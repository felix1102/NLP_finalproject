2019,When Real-Life Murder Plays Out in Fiction,"Inside the List “I suspect I was dropped on my head a lot as a child. I’m honestly not sure where the ideas come from,” Lisa Gardner writes on her website. “They simply come to me, particularly creepy, scary ones. I guess it’s a good thing I can turn ideas into novels, because being an ax murderer doesn’t pay nearly as well.” But Gardner is also inspired by true-crime cases, and the kernel for “Never Tell” — which enters the list this week at No. 3 — was the story of Amy Bishop, a University of Alabama biology professor who shot six colleagues, killing three, after she was denied tenure. “To make things even more curious, when she was a teenager, she ‘accidentally’ shot and killed her own brother,” Gardner says. “Of course, in the wake of the second shooting, people immediately questioned the childhood tragedy. Was her brother’s death an accident, or did she get away with murder? It got me thinking, could an accidental death as a child lead to an intentional murder as an adult?” Gardner calls herself a “research junkie.” Over the years, she’s interviewed county sheriffs, F.B.I. agents and police detectives about how they solve cases; she’s spent time at the University of Tennessee’s famed Forensic Anthropology Center, known as “the Body Farm,” to study how corpses decay; she’s talked to fugitive trackers about how they find people in the wilderness. For “Never Tell,” she studied female mass murderers (“they’re incredibly rare!”) and worked with a computer forensic technician to understand the dark web: “According to her, dark web users are 50 percent predators and 50 percent undercover investigators trying to catch the predators,” Gardner says. “The challenge for both sides is knowing which is which.” [ Listen to Lisa Gardner, Lee Child, Megan Abbott, Meg Gardiner and Lisa Scottoline discuss the art of thriller writing in this bonus edition of the Book Review’s podcast. ] Gardner writes both series and stand-alone novels; “Never Tell” is the 10th to star Detective D.D. Warren. “I consider myself to be a non-series series writer,” she says. “Basically, I never planned to write a series, and yet I can’t seem to let my characters go.” Though the nonfiction list is still packed with familiar titles — like “Educated” and “Bad Blood” — there’s quite a bit of movement on it, with four new titles this week. Most notably, Andrew McCabe’s “The Threat” vaulted past Michelle Obama’s “Becoming” in its first week out to take the No. 1 spot, which had been held by the former first lady’s memoir since its November publication.",The New York Times
2019,When Science Fiction Comes True,"Essay Maybe because we’re living in a dystopia, it feels as if we’ve become obsessed with prophecy of late. Protest signs at the 2017 Women’s March read “Make Margaret Atwood Fiction Again!” and “Octavia Warned Us.” News headlines about abortion bans and the defunding of Planned Parenthood do seem ripped from the pages of Atwood’s novel “The Handmaid’s Tale” (1985). And Octavia Butler’s “Parable” series, published in the 1990s, did eerily feature a presidential candidate who vows to “make America great again.” In “The Dreams Our Stuff Is Made Of: How Science Fiction Conquered the World,” Thomas Disch calls this relay between fiction and reality “creative visualization.” Businesses have started to co-opt it. The designers of the iPhone and the Kindle cite works of science fiction as inspiration. Boeing, Nike, Ford and Intel have hired prototyping, future-casting or world-building ventures for product development. As the author Brian Merchant put it on Medium recently, these companies “do what science fiction has always done — build rich speculative worlds, describe that world’s bounty and perils, and, finally, envision how that future might fall to pieces.” This is “speculative” fiction in the financial sense, too, a new way to gamble on futures. The irony — or the proof — of this brave new business model is that sci-fi saw it coming. Dystopias have long portrayed artists being drafted into nefarious corporate labor. In “Blade Runner 2049,” for instance, the Wallace Corporation sets a woman the task of crafting memories — not for characters in a novel, but for androids. It’s a touch self-congratulatory for sci-fi creators to imply that they’re the unacknowledged designers of the world. But they do seem to have a knack for innovation. The genre has predicted satellite communication, army tanks, tablets, submarines, psychotropic pills, bionic limbs, CCTV, electric cars and video calling. You can find dozens more examples of sci-fi-minted gadgetry on the internet, which is itself a prime example of the phenomenon. The word “cyberspace” first appeared in the cyberpunk novel “Neuromancer” (1984), to describe “a consensual hallucination …. A graphic representation of data abstracted from the banks of every computer in the human system.” Its author, William Gibson, is our Nostradamus: His novels have prophesied reality television, viral marketing and nanotechnology. I write science fiction set in the near future, so I’m constantly testing my own powers of prophecy. I once wrote a story about a germaphobic couple who want to have sex without touching. They purchase the “TouchFeely” — my nod to the “Feelies” in Aldous Huxley’s “Brave New World” (1932) — an apparatus that includes an electrified dildo and a sheath that respond remotely to each other. The year after the story came out, I learned about Hera and Zeus, “the world’s first internet-enabled” sex toys. These “teledildonic” devices uncannily resemble my fictional invention. I was a little disconcerted. My story is a satire about bourgeois disconnection. My characters each start affairs with the bot. One ends up choking on the dildo. But I’ll confess: I felt a perverse pleasure, too. It was as if I had conjured something into existence — the dream of every artist. More recently, I did some research on H.I.V. vaccines for my novel, “The Old Drift.” With some help from a biologist at New York University, I came up with one that uses a particular technique to target a specific gene sequence. I felt a strange, and, again, perverse, mix of horror and wonder when I read a couple months ago that Chinese scientists had used the exact same mechanism for their “AIDS vaccine development project,” also known as the CRISPR babies, the first genetically modified humans. I’ve started to worry that, before long, the Moskeetoze(TM) microdrones that I designed for the novel will buzz to life too. Raymond Z. Gallun’s 1936 short story “The Scarab” got there first, but the TV series “Black Mirror” introduced robo-bees into the popular imagination just in advance of their emergence in the real world: Last March, Walmart filed a patent for a fleet of pollination drones. This is the dark side of science fiction prophecy. “Wow, I was right!” can turn quickly into “Yikes, I was right!” You almost envy Cassandra, the Trojan princess who was doomed by the gods to be always correct yet disbelieved. “I was never able to predict,” William Gibson demurred in an interview with GQ. “But I could sort of curate what had already happened.” When it was brought to his attention that the global disasters he had envisioned in his 2014 novel, “The Peripheral,” seemed to be happening even before it was published, Gibson admitted: “That makes me very uncomfortable.” What if you don’t just predict a bad idea but inspire it? Mary Shelley’s “Frankenstein” (1818), widely considered the first science fiction novel, tried to forestall this: “Learn from me, if not by my precepts, at least by my example, how dangerous is the acquirement of knowledge.” But while science fiction aims to warn, humans are teenagers at heart: We love doing what we’re told not to. Our modern-day “Frankenstein,” Michael Crichton’s “Jurassic Park” (1990), may even have spurred researchers to try to recover dinosaur DNA. Should the makers of sci-fi quit indulging this desire to peer into the future? Well, no. First of all, our predictions are off a lot of the time. No one’s floating around in jet packs and hovercrafts just yet. Huxley presaged genetic engineering — his test tube babies are the true precursors of CRISPR babies — but so far we’ve passed on his multisensory “Feelies” and stuck with the good old-fashioned movies. For some reason, there’s a slew of older sci-fi films that happen to be set in 2019 — “Blade Runner,” “The Running Man,” “The Island” — so we have new proof of our flubs. The IGN piece detailing these failures of prophecy is titled “The Sci-Fi Movies That Predicted 2019 … and Got It Wrong.” The writer Harry Turtledove tweeted a link to that article with an exclamatory comment: “Science fiction does not predict the future. Not. Not! [expletive] NOT! It uses the imagined future to comment on the real present.” Margaret Atwood often claims something similar, echoing Gibson’s protestations. Despite manifest evidence of her acute forecasts — the rise of the Christian right, in vitro meat, sexbots modeled on real people, apocalyptic climate change, live aquatic jewelry — she says: “I’m not a prophet. Honest, I’m not a prophet. If I were a prophet I would have cleaned up on the stock market years ago. … They’re saying things about ‘Oryx and Crake’ and ‘MaddAddam’ are all coming true. But that’s based on things people were already working on when I was writing the books. It’s just that I was looking for those things and other people weren’t.” Maybe science fiction’s future is actually just a lens on the present. Some writers do like to don the mantle of prophet. In 1983, Isaac Asimov published a set of 2019 forecasts. He was right about some things: “The mobile computerized object, or robot, is already flooding into industry and will, in the course of the next generation, penetrate the home.” But it’s embarrassing to see how hopeful he was about us: Asimov thought computers would have freed us from the most tedious forms of labor by now. He imagined we’d have fixed pollution, developed technology “based on the special properties of space” and even settled on the moon. This rosy picture might seem surprising, given science fiction’s proclivity for doom and gloom. Yet given our headlong plummet toward the death of this planet, to picture any future at all feels optimistic these days. It assumes that, when the apocalypse comes, we will still be here to witness it. Stories are one of our oldest technologies. They let us have vivid experiences — beautiful, moving ones, but also horrifying, dark ones — and then close the book, or the laptop, unscathed. They give us a kind of perverse pleasure in reverse: not of seeing the worst come true, but of seeing the worst without it coming true. And this is the other reason I don’t think writers should give up on the art of prediction. Writers don’t just see into the future or possess special insight into the present; we also construct a kind of machine for virtual hindsight. We create an immersive simulation of the future that we can all experience and look back on, so that we might decide together whether we want these dreams to come true after all.",The New York Times
2019,When Sheriffs Say No: Disputes Erupt Over Enforcing New Gun Laws,"ALBUQUERQUE — New Mexico’s governor is feuding with county sheriffs, accusing them of going “rogue” by refusing to enforce new gun control legislation. Counties in Oregon are passing militia-backed measures against stricter gun laws. Washington State is warning sheriffs they could face legal action if they don’t run enhanced background checks approved by voters. As states have approved dozens of restrictive gun control measures since the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., last year, efforts to resist such laws have gathered strength around the nation as rural gun owners say their rights are being violated. “This is just a gun-grab measure,” Shane Ferrari, the sheriff of San Juan County, said of a provision that requires background checks on most gun sales in New Mexico, signed into law this month by Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, a Democrat. Sheriff Ferrari, a Republican, said he believed that the new law was a violation of the Second Amendment and the state’s existing gun laws, and that he would not enforce it unless a court ruling told him to do so. And all but a handful of counties in New Mexico have expressed similar opposition. The impasses — between local sheriffs and elected officials in states now controlled by Democrats — are raising the specter of a constitutional showdown over enforcement of the new gun laws. Some of the gun rights advocates say they are simply drawing inspiration from strategies employed by liberal critics of the Trump administration: They compare their efforts to declare “Second Amendment sanctuary” counties to so-called sanctuary cities opposing the federal government’s immigration crackdown. “Critics are calling these new laws Gestapo-style tactics when that’s the furthest thing from the truth,” said Victor Snover, the mayor of Aztec, a town in San Juan County that was shaken by a school shooting in 2017 in which a former student killed two students and himself. Mr. Snover, a Democrat who is also a teacher at Aztec High School, called the measure “common sense and reasonable.” He added, “But unfortunately we live in a hyperpartisan time when avoiding tragedies isn’t viewed as reasonable.” In New Mexico and elsewhere, the disputes generally reflect tension between cities that support stricter gun laws and rural areas that want to bolster protections for gun owners. The pushback against new laws generally seeks to maintain existing gun ownership rights; most have not yet been challenged in court. The disputes around the country over the gun control measures raise vexing questions about the rule of law. Governors claim that local sheriffs cannot pick which laws to enforce, but some states have already grappled with low compliance with other gun laws. “There’s a real tension on this issue between urban and rural identities that doesn’t necessarily fit nicely into party loyalties,” said Lonna Atkeson, a political-science professor at the University of New Mexico. She noted that some of the counties vehemently opposing the state’s new gun control legislation are solidly Democratic. Elsewhere, dozens of counties in Illinois have approved “gun sanctuary” resolutions meant to signal local discontent with gun control measures approved by the State Legislature, which is dominated by Democrats. Among the measures approved by Illinois last year was one requiring a 72-hour waiting period for all gun purchases and a so-called red flag bill, which allows relatives and law enforcement officials to ask courts to confiscate firearms from people deemed a threat to themselves or others. In Oregon, where the State Legislature is currently debating several gun control measures — including a bill that would forbid the sale of assault rifles to people under 21 — voters in eight counties have approved ordinances stating that residents have the right to own semiautomatic weapons and high-capacity magazines, even if federal and state law bans them. Some of the most public discontent, however, has come in Washington, where a divide between rural and urban areas has become a recurring political split. In November, nearly 60 percent of Washington State voters approved an initiative prohibiting anyone under 21 from purchasing a semiautomatic rifle and requiring buyers to undergo enhanced background checks. (State law already barred those under 21 from buying a handgun.) Long guns that employ manual operations, including pumps and bolts, could still be purchased at age 18. The law also mandated a 10-day waiting period and completion of a firearms training course. The initiative also allowed prosecutors to charge gun owners with crimes if the gun was stored improperly and someone unable to legally own a gun used it to commit a crime. Most of the law is scheduled to take effect July 1, though the Second Amendment Foundation, a nonprofit group based in Washington State that supports gun rights, has filed a lawsuit seeking to block it. Already, though, more than a dozen sheriffs in Washington have said they will refuse to enforce the law. That has set up a showdown between them and Bob Ferguson, the attorney general. Mr. Ferguson has warned the sheriffs that they have a legal responsibility to enforce the new law in the same manner they are sworn to uphold other laws prohibiting criminal activity. “Local law enforcement officials are entitled to their opinions about the constitutionality of any law, but those personal views do not absolve us of our duty to enforce Washington laws and protect the public,” Mr. Ferguson wrote in a letter last month. But Bob Songer, the sheriff of Klickitat County, a rural county in southern Washington, said that the law violated gun owners’ rights. “There is no way in hell I’m going to be going after their guns if they are honest citizens,” he said. “What I’ve told people is: I’m not giving up my guns, and I don’t expect them to give up theirs.” The sheriff dismissed the pressure from the state’s attorney general to abide by the law. “They are not the boss of the sheriff,” he said. “The only bosses I have are the voters of Klickitat County.”",The New York Times
2019,When Simplicity Can Be a Winemaking Virtue,"Wine School Sweetness in wine can make people seem crazy. Some of the most popular wines ever sold in the United States have had at least a few degrees of sweetness to them. Do you remember Blue Nun in the 1970s, Riunite Lambrusco in the 1980s and Kendall-Jackson Vintner’s Reserve Chardonnay in the 1990s (still going strong)? All had discernible sweetness. So do more recent best-sellers, like Apothic Red and The Prisoner, which we tasted in January in our first foray into crowd-pleasing American wines. Yet many American consumers swear they want only dry wines. They detest riesling, they say, because they think the wines are all sweet. Wine trade observers for years have remarked on this chasm between what American consumers say they want in a wine and what they actually choose to drink. It’s worth asking what on earth is going on. Why do consumers seem to have such an aversion to saying they like sweet wines? That’s a natural inquiry here at Wine School, where we try to question almost everything and assume almost nothing. Not that we expect to crack the code of American tastes in wine. But we can at least make an effort to understand the disparity between what people say they want and what they do. The question came up in the context of our exploration of the sort of popular American wines one might find in supermarkets and other places that sell big-production wines. After looking at highly processed examples of these wines in January, we returned to the supermarket in March to look at popular wines that were made with simpler production techniques. As I do each month, I recommended three wines to be consumed over the course of several weeks. The wines were: Marietta Cellars California Old Vine Red Lot Number 67, Montinore Estate Willamette Valley Pinot Noir 2016 and Ridge Sonoma County Three Valleys 2016. Drinking these wines made me think about the sweetness issue. Why? Because in comparison to the more processed wines, these wines were dry. That is, they had little detectable sweetness remaining in the wine after fermentation converted the sugar in the grape juice into alcohol. Theoretically, at least, the process continues until all the sugar is gone. But that’s not always desirable for winemakers. So they may choose to stop the fermentation by adding sulfur dioxide, a preservative that kills yeast, and by chilling the wine when it reaches their preferred level of sweetness. That may yield something very sweet, like an auslese riesling, in which the luscious sweetness is balanced by high acidity to create a thrilling, refreshing wine. Or it may result in a low level of sweetness to soften an otherwise sharp acidity. Wines can also be made sweet by raising and concentrating the level of sugar in the grapes before fermentation. This can be done by delaying harvest, the proverbial “long hang-time” — popular in California for the last 20 years — in which grapes desiccate on the vine, increasing the ratio of sugar to liquid. Fermenting these wines until dry can result in ultrahigh levels of alcohol. When you see a bottle of pinot noir or cabernet sauvignon that is 16 percent alcohol, that’s where it came from. Sometimes winemakers want it both ways. They crave the jammy flavors that come from late harvesting, but don’t want high alcohol. They may employ technology like reverse osmosis to lower the alcohol level. Or they can go low-tech and just add water. Other ways of making sweet wine include air-drying grapes, as in Amarone; harvesting grapes shriveled by botrytis cinerea, the noble rot, as in Sauternes; or fortifying, adding neutral spirits to stop fermentation, as in port. One more method may be used. It’s primarily for cheap wines, and that is simply to add sugar to an already fermented wine. That could mean actual sugar or concentrated grape juice. This way, winemakers need not trouble themselves with more labor-intensive techniques and can simply sweeten to taste. One notable exception to the cheap wines: Champagne is often made this way, with a last-minute addition of sweetness, or dosage, to balance things out. The perception of sweetness, by the way, may not depend on the actual level of sugar in the wine, but by how well it is balanced by acidity. That may be the difference between a wine that is cloying and one that is refreshing. You may wonder why I went off on this tangent. Because sometimes it’s as important to understand what winemakers did not do as it is to know what they did. Let’s look at these three wines. The Montinore pinot noir is bright, with flavors of red fruits and an underlying earthy, forest-brush quality. It’s taut and pure, and it tastes like Willamette Valley pinot noir. An entry-level wine that reflects both the grapes from which it is made and the place from which it comes is what I would call an awfully good value. The Marietta Old Vine Red, a wine blended with a number of different grapes from multiple appellations, is quite different. It tastes a little of red fruits, a little of licorice and a little of root beer. Yet it’s not sweet. It’s medium-bodied, not too big or alcoholic, just a decent drink of wine, with character and personality. And finally the Ridge Three Valleys, which is a little riper, with a little more alcohol at 14.3 percent than the others, which are around 13.5 percent. It is also a blended wine, with flavors of spicy red fruit, a touch of licorice and maybe a little oak, which I don’t get from the other wines. Compared with the sugary confections from the January tasting, these wines are in a different universe, one that is far closer to the world of traditional craftsmanship, which I believe is the source of the best, most compelling wines. I know I said these wines were dry — I meant blessedly dry, as I am not a fan of sweet red still wines — but that does not necessarily mean they cannot offer the impression of sweetness. That’s different from actual sugar in the wine. It might come from the brightness of ripe fruit, or from glycerol, a harmless byproduct of fermentation that is more apparent in higher-alcohol wine. It also might come from the flavors of oak. This impression of sweetness can be amplified if a wine has insufficient acidity to counter its effects. I particularly found this slight impression of sweetness in the Marietta and the Ridge. It’s perhaps a characteristic of zinfandel, which was the dominant grape in both of these blended wines. I’ve had plenty of wines from California that have crossed the line, wines that are ostensibly dry, but where the impression of sweetness becomes the dominant flavor. These wines maintained their balance, even if, in the opinion of one reader, Martin Schappeit of Forest, Va., the Marietta was too sweet to pair with simple broiled lamb chops. No matter. He said the wine was great with steak. These wines demonstrate that pretty good wines can be made on a large scale. They are not mass-produced in the millions like those in our January exploration, but by the hundreds of thousands, which is still quite a lot. Good wine is out there, if you want it. Not everybody embraced these wines. Peter of Philadelphia called the Ridge “pleasant and unlikely to offend anyone,” while Ferguson of Princeton, N.J., referred to them as “comfortable, familiar, utility wines.” Dan Barron of New York felt that the Ridge and the Montinore were “more comfortable than they are exciting.” While inoffensive may be a whole lot better than repugnant, it offers a lot of room for bottles that may be more distinctive and striking. Fortunately, a whole world of exciting wines is out there, though sometimes they are produced in disappointingly small quantities. Meanwhile, the mystery remains: Why do people who say they want dry wines actually prefer sweet? The usual explanation is that Americans are reared on sugary soft drinks, so it’s a natural progression to sweet wines. This does not account for why Americans also embrace the bitterness of beer. Nor does it explain why people deny that they like sweet wines, which by the way are not simply the realm of the supermarket. Some of the most highly sought-after Napa Valley cabernet sauvignons in the last 20 years have had discernible levels of residual sugar in them. The answer more likely comes from an association of “dry” with the perceived sophistication of drinking wine, while “sweet” on some level seems childish. It’s another example of fears and connotations — what wine signifies — triumphing over honest expressions of tastes. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook and Pinterest.

2019,When Sky & Telescope Had No Limit,"Out There In the spring of 1976, nearly broke, struggling with a novel and having exhausted the patience of everyone around me, I wrote a letter begging for some kind of job to every publisher listed in the Boston Yellow Pages. I had a physics degree from M.I.T., but I didn’t want to be a physicist anymore; I had decided I was a writer. I wound up landing a part-time job at a small monthly magazine called Sky & Telescope, a venerable bible of astronomers and amateur telescope makers, as an assistant typesetter, for $6 an hour. On my first day, as I was entering, the magazine’s founder, Charles Federer, Jr., met me on the sidewalk and warned me not to tell my new colleagues how much I was making. The company would never give me such an exorbitant salary on a full-time basis, he said. This was true; when I was hired full-time six months later, I had to take a cut in hourly pay. I learned that my co-workers had been calling me the six-dollar-an-hour man behind my back. That was my first job in journalism. Four years later I left for a job in New York, with tears in my eyes. [Sign up to get reminders for space and astronomy events on your calendar.] The small Sky & Telescope staff was like a family, with all the good and bad that implies — a handful of backyard stargazers and space fans who care enough about the sky to work for, well, see above. We all did it all: wrote and edited stories, took pictures, drew artwork and laid out the pages. It was at Sky & Telescope that I met Stephen Hawking and commenced a lifetime of writing about black holes, but one of my other jobs was typing up the advertising bills and sending them out each month. My years there were the journalistic equivalent of growing up on the family farm, where you learned to do everything. So I was crestfallen to hear recently that the family farm was up for sale. The news broke on Hastro-L, a mailing list devoted to the history of astronomy. Forbes had reported that the corporate behemoth F+W Media had filed for bankruptcy and would have to sell off its properties, including Sky & Telescope. Word reverberated through the astronomical community, amid rumors that the magazine might close or become an online-only publication. Peter Tyson, the editor in chief, confirmed in an interview that Sky & Telescope was indeed for sale, but he was not worried. The magazine was financially strong, he said, but had been dragged down by the financial misadventures of its parent company. “I have every confidence that it will survive this rough patch,” he said. I have to believe he is right, and not just out of shameless sentiment or because I have relied on S&T, as it is familiarly known, over the years for straight-talk about the heavens and the gritty details about how telescopes and other gadgets by which astronomers observe the sky are made. In its singular way, S&T is treading the same dark path that many publications, including The Times, have been traveling lately. In 1980 I left Sky & Telescope to join Discover, Time Inc.’s entry in a wave of popular-science magazines that arose in the late 1970s and early ’80s. Those were heady times for me, my colleagues and our competitors, but that wave soon crashed for lack of advertising. By the ’90s most of Discover’s competitors were gone, and many newspapers had discontinued their stand-alone science sections. The carnage continues as the internet erodes the classic business model in which advertising pays the freight for publishers. So far this year some 2,300 media jobs have been lost, including at BuzzFeed, once a darling of digital-media mavens. Sky & Telescope, aimed at an audience of hobbyists and armchair astronauts, was founded by Mr. Federer and his wife, Helen Spence Federer, in 1941, by combining a pair of existing publications: The Sky, published by the American Museum of Natural History, and The Telescope, out of Harvard College Observatory. “We’ve never missed an issue, and don’t intend to,” Mr. Tyson, who has edited the magazine since 2014, told me. Many of the articles in Sky & Telescope are written by professional astronomers and so bear a stamp of authority. My editor, Joseph Ashbrook, who had a Ph.D. from Harvard, treated each word in every issue as a reflection of his own professional probity. A mistake, real or perceived, in my copy could transform him into a sputtering tower of frustration, after which he would retreat to his office and run my story through his typewriter, while I sat outside at my own desk listening for the clatter of his keys. Later in my career, the fact that I had worked at Sky & Telescope often gave me credibility with older astronomers still uneasy about the mainstream media. It is the kind of magazine that readers hoard for eternity in giant stacks in the attic, selling and trading back issues. Except for a couple of years in the early 2000s, Sky & Telescope has always been profitable, and it remains so, Mr. Tyson said. The company has expanded to publish Night Sky magazine for beginners, books, star atlases and other products, and to run eclipse and other adventure tours. In December 2020, the magazine is offering a 23-day eclipse cruise around South America and Antarctica with the astronaut John Grunsfeld, who helped repair the Hubble Telescope in 2009. In 1993 the magazine announced a contest to come up with another name for the beginning of the universe: The phrase “Big Bang” was “misleading, trivializing and inappropriately bellicose,” wrote Timothy Ferris, who proposed the contest and served as one of its judges. After perusing the entries — 13,099 of them, from people ranging in age from 4 to 92 — the judges concluded essentially that “Big Bang” was the worst name for the origin of everything, except for every other name. Never miss an eclipse, a meteor shower, a rocket launch or any other astronomical and space event that's out of this world. But Sky & Telescope has dwindled, from a circulation of 132,000 and a typical size of 168 pages in 2000, to about 55,000 and 86 pages recently, according to Rick Fienberg, who edited the magazine for 22 years and is now the spokesman for the American Astronomical Society. “There’s simply not enough pages to do everything that S&T used to do, such as publish book reviews every month,” he said in an email. For all that, there is little evidence that interest in cosmic affairs has lessened. Mr. Tyson said that traffic to Sky & Telescope’s website had doubled over the last decade and now stands at about 500,000 page views a month. Sky Publishing was owned by its staff until 2006, when it sold itself to New Track Media LLC, which in turn was taken over in 2014 by F+W Media, one of the nation’s largest publishers of hobbyist media. In early March, however, F+W filed for bankruptcy as a result of what Forbes called “a perfect storm of secular industry decline, poor investments, and even mismanagement.” What, and who, happens next to Sky & Telescope depends on F+W, and likely will be decided this summer. Greg Osberg, the company’s C.E.O., called S&T “a well performing account” that already had attracted interest. There will be an auction in late May or early June for the magazine and its various streams of revenue. “It’s worth a lot,” Mr. Osberg said. That sentiment was shared by Mr. Tyson: “I think we’re a bargain.” He added, “We are entirely confident that Sky & Telescope will survive — maybe not unscathed, but for another 75 years.” Which would be good news for the starhuggers among us.

2019,"When Uber and Airbnb Go Public, San Francisco Will Drown in Millionaires","Uber, Lyft, Airbnb and Pinterest plan to go public. California’s newly minted rich will be hungry for parties, houses, boats, bikes — and ice sculptures. Here comes the big one! SAN FRANCISCO — Big wealth doesn’t come in monthly paychecks. It comes when a start-up goes public, transforming hypothetical money into extremely real money. This year — with Uber, Lyft, Slack, Postmates, Pinterest and Airbnb all hoping to enter the public markets — there’s going to be a lot of it in the Bay Area. Estimates of Uber’s value on the market have been as high as $120 billion. Airbnb was most recently valued at $31 billion, with Lyft and Pinterest around $15 billion and $12 billion. It’s anyone’s guess what prices these companies actually will command once they go public, but even conservative estimates predict hundreds of billions of dollars will flood into town in the next year, creating thousands of new millionaires. It’s hard to imagine more money in San Francisco, but the city’s residents now need to start trying. Welcomed finally into the elite caste who can afford to live comfortably in the Bay Area, the fleet of new millionaires are already itching to claim what has been promised all these years. They want cars. They want to open new restaurants. They want to throw bigger parties. And they want houses. One recent night, in a packed room with a view of the Bay Bridge and an open bar, real estate investors gathered. Standing at the front presenting was Deniz Kahramaner, a real estate agent specializing in data analytics at Compass. “Are we going to see a one-bedroom condo that’s worth less than $1 million in five years?” he asked the crowd. “Are we going to see single family homes selling for one to three million?” No, he said, not anymore. The energy rose as he revealed more data about new millionaires and about just how few new units have been built for them. San Francisco single-family home sale prices could climb to an average of $5 million, he said, to gasps. [Sign up for California Today, our newsletter for Californians and people who care about California.] “All cash. These are all cash buyers,” he said. “It’s just going to be astounding.” Now, seemingly the whole city — and not just the financial planners and the real estate agents and the protesters who block tech buses — is scrambling to prepare. As the idea of the coming I.P.O.-palooza took on currency, sellers started pulling their houses off the market. The broader California housing market has softened, and home sales are down, but here’s one fix for that. “Even if just half the I.P.O.s happen, there’s going to be ten thousand millionaires overnight,” said Herman Chan, a real estate agent with Sotheby’s. “People are like, ‘I’m not going to sell till next year, because there are going to be bajillionaires everywhere left and right.’” One of those is his client Rick Rider, a 61-year-old C.E.O. who decided not to publicly list his Bay Area house until some of the I.P.O.s have happened. “Our particular house is not a family home. It’s a Double Income No Kids sort of home,” Mr. Rider said. “So it would potentially play well for a lot of the people that would be benefiting from the I.P.O.s.” The spending wars will likely stay close to work. “The millennial tech workers are really looking for convenience,” said Christine Kim, the president of Climb Real Estate. “They seem to not want to own cars, and food deliveries are really easy now, and they want to be close to entertainment, so they’ll stay in the city.” When Google in Mountain View and Facebook in Menlo Park went public, their workers were spread across the Bay Area, and so the impact on housing was diffuse. Now, many of the biggest start-ups are based in San Francisco, in part thanks to the city’s tax breaks. Brokers say San Francisco is where the workers want to stay. In 2018 there were 5,644 properties sold in San Francisco and only 2,208 of those were single family homes. Software employees represent more than 50 percent of those buying, according to Compass. One real estate firm estimates an average one-bedroom in the city now rents for $3,690 per month. (Another firm puts that average at $3,551.) “Now you’ve got all these I.P.O.s at the same time, and we’ll potentially have thousands of young people, all now with money, looking to buy homes,” said Shane Ray, a real estate agent. “You’ll be able to feel it.” Those in the market for a house are trying to buy them fast while the inventory shrinks but before the wave hits. “I had this sense of existential dread that if we didn’t buy before all the I.P.O.s, we would forever be priced out,” said Tom McLeod, the founder of storage start-up Omni, who has been renting for nearly a decade. “We ended up pulling the trigger.” Companies instill in their employees a belief that stock only goes up. At this point, a decade since their founding, start-ups like Uber and Airbnb have been asking their employees to hold that faith for a long time. Now, wealth managers are hoping to rattle the religious. Ryan S. Cole, a private wealth adviser at Citrine Capital, said he has started getting an influx of new clients who are preparing for wealth. He is worried. This generation of the start-up wealthy seem especially bullish on their company’s success. “We’ve been trying to get them to exercise a little more caution, just because they’re so excited,” Mr. Cole said. “I don’t think a lot of them think there ever could be a downturn.” He cautions that no one can be sure how well a stock will do. A company like Uber is still dramatically unprofitable, he tries to remind his clients. So many I.P.O.s turn out to be busts. Groupon opened around $26 a share and now trades around $3; Snap opened around $27 and now trades at $9. “A lot of them are young — they’ve just seen their valuations going up forever and they don’t really understand that tech stocks are volatile,” Mr. Cole said. “And they have their managers painting especially rosy pictures of where the company is headed to get them to work harder.” Mostly, he just urges his clients not to spend too much yet. “They shouldn’t be buying boats,” Mr. Cole said. “We see a little bit of that.” Electric bikes, on the other hand, are a favorite mode of transportation for the San Francisco tech worker. Owners of the electric bike shop New Wheel say they are preparing for the I.P.O.s by ordering 30 percent more of the Stromer ST3 — the most popular configuration retails for around $7,500 — and 200 percent more of the Riese & Muller front-loader bikes, which sell for around $9,500. Michael Biggica, the founder of Pixel Financial Planning, said 2019 is the year of “pent-up demand” and that the excitement of a windfall can be intoxicating. “My role is eliminating that emotion,” Mr. Biggica said. Jonathan K. DeYoe, another private wealth adviser in the region, started working with tech clients in 1997 during the first dot-com boom. He said it was pretty exciting back then. Now, as he thinks about thousands of new millionaires coming onto the scene, he is worried about the region’s inequality. “There’s some who’ve talked about pitchforks,” Mr. DeYoe said. “And I don’t think we’ll go there, but there’s a point when that makes sense.” “It’s very visible,” Mr. DeYoe said. “This kind of wealth is very visible.” In cities like Oakland and Berkeley and San Francisco, millennials obsess over Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s Twitter and attend Democratic Socialists of America meetings. But the socialist passion doesn’t seem to have impacted the city’s zeal for I.P.O. parties, which the party planning community says are going to surpass past booms. Jay Siegan, a former live music club owner who now curates private entertainment and music, is gearing up. He has worked on events for many of the I.P.O. hopefuls, including Uber, Airbnb, Slack, Postmates and Lyft. “We see multiple parties per I.P.O. for the company that is I.P.O.ing, as well as firms that are associated to them,” Mr. Siegan said. Budgets for start-up parties, he said, can easily go above $10 million. “They’re wanting to bring in A-list celebrities to perform at the dinner tables for the executives. They want ballet performers.” A popular new feature he’s noticing is clients hoping to curate their own theme concerts featuring fleets of bands. Mr. Siegan says he put on one for a 1980s loving tech executive, featuring the B-52s, Devo, The Bangles, Tears for Fears and Flock of Seagulls. In a warehouse in Concord, Calif., the I.P.O. ice sculptor is getting ready to staff up for what he says will be a long year. “It’s going to be a lot of 14-hour days,” said Robert Chislett, founder of Chisel-it, who has around 15 ice sculptors currently employed. Together, they have chiseled a full-size ice car for a tech executive’s party in Atherton and a 10-foot ice Taj Mahal for another’s swimming pool in San Jose. But, he says, I.P.O.ing executives usually want predictable things. An ice chair with the logo on the back, for photos. A lot of logos carved into ice rockets, to indicate that the company’s stock will be like a rocket. And ice cubes, for drinks, with the company logo on each one. And of course, the tech backlash, mostly quiet as stocks have vested, is preparing for its own revival. At Radio Habana Social Club in the Mission district, housing rights activists gathered one recent evening for a drink. By now, there is a well-known choreography: the cash comes flooding in to a few and the stock-less masses begin to gather. They will protest evictions, fight developers, organize against tax breaks and unfurl banners in front of tech buses. “It’s going to mean mass displacement,” said Sarah “Fred” Sherburn-Zimmer, the executive director of the Housing Rights Committee of San Francisco, of the coming wealth influx. She paused for a moment. “It feels like the same game,” she said. Activists stood elbow-to-elbow around a table of hummus and pepper jack cheese. “We’ve lived through boom times before,” said Maria Zamudio, the group’s associate director. “We’ve learned our lessons. We know what a massive influx of money looks like. Concessions we made in the past, we will not make this year.”",The New York Times
2019,"When Women Control the Money, Female Founders Get Funded","Female entrepreneurs have long known how hard it is to raise money from a roomful of men. “I would walk into these rooms of late-40s, early-50s dudes — potential investors — and they would just look at me blankly, like, ‘I do not get it,’” said Rachel Drori, the founder of Daily Harvest, a delivery service for produce-centric meals. “Sometimes, they’d say, ‘Can you send samples to my wife?’” What if Ms. Drori, and others like her, could pitch to a roomful of women? On a frigid evening in January, some 275 entrepreneurs filed into the SoHo outpost of The Wing, the women-only co-working club, for a women-only pitch night. They grabbed seats (pink folding chairs, mint settees, maroon couches) as well as sustenance (crudités, cheese, wine) ahead of the main event: Ten start-ups would present their business propositions to potential investors as well as those interested in learning from or working with them. The gathering was called Wingable, named for the club and Able Partners, a New York venture capital firm that had already put money into each of the 10 companies. The fund, which was started three years ago by Lisa Blau and Amanda Eilian, has been an early-stage investor in a number of female-founded companies, including The Wing and Goop. Prior to the event, the start-ups spent six weeks in an Able incubator program, honing their business models and pitch decks. “We’re calling it the anti-‘Shark Tank’ because everyone is already a winner,” Ms. Blau said. “They’re getting funding from Able, and we’re just trying to bring more female investors to their cap table.” Among the attendees was Alexandra Wilkis Wilson, co-founder of Gilt Groupe and more recently Glamsquad, who said she was discussing an investment with two of the Wingable start-ups. “I know a lot of women are coming with their checkbooks open,” she said, surveying the crowd. According to the venture-tracking site Crunchbase, as of October 2017, women made up just 8 percent of investing partners at the top 100 VC firms. And last year, female founders received only 2.2 percent of the $130 billion in venture money invested in the United States, according to the analytics firm PitchBook and the advocacy organization All Raise. That works out to a combined $2.9 billion; for a sense of the scale of money going to other start-ups, a single one, Juul — which makes fruit-flavored e-cigarette cartridges — recently drew an investment of $12.8 billion from Altria. Wingable presented a microcosm of an alternative view: What would VC-funded industries look like if more women controlled the money? “We need the old girl’s network,” said Linnea Conrad Roberts, the chief executive of Gingerbread Capital and a former partner at Goldman Sachs, as she waved to Ms. Blau. “If you think about the ecosystem that guys have, a Silicon Valley founder will make hundreds of millions of dollars and he doesn’t go home and retire; he starts putting it toward funding other companies.” “The problem, quite honestly, was people like me, sitting on the sidelines, doing philanthropy, retired from my Wall Street career and not thinking about it,” Ms. Roberts added. “I spend a good chunk of time just trying to get more women focused. All they need is a bit of a lesson, contacts and then they need to come to amazing things like this. This is a free look at companies.” Liz Lange, the maternity fashion pioneer, tapped Ms. Roberts’s shoulder to say hi; Jennifer Fleiss, the co-founder of Rent the Runway, slid into a seat in front of them. “Guys would never do an event like this,” Ms. Roberts said. “And the food would suck and it would not be this well organized, and the egos: You might have to leave, you’d have to go outside and get a breath of fresh air. We don’t have to play golf or poker in order to get together and get business done.” Ms. Blau, 43, and Ms. Eilian, 41, met in 2004, when the former was about to graduate from Harvard Business School and the latter was preparing to begin her first year there. In 2007, Ms. Blau started VitalJuice, a newsletter about healthy living, and Ms. Eilian started Videolicious, a platform for making high-end video. She went through five rounds of fund-raising, some while pregnant. “There’s nothing like being a pregnant woman in the tech world to make you feel like an alien,” Ms. Eilian said. She and Ms. Blau wondered about the struggles of female founders who didn’t graduate from an elite business school or have a well-pedigreed social network. (Ms. Blau’s husband is the chief executive of Related Companies, the mega-developer, and Ms. Eilian’s husband was an early employee at the private equity firm Starwood Capital Group.) They formed Able in 2016 to invest their own money — they have no outside capital — in early-stage companies led by women. Ms. Blau and Ms. Eilian declined to identify the size of their fund, but said their portfolio has 38 companies, with investments starting at $50,000. Twenty percent of the start-ups have men on their executive teams. Able is not the only recently formed investment fund targeting women. In 2015, Arlan Hamilton, a once homeless music manager, created Backstage Capital, a $36 million venture capital fund dedicated to “underestimated founders” — women, people of color, the L.G.B.T.Q. community. In 2014, Anu Duggal started Female Founders Fund, which she now runs with Sutian Dong, a venture capital fund that invests solely in women-founded start-ups. It’s a small world with a lot of overlap: Ms. Blau gave Female Founders Fund one of its first checks, and several of the companies that participated in Wingable have had conversations with Backstage Capital and Female Founders Fund. Last fall, Ms. Blau and Ms. Eilian sketched out the idea that would lead to the Wingable pitch night in January. In October, they put out a call for interested start-ups, specifying that they had to have at least one founder who identified as female, and had to be in prelaunch phase, with less than $5 million in revenue. Within two weeks, Ms. Blau and Ms Eilian had more than 800 applications. They hired two M.B.A. graduates to comb through them and enlisted Ms. Eilian’s sister, Sarah Godwin, who until recently worked in recruitment at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, to devise an evaluation matrix for the most promising candidates. By November, Able chose 10 start-ups to back; the fund ended up investing a total of $700,000 in the group at varying degrees of equity. Over the course of a six-week “boot camp,” Ms. Eilian and Ms. Blau offered the women access to their network of investors and advisers; put them through media training; paired them with mentors, including Ms. Wilkis Wilson, SoulCycle’s chief executive, Melanie Whelan, and the Away co-founder Jen Rubio; and held “office hours” to zhuzh up their PowerPoint pitch decks. The day before the showcase at the Wing, the group gathered at West-bourne, a vegetarian cafe in SoHo, to practice their presentations. A projector had been set up next to a vast spread of purple cauliflower and other crudités. When Zofia Moreno, a founder of the probiotic drink Oba, stumbled on her lines midway through her script, Bea Arthur, who started an on-demand therapy service called the Difference, yelled, “You’re doing great, it’s O.K.!” Others practiced punch lines and sound bites designed for Twitter. “Our equipment is not barbells and treadmills; it’s wine and Kleenex,” said Shannon McLay, 40, who has started a chain of financial coaching centers called Financial Gym. Other companies included BlockFi, which provides banking services for investors in cryptocurrency, and AcadeMe, a platform that teaches women workplace skills like how to negotiate a salary increase. The only men in the room were kitchen staff and a guy named Evan who kept his head down and clicked slides on a laptop hooked up to a projector. Over a lunch of cabbage salad, falafel bowls and sweet potato tacos, the participants talked about dealing with male investors. “This investor once told me, ‘I’m too good-looking to be accused of harassment,’” said Viveka Hulyalkar, 26, the co-founder of Beam, a charitable donation service. “I don’t even care about the harassment,” said Ms. Arthur, 35. “It’s just like, if you’re not going to invest, then you’re just wasting my time and trying to hit on me on top of it.” “Last year, when I was raising my seed, this guy was like, ‘It must be really difficult for you to raise money, Shannon, because men dissociate intelligence from attractiveness,’” Ms. McLay said. Everyone in earshot groaned. “I’ve heard, ‘I really love you, Chanel, I think you have an amazing company, but I think I might want to date you,’” said Chanel Melton, 31, the founder of a hair-extension company called RoseGold Pro. More groans. “He followed up later, like, ‘Hey, I hope I didn’t make you feel uncomfortable.’” In February, the mayor’s office announced that it will invest $30 million in women-led start-ups through a program called WE Venture, in coordination with private venture capital firms that have a track record in the area. Alicia Glen, the deputy mayor in charge of the initiative, said that she would be asking Able to provide tips about deals and female entrepreneurs worth watching. “You don’t want to let any smart woman or any good idea fall through the cracks simply because it doesn’t work for a particular fund manager,” Ms. Glen said. “Lisa probably gets pitched a lot of stuff that’s not ready for her but great for us. If we get pitched some wellness hemp thing that you put on your body and it makes you tall and skinny, well, they should go work with Lisa. I’m a middle-aged bureaucrat; I have no idea about that stuff.” At the Wing in January, the crowd cracked up at Ms. McLay’s line about wine and Kleenex and cheered at Ms. Arthur’s ability to dance her way past a PowerPoint glitch. After the presentations, the women stood at tables around the perimeter of the room to meet with audience members and investors. “She, her, they all have very strong handshakes,” Ms. Arthur said, nodding at two blazer-clad women who had given her their business cards. “You can tell they’re real investors.” At her table, Ms. McLay wore a T-shirt that read “Money is my spirit animal.” “It’s fun, it’s good for branding awareness, but we’ll see if the checks come in,” she said. “That’s the next step — what checks get written. Talk to me next week.” I called her the following week. She was in touch with five new potential investors. “We got money from Able, which is wonderful,” she said. “T.B.D. on other money. But I will say that the ones who are talking to me, I know they’re having the conversation because Able gave us money. Investors want to invest in whoever other people are investing in.” Even in the “anti-‘Shark Tank,’” some funder-founder dynamics transcend gender.

2019,When Your Kid Realizes Bedtime Is a Scam,"Welcome to the NYT Parenting newsletter. [Click here to get NYT Parenting in your inbox once a week.] Hello, and welcome to the first installment of the NYT Parenting newsletter! I’m Jess Grose, the lead editor of Parenting, and the mom of two girls who are 6 and almost 3. I’ll be your guide each week as we discuss all the issues affecting your fertility, babies and kids and your lives with them. In May, we’ll be launching our own fancy website full of evidence-based guidance, news and personal stories. And we’re sharing some new articles in this newsletter to give you a taste of the full Parenting experience. One piece we’re excited to run this week explores how to get your kids to share a room without killing each other. It’s a subject dear to my heart, as my children have been splitting a bedroom with varying degrees of success for a while now. My 6-year-old is a stereotypical first born. She never met a rule she didn’t like to follow or enforce on her little sister with an iron fist. She’s always been an excellent sleeper — my husband and I were those jerks who barely had to sleep train our first baby. She just started sleeping a solid 12 hours a night from 6-months old; no muss, no fuss. Her little sister, however, is an agent of chaos. For a nine-month period early on (or was it a full year? I honestly blocked it out), she awoke between 4 and 5 a.m. Every. Single. Day. Right before she turned 2, she finally started sleeping until 6:30 a.m. in the same room as her big sister, and going to bed without much drama around 7:30 p.m. … until about a month ago, when she figured out that her bedtime is a scam. I could see the realization dawning on her. All this time, she’d been just going to bed because we told her to, but what was in it for her? One night she asked, “Why I have to go to bed before sissy?” and started refusing to go to sleep earlier than her older sister. So we moved her bedtime to 8:30 p.m. Then, she started refusing to go to bed until 10 p.m. We tried sticker charts, where she’d earn a pony sticker of her choosing if she stayed in bed without getting up 47 times for hugs, glasses of water, tummy rubs. She did not care one bit about those sticker charts. What ended up working for us is something that Craig Canapari, M.D., the author of our room-sharing article and the director of the Yale Pediatric Sleep Center suggested in his piece. We put our oldest to sleep at 8:30 p.m., then let the little one come back into our bedroom to read another book or two, and put her to bed at 9 p.m. It’s counterintuitive, but as Dr. Canapari, who is also the author of the forthcoming book, “It’s Never Too Late to Sleep Train,” pointed out, if your younger child is still napping, she’s getting more total sleep even if she goes to bed a bit later at night than her older siblings. Ideally Lil’ Chaos would be going to bed earlier than 9 p.m., but it’s still an improvement. P.S. — If you’re enjoying this newsletter, sign up to receive it in your inbox. (Know a sleepless parent? Forward it to them.) In 2016, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended that parents share a room with their babies, “ideally for the first year of life.” That year, Claire Cain Miller and Aaron E. Carroll explained why that recommendation should not be taken as gospel if it doesn’t work for your family. The evidence for sharing a room for a full year, they wrote, “is not conclusive, and doctors need to understand the trade-offs before demanding that parents follow the recommendation.” Trade-offs might include parental sleep, sanity and a sex life. Our friends at Wirecutter — a product review site owned by The New York Times — put together a guide of their favorite books and gear for putting their kids to sleep. My personal lifesaver has been a variety of white noise machines. Maria Russo, the children’s books editor at The Times, recommends the book, ""The New Small Person"" by Laura Child, for kids who must make room for a new sibling in their private space. “Child really captures the tragedy of the situation for little Elmore,” Russo said. “But the ending may surprise even those most opposed to room-sharing.” If you’re struggling with your kid and sleep, you can find solace in this cartoon from the brilliant Emily Flake in The New Yorker, which includes the sentence, “But what is parenting if not an exercise in eating your own words?” Every week we’re going to publish a “Tiny Victory” from a Parenting reader. Tiny Victories are meant to celebrate the little accomplishments that get you through the hardest days. No one wants to hear about how you potty trained your 9-month-old. Everyone wants to hear about how you tricked your children into going to sleep in the same room at a reasonable hour. See below for our first installment. The only way to get my 3-year-old daughter’s shoes on was to play “shoe store.” If I pretended to sell her the shoes, she allowed me to put them on her feet. — Camilla Okamoto, Philadelphia If you want a chance to get your Tiny Victory published, find us on Instagram @NYTparenting and use the hashtag #tinyvictories; or email us.

2019,"Opinion | When a Criminal Record Is Erased, or Isn’t","letters A retired California judge and the Brooklyn district attorney discuss aspects of the issue, including applying for professional licenses and marijuana possession. To the Editor: Re “After Jail Time, a Clean Slate” (Op-Ed, March 21): As J.J. Prescott and Sonja B. Starr advocate, it is high time to institute automatic expungement of records for minor criminal acts once the formal sentence has been served. Expunging a criminal record, however, does not assist a person who is applying for a license, for example, in law, real estate and medical fields, or for that matter most professions. In those cases, a conviction will still be considered by the board or agency. It is noted on the application form. In most states, too many occupations are overregulated. California, for example, has more than 200 regulated occupations; each has its own board that has been delegated vast powers by the Legislature, including admission to be allowed to practice. A felony that is later reduced to a misdemeanor will remain a felony in the eyes of most boards and will be found, usually, to be disqualifying. In most cases, such lifetime bans are unnecessary for protecting the public. In addition to expunging criminal records, it is time to make appropriate policy revisions to limit these excessive powers, which work against the rehabilitation we profess to offer to most criminals. Eugene M. HymanLos Altos, Calif.The writer is a retired judge of the Superior Court of California, Santa Clara County. To the Editor: My experience with expungements for marijuana convictions in Brooklyn is consistent with the “bad news” the writers report from Michigan: “Hardly anyone gets expungements,” even when the opportunities are available. Last fall, working with the Legal Aid Society, Brooklyn Defender Services and the courts, my office created the first program in New York State for the expungement of misdemeanor convictions for marijuana possession. We did this knowing that many of these convictions were a result of years of racially disparate enforcement practices and based on my belief that because my office no longer prosecutes almost all instances of marijuana possession, it was unfair to leave those previously prosecuted with the collateral consequences of a conviction. We estimated that thousands of Brooklyn convictions may be eligible, and we set up a relatively simple process for applications: a free consultation with lawyers to fill out a form motion. We received only a few dozen applications. We will continue to encourage applicants to come forward, but I agree with the writers that expungement — in our case, for misdemeanor marijuana possession — should be automatic and enacted through legislation.

2019,"When a Phone App Opens Your Apartment Door, but You Just Want a Key","[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] The third floor of the warehouse on West 45th Street in Manhattan was a sprawl of rotting wood when the two artists first arrived. Yet through the windows came north light, softened and diffused. The newlywed couple envisioned their future studios and moved in. They put down bamboo floors, erected walls, built a kitchen and bathroom and raised two daughters in a home they have loved for over four decades. Then a new set of digital locks that rely on a smartphone app arrived. Now, the couple — Mary Beth McKenzie, 72, and Tony Mysak, 93 — find themselves waging a legal battle over access to their home that has raised an analog question: Do renters have the right to an old-school metal key? A lawsuit filed in October in Housing Court in Manhattan by the couple and three other tenants of the West 45th Street building demands that the landlord give them access to all the entryways without having to use a keyless entry system. But it also has opened a wider debate over privacy, ageism and renter’s rights that has inspired new legislation in Albany. At the heart of the dispute is a keyless entry system designed by the company Latch that has been installed in more than 1,000 buildings across the city. Founded in 2013, the New York-based company saw a need for tenants and landlords to share access with guests, such as visiting family members, the electrician or a delivery person. Users download the app, create a profile and can unlock doors via their phone or a key card or by punching in a code on the device’s numeric keypad. In some cases, the mechanism is compatible with an ordinary metal key. Assemblywoman Linda Rosenthal, a Democrat who represents the Upper West Side and parts of the Hell’s Kitchen neighborhood (where Ms. McKenzie and Mr. Mysak live), introduced legislation on Wednesday that would require landlords to provide a “traditional” method of entry in all areas for tenants who prefer not to use a smart access system. It also puts strict limitations on any personal data collected by Latch or any similar digital-access company. “This is probably the wave of the future,” Ms. Rosenthal said. “And so we have to make sure as we gallop toward that brave new world that there are privacy protections and alternatives to using apps. That people who are older or disabled or have other issues are not being inconvenienced.” Michael P. Kozek, a lawyer for the Hell’s Kitchen loft tenants, said residents had been given mechanical keys to entrances where Latch is not installed, including their individual apartment doors and side doors that access stairways. But if they want to enter the lobby that leads to the elevator and mailboxes, residents must use the keyless entry system. The tenants have been given key cards that allow them to access the system without the use of a phone. “As a practical matter, this particular group of tenants happen to be elderly or close to elderly and they’re not really technologically savvy,” Mr. Kozek said. Charlotte Pfahl, a resident of the West 45th Street building and a plaintiff in the lawsuit, said she was not comfortable providing personal information on an app that she believes will also track her movement. She said she thinks the landlord is using it as a tactic to push longtime tenants out to make way for higher rents. “They are trying to get rid of the rest of us,” Ms. Pfahl, 67, said. Latch is not a named party in the lawsuit, and the chief executive and co-founder of the company, Luke Schoenfelder, would not comment on the court challenge. Mr. Schoenfelder said the company did not capture, store or use GPS location data of users, nor did it share personal data with third parties for marketing purposes. He said Latch was revising its privacy policy to remove any ambiguity. Landlords can view only the history of entry into common areas, not residents’ apartment units, and they are not permitted to revoke access to the building without an order of eviction, according to Mr. Schoenfelder. “It’s just like going out and changing the locks in the middle of the night — to my knowledge we’ve never had an instance where that was done,” Mr. Schoenfelder said. Benjamin Dulchin, the executive director of the Association for Neighborhood & Housing Development, a coalition of affordable housing organizations in New York City, said this new frontier in digital access was worrisome. “There’s a lot of reason for concern that high-tech apps actually take and track a lot of your personal information,” Mr. Dulchin said. “I don’t want my landlord to know when me or my kids are coming in or out. “People have an absolute right to expect both security and privacy.” Lisa Gallaudet, an attorney who represents the company that owns the building, said the keyless entry system was installed to increase security after a burglary last year. Ms. Gallaudet said the tenants, who have filed two other lawsuits, are attempting to obstruct the owner from converting the industrial property into legal residences under the state’s Loft Law. “Consistent with their past conduct, these select few litigious tenants are wasting judicial resources that should be afforded to deserving claims,” Ms. Gallaudet said in a statement. Many of the units at the West 45th Street building are under renovation or unoccupied. People who entered the brick building with ease on a recent weekday tended to be of a younger generation. “I’m used to it,” said Luis Solares, 28, who works at a first-floor office in the building. “But not everybody is ready for the digital revolution.” Ms. McKenzie, a painter, admitted she has not stayed current with technology. She spends much of her time at home, depicting models who pose in her studio as life-size images on massive canvases. Two of her self-portraits are in the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s permanent collection. “I don’t do Twitter or any of that,” she said. “That’s for young people.” But she does not like the notion that perhaps she was resistant to keeping up. She owns an iPhone, but her husband, whose photography business dwindled when the industry went digital, is blind in one eye and struggles to use any type of phone. “We just want a normal key to get in and out like we used to,” Ms. McKenzie said.",The New York Times
2019,"When a Tornado Hits Your Hometown, and All You Can Do Is Help Cover It","An editor born and raised in Alabama struggles with being so far away when her community and family face such tragedy. As our National editor described plans for covering the aftermath of the Alabama tornadoes in Monday morning’s news meeting, I piped up: “O-pa-LIE-ka,” I said, helping him pronounce the name of the town where I was born and close to where I spent most of my childhood. A working class town of mostly modest homes, Opelika, Ala., was in the news for a grim reason. The death toll from the tornadoes that struck the surrounding Lee County on Sunday had risen overnight from 14 to 23, and rescuers were searching the wreckage for more remains. As Marc Lacey, our National editor, described the scene on the ground, fear knotted my stomach. I gripped my cellphone, waiting for news about the status of four of my cousins, who live in Salem, Ala., close enough to the paths of the tornadoes to have been at risk. And I braced myself for the release of the names of the dead. In a region this small and tight knit, the chances were good that I would know someone who died. Opelika is a former cotton mill town that has, against all odds, attracted new retail stores and lured manufacturing jobs in the past 20 years. It is the county seat of Lee County, but it sits in the long shadow of its neighbor, Auburn, Ala, the home of Auburn University. The county is on the northeastern edge of Alabama’s Black Belt and belongs to a broader, mostly rural region of rolling hills and grassy fields that extends to Georgia. I wanted to be there. I wanted to wrap my arms around my friends and family, and help people start over by clearing debris from yards. But since I wasn’t, I did the other thing that came natural to me: I asked my networks to help my colleagues on the ground in Lee County find tornado victims and tell their stories. On Facebook, I saw a post from a Lee County woman with whom I went to junior high school. Shiraka Farley Baker posted a photo of an overturned Coca-Cola van in a front yard of a mobile home with a partially peeled off roof. “No words can describe!!! God's grace and mercy kept us safe,” she wrote. Some of her neighbors were not as a lucky. Her children had friends who died. I traded instant messages with another junior high school friend who is a doctor at East Alabama Medical Center, the Lee County hospital. My friend spoke about the reactions of families who were starting to learn that their loved ones were dead. The tornado also killed a hospital employee. On the Facebook page of a friend I went to elementary school with, I stumbled on a post featuring a mother’s plea for help to find her missing 6-year-old son, Armando Hernandez. The post was shared more than 4,000 times and had hundreds of comments. In the comments thread, people suggested places to look and volunteered to help. But then word spread that the boy was among the dead, and people argued back and forth over whether the information should be posted on the mother’s own Facebook page. I saw a stranger named Christopher Lynn Grimes comment on a post featuring drone footage of the devastation in Beauregard, Ala., that the tornado killed his father. His father’s car and truck were in the footage, he wrote. Before I became an editor, I was a reporter for newspapers and magazines in California, Florida and Illinois. I loved that work, but it was stressful. I wrote about accident victims, suicide victims, murder victims, rape victims, victims of systemic injustice and perpetrators of fraud and political corruption. But watching such a catastrophic tragedy unfold in my hometown has been different. It has been really hard. It is one of those rare places in America where generations of families have lived for so long that many have forgotten which cities and towns they migrated from, but they can tell you exactly how they are related to nearly everyone around them. In my time growing up there, I lived with three generations of my family on a hill at the top of a rocky dirt road. Our homestead was at onetime six houses or mobile homes in a small clearing amid a forest of towering pine trees. I lived in one of those mobile homes until I was 11 or 12, and I remember rehearsing the steps I would take to flee if a tornado came. I was lucky — the one tornado that I lived through as a young child roared through town while I was in the safety of my school. And by the time I turned 12, my father had moved us to better housing. My immediate family left Salem, and eventually Alabama, moving across the river to Georgia, where my father worked. All the children in my family of my generation left Salem, too. For more than a decade, the only people remaining on the hill have been my father’s four cousins, who are now all older than 75 and living in three houses — two wooden and one brick. The evening that I heard about the storm I texted my younger cousin to see if she had heard from them. She hadn’t and didn’t seem worried. They don’t use their phones during storms, she said. By Monday morning, when I still hadn’t heard from anyone, I started looking through my contacts for their phone numbers and making calls. Jean’s phone was turned off and went straight to voice mail. Mary’s phone was on, but rang four or five times and went to voice mail, too. I left a message and then went to the newsroom’s morning meeting. My drive to tell stories came in part from being born and raised in this family and in this region, which has a long tradition of African-American folklore and oral history. The author and anthropologist Zora Neale Hurston was born in the region, on my birthday no less. “All God’s Dangers: The Life of Nate Shaw,” the oral history of a black sharecropper in the region, won a 1975 National Book Award, besting “All the President’s Men” by Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein and “The Power Broker” by Robert A. Caro. But the best folklorists in my life were the old people on that hill. After the meeting, I checked my messages again and saw a voice mail message from Mary. When I called her, she told me about the storm. It got dark, black as night, and the wind roared like a freight train. They were afraid. But the storm passed, they were all safe and now all she requested was for me to come home.",The New York Times
2019,When a ‘Be In’ in Central Park Was Front-Page News,"Fifty-two years ago, thousands came to Central Park for a counterculture happening that influenced decades of political gatherings there. They came wearing crowns of daffodils in their hair, their foreheads painted rainbow blue and gold as they strolled through Central Park, kites drifting overhead. It was March 26, 1967, and more than 10,000 New Yorkers from Brooklyn to the Bronx gathered for a “Be In” on Easter Sunday to spread a message of love and tolerance. Attendees covered a police car with flowers. They chanted, “L-O-V-E, L-O-V-E, L-O-V-E,” and strummed guitars as police officers kept a watchful eye. Women showed off their Easter bonnets. The New York Times described it at the time as “noisy, swarming, chaotic and utterly surrealistic.” For many it was a reminder that Central Park was a unique place for people to gather in a country divided by race, politics and women’s rights. It was front-page news. Indeed, a month later, crowds would gather again, but this time their message was more pointed: End the war in Vietnam. That is why the Be-In from March 1967, inspired by an earlier one in San Francisco, was a singular event. “It represents a cultural moment in our history,” said Marie Warsh, a historian for the Central Park Conservancy, which oversees management of the park. “Central Park became an epicenter of the counterculture in New York, where different people from all walks of life could gather.” Sure, there were later Be-Ins or happenings in the 1960s. The subsequent rally in 1967 was part of the “Spring Mobilization to End the War in Vietnam” and ended with a march to the United Nations, where orators like the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. spoke against war. A year later, a peace rally and another Easter Be-In were combined. By 1969, though, the gatherings had become explicitly political. Jeanne Gutierrez, a curatorial scholar at the New-York Historical Society, said protesters built bonfires and left mountains of trash, leading to complaints that revelers were ruining Central Park. City officials “got pushback about the Be Ins,” Ms. Gutierrez said. New Yorkers debated whether Central Park should be a place of protest or an oasis of contemplative beauty. The March 1967 Be-In was not planned as a political protest. Thomas Hoving served as parks commissioner for a year leading up to the Be-In before becoming director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. He had championed a series of “Hoving Happenings,” with concerts and festivities, to get more people to enjoy the city’s green space. “He wanted to make the parks a democratic space,” Ms. Gutierrez said. The Be-In was organized by James Fouratt, an actor; Paul Williams, a magazine editor; Susan Harnett, an art administrator; and Claude Badal, a poet and playwright from Chile. According to The Times, the four raised $250, which they spent on posters that appeared in Greenwich Village, the East Village and Harlem. (Some were printed in Spanish.) Two newspapers, The Village Voice and The East Village Other, promoted it, as did local radio stations. But it was largely word of mouth that made New Yorkers show up at the Sheep Meadow. “We wanted to be a celebration of being alive,” Mr. Fouratt said at the time. “People in New York don’t look at each other, don’t see each other, don’t talk to each other.” They arrived in the morning with drums, bells and bubbles for blowing, the sound of music lilting in the spring air. Sunday strollers, some who came after the Easter Parade on Fifth Avenue, stopped and gawked. “Isn’t the young generation awful?” a woman wearing egg-shaped gold earrings and a crown of flowers told The Times. “What are they coming to? In my generation things were never like that.” The Be-In was modeled after one two months earlier in San Francisco, which was attended by tens of thousands of people to celebrate personal empowerment, youth culture and higher consciousness (often aided by drugs). “They wanted to create good energy,” Ms. Gutierrez said of the New York attendees. “It was not dominated by personalities. It was much more organic. People were in costumes. Everyone shared food.” Subsequent Be-Ins, though, raised the question: Who was allowed to congregate in Central Park? And what was the cost? “Within a few years of that first Be-In, people were up in arms,” Ms. Gutierrez said. “They hated seeing hippies in Bethesda Fountain.” Attitudes toward Central Park changed as city officials made it harder to hold large-scale political events, Ms. Warsh, the historian, said. The city began to ask organizations to pay for permits as well as the cost of cleanup and salaries for police officers. “It was complicated,” she said. As donors, too, paid millions of dollars to refurbish Central Park, major protests dwindled, with a few exceptions. In June 1982, hundreds of thousands of peaceful demonstrators rallied against nuclear weapons at a concert attended by, among others, the singers Jackson Browne and Bruce Springsteen, and Coretta Scott King, Dr. King’s widow. Large gatherings were often funded by corporate sponsors who could foot the bill. In recent years, throngs have gathered in awe to hear Beyoncé, Coldplay and other musical acts play at the Global Citizen Festival to end world poverty. “A lot has changed in Central Park since the 1960s,” Ms. Warsh said.",The New York Times
2019,When the Benefits of Statins Outweigh the Risks,"Personal Health Knowing the odds of side effects and making sure to get periodic checkups that would pick up an adverse reaction, I chose to focus on the drugs’ potential benefits. My column last April, “Weighing the Pros and Cons of Statins,” has so far elicited nearly 700 online comments, many of them from people who accused me of selling out to Big Pharma. Yes, statins are blockbuster drugs with sales in the billions, but that doesn’t mean they’re not safe and effective. In this column, I will try yet again to explain my understanding of statins and help others deal sensibly with these potentially lifesaving drugs. I do not own stock in any drug company, and no friend or relative works for one. My personal decisions and published statements about any medication are based on a thorough analysis of the best available medical evidence. Those decisions and statements may change if and when reliable new findings warrant. This is science, after all, and science is constantly evolving. As I mentioned in last year’s column, I had taken a monthslong hiatus after more than a decade on a statin to see if it would relieve my periodic back pain. It did not. What it did do was allow my cholesterol level to soar back to a total of 248 milligrams per deciliter of blood and an LDL (the heart-damaging lipid) level of 171, 70-plus milligrams higher than it should be. My decision to take a statin was not made casually. I first tried a stricter-than-usual diet of home-cooked meals rich in vegetables plus fish and nearly devoid of saturated fats, processed foods and refined carbs and sugars. I took supplements of fish oils, fiber and plant sterols, among other nonprescription products said to lower cholesterol. And, of course, I kept my weight down and activity up — a daily regimen of walking, swimming and cycling. All, alas, to no avail. My doctor deduced that my body was manufacturing too much cholesterol, and knowing I had a frightening family history of premature heart attacks, he thought I’d be wise to take a statin. Many of the readers who responded to my April column also said that statins caused unrelenting muscle pain that resolved once they stopped the drug. I don’t dispute that this can happen to some people, even though numerous studies, including a double-blind placebo-controlled trial, indicated that most reported muscle aches were not attributable to statins. In addition, in about 9 percent of patients, statins have been shown to raise the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. Knowing the odds of side effects and making sure to get periodic checkups that would pick up an adverse reaction, I chose to focus on the drugs’ potential benefits. Most important to me is that for each 40-milligram drop in heart-damaging LDL on a statin, the risk of a major cardiovascular event drops by 25 percent each year. In a 20-year study in Britain of men who had no coronary risk factors other than high LDL levels and no evidence of heart disease, 40 milligrams a day of pravastatin (Pravachol), a relatively weak statin, reduced coronary deaths by 28 percent. Also important are the likely mechanisms behind such protection. In addition to lowering blood levels of LDL, statins reduce inflammation, now recognized as an important risk factor for heart disease, and they stabilize the plaque that narrows coronary arteries. Most heart attacks happen when a chunk of plaque becomes unstable, breaks loose and obstructs a major artery feeding the heart. There may be other important benefits. A review of 36 studies involving more than 3.2 million people found that statin use reduced the risk of blood clots in a limb or lung by 15 to 25 percent. Also enticing is the finding among 400,000 men and women on Medicare linking statin use to a lower risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease. To be sure, this is just an association, not a controlled clinical trial, but one possible explanation for the link is that cholesterol plays a role in processing beta-amyloid, plaques of which are a hallmark of Alzheimer’s. None of this means that every adult over 50 should be on a statin. Trials involving hundreds of participants with differing cholesterol levels and coronary risk factors have shown that those who are at the low end of the risk profile are unlikely to benefit, at least in terms of cardiovascular disease. Currently, doctors and patients can use the Cardiovascular Risk Calculator to determine where on the risk spectrum someone between the ages of 40 and 79 falls. Those calculated to face a risk of experiencing a cardiovascular event over the next 10 years below 5 percent are considered low-risk; a risk level between 5 percent and 7.4 percent is labeled borderline; a level of 7.5 percent to 19.9 percent is intermediate, and a level of 20 percent or higher is considered high. In the latest guidelines from an expert committee of cardiologists, high-risk patients, including anyone who has already had a cardiovascular event, should be advised to start taking a statin, with the goal of lowering their cholesterol level by more than 50 percent. The goal for intermediate-risk patients is a 30 percent reduction in their LDL-cholesterol level. Those who are uncertain about the extent of their risk or who hesitate to take a statin based only on a medical profile suggesting their cardiovascular risk is relatively high could opt for a CT scan of the heart to determine their coronary artery calcium score. The score indicates how much hardened plaque may line the arteries critical to their heart’s health. Also, for those facing a higher-than-average risk of suffering a heart attack or stroke, the first step in reducing that risk is not a drug but getting modifiable risk factors under control. Even if you plan to take a statin, the drug will be most effective when combined with measures that reduce cardiovascular risk. That means adopting and sticking to a Mediterranean-style diet that emphasizes fruits, vegetables, peas and beans, nuts and seeds and contains little or no saturated fats, the fats found in meats, poultry and dairy products that are not fat-free. Substitute whole grains for refined ones. The best oils to use for cooking and salads are olive, canola, grapeseed and avocado. Control of body weight, high blood pressure and elevated blood sugar are also critically important. Again, the first step is consuming the kind of diet outlined above, using less salt and other sources of sodium, and eating fewer sweets and refined carbohydrates like white rice and white bread. If, unlike me, you’re lucky, such changes may even lower your cholesterol enough to eliminate the need for a statin and concern about possible side effects.",The New York Times
2019,When the Dominatrix Moved In Next Door,"A “kink collective“ in a residential area of Brooklyn has upset longtime residents and resulted in a culture clash and gentrification struggle all wrapped up into one fight. Charlotte Taillor began The Taillor Group in 2016 to serve as a kind of kink community center that could help educate women about B.D.S.M. practices.CreditCreditElizabeth D. Herman for The New York Times [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] It’s a classic New York gentrification story with a morality twist. Think “Fifty Shades of NIMBY.” On one side, longtime residents of a block in the Bedford-Stuyvesant area of Brooklyn, led by Laurie Miller, who lives in the same narrow house on Quincy Street that she moved into as a child in 1974. On the other, a queer feminist, Charlotte Taillor, who moved her business next door to Ms. Miller, from a more expensive space in Crown Heights. And in the middle: Ms. Taillor’s business. Now about that business. It’s what’s known as a kink collective, where Ms. Taillor runs bondage workshops and other fetish events for the B.D.S.M. (bondage, dominance, sadism and masochism) community. It’s perfectly legal, she said, but that does not necessarily make it welcome. The dispute began in January when Ms. Miller began noticing men, some of whom she called “weird-looking,” coming and going from the house next door. “It was like a heavy, continuous pattern of these guys that aren’t in the neighborhood,” she said. Because she lived alone, the foot traffic made her uneasy. “Some of them were questionable people,” Ms. Miller said. “You know, your Spidey senses started tingling.” When she asked around, neighbors told her that Ms. Taillor was up to no good. Perturbed, she quickly put up fliers calling for a meeting with the block association and urging local residents to call the community board and the police about “a gentlemen’s sex club” that had “no business” being on the block. Now after weeks of outcry and several community meetings, Ms. Taillor is planning to move her custom-built kinky clubhouse, where folks play with the boundaries of trust and consent, under pressure from Ms. Miller, who says the dominatrices did not have her consent to be there. “It’s her block,” Ms. Taillor said in an interview. “I respect her. I want her to be the Beyoncé of her block. I want her to be the queen of the block. I have no qualms with it.” The clash, which was first reported online by Patch, was splashed across the front of The Daily News with the headline “Kinky Booted” and an image of fishnets and red, thigh-high boots. But the battle on Quincy Street is about more than just sex. For Ms. Miller, it’s about trust and safety; for Ms. Taillor, it’s about respect and kink-shaming. As both women fought to protect their communities, what resulted was a culture clash and gentrification struggle all wrapped up into one fight. Like many blocks in Bedford-Stuyvesant, that part of Quincy Street is a collection of well-kept rowhouses where residents nurse plants next to their stoops. The locals are a mix typical of many changing Brooklyn neighborhoods: young single people lured by affordable rent, families looking for a nurturing environment and older residents who helped turn their block into a tight-knit community. During a recent block association meeting in a church basement, Ms. Taillor, 30, and Ms. Miller, 58, sat across from one another, in front of about 20 people who appeared evenly split. With her lawyer beside her, Ms. Taillor announced to the neighbors that she planned to move her business, the Taillor Group. Despite that, she and Ms. Miller clashed repeatedly, forcing a local police officer to intervene several times to call for order and keep tempers in check. One of Ms. Taillor’s supporters said critics just objected to the nature of her work and wouldn’t care if she were teaching knitting. Ms. Miller said afterward that neighbors were able to hear “things like whips and chains and moans and stuff like that.” “These brownstones are old and hollow,” she said. Another block neighbor, Mary Patrick, said at one point about Ms. Taillor: “She should leave. She should take that to 42nd Street.” Ms. Taillor told her critics in the room: “You don’t have to kink-shame or say that people are creepy because of what they enjoy doing.” She added that her hope when she moved to Bedford-Stuyvesant was “to have a nice relationship with a nice community of woke people.” “Oh, ‘woke’!” Ms. Miller fired back. “Bye, Felicia!” The other day, Ms. Taillor, who does not live in the neighborhood but rents an apartment in the Ditmas Park section of Brooklyn, said she was most upset about what she says is a misrepresentation of her business. “We’re not a sex club,” she said. “Nobody is allowed to have sex on the premises. Even me.” She said she began The Taillor Group in 2016 to serve as a kind of kink community center that could help educate women in particular about B.D.S.M. practices. That included classes for aspiring dominatrices on the finer points of spanking, flogging and rope bondage, as well as events catering to those more experienced with fetish play. The business relied on a group of submissive men for the women to practice with. But Ms. Taillor disputed Ms. Miller’s description of them. Because of the nature of The Taillor Group, she said, the clients tended to be respectful and docile. “It’s great to have them around,” she said. “Because they’re — they’ll do anything from hanging your picture to defending you in your front yard.” Ms. Taillor said she also tried to foster a body-positive, sex-positive, queer-friendly and inclusive environment. In a separate interview on Friday, Ms. Miller complained about the unfamiliar men coming onto her block. “I don’t like the transient nature of the guys that come there, that have no vested interest in our community,” she said. “We don’t know what their backgrounds are or what they’re capable of. It’s just a scary thing.” She wasn’t the only one with concerns. At the community meeting, neighbors asked why Ms. Taillor wasn’t running her business out of a storefront on a commercial block. And Ms. Patrick, 35, shared her concerns that children on the residential street might be exposed to adult sexual behavior. The Department of Buildings has received several complaints about Ms. Taillor’s business, and Ms. Taillor has said she has spoken with them but that her lawyer told her she was not violating any zoning codes. Still, after hearing Ms. Miller’s objections in person, Ms. Taillor said, she decided not to stay on the block. “It’s definitely her block.” Ms. Taillor said. “I’m a feminist, I’m all about her rights.” She also wanted to make sure her group of femme-identifying dommes felt safe and valued. “I want to be cherished,” Ms. Taillor said. “We deserve to be recognized in the community that we are in.” Ms. Taillor is raising money for a new space and moving costs — none of The Taillor Group’s submissives are professional movers — but she said she wouldn’t be able to move until April. In the meantime, she said, Ms. Miller has been harassing The Taillor Group’s clients and employees, shouting insults at them on the street. Ms. Miller denied any harassment and said the only time she confronted Ms. Taillor’s clients was after they started “cursing me out.” But she said she tells neighbors exactly what she thinks happens in the house next to hers. Ms. Miller said she would feel unsafe as long as The Taillor Group was next door. “Not until she’s out,” Ms. Miller said. “That’s when I’ll breathe a sigh of relief.”",The New York Times
2019,"When ‘Captain Marvel’ Became a Target, the Rules Changed","One audience reviewer deemed the movie “a complete disaster.” Another was “tired of all this SJW nonsense,” using the abbreviation for “social justice warrior,” a pejorative term for progressives. Yet another groused that Brie Larson, the movie’s star, “says I shouldn’t see the movie anyway.” “Captain Marvel” had not even been released yet — its opening day was a month away — but that did not stop negative remarks from piling up against the film and Ms. Larson. Much as Facebook and Twitter have had to grapple with false stories aimed at inciting violence or disrupting elections, movie review aggregators like Rotten Tomatoes and IMDb are often besieged by users trying to manipulate a film’s box office success. Despite the trolls’ concerted efforts, “Captain Marvel” slayed during its opening weekend, but not before Rotten Tomatoes, an influential site where a bad audience score can damage a film’s prospects, made major changes to its rules. Most critically, it eliminated prerelease audience reviews. It also stopped displaying the percentage of moviegoers who say they “want to see” a film in favor of using the raw number of people. And it removed the “not interested” button. “We’re doing it to more accurately and authentically represent the voice of fans,” the site said, “while protecting our data and public forums from bad actors.” The backlash against “Captain Marvel” resulted from a collision of two major forces. One was the popularity of websites that at their best democratize the reviewing of movies, restaurants and businesses and at their worst can be weaponized for score-settling or political grudges. The other was the growing movement in Hollywood toward broader gender and racial representation in film roles, production jobs and the industry in general. “Captain Marvel” is among the few superhero films to star a woman, but a bigger trigger factor for the film’s haters appeared to be Ms. Larson’s outspokenness about the lack of diversity in movies and news media coverage of films. Before the film’s release, Ms. Larson told “Entertainment Tonight” that she had spoken with Marvel about making the film “a big feminist movie.” In another interview, she said that after noticing that most of her interviewers in the past had been white and male, she vowed to seek out more underrepresented journalists, including Keah Brown, who is black and disabled, and who profiled her for Marie Claire. Ms. Larson, who won the best-actress Oscar in 2016 for her performance in “Room,” had previously lashed out against the homogeneity of professional film critics. “I do not need a 40-year-old white dude to tell me what didn’t work for him about ‘A Wrinkle in Time,’” she said during a speech last summer. “It wasn’t made for him.” This all provided fodder to trolls, and weeks ahead of “Captain Marvel’s” release, the percentage of Rotten Tomatoes users who registered that they wanted to see it plummeted to 27 percent. On Feb. 25, Rotten Tomatoes implemented the changes, and the “want to see” score disappeared. Since the film’s nationwide release on Friday, the audience score has rebounded to a better-but-still-not-great 63 percent, the lowest for any movie in the Marvel franchise. For a while, the score had been below 60 percent, signified by a tipped-over bucket of popcorn, the symbol for a film that might be one to skip. The “Tomatometer,” which analyzes the ratings from film critics, is at a “certified fresh” 79 percent, slightly below the average for Marvel movies. It is impossible to say whether the website’s changes helped the film, but it made $456 million during its opening weekend, trouncing projections. A representative for Ms. Larson declined to comment, and publicists at Disney, which owns Marvel Studios, did not reply to emails Tuesday. The film’s opponents also swarmed YouTube; video rants with titles like “Brie Larson is Ruining Marvel” often appeared at the top of searches for her name. But a day before the film’s release, a change in the search results pushed those videos beneath others from established sources like Jimmy Kimmel, “Today” and Wired. A YouTube representative said the reason was an algorithm change made last summer that reclassifies trending search topics as news. The site, which is owned by Google, took the action as part of its effort to combat fictitious content and ensure that reliable information was highlighted. “Captain Marvel” detractors also flocked to IMDb, though a representative from that site said no one was available to comment, and would only provide a link to the site’s ratings and comments policy, which states that users are not allowed to rate a film before its release. The new Marvel movie is not the first film to come under attack for a perceived feminist or politically correct underpinning. The all-female remake of “Ghostbusters,” “Black Panther” and “Star Wars: The Last Jedi,” which had a diverse cast, all found themselves in the cross hairs of armchair critics, some aligned with alt-right groups. Some sites pushed back. Last year, Rotten Tomatoes said it would delete comments posted from members of the Facebook group “Down with Disney’s Treatment of Franchises and Its Fanboys” if they contained hate speech. The group had posted an event called “Give Black Panther a Rotten Audience Score on Rotten Tomatoes.” Facebook then deactivated the group (it has since been revived by someone claiming to be anti-troll), which had also claimed responsibility for torpedoing audience scores for “Star Wars: The Last Jedi.” That a movie starring Ms. Larson spurred Rotten Tomatoes into taking a bolder step was no coincidence. When Ms. Larson spoke out last summer against the dominance of white male critics, she cited findings by the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative, which is run out of the University of Southern California and had singled out Rotten Tomatoes for having 3.5 men to every female critic reviewing the top films of 2017. In her speech, Ms. Larson also revealed that the Sundance and Toronto film festivals had each pledged to set aside one-fifth of their press passes for use by diverse journalists, including women and people of color. Two and a half months later, Rotten Tomatoes threw in with Ms. Larson’s cause, and revamped its criteria for critics, focusing more on individual qualifications than the brand and reach of a publication, to include hundreds of reviewers from underrepresented groups in its Tomatometer score (a representative said the change had been in development for over a year). It also pledged $100,000 to various film festivals working to diversify their press corps, in part by helping cover freelancers’ travel and lodging costs. A representative for Rotten Tomatoes, Dana Benson, said the change to its audience score had been in the works for a while, but that the attacks on “Captain Marvel” prompted them to roll it out earlier than planned. “We’re very dedicated to making criticism more inclusive,” Ms. Benson said. “All the thought and care that went into the Tomatometer, we are expanding that to the audience score.” Rotten Tomatoes said future changes could include having “verified” reviewers, like the ones who post on Amazon after purchasing a product. Those could come from people who bought tickets through Fandango, the movie ticket website, which owns Rotten Tomatoes. There was, not unexpectedly, a flip side to the attacks on “Captain Marvel” — people rushing to its defense, whether they had seen the movie or not. “There are a large group of people that are only down-voting this movie because they somehow feel threatened by it,” wrote one fan on Rotten Tomatoes. “Imagine being so insecure, you cry about a movie with a girl as the hero,” wrote another. And over on IMDb, one wrote: “I do agree that this isn’t marvel’s best movie, but it was a fun and enjoyable ride.

2019,When ‘What Are You Wearing?’ Is a Beat Unto Itself,"Times Insider My “Life as a Runway” column has taken me to all kinds of places — film festivals; a fish market — to talk to people about their clothes. Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together. It is hard for me to imagine my father, a career litigator, boasting to his colleagues in Toronto that his son writes about pants. “I’m not sure what my father tells people I do,” I’ll joke. “Maybe he says ‘engineer.’ I hope he says ‘spy.’” So what is it that I do? I write the Life as a Runway column for The Times’s Styles section. Since April 2015, I regularly go to a location — an event or workplace — and discuss with people the clothes they’ve decided to wear. I write about pants. Naturally, I like to think there’s more to it. To quote one of my favorite writers on the subject of style, Judith Thurman, “Everyone gets dressed.” That’s universal, but there’s also a city and its people to be explored; and I can think of few less interesting ways to do that than by asking about the literal layers that separate them. It’s not always easy. One trick to approaching strangers and inquiring about what they’re wearing, I’ve found, is to be Canadian. It helps to be polite, a little embarrassed, a little (and I really stress “little”) funny, a little unassuming. That’s half the ballgame. The other half is editing, which is kissing cousins — let’s be honest: it’s a whole Greek tragedy — with a troublesome thing called taste. It begins with my editor, Denny Lee, and I, figuring out a place to feature. This week, we looked at a large construction site, which is something we’ve been trying to do for years. After failing to get access to Hudson Yards and 1 Vanderbilt, I reached out to Berlin Rosen, a PR firm that represents developers, and they finessed it with the construction folks at 1 Wall Street. Once the photographer and I arrive, we need to make some quick decisions: Whom do we feature? I look for looks. But not just beauty, at least as traditionally defined: interesting looks are at least as important as “good” ones. We strive for diversity — age, gender, race, size — but at the same time, I want to be representative of the actual crowd at the Sundance Film Festival, Frieze art fair or Fulton Fish Market. We’re choosing a few of many, always. “This is not the Fashion Police,” I once told a reporter from Fast Company, when the tech-biz magazine was following the rest of the internet in mocking Tumblr employees we featured in a 2015 column (they took issue with the “pedestrian quality of some choices”). I really believe that. At the same time, I’m clearly making aesthetic decisions. So there’s a tension. That push and pull exists throughout the entire process: in the people I choose to include and leave out, in what clothes I interrogate and ignore, in the questions I ask. I have all of three minutes to get the information, to get them to say something interesting, or perhaps funny, but at the same time feel comfortable and to be themselves while I’m standing here with a microphone in their face. The real challenge is to lead them to a place where they’re imparting the essential info on their own, without my drawing it out too much. All the while, I need to know to clamp down on my own tongue. It can be uncomfortable to wait out the extra beat of silence that gives the subject room to give that the golden nugget of information, but holding back allows the best moments. Also, there’s a danger in overexposing. Our readers are smart; they know what they’re seeing. They have taste. Finally, there’s the most important step: the editing, once everything’s transcribed. When we featured the old Four Seasons restaurant at Christmas time, Martha Stewart told me that she had always found the room “sexy,” which never made it into the final version. That killed me, but cutting it made room for her anecdote about always getting cookies for her driver, which made the piece. Between Denny’s cuts and mine, I’d wager we lose about three-quarters of the quotes in a given interview. Working through it recalls the title of one of my favorite collections of poetry: “There’s A Trick With A Knife I’m Learning To Do,” by Michael Ondaatje. Writing is editing. Talking is editing. Seeing too. A few weeks after I interviewed Martha, I was home in Canada for holidays. After dinner every night, my father retreats to the living room, where he reads The Times. Out of earshot, my stepmother confessed to me that he not only reads my Styles pieces, he cuts them out and saves them. Later that week, I noticed his dad jeans were a tad baggy and asked if he’d like me to have them tailored. “Get out of here,” he said. But I’m leaving out a couple of words. As in my column, some things are better left unsaid.

2019,Where Beto O’Rourke Stands on the Issues,"[Sign up for our politics newsletter and join our conversation about the 2020 presidential race.] Beto O’Rourke, the former Texas congressman who just joined the Democratic presidential race, gained an instant following last year when he came within three points of unseating Senator Ted Cruz. But while he was able to stand out in his Senate campaign with a broadly liberal message and no signature policy issue, that broad message is not likely to be enough in a ballooning Democratic field. This time, the specifics are going to be crucial. Here’s a look at where Mr. O’Rourke stands on some major issues. As President Trump’s proposed border wall has become one of the biggest issues in American politics, Mr. O’Rourke has made immigration the centerpiece of his speeches. In addition to supporting the Dream Act and a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, he has called for the closing of private immigrant detention centers, denounced the “militarization” of immigration enforcement and spoken out against the wall. [Beto O’Rourke announces candidacy, joins field filled with committed progressives] “We are not safe because of walls but in spite of walls,” he said at a rally in El Paso last month held at the same time Mr. Trump was holding his own rally nearby. Far from extending a barrier across the entire border, he has said, he would like to remove the existing fencing in El Paso — one of the country’s largest border cities, and Mr. O’Rourke’s hometown. In his State of the Union address, Mr. Trump held up El Paso as an example of the need for a wall, claiming that the city had been one of the most dangerous in the United States until a border fence was built there. But the crime rate in El Paso actually fell long before the fence was built and rose afterward, and Mr. O’Rourke is holding up the city as an example of the lack of need for a wall. Mr. O’Rourke arguably first made his name when, after the shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando in 2016, he live-streamed the sit-in he and other Democratic representatives were holding on the House floor in support of stricter gun laws. The Republican-controlled Congress did not pass any gun control legislation then, but Mr. O’Rourke continues to support similar policies, including universal background checks, magazine size limits and restrictions on some semiautomatic weapons. He also opposes concealed carry reciprocity, which would make concealed carry permits granted in any state valid nationwide, forcing states with strict licensing requirements to recognize permits from states with looser standards. It is one of the National Rifle Association’s legislative priorities. While Mr. O’Rourke supports universal health care — increasingly a litmus-test position for Democratic candidates — he hasn’t committed to a specific way to get there. During his Senate campaign, he suggested that universal health care could take the form of a single-payer system or “a dual system,” in which a government-run program would coexist with private insurance. He has given conflicting messages on the most prominent proposal, “Medicare for all.” In 2017, during his time in the House, he said unequivocally, “A single-payer ‘Medicare for all’ program is the best way to ensure all Americans get the health care they need.” But during his Senate campaign, he carefully avoided those words, calling instead for “universal, guaranteed, high-quality health care for all.” He does support expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act and has urged Texas to do so. Other points in his 2018 platform included allowing the government to negotiate prescription drug prices with manufacturers and creating incentives for insurers to participate in the Affordable Care Act’s exchanges. When it comes to proposals for mitigating climate change, opponents frequently cite the potential costs of those plans. But Mr. O’Rourke has emphasized the financial impact of climate change itself. Billions of dollars that are spent on steps like sea walls, which would be critical if climate change continues unchecked, is money not spent on other priorities, he noted at a town-hall event with Columbia University students last month. At that event, Mr. O’Rourke spoke positively about the Green New Deal, calling it technically and logistically doable. As for its political prospects, “I don’t know,” he said. “That’s up to all of us, right?” He supports the Paris climate accords, and has also made a point of emphasizing effects that climate change is having: more storms like Hurricane Harvey, for instance, which devastated Texas. Mr. O’Rourke emphasized criminal justice in his 2018 campaign, focusing in particular on racial and economic inequities. In an op-ed in The Houston Chronicle, he described his own criminal record — he was arrested once for attempted forcible entry and once for drunken driving when he was in his 20s; both charges were dismissed — and argued that his success since then had been possible because of his race and economic status. “The chance that I had, and which I have made the most of, is denied to too many of our fellow Texans, particularly those who don’t look like me or have access to the same opportunities that I did,” he wrote. He called for closing private and for-profit prisons, decriminalizing marijuana and expunging the records of people previously convicted of possessing it, eliminating mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent crimes, and reforming the bail system so people charged with misdemeanors would not be incarcerated because of their inability to pay. He also emphasized rehabilitation for offenders released from prison, including the restoration of voting rights. Currently, those rights vary drastically by state. Like many of the Democratic candidates, Mr. O’Rourke has criticized Mr. Trump’s trade policies, including the imposition of tariffs, which have hurt some farmers and blue-collar workers. In his Senate campaign, he emphasized the needs of farmers, calling for a stronger crop insurance program and federal investments in rural infrastructure, including high-speed internet, roads and schools. He has also drawn connections between agricultural policy and immigration policy, noting that immigrants — many of them undocumented — make up a large share of farm laborers. On that basis, he has cast immigration reform as an economic issue as well as a social one. “We should treat these individuals with dignity and respect,” he wrote on his website last year, “because they are a critical component of our agriculture communities.”",The New York Times

2019,"In a Crowded Syria Tent Camp, the Women and Children of ISIS Wait in Limbo","Syria Dispatch AL HOL CAMP, Syria — She left the Netherlands to join the Islamic State in Syria, and married a fighter here. He was killed, so she married another, who got her pregnant before he was killed, too. Then this month, as the Islamic State collapsed, she surrendered with her son to United States-backed forces and landed in the sprawling Al Hol tent camp, which has swollen to the breaking point with the human remnants of the so-called caliphate. “I just want to go back to a normal life,” said Jeanetta Yahani, 34, as her son Ahmed, 3, clung to her leg and shook with a violent cough. The announcement a week ago that the Islamic State had lost its final patch of territory in Syria was a milestone in the battle against the world’s most fearsome terrorist network. But it also raised urgent questions about what to do with the tens of thousands of people who had flocked to join the jihadists from around the world and now have nowhere else to go. Al Hol, a sprawling, isolated conglomeration of tents on rocky soil surrounded by a chain-link fence and armed guards, held about 9,000 people in December. As the Islamic State’s final territories fell, its population swelled to more than 72,000. TURKEY Al Hol Camp Aleppo Raqqah Deir al-Zour SYRIA Homs Abu Kamal Damascus IRAQ TURKEY Al Hol Camp Aleppo Raqqah Deir al-Zour SYRIA Homs Abu Kamal Damascus IRAQ By The New York Times The population explosion has taxed the camp’s resources, leading to crowding and long lines for food, fuel and drinking water. On a rare visit to the foreigners’ section of the camp on Thursday, a team of New York Times journalists found a miserable international tableau of lost women and children. Along muddy, trash-strewn lanes between rows of white tents, we heard groups of women chatting in English, Russian, French, Dutch and Chinese. We saw blond- and black-haired children playing together in the mud. A German woman told me she had come to Syria with her husband, a doctor. Now she had no idea where he was, and she was stuck in the camp with a baby in her arms and a curly-haired toddler gripping her leg. But she did not want to return to Germany, which she considered an infidel country. “I don’t want to raise my kids in a society that’s totally corrupt, where every sin is promoted,” she said, declining to give her name. It was better to tough it out in Syria, she said. “This is temporary. The afterlife is forever.” [For more stories about the collapse of the Islamic State, sign up for the weekly At War newsletter.] Although the Islamic State no longer controls the vast territory that that once stretched across Iraq and Syria, the women in the camp still followed its rules, wearing black gowns and face veils with slits for their eyes. Their clothes were dirty, the hems and shoes caked with mud. Many toted toddlers with hacking coughs and runny noses. Other children sold cookies and soda their relatives had managed to bring in, or stood in long lines for food, drinking water and gas for generators. Al Hol is the largest of three detention camps run by the Kurdish-led administration in northeastern Syria. Other camps dot Iraq and Libya. Along with tens of thousands of Syrians and Iraqis, the Syria camps hold 12,000 foreign women and children, according to Redur Xelil, a senior official with the Syrian Democratic Forces, the United States-backed militia that fought the jihadists. The force also holds more than 8,000 fighters, including 1,000 foreigners, in its prisons. A handful of places, including France, Russia and Chechnya have taken back tiny numbers of their citizens, mostly women, children and orphans. But most of the home countries do not want the caliphate’s former residents back, so they are stuck here, in a stateless, unstable territory. The local administration lacks the resources to deal with them and worries that the paucity of international support could help the Islamic State reconstitute itself. “There is little support, little response,” said Mohammed Bashir, a camp administrator. This week, local officials called for the creation of an international court to try foreign fighters, but the idea has garnered little international support and the Syrian government would probably block it. While determining the exact backgrounds of the women and children in the camps is difficult since many lack identification and use fake names, they are generally considered less dangerous than the men. But some were also combatants. And some still endorse the extremists’ ideology, making local officials reluctant to let them leave. More than 9,000 of Al Hol’s residents are foreigners who are kept in a special section, which I visited with a photographer on Thursday. As soon as we entered, women approached us to ask if we could help them return to their countries or find missing loved ones. “Are you from the Swedish Red Crescent?” a woman asked, trotting away after I said no. “I am from a country that no one knows about, so I will never get out of here,” said a woman from the Seychelles. Spotting strangers in the camp, Lisa Smith, a former member of the Irish Defense Forces, said hello but declined to be interviewed. Some women still clung to the jihadists’ ideology. A 22-year-old Chechen woman who identified herself only as Um Aisha described life in the caliphate as “all very good.” “There were brothers who believed in Shariah, an Islamic state, and it was not like this,” she said, pointing disapprovingly at two female aid workers wearing pants. The woman’s husband was killed in an airstrike on the Islamic State’s final pocket this month, she said, but she did not think the jihadists’ project was over. “Our brothers are everywhere, in Germany, in Russia, in America — we believe that al-Dawla al-Islamia will come back,” she said, using the group’s Arabic name. Others expressed regrets. Galion Su, from Trinidad, stood near the camp’s gate with her face uncovered, hoping to get out and look for her teenage son, who had been arrested by Kurdish forces in January. Her husband brought them to Syria in 2014 and the couple divorced soon after, leaving her struggling to care for her son. “I was like a whore in the Dawla,” said Ms. Su, 45. She had married four men, she said, each on the condition that they let her keep her son. When the jihadists tried to force him to fight, she dressed him as a woman and fled, but Kurdish forces arrested him when they discovered the ruse, she said. Now, she had no idea where he is. “I just want to be normal and go back to a normal society, sleep in a nice bed, eat nice food, watch TV and laugh,” she said. Children make up about two-thirds of Al Hol’s residents. Some are orphans. Many described in detail and with little emotion how their fathers had been killed. All had witnessed violence, and some had been taught to practice it. Camp officials say they are too busy scrambling to provide tents and food to offer schooling or other activities, much less to deal with people’s psychological problems or to re-educate children trained by the jihadists. The challenge is intensified because some parents still endorse the jihadists’ ideology. “The mentality is the same. Nothing has changed,” said Mr. Bashir, the camp administrator. “The children are innocent, but when they end up in the camp, they will learn what their parents teach.” As the sun set after a rare sunny day on Thursday, we found ourselves surrounded by hordes of children playing. A group of Turkish boys played a rowdy game of soccer while children from Iraq, Egypt, Russia and elsewhere pelted one another with fistfuls of gravel. Standing atop a latrine, an Iraqi boy with a toy rifle shouted, “The Islamic State has invaded!” Training his sight on another child, he threatened, “I’m a sniper. I’ll shoot you in the head right away.” Nearby, two toddlers got into a fight and fell to the ground punching each other while a 10-year-old boy who was missing his right leg looked on. He declined to give his name or say where he was from, and responded to questions with short answers. How did you lose your leg? “A plane. Shrapnel.” What do you want to do now? “Get a tent and stay in it. Or maybe a house.” Where? “I don’t know.”",The New York Times
2019,Where Does Brexit Go From Here?,"LONDON — What now? Now that European leaders have agreed to a short postponement of Brexit, as Britain’s scheduled withdrawal from the European Union is known, what happens next? Another vote in the British Parliament on some version of Prime Minister Theresa May’s plan? A short delay and a cliff-edge Brexit? A slightly longer delay and a victory for the prime minister? A very long delay and a softer from of Brexit? Another vote of confidence on Mrs. May? An upheaval within one or both major political parties? Early elections? Another referendum? No Brexit? The answers are: maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe and maybe. More nuanced responses range from “probably” to “probably not, but you never know,” with a liberal sprinkling of “no one has a clue.” The process leaving the European Union continues to defy easy prediction, despite the fast-approaching prospect of an abrupt, chaotic exit for Britain that might be an economic disaster. So here is the situation Mrs. May and her nation find themselves in, as well as the possible routes ahead. The one certain result of the meeting of European Union leaders in Brussels on Thursday is that Brexit will not take effect on March 29, the date that was set two years ago. Mrs. May negotiated a withdrawal agreement with the European Union, but Parliament has rejected that deal twice, each time by very wide margins. And last week it voted against leaving without any agreement in place — the “no-deal” or “cliff-edge” scenario — and told Mrs. May to ask for a postponement. So after insisting for almost two years that Brexit would go ahead on March 29, Mrs. May gave in and requested an extension until the end of June. But the European Union refused to give her that much time, declaring instead that the British Parliament must decide what it wants to do by April 12. If lawmakers somehow approve Mrs. May’s deal by then, the exit date would become May 22, to give them time to pass all the additional legislation it would require. If not, European leaders said, Britain’s choices would be a cliff-edge Brexit on April 12, no Brexit at all or a much longer delay, possibly two years. Each of those options is opposed by most of Parliament, as is the deal on the table. On Monday, lawmakers could take the first big step toward wresting control of Brexit policy away from Mrs. May. They are scheduled to vote on proposed amendments to her plan, including one that would give Parliament a rapid-fire series of votes on specific alternatives to the plan. A similar proposal was defeated last week, but barely. For Parliament to decide to weigh in like that might not have much practical effect, because the votes would not be binding on the government. But it would be an enormous political blow to the prime minister, who is on increasingly shaky ground. Mrs. May wants to try a third time, possibly next week, to get her plan through Parliament. But to succeed, she would have to change the minds of about 70 lawmakers who have already voted against it twice. The speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, ruled this week that she cannot have another vote on the same proposal unless she offers something new. The European Union has insisted that it is done negotiating, and there will be no further changes. The new dates might count as enough of a difference, but Mr. Bercow has yet to confirm this. British lawmakers have stated repeatedly what they don’t want, but have given no reason to believe that they can agree on what they do want. Some have demanded a more complete break with the bloc than Mrs. May proposes. Others would prefer a withdrawal that keeps Britain closely tied to Europe, and a sizable faction is holding out for no Brexit at all. The leader of the opposition Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, could try to bring down the government by a vote of no confidence. He forced such a vote in January and lost, but Mrs. May’s standing has only worsened since then. The problem is that the British government cannot say what sort of relationship it wishes to have with the European Union once Britain leaves the bloc. Mrs. May’s deal would mostly keep Britain tied to European customs and trade rules until the end of 2020, while the two sides work out long-term arrangements. If Brexit were to take place without an agreement, then all products going between Britain and the bloc would suddenly become subject to tariffs and quality checks, which would be cumbersome and time consuming. Britain does not have the physical infrastructure or bureaucracy to manage such checks, nor do some of its European trading partners. The British government has said it will wave trucks through the border, at least for the first several months, but the European Union will not. So trade would slow down, particularly on the Continental side, hurting merchants of perishable goods and manufacturers; some products could be barred from crossing borders; and experts predict higher prices and shortages. In addition, Britain has no trade treaties with most of the world, including the United States, because it has operated under the European Union’s treaties, and negotiating new ones can take years. In a no-deal Brexit, the existing arrangements would abruptly cease to exist and Britain would default to rules set by the World Trade Organization, upending the way every importer, exporter and regulator in the country operates. Economists and the government say that leaving without a plan in place would do severe economic harm. But the most ardently pro-Brexit lawmakers in Britain insist that the cliff edge is nothing to fear, and preferable to a long delay. There is at least one set of elections approaching that could affect Brexit, and others are possible. European Union member countries are scheduled to hold elections for the European Parliament from May 23 to 26. But if there were a two-year delay for Brexit, as some European officials have proposed, then Britain would be in an awkward position: It would be required to participate in elections, which the major British political parties do not want to take part in, to govern a bloc it intends to abandon. The exit dates set in Brussels were chosen with these European elections in mind: May 22 is the day before Britain would have voted, and April 12 is the last day it could start preparations to hold a vote. One of the nonbinding amendments Parliament might consider on Monday would approve Mrs. May’s deal, but only if it were also approved by popular vote. Many lawmakers want to go further and hold another referendum on the overall question of whether to leave the bloc, rerunning the vote held in 2016. Mrs. May has opposed both a long Brexit postponement and a second referendum, and any reversal would infuriate pro-Brexit members of her Conservative Party. In addition, the opposition Labour Party has been demanding early elections for a new British Parliament, and there is widespread speculation that Mrs. May — or a possible successor — might eventually be forced to call such elections. Brexit opponents are demanding a “people’s vote,” insisting that they would win such a referendum this time, and accusing resistant lawmakers of forcing an unwanted calamity on them. Brexit supporters say a do-over would be a slap in the face to those who voted the first time, and predict a backlash. With emotions running very high, a second referendum could tear at the fabric of both the Labour and Conservative parties, and of the nation as a whole. Some political analysts say the issue might even split one or both parties apart. Mrs. May has steadfastly insisted that she will deliver on the referendum, but her stance in the 2016 campaign was anti-Brexit. Most Conservatives supported Brexit, many of them doubt that Mrs. May is really on their side, and a significant minority in the party opposes Brexit. Further complicating matters, the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, who was officially anti-Brexit in 2016, is a longtime euroskeptic who is widely seen as wanting to leave. Most Labour supporters opposed Brexit, many of them doubt that Mr. Corbyn is really on their side and a significant minority in the party is pro-Brexit. Early parliamentary elections would be likely to revolve around Brexit, and expose the same fissures.",The New York Times

But the European Union refused to give her that much time, declaring instead that the British Parliament must decide what it wants to do by April 12. If lawmakers somehow approve Mrs. May’s deal by then, the exit date would become May 22, to give them time to pass all the additional legislation it would require. If not, European leaders said, Britain’s choices would be a cliff-edge Brexit on April 12, no Brexit at all or a much longer delay, possibly two years. Each of those options is opposed by most of Parliament, as is the deal on the table. On Monday, lawmakers could take the first big step toward wresting control of Brexit policy away from Mrs. May. They are scheduled to vote on proposed amendments to her plan, including one that would give Parliament a rapid-fire series of votes on specific alternatives to the plan. A similar proposal was defeated last week, but barely. For Parliament to decide to weigh in like that might not have much practical effect, because the votes would not be binding on the government. But it would be an enormous political blow to the prime minister, who is on increasingly shaky ground. Mrs. May wants to try a third time, possibly next week, to get her plan through Parliament. But to succeed, she would have to change the minds of about 70 lawmakers who have already voted against it twice. The speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, ruled this week that she cannot have another vote on the same proposal unless she offers something new. The European Union has insisted that it is done negotiating, and there will be no further changes. The new dates might count as enough of a difference, but Mr. Bercow has yet to confirm this. British lawmakers have stated repeatedly what they don’t want, but have given no reason to believe that they can agree on what they do want. Some have demanded a more complete break with the bloc than Mrs. May proposes. Others would prefer a withdrawal that keeps Britain closely tied to Europe, and a sizable faction is holding out for no Brexit at all. The leader of the opposition Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, could try to bring down the government by a vote of no confidence. He forced such a vote in January and lost, but Mrs. May’s standing has only worsened since then. The problem is that the British government cannot say what sort of relationship it wishes to have with the European Union once Britain leaves the bloc. Mrs. May’s deal would mostly keep Britain tied to European customs and trade rules until the end of 2020, while the two sides work out long-term arrangements. If Brexit were to take place without an agreement, then all products going between Britain and the bloc would suddenly become subject to tariffs and quality checks, which would be cumbersome and time consuming. Britain does not have the physical infrastructure or bureaucracy to manage such checks, nor do some of its European trading partners. The British government has said it will wave trucks through the border, at least for the first several months, but the European Union will not. So trade would slow down, particularly on the Continental side, hurting merchants of perishable goods and manufacturers; some products could be barred from crossing borders; and experts predict higher prices and shortages. In addition, Britain has no trade treaties with most of the world, including the United States, because it has operated under the European Union’s treaties, and negotiating new ones can take years. In a no-deal Brexit, the existing arrangements would abruptly cease to exist and Britain would default to rules set by the World Trade Organization, upending the way every importer, exporter and regulator in the country operates. Economists and the government say that leaving without a plan in place would do severe economic harm. But the most ardently pro-Brexit lawmakers in Britain insist that the cliff edge is nothing to fear, and preferable to a long delay. There is at least one set of elections approaching that could affect Brexit, and others are possible. European Union member countries are scheduled to hold elections for the European Parliament from May 23 to 26. But if there were a two-year delay for Brexit, as some European officials have proposed, then Britain would be in an awkward position: It would be required to participate in elections, which the major British political parties do not want to take part in, to govern a bloc it intends to abandon. The exit dates set in Brussels were chosen with these European elections in mind: May 22 is the day before Britain would have voted, and April 12 is the last day it could start preparations to hold a vote. One of the nonbinding amendments Parliament might consider on Monday would approve Mrs. May’s deal, but only if it were also approved by popular vote. Many lawmakers want to go further and hold another referendum on the overall question of whether to leave the bloc, rerunning the vote held in 2016. Mrs. May has opposed both a long Brexit postponement and a second referendum, and any reversal would infuriate pro-Brexit members of her Conservative Party. In addition, the opposition Labour Party has been demanding early elections for a new British Parliament, and there is widespread speculation that Mrs. May — or a possible successor — might eventually be forced to call such elections. Brexit opponents are demanding a “people’s vote,” insisting that they would win such a referendum this time, and accusing resistant lawmakers of forcing an unwanted calamity on them. Brexit supporters say a do-over would be a slap in the face to those who voted the first time, and predict a backlash. With emotions running very high, a second referendum could tear at the fabric of both the Labour and Conservative parties, and of the nation as a whole. Some political analysts say the issue might even split one or both parties apart. Mrs. May has steadfastly insisted that she will deliver on the referendum, but her stance in the 2016 campaign was anti-Brexit. Most Conservatives supported Brexit, many of them doubt that Mrs. May is really on their side, and a significant minority in the party opposes Brexit. Further complicating matters, the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, who was officially anti-Brexit in 2016, is a longtime euroskeptic who is widely seen as wanting to leave. Most Labour supporters opposed Brexit, many of them doubt that Mr. Corbyn is really on their side and a significant minority in the party is pro-Brexit. Early parliamentary elections would be likely to revolve around Brexit, and expose the same fissures.",The New York Times
2019,"Where Prisoners Can Lock Their Cells, and Guards Are Told to Knock","LONDON — For two years, inmates at a prison in Wales have been allowed to lock their cells from the inside — for privacy. Guards have been expected to follow a “knock first” policy before entering. The detainees have had access to laptops, through which they can order meals. And please, don’t call them “prisoners.” The unusual accommodations, publicized by the British newspaper The Telegraph and other news outlets this past week, were put in place at Berwyn, the largest prison in England and Wales, which opened in February 2017. The policies are part of a government overhaul of prison practices in England and Wales intended to improve conditions and bolster rehabilitation. Six new jails are planned in the United Kingdom, The Telegraph noted. And despite opposition from some prison workers, the government regards Berwyn as “a model for a modern prison,” according to a continuing study funded by the Economic and Social Research Council seeking “to unlock an age-old question of whether prisons can really rehabilitate offenders.” But the approach has been a failure, an official from a trade union for prison workers said on Sunday. “It’s a social experiment that has been a complete disaster,” the official, Mark Fairhurst, the chairman of the Professional Trades Union for Prison, Correctional and Secure Psychiatric Workers said in a phone interview. “Berwyn has the highest assault rates on officers — they lost control because they were too soft; they listened to psychologists who don’t do our jobs,” he added. Berwyn, about 170 miles northwest of London, has capacity for 2,106 male inmates. The prison follows guidelines set out in a 2017 research project, “Well-Being in Prison Design,” that was funded by the Royal Institute of British Architects in conjunction with the Ministry of Justice. As part of the measures, privacy locks were installed to allow inmates to lock their cells (though they can be overridden by guards); prison officers were required to knock on cell doors before entering; prisoners were provided with laptops that could gain access to an internal network; and different terms were used to refer to the men inside and to their cells. “These physical measures are matched with the operational philosophy and terminology: Those in custody are referred to simply as ‘men’ and the cells are ‘rooms,’” according to the project’s guidelines. “The guiding principle is that officers and staff are enablers of rehabilitation first and foremost,” the report added. But the approach has not been effective, Mr. Fairhurst, the trade union chairman, said. He also pushed back on the idea that staff members at Berwyn would knock on cell doors. “They’re prison officers, why would they knock?” he said. “They are still prisoners; there’s still violence.” About 100 prison officers demonstrated outside Berwyn in September to protest “unprecedented violence” at the prison, after reports of widespread drug use and assaults against staff members, which allegedly included employees being pushed down the stairs and spat on, the BBC reported. Mr. Fairhurst also stressed that inmates at Berwyn could not lock and unlock their cells at will. “They can lock their cell door when it’s unlocked, so that other prisoners cannot go in and steal their belongings; they can’t unlock their cells,” he said. A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice said in an email on Sunday that staff members at the prison “can override the locks that prisoners use when they want privacy in their cells.” The spokesman for the Ministry of Justice said of the 2017 report, “While we welcome views on how the design of new prisons could reduce reoffending by improving prisoners’ mental health and rehabilitation, this document is not a blueprint for future prisons.” In January, academics from the Universities of Bath and Leicester announced a three-year research project into whether prisons can rehabilitate offenders — and Berwyn is being studied, according to the project’s official announcement. “Some of these changes at Berwyn are relatively simple, but they might be having an important effect when it comes to making prisoners feel that they are treated with respect and decency,” Yvonne Jewkes, a professor of criminology at the University of Bath who is one of two academics leading the research, said at the time. A report published in July by an independent monitoring board for Berwyn, a body of volunteers who monitor prisoners’ welfare, found that inmates there were “treated fairly and with decency,” and said, “Berwyn will provide a practical illustration of what works well, what works less well and what can or should be discontinued.” The report covered the period from March 2017 to February 2018. The Ministry of Justice has said that as part of the wider overhaul of British prisons, the windows of new prisons in England and Wales will have toughened glass and air vents, because a government-funded study had warned that having bars was punitive. The measure was also intended to make it harder to smuggle contraband into prisons. The ministry has also said in December that more inmates would be allowed phones in their cells to help maintain family ties in an effort to improve rehabilitation and cut reoffending rates.",The New York Times
2019,"Where Some See Trash, She Sees Treasure","GLOVER, Vt. — The entryway of the rundown barn that houses the Museum of Everyday Life looks like a collection of junk — an old pink toilet, gas cans, rusty farm tools. In fact, it is a collection of junk, but a purposeful one. Called the “New England Barns Found Objects Collection: An Ever-Expanding Community Curated Archive,” this exhibition consists of items from residents around the region who dug them out of farm sheds or surrounding fields. The Museum of Everyday Life is exactly that. It chronicles and highlights the mundane, utilitarian, insignificant objects of our existence and makes them remarkable. Past shows have focused on the toothbrush, the safety pin, bells and whistles and even dust. The current special exhibition, which closes in May, features locks and keys. The next yearlong show, a rumination on scissors, opens in June. In a part of rural Vermont known as the Northeast Kingdom, the museum sits next to the home of Clare Dolan, its founder, curator and self-described “chief operating philosopher.” An artist and puppeteer, she started the museum in 2011 after clearing out her barn and choosing the first exhibition topic: the match. Some items from that show that remain on display include a violin that a prison inmate made from wooden matchsticks (it really plays), an array of matchbooks from across the globe and a roller coaster reproduction constructed of paper matches. Her goal is to recognize the extraordinary in the ordinary. “We need to celebrate what is mundane and ordinary but beautiful,” Ms. Dolan said. Not in a major city or even a town center, the museum occupies a 70-year-old barn in the middle of nowhere. It does not display its collection in a pristine environment on stark walls but in a rickety wooden structure with a leaky roof and no heat. It has no security guards to protect its art. Indeed, one piece went missing last spring, and a small placard was put in its place, admonishing museumgoers not to steal. Visitors turn the lights on when they arrive, and off when they leave. There is no charge for admission, although there is a wooden box for donations. In recent months, the visitors’ book has logged names from as far away as Sweden. Inside, an unusual, thoughtful and carefully curated selection of works reveals what Ms. Dolan calls the “storytelling power” of common objects. “The museum is a way for me to think about things I want to think about,” she said. For the locks and keys exhibition, Ms. Dolan interviewed locksmiths, researched history and studied deadbolt design. She has included an installation about escape artists like Harry Houdini, an explainer on chastity belts and a trompe l’oeil scene of Gramercy Park in Manhattan, a private space that is open only to those who live nearby. That piece is accompanied by a recorded interview with Arlene Harrison, the keeper of the keys to the park’s gate. “Part of the magic of a really great exhibit is it operates on different levels,” said Richard Saunders, an art history professor at Middlebury College in Vermont and director of its Museum of Art. “Who would do an exhibit on dust? Then you begin to think about it.” In late January, Luke Burton drove over to the Museum of Everyday Life with his father, William Burton, who lives an hour away in Barre, Vt. “It’s just a reminder to pay attention to the little things,” Luke said of the museum. “What’s interesting about keys is they are either extremely important or totally useless,” William said. He added: “You hold it in your hand. You keep it in your purse. Keys are imbued with the spirit of you.” Ms. Dolan, 52, bought her house on a “super-old derelict farm” in 2004 and envisioned the barn as an art and performance space. In 2010, Glover celebrated the 200th anniversary of a momentous local event known as the Legend of Runaway Pond, when the village center was flooded, but no one died. Ms. Dolan staged a Runaway Pond exhibition in her barn, opening the door for the Museum of Everyday Life. Ideas for the subjects of the museum’s shows often start with an intriguing suggestion or donation. The toothbrush exhibition was inspired by a writer in Montpelier, Vt., who gave Ms. Dolan a box packed with toothbrushes and other dental accessories. A regular contributor to the collection later donated a toothbrush with a handle shaped like a svelte woman; the brush was the woman’s head. Pieces from each special exhibition become part of the museum’s permanent collection. “I’m never going to run out of subject matter, and it’s always going to be accessible,” Ms. Dolan said. To earn a living, Ms. Dolan is a nurse in an intensive-care unit at a nearby hospital. She remains a disciple of, and an occasional performer for, Bread & Puppet Theater, also in Glover, which produces politically charged shows featuring giant papier-mâché figures. In addition, she helps organize an annual traveling festival, Banners and Cranks, which celebrates the ancient art form of cantastoria, a performance of sung narration accompanied by painted panels. One type of cantastoria, called a cranky, is a scroll that unfurls with a crank. Ursula Populoh, a 77-year-old textile artist and puppeteer in Baltimore, is a cranky enthusiast who became what Ms. Dolan calls a “philosopher in residence” at the museum. Visiting philosophers live in an efficiency apartment in another part of the barn while working on a project. During her residency in August 2017, Ms. Populoh created two crankys and tended Ms. Dolan’s vegetable garden. She also acted as a Museum of Everyday Life guide. “This valuing of what we use daily is so absent in our culture and is represented in Clare’s museum,” Ms. Populoh said. Ms. Dolan now hopes to seek some outside funding. She would like to hire an employee to help run the museum, and the barn needs maintenance. “It would be good to not have the roof leak,” she said.",The New York Times
2019,Where Spider-Man and Captain America Intern: The White House Economic Team,"WASHINGTON — The 2019 Economic Report of the President runs 705 pages and features chapters on “expanding labor force opportunities” and “ensuring a balanced financial regulatory landscape.” It also claims to be written by Batman. For the second straight year, the group of economists that do regression analyses and forecast annual growth rates for President Trump has slipped a straight-out-of-Comic-Con Easter egg into its annual report. [Not nerdy enough to know what an Easter egg is? Read here.] The list of Council of Economic Advisers interns on Page 624 of the report includes Steve Rogers (a.k.a. Captain America), Peter Parker (Spider-Man) and Bruce Wayne (Batman). There’s also Aunt May (Peter Parker’s guardian; apparently there are no anti-nepotism rules at the council), J. T. Hutt (a superfan abbreviation for Jabba the Hutt, the “Star Wars” gangster who hangs a frozen Han Solo on his wall), the actor John Cleese, Kathryn Janeway (a “Star Trek” captain) and someone called John Snow (more on him later). The names stuck out because most Council of Economic Advisers interns are university students — depending on which movie or comic you prefer, Peter Parker is the only one on the list who fits that bill — and also, real human beings. A former council economist, Martha Gimbel, who is now research director at Indeed, noticed the names and tweeted about them on Tuesday afternoon. Last year’s list was pretty impressive, too, it turns out. The 2018 report included abbreviated references to a pair of famed “Star Trek” captains, James T. Kirk and Jean-Luc Picard. The White House says it’s all in good fun. The Council of Economic Advisers’ official Twitter account said late Tuesday that the list was an effort to call attention to its intern “super heroes,” who made “significant contributions” to the economic report. It’s worth noting that Jabba the Hutt is not, in fact, a superhero — he enslaved Princess Leia and tried to feed Han Solo and Luke Skywalker to a slow-digesting pit monster in the desert. Also, who is this “John Snow” they speak of? Is he the former Treasury secretary under President George W. Bush? An actual intern? Or did the council, in a blow to its nerd cred, misspell the name of the “Game of Thrones” hero Jon Snow? The New York Times asked a council spokeswoman to clarify. “Have a sense of humor!” she replied. Funny, that’s what people usually say to economists.",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | Where Spying Is the Law,"China requires its citizens and corporations to conduct espionage for the state. Did Huawei comply? Mr. Lian is a former lead writer and chief editor of the Hong Kong Economic Journal. Last week, the Supreme Court of British Columbia set a hearing date in extradition proceedings against Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of the Chinese telecom giant Huawei, bringing her one step closer to being sent to the United States for trial. This is a make-or-break moment for Huawei’s international ambitions — and perhaps China’s — if only because the company is widely tipped to lead the world in soon-to-debut fifth-generation (5G) technologies. Ms. Meng was arrested in Canada late last year on behalf of the American government, which has charged her with fraud and violating sanctions against Iran. But the United States’ beef against her goes deeper than any Iran connections and will have strategic significance well beyond her fate. Huawei describes itself as a private, employee-owned business committed to bringing digital technology to the world. Some question that characterization, and the United States government sees the company as an arm of the authoritarian Chinese state, beholden to the interests of the Chinese Communist Party (C.C.P.). In that view, China’s objective is global dominance, and major Chinese companies like Huawei — nurtured strategically, richly resourced and now successfully embedded in the West — are commercial concerns on a political mission. Apart from the charges against Ms. Meng, in January the United States filed an indictment against Huawei for multiple offenses, including the systematic theft of intellectual property. The American government has been warning allies that the company has developed critical capabilities to carry out cyberespionage worldwide. Congress has banned the use of Huawei products in federal projects for fear of compromising national security. (Huawei has responded by filing a suit last week against the United States over the restrictions.) With these moves, the United States may be hoping to protect the interests of American tech companies, but that doesn’t mean it’s wrong about the threat of Chinese spying. That’s real, and laid out in the open: Just look at China’s 2017 National Intelligence Law. The N.I.L. is no standard security and spying legislation, concerned principally with preventing the leak of state secrets. Its main thrust isn’t protective; it’s proactive. “All organizations and citizens shall support, assist and cooperate with national intelligence efforts according to the Law,” it says. (I know of no official English version; this is my translation, based partly on several others.) Another provision is even more explicit: The state institutions tasked with enforcing the N.I.L. — which also oversee all intelligence and espionage activities, civilian and military — “may demand that relevant organs, organizations and citizens provide necessary support, assistance and cooperation.” Spying for the state is a duty of the citizens and corporations of China under the law, much like paying taxes. The N.I.L. offers enticements for compliance: “The state gives commendations and rewards to individuals and organizations that make major contributions to national intelligence efforts.” In its January indictment against Huawei, the United States claims that the company systematically gives bonuses to employees who pilfer intellectual property from foreign companies. The N.I.L. leaves little room for opting out. “Obstructing the work” of China’s intelligence institutions is punishable and may be a criminal offense. Those institutions are entitled to “have priority use of, or can lawfully requisition the transportation or communications tools, premises and buildings of state organs, organizations or individuals” — and “when necessary,” set up “relevant work sites and equipment within them.” In other words, installing a back door in Huawei hardware to collect foreign intelligence would have a firm basis under Chinese law. During an interview with CBS last month, Ren Zhengfei, the founder and chief executive officer of Huawei, was asked if he had “ever given any information to the Chinese government, in any way, shape or form?” Mr. Ren — who is also Ms. Meng’s father, as well as a veteran C.C.P. member and a former officer of the People’s Liberation Army — answered: “For the past 30 years, we have never done that, and the next 30 years to come, we will never do that.” The Chinese government has come to the defense of Ms. Meng and Huawei, aggressively. Calling for Ms. Meng’s release in December, it threatened, “otherwise Canada must accept full responsibility for the serious consequences caused,” and later arrested two Canadians in China on espionage charges. When Canada, in turn, asked for the Canadians’ release, China accused it of double standards and “white supremacy.” Last week, China banned the import of canola from one of Canada’s biggest producers. The Chinese foreign ministry has also called the American charges against Ms. Meng and Huawei politically motivated and “immoral.” Might quieter, behind-the-scene diplomatic maneuvering be more effective at saving Ms. Meng and helping Huawei? Probably. But a more discreet approach would be suitable only if Huawei were more or less an isolated case. If it isn’t, then when the Chinese government stands up visibly for an operative that is under threat, it is signaling to Chinese individuals and corporations the world over that it will also help them should they get into trouble while in the line of spying duty. This, too, is in keeping with the N.I.L., which provides that “the relevant state departments shall employ the necessary measures to protect or rescue” any person (or a close relative) who “has established cooperative relationships” with the state intelligence institutions and who is “threatened as a result of assisting” them. The United States authorities are correct to point out that Huawei can perform critical commercial, military and diplomatic espionage; actually, Chinese law explicitly requires it to. Yet the law is so stunningly blatant that it may be difficult to take in fully, especially for some in the West. Discounting the United States’ warnings, Britain, Germany, India and Italy seem to be leaning toward using Huawei hardware in their communications infrastructure. Some countries want to upgrade to 5G quickly and cheaply; Huawei can help with that; they see no obvious back door in its systems. In this, they are much like prey before a trap that’s empty and who doubt there ever was a trapper who laid it out.

2019,Where Terrorism Is Rising in Africa and the U.S. Is Leaving,"LOUMBILA, Burkina Faso — President Trump has ordered most American troops to withdraw from Syria. He wants to bring home thousands more from Afghanistan. Now hundreds of United States commandos and other forces are leaving West Africa — despite an onslaught of attacks from an increasingly deadly matrix of Islamist fighters. The shift has unnerved African commanders in Burkina Faso and neighboring nations in the Sahel, a vast sub-Saharan scrubland increasingly racked by bombings, massacres, kidnappings and attacks on hotels frequented by Westerners. It is a region in which most Americans were unaware of United States military involvement until four Army soldiers were killed in a deadly 2017 ambush in Niger by Islamic State fighters. What is emerging, critics said, is a glimpse of what happens when American troops, especially Special Operations forces, pull back before insurgents are effectively subdued, leaving local or allied forces to fend off the Islamic State, Al Qaeda or their offshoots. “It’s a real problem,” Col. Maj. Moussa Salaou Barmou, commander of Niger’s Special Operations forces, said of the drawdown and the closing of seven of eight American elite counterterrorism units operating in Africa. [For more coverage of the experiences and costs of war, sign up for the weekly At War newsletter.] Under the Trump administration’s military strategy, the Pentagon has pivoted from focusing on counterterrorism operations to potential threats from China and Russia. In December, President Trump ordered the withdrawal of all 2,000 American troops from Syria, although he since has softened it to allow at least 400 remain. A new Pentagon plan also would pull all 14,000 American troops from Afghanistan over the next five years — and as many as 7,000 in coming months — as part of continuing peace talks with the Taliban. The American military is scaling back its commandos in Africa by about 25 percent, mainly in the continent’s west. At the same time, insurgents are attacking northern Burkina Faso and pushing south along the border with Niger toward areas previously untouched by extremist violence, including the Ivory Coast, Benin, Togo and Ghana, where the Pentagon has a logistics hub. In one sign of the growing fear, a school in the Burkina Faso village of Bargo recently built a concrete wall around its buildings for greater protection. Just last month, two boys were kidnapped by extremists while they prayed at the nearby mosque, said Bonane Honore, the school’s headmaster. “We are very scared,” said Christine Kabore Ouedraogo, a political leader in the village, a short drive from the training camp in Loumbila. Colonel Major Barmou trained at Fort Benning, Ga., and the National Defense University in Washington. His comments — which were echoed by other African officers concerned about Washington’s commitment to fighting violent extremism — came during a counterterrorism exercise in Burkina Faso last week that drew 2,000 military personnel from more than 30 African and Western countries. “The threat is gaining ground,” Foreign Minister Alpha Barry of Burkina Faso told a security conference in Munich in February. “It’s no longer just the Sahel, it’s coastal West Africa and the risk of spreading regionally.” France, the former colonial power in West Africa, maintains 4,500 troops in the region to help battle insurgents in Niger, Chad and Mali, where it routed Al Qaeda’s affiliate from the north in 2013. French officials said the Pentagon had assured them it would keep providing intelligence, logistics and aerial refueling in what Prime Minister Édouard Philippe called “a hard fight,” while visiting troops in Mali last week. The American military has a relatively light footprint across Africa, relying on European and African partners to carry out most counterterrorism missions from the Sahel to Somalia, with the Pentagon providing air power when needed. The United States has already conducted 24 airstrikes this year against Shabab targets in Somalia, compared with 47 all of 2018. About 6,000 United States troops and 1,000 Defense Department civilians or contractors work throughout Africa, mainly training and conducting exercises with local forces. The military’s Africa Command plans to cut 10 percent of those personnel by January 2022, including about 300 Special Operations forces from the roughly 1,200 commandos who were deployed across the continent last year. American Green Berets from the Third Special Forces Group at Fort Bragg, N.C., advise their African partners on planning and carrying out operations, but rarely join them on missions, said Col. Nathan Prussian, the group commander. American commanders said the changes reflected the progress made by the African troops and denied that the United States was backing away from its commitment to the region. “The notion that we’re leaving the Sahel is simply not true,” Maj. Gen. J. Marcus Hicks, the head of American Special Operations forces in Africa, said in an interview. “This is just a natural transition.” The drawdown, however, comes amid a torrent of terrorist attacks. In Burkina Faso alone, Islamic State and Al Qaeda affiliates and splinter groups conducted 137 attacks last year, up from 12 in 2016, according to the Africa Center for Strategic Studies. SAHEL Mali Area of detail Africa Niger Bargo Loumbila Ouagadougou Burkina Faso BENIN IVORY COAST GHANA TOGO 200 miles By The New York Times Armed groups have attacked government buildings and schools, threatened teachers, conducted brutal assaults on cafes and other gathering places, and executed those suspected of collaborating with authorities. Last March, fighters attacked the French Embassy and the national army headquarters in Ouagadougou, the capital, killing eight security guards. Military analysts and human rights groups cited three main reasons for the spiraling violence in Burkina Faso and its neighbors: French-led counterterrorism operations in Mali have pushed the problem south, into Burkina Faso. Armed Islamic militants have effectively exploited grievances among local populations. Abuses by security forces have fueled jihadist recruiting. “These are a series of small rural insurgencies that are spreading,” said Jean-Hervé Jezequel, director of the International Crisis Group’s Sahel project in Dakar, Senegal. The violence has upended Burkina Faso, a poor, landlocked country of about 20 million people that is roughly the size of Colorado and was once a French colony known as Upper Volta. A popular uprising ousted its longtime strongman, President Blaise Compaoré, in 2014. But weeks after a democratically elected government took office, Qaeda militants in January 2016 carried out the most devastating terrorist attack in Burkina Faso’s history, killing 30 people at a luxury hotel and restaurant frequented by Westerners in Ouagadougou. In August 2017, Islamist extremists struck again, as gunmen stormed a popular cafe, leaving 18 dead. Militants have largely outgunned the government of the current president, Roch Marc Christian Kaboré, who recently named a new prime minister and chief of armed forces to put Burkina Faso more on a war footing. The United States is scheduled to provide about $100 million in support — including vehicles, body armor, radios and night-vision goggles — to the 12,000-member Burkinabe military and paramilitary forces over the next two years. An embassy spokesman said that was 10 times what the Pentagon provided the previous Burkinabe government. The Trump administration is also providing about $242 million in military aid to the so-called G5 Sahel countries — Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, Chad and Mauritania. But the G5 force, ultimately set to grow to 5,000 troops, has been slow to halt the militants’ advance. African commanders said they welcome Western assistance, but noted the equipment that is provided is not always effective. Four-wheel drive Toyota Land Cruisers given by the United States, for example, lack armor to protect against increasingly powerful improvised roadside bombs. “The terrorists have I.E.D.s, so we need hardened vehicles,” said Capt. Amadou Koundy, a Nigerien special forces officer who trained in Senegal and at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Fla. Military officials and independent analysts stressed that American and other Western military aid may at best buy time for African allies to address poverty, lack of education, government corruption and other grievances that extremist groups seek to exploit. “There are no fully military solutions here, just holding actions,” said Alice Hunt Friend, a former top Pentagon official for Africa and a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. For now, though, African troops and their Western allies are racing to establish security. At an Army training range in Loumbila, 15 miles northeast of Ouagadougou, Malian and Burkinabe commandos practiced marksmanship with AK-47 rifles and Beretta pistols under the watchful eye of Czech and Polish trainers barking out instructions in French. With temperatures nearing 100 degrees under a blazing sun, the African troops also rehearsed how to thwart militant ambushes and roadside bombs, and clear militant-infested buildings. The troops also honed their skills in the propaganda wars of winning hearts and minds. During the exercise, a four-man American civil-affairs team accompanied Burkinabe Army officers who rumbled over dusty, rutted dirt roads to visit the village of Bargo, bringing school supplies, soccer balls and good will from a government that still struggles to connect with its citizenry. The village of 10,000 people lacks electricity and a working hospital, but Christians and Muslims live side by side in harmony. The village chief is Catholic. His younger brother is the village imam. “We are all one people,” said Mouni Ouedraobo, the imam. Yet there are troubling signs, like the kidnapping of the two boys from the mosque, that peace may be imperiled as American troops draw down. “The U.S. refocus, which has taken resources away from Africa, is shortsighted and in contrast to the long game being used by abusive Islamist groups,” said Corinne Dufka, associate director for West Africa at Human Rights Watch in Washington, who spent two weeks in Burkina Faso in January. “Provided the U.S. is working to improve rights, this is not the time to scale back.”",The New York Times
2019,Where There’s Rarely a Doctor in the House: Assisted Living,"the new old age As residents become older and more frail, some facilities are bringing in doctors and nurses instead of relying on 911. The patient moved into a large assisted living facility in Raleigh, N.C., in 2003. She was younger than most residents, just 73, but her daughter thought it a safer option than remaining in her own home. The woman had been falling so frequently that “she was ending up in the emergency room almost every month,” said Dr. Shohreh Taavoni, the internist who became her primary care physician. “She didn’t know why she was falling. She didn’t feel dizzy — she’d just find herself on the floor.” At least in a facility, her daughter told Dr. Taavoni, people would be around to help. As the falls continued, two more in her first three months in assisted living, administrators followed the policy most such communities use: The staff called an ambulance to take the resident to the emergency room. There, “they would do a CT scan and some blood work,” Dr. Taavoni said. “Everything was O.K., so they’d send her back.” Such ping-ponging occurs commonly in the nation’s nearly 30,000 assisted living facilities, a catchall category that includes everything from small family-operated homes to campuses owned by national chains. It’s an expensive, disruptive response to problems that often could be handled in the building, if health care professionals were more available to assess residents and provide treatment when needed. But most assisted living facilities have no doctors on site or on call; only about half have nurses on staff or on call. Thus, many symptoms trigger a trip to an outside doctor or, in too many cases, an ambulance ride, perhaps followed by a hospital stay. Twenty years after the initial boom in assisted living — which now houses more than 800,000 people — that approach may be shifting. Early on, assisted living companies planned to serve fairly healthy retirees, offering meals, social activities and freedom from home maintenance and housekeeping — the so-called hospitality model. But from the start, the assisted living population was older and sicker than expected. Now, most residents are over age 85, according to government data. About two-thirds need help with bathing, half with dressing, 20 percent with eating. Like most older Americans, they also generally contend with chronic illnesses and take long lists of prescription drugs — and more than 80 percent need help taking them correctly. Moreover, “these places became the primary residential setting for people with dementia,” said Sheryl Zimmerman, an expert on assisted living at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. About 70 percent of residents have some degree of cognitive impairment, her studies have found. So residents can find it difficult to coordinate medical appointments and tests, and to travel to offices and labs, even when facilities provide a van. “The assisted living industry has to recognize that the model of residents going out to see their own doctors hasn’t worked for a long time,” said Christopher Laxton, executive director of AMDA, a society that represents health care professionals in nursing homes and assisted living. His recent editorial in McKnight’s Senior Living, an industry publication, was pointedly headlined: “It’s time we integrate medical care into assisted living.” AMDA is considering developing model agreements. “There has to be more attention to medical and mental health care in assisted living,” Dr. Zimmerman agreed. “Does everyone who falls really need to go to an emergency department?” Lindsay Schwartz, an executive at the National Center for Assisted Living, a trade association, said in an email that “assisted living has certainly expanded its role in providing medical care over the years by adding nursing staff and partnering with other health care providers, among other ways.” But persuading most operators to provide medical care likely won’t happen without a fight. They’ve built their marketing strategies on looking and feeling different from the dreaded nursing home, and they object to “medicalizing” their communities. “They don’t want the liability,” said Dr. Alan Kronhaus, an internist who, with Dr. Taavoni (they are married), started a practice called Doctors Making Housecalls in 2002. The facilities also “live in mortal fear of bringing down heavy-handed federal regulation,” he said. That can happen when Medicare and Medicaid, which cover most residents’ health care, get involved. Doctors Making Housecalls provides one example of how assisted living can offer medical care. The practice dispatches 120 clinicians — 60 doctors, plus nurse-practitioners, physician assistants and social workers — to about 400 assisted living facilities in North Carolina. “We see patients often, at length and in detail, to keep them on an even keel,” Dr. Kronhaus said. By contracting with labs, imaging companies and pharmacies, the practice can provide most of the medical care for more than 8,000 residents, on site and around the clock. Working with a local emergency medical service, he and his colleagues reported in a 2017 study that the practice could reduce emergency room transfers by two-thirds. The Lott Assisted Living Residence in Manhattan, on the other hand, relies on a single geriatrician, Dr. Alec Pruchnicki, to provide medical care for most of its 127 or so residents. If they’re feeling sick, a family member calls or the resident just knocks on the door of “Dr. P’s” basement office. “Sometimes it’s just a cold — chicken soup,” Dr. Pruchnicki said. “But this winter we had a few cases of flu and pneumonia, things you need to treat.” Nearby Mount Sinai Hospital employs him and provides emergency services when needed. Often, they’re not. In 2005, Dr. Pruchnicki reported at medical conferences, he decreased hospitalizations by a third. “I can’t be in the only place in the country where this would work,” he said. Spending time in emergency rooms and hospitals often takes a toll on residents, even if their ailments can be treated. They get exposed to infections and develop delirium; they lose strength from days spent in bed. Perhaps that contributes to short stays in assisted living. Adult children often see these facilities as their parents’ final homes, but residents stay just 27 months on average, after which many move on to nursing homes. Adding doctors to assisted living could also cause problems, advocates acknowledge; in particular, it might increase the already high fees facilities charge. But something has clearly got to give. “There can be health care in assisted living without making it feel like a nursing home,” Dr. Zimmerman said. Family members tell of frightened and confused residents arriving unaccompanied at emergency rooms, unable to give clear accounts of their problems. Dr. Kronhaus recalls a resident with dementia taken to the local E.R. by ambulance; discharged, she was sent home by taxi. The address she gave the driver was her former home, where neighbors spotted her and called the police. By contrast, the North Carolina woman with a history of falls is doing well. Dr. Taavoni discovered that her hypertension medications were causing such low blood pressure that she fainted. Reducing the dose and discontinuing a diuretic, Dr. Taavoni also weaned the patient off an anti-anxiety drug she suspected was causing problems, substituting a low dose of an antidepressant instead. The falls and the related emergency room visits stopped. Doctors Making Housecalls is still caring for her, and for most of the neighbors in her assisted living facility.",The New York Times
2019,Where Will Sellers Get What They’re Asking?,"Calculator If you’re listing a home in one of these neighborhoods in Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens, you may well get more than you’re asking — or a lot less. With peak spring listing season upon us, buyers and sellers in New York City may be wondering how well homes are selling in their neighborhoods, and whether those homes are likely to go for more or less than the asking prices. It may help to look at a recent report from StreetEasy that examined selling prices across the city last year, focusing on homes in Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens that were initially listed in March, April and May of 2018 and sold by Feb. 1, 2019. (Areas where fewer than 15 homes sold were not included in the report.) The trend is not good for sellers. Overall, 70 percent of the homes listed sold for below their asking price. That’s up from 62 percent in 2017 and 61 percent in 2016. Neighborhoods with more expensive homes (like Flatiron and Battery Park City) did the worst, although desirable pockets of Brooklyn (like Fort Greene and Carroll Gardens) seemed to defy the trend. The following are the 10 areas where the greatest share of homes sold for over asking price, and the 10 where the smallest share did, along with the total percentage of homes that sold in each.

2019,Where a TV Pro Goes for Video When YouTube Just Won’t Do,"Tech We’re Using Donald Trump’s old vlog? An archive of closed captions? Liz Day, a senior story editor for The Times’s new television show, “The Weekly,” knows how to find them. How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Liz Day, a senior story editor for The Times’s new television show, “The Weekly,” discussed the tech she’s using. “The Weekly” is something new that’s coming from The Times. What should we know about it? It’s The Times’s most ambitious TV project ever: a 30-minute documentary show, premiering in June, that will air on FX on Sunday nights and then stream on Hulu. We’re taking great reporting from the Times newsroom and bringing it to TV for a new audience. You should tune in. You’ve also worked at ProPublica and “Last Week Tonight With John Oliver.” What kind of tech did you use in those workplaces? At ProPublica, we used databases like LexisNexis Public Records for people-finding, Pacer for federal court records and Factiva for news clips. Because investigative reporters are often looking for those who don’t want to be found, we’d also keep an eye out for weird sites that promised to unearth off-the-grid cellphone numbers or scrape the deep web. ProPublica has a wonderful open-source culture devoted to the public interest. Anytime they got their hands on unruly government data, the talented folks there would build an app to make access easy. Thanks to them, you can look up your doctor to see how much money he or she gets from drug companies. When I joined “Last Week Tonight,” I discovered a whole new world of video that I hadn’t known existed. Did you know there’s a database where you can search all of President Trump’s video appearances, including a vlog he kept from 2011 to 2014? Or that the wizards behind the Wayback Machine have a tool where you can search the closed captions for local, cable and network TV news from the last decade? We also used Scripto, a program for writing and producing television that Stephen Colbert helped build. What are your most important gadgets and apps for doing your job? Lame answer but definitely my iPhone. Depending on the type of person I’m communicating with, I’ll use text, Slack, WhatsApp or a regular old telephone call. On my laptop, I use Google Docs, Evernote, Scrivener, Airtable and Dropbox. We use Frame.io to share or watch cuts of episodes. More old school: giant spiral-bound notebooks. It feels soothing to write in them. But if I need to work from home after hours, I sometimes end up having to take photos of my handwritten notes. What tech do you love to use in your personal life and why? My husband has Sonos speakers set up around our apartment. It often feels as if I use them to fill every moment at home with podcasts and news. Every once in a while, I remember how nice it is to listen to music instead. For reading, I use email newsletters and Instapaper, and we share a Kindle account so we can read the same books. I use Twitter to find unusual news or stuff that makes me laugh. I fall down Instagram rabbit holes all the time. An unexpected app I still use is Foursquare. I love seeing all the spots where my husband and I went 10 years ago. I have no interest in Alexa, but we do have SmartThings, which sends your phone an alert every time your front door opens. I just got a letter that our (low-tech) building is installing a new buzzer system that has facial recognition. So I guess I will be using that soon, too! I was given Beats wireless headphones as a gift. Initially, I thought they were for teens, but now I wear them all the time for travel and sometimes even sleep in them. I almost never go to brick-and-mortar stores anymore, so I enjoy buying little treats from New York Magazine’s The Strategist. There’s always a magic skin care potion or some other fun new product that promises to improve your life for $15. What is your personal TV setup, and has it changed? I cut the cord in 2008. It was funny because at the time, my job was to analyze what people liked to watch on TV. But on principle, I resent that there’s barely any choice of cable TV providers. I spent a while infecting my laptop with God-knows-what from various Napster-esque video streaming sites. But now it’s so easy. We have Apple TV, where we subscribe to apps from Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, Showtime and HBO and then buy anything else a la carte from iTunes. Sometimes, I listen to the audio podcast version of shows like “60 Minutes” or PBS’s “Frontline.” I know that sounds like I must watch a lot of TV, but I swear I really don’t. It’s fun to follow the TV industry like sports — keeping an eye on what’s new, what’s a hit and what has bombed. You can learn a lot about the world by understanding what people watch on TV! What do you do to take a break from tech? Hot yoga. Sixty minutes in a 100-plus-degree room standing on one leg. Or nightly walks around the neighborhood with my husband. No phones and just laughs.",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | Where the Girls Aren’t,"Let’s have a statute of limitations on statues. Opinion Columnist It is possible that you didn’t know a 24-year-old black woman started the integration of the New York City mass transit system in 1854. It’s a very good story that involves some kicking and screaming, a ruined hat and a future president of the United States. And now she’s getting a statue next to Grand Central Station. About time. We’re coming to the end of Women’s History Month, and all in all, it’s been a pretty good celebration. Perhaps a little superior to the one when Donald Trump dropped in on a women’s empowerment panel and asked the assembled high achievers whether any of them had ever heard of Susan B. Anthony. So about Elizabeth Jennings, a Manhattan schoolteacher in the years before the Civil War. She was rushing to church services, where she was supposed to play the organ, when a trolley conductor told her that his car was only for white people and she’d have to get off and wait for another ride. Jennings was fearless. She grabbed onto an open window frame, screaming “Murder!” when the conductor tried to pull her off. She hung on for dear life until a police officer shoved her onto the sidewalk, soiling her going-to-church dress and smashing her bonnet. Her family hired a young lawyer, Chester Alan Arthur, to file suit against the streetcar company for discrimination. Jennings won 100 years before Rosa Parks. And several follow-up suits later, segregation in New York mass transit came to an end. Arthur, a machine politician of no remarkable talent, later became president of the United States. Jennings was forgotten. For years I’d spend Women’s History Month muttering that there ought to be a statue of her at Grand Central Station. Now it’s happening! New York is trying to do something about its wildly man-centric population of public monuments, and City Hall has commissioned five female statues, one for each borough. Shirley Chisholm, the first black woman to serve in Congress, will be greeting visitors to Prospect Park in Brooklyn. Queens gets singer Billie Holiday and the Bronx gets Dr. Helen Rodríguez Trías, a pioneer in treating families affected by H.I.V. Staten Island gets Katherine Walker. She was a tiny widow who ran a lighthouse outside the New York harbor in the early 1900s until she was 73. When the waters got bad and boats started to sink, she rowed to the rescue, saving at least 50 lives over the years. See? This is the sort of thing you learn when you get to see monuments that don’t involve generals on horseback. There needs to be a statute of limitations on statues of guys in stirrups. The nation’s nonmilitary statue population is very heavy into politicians. For instance, down on Madison Square there’s a tribute to Roscoe Conkling, a 19th-century boss who gave Chester Alan Arthur his big career break running the deeply corrupt port of New York. Meanwhile we’re still working on Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton. Could be worse. Georgia’s legislature has been busy voting to make it virtually impossible to remove any existing statue from a public place. It’s intended to protect statues of generals who are on horses and wearing Confederate uniforms. On the plus side, Tennessee is working on a Woman Suffrage Heritage Trail, which celebrates its role as the critical 36th state to ratify the 19th Amendment. That was a very dramatic moment. The House was one vote short of passage. Then 24-year-old Harry Burn — who had always been seen as a “no” — switched sides at the final second. He later said he had gotten a letter from his mother urging him to change his mind and “I know that a mother’s advice is always safest for her boy to follow.” Now there’s a new statue of Burn in Knoxville. He’s sitting down while his mother, Febb, stands behind him with a hand on his shoulder. She’s probably saying, “Harry, shape up.” Besides all the famous heroines we need to honor, it’d be nice to see tributes to some of the more obscure yet exciting figures. I’ve always yearned for a monument to the Woman Who Burned Down Manhattan. In 1776, the British troops were hot on the trail of George Washington, hoping for a quick end to the Colonial rebellion, when their path was blocked by a sudden blaze that broke out in Manhattan. Back in England, a frustrated Edmund Burke told the House of Commons it was all the fault of “one miserable woman” who had been found in a cellar, covered with soot and proudly declaring that she was the one who did the deed. She was apparently executed for her heroics. Never did get her name. Historian Linda Kerber, who first brought Burke’s remarks to attention, says she hasn’t been able to find any details. Kerber, however, had another nominee on the Revolutionary War front — Deborah Sampson of Massachusetts, who disguised herself as a man so she could fight the British. Sampson was a scout and a fierce fighter. To stay in combat and keep her secret, she dug a pellet out of her leg when she was wounded rather than let a doctor check her out. There’s a statue of Sampson in Massachusetts, but nothing really spectacular. If only she’d had a really impressive horse. The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

2019,Where to Have Your Existential Crisis: Ann Arbor or Rome?,"Fiction When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. THE PROMISE OF ELSEWHERE By Brad Leithauser In the opening pages of Brad Leithauser’s latest novel, a butterfly lands on young Louie Hake’s knee. This is a flashback to his childhood; 43-year-old Louie, the Louie who occupies the rest of this weirdly engaging book, has just landed in Rome, the first stop on an odyssey that will be “the trip of his life, or even — for Louie embraces an idiom of elevation — the Journey of His Life.” But the memory of that butterfly haunts him as he recalls how he sat with his father in Fallen Hills, a nondescript suburb of Detroit, and was visited by this almost otherworldly creature, weightless yet surprisingly large, alien and aristocratic: “The duplicated, mirroring mosaics of its jeweled wings are an animate astonishment.” Sure enough, Louie’s personal butterfly effect brings chaos to his life, for he has glimpsed “perfection,” those emphatic italics witness to the significance of the moment. Perfection has otherwise eluded him, to say the least. He’s stuck teaching art history at a crappy liberal arts college in Ann Arbor. The fact that people assume he must teach at the University of Michigan only makes matters worse. His wife — his second wife, actually — has left him, and is blissfully ensconced in the Virgin Islands with her lover, Daryl. Ten years before, he had been diagnosed as bipolar; now, to cap it all off, he has learned that he is suffering from a degenerative eye disease and is slowly, inexorably, losing his vision. An epic trip to Europe is a way to reclaim his life. It would be fair to ask, at this point, whether the world needs another novel about a middle-aged academic suffering from an existential crisis; also fair to inquire whether the tale of the American abroad hasn’t been done to death. Leithauser uses a restricted third-person narrative to create the claustrophobic room of Louie’s sensibility; yet the trick allows for the notion that another sensibility might be available, giving the book a nice leavening of irony. Louie is an unlikely world traveler, with his dislike of the “aggressive little ruses and booby traps” of European menus; by the end of the novel, little has changed in that regard, and a tuna sandwich remains his ideal of culinary bliss. What Leithauser permits us to see of Louie’s observations of Rome and then London veers toward cliché: an outrageously charming Italian bartender, English breakfasts that ensure “you can feel your arteries clogging while you dine.” But there is, somehow, a tension to all this, a knowingness, that keeps the pages turning. In the final third of the book, the reader’s pilgrimage is rewarded when Louie ends up — to his own astonishment — in Leithauser’s version of Greenland. The author’s admirers will know that he has ventured north before, most notably in his 1997 novel “The Friends of Freeland,” set in an imaginary nation between Greenland and Iceland. In an author’s note, Leithauser warns that the Greenland found in this book is “a few removes from real,” and it’s all the better for it. Hake settles in with a grumpy Dane who runs a hotel, hardly worthy of the name, called the Rotten Egg. Meals are served by the Dane’s spectral children, who recall — to Louie and to us — the malevolent bairns in “The Turn of the Screw.” Here Leithauser’s prose becomes giddy and lustrous: from his descriptions of the microscopic diamonds Louie perceives in his toothpaste to the disturbing erotic drawings he finds hidden in the pages of a book and finally, soaringly, to the miraculous blues and whites of the landscape of ice that surrounds him. “The Promise of Elsewhere” uses the ordinary as a prism, splitting the tropes with which it plays into a surprising spectrum of colors. I wasn’t sure, at the outset, how much time I’d want to spend with Louie. In the end, I was glad I went along for the ride.",The New York Times
2019,"Opinion | Where’s Your Climate Plan, Mr. McConnell?","The Senate Republican leader staged a sham vote on a Democratic climate change resolution, embarrassing only himself. Ms. Cottle is a member of the editorial board. For those wondering if it was still possible for the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, to raise his cynicism game, Tuesday’s show vote on the Green New Deal supplied a resounding “yes.” Of all the pressing business Mr. McConnell could be tackling, he devoted precious floor time to the resolution introduced last month by the Democrats Ed Markey, the junior senator from Massachusetts, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a House freshman from New York. A grand reimagining of America’s environmental and economic landscape, the Green New Deal is not a policy proposal. It is a statement of values — a nonbinding resolution that even its champions do not expect to become law. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez has called it “a vision document.” Which is precisely why Mr. McConnell couldn’t resist it. The Senate majority leader, like so much of his party, has zero interest in climate change — or rather, he has no interest in pursuing policies to address what many regard as the defining crisis of our time. Mr. McConnell is, however, passionate about making life politically awkward for the opposition. With their base voters fired up about climate change, dozens of Democratic lawmakers have embraced the Green New Deal, including at least half a dozen 2020 presidential contenders. Even so, the resolution’s sweeping ambitions — built around a huge infrastructure investment and a shift to carbon-free energy — strike more than a few Democrats, especially moderates, as unrealistic and politically perilous. Republicans have been quick to mock the proposal, claiming that Democrats are poised to outlaw everything from cars to cows to airplanes. Mr. McConnell has been particularly vicious, slamming it as a “destructive socialist daydream.” Mr. McConnell sought to raise the stakes on Tuesday by forcing Democrats to cast a vote on the controversial measure —  exacerbating intraparty tensions in the process. The ploy fell flat. Most Democrats agreed ahead of time to go with a noncommittal vote of “present,” thus denying Mr. McConnell his desired drama and any meaningful vote count. Republicans are sure to continue harping on the Green New Deal as a way to paint Democrats as out-of-touch extremists. As Senator James Inhofe, a proud climate-change denier from Oklahoma, crowed, “It’s the gift that keeps on giving.” While Mr. Inhofe and President Trump may not believe in climate change, a growing majority of Americans care about it a great deal. In its latest survey, conducted in December, the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication found that just shy of 60 percent of Americans are either “alarmed” or “concerned” about the issue, with the number of those “alarmed” — 29 percent — having doubled since 2013 and risen eight points in just the past year. The numbers of “dismissive” and “doubtful” respondents have sunk to 9 percent each. Outside the bubble of the Republican base, Mr. McConnell’s political stunt may strike many people as shameless, coming as it did as the Midwest was being swallowed up by floodwaters. While the role that climate change plays in any particular natural disaster is complicated, there is widespread scientific agreement that the phenomenon is fueling a pattern of ever more extreme weather, from historic floods to hurricanes to droughts. The Green New Deal is by no means a fully baked proposal for combating climate change. But for all its flaws, it is a more promising first step than the Republican leaders’ chosen strategy of inaction and sneering denial.

2019,Where’s the Mueller Report? Washington Barely Handled the Anticipation,"WASHINGTON — The president’s lawyer had no clue when the report might arrive, or if it even would. Seated alone amid the tourists at the Trump International Hotel a few blocks from the White House on Friday, Rudolph W. Giuliani scrolled through a tablet with one hand and held a cellphone in the other as he waited for the news that the long-awaited report by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia, was done and had finally been delivered to the Justice Department. “Keep in touch,” he said to the person on the other end of the phone. “Tell me what’s going on, O.K.?” Like the rest of Washington, Mr. Giuliani was tired of waiting. “They said it was going to be at noon or 12:30,” Mr. Giuliani told a reporter who approached him around half-past 1 p.m. According to his sources — according to everyone’s sources — Mr. Mueller was late to deliver on a report that has enthralled the capital, bedeviled the president and, at times, enticed the nation. As the hours ticked by, it seemed as if the report might never come. But at some point during the afternoon, unbeknown to the curious public and TV camera crews, a security officer from the special counsel’s office arrived at the Justice Department to deliver the report to Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general. Within minutes, it was in the hands of William P. Barr, the attorney general. At 4:05 p.m., a thunderclap rumbled around the capital, and hail began to fall. Fifty-five minutes later the skies cleared, and it was announced that Mr. Barr had finally received the report. And by the time Mr. Barr was sitting in his office on the fifth floor of the Justice Department on Friday night, reading the report — he was among a few people, including Mr. Rosenstein, who had access to it — Mr. Giuliani, who had been in the dark for much of the day, had changed his tone. “We are confident the attorney general will make the right decision,” Mr. Giuliani said in a statement. “He has to consider the legal matters and rules. I’m confident he’ll make the right call.” [The special counsel has submitted his full report on Mr. Trump and Russia to the attorney general, who now must decide how much of it to release.] The assurance of the report’s delivery was the capstone to a day marked by just how little anyone really knew. Beginning in the early morning, reporters and photographers clustered around the office building just blocks south of the National Mall where the special counsel has offices. At least a half-dozen news cameras positioned themselves outside the building’s garage, hoping to catch a glimpse of Mr. Mueller driving his sensible Subaru into a colorless, bureaucratic-looking complex. “I have the report in my purse!” one woman joked as she walked by. At one point, as two of Mr. Mueller’s investigators left for lunch, they noticed the cluster of cameras and quickly turned to cross the street. By 2 p.m., an increasingly impatient group wanted a sign of something — anything — that could hint at Mueller-related activity a mile away at the Justice Department’s headquarters. Cameras flashed when two lead prosecutors investigating Mr. Trump for obstruction of justice — James L. Quarles III and Andrew D. Goldstein — left together in a BMW sedan headed in that direction. Rumors that had hatched about a noon report arrival were scuttled once Mr. Barr grabbed lunch in the department’s subterranean cafeteria. [Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter.] Outside, a lone protester got in on the action. The man, who would identify himself only as “T. Pardy,” told a reporter that the special counsel investigation was “the fruit of the poison tree.” He then began to bang on a five-gallon bucket, screaming “FISA abuse.” Not everyone took such a theatrical approach to the wait. Newt Gingrich, an occasional adviser to the president who as the House speaker vigorously defended the work of Ken Starr, the independent counsel who investigated President Bill Clinton, said that he had taken a laid-back approach to the report’s arrival. Mr. Gingrich said in an interview that the public should get the chance to see Mr. Mueller’s report once it was in Mr. Barr’s hands — with “obvious exceptions,” he added. Here are some pieces of the jigsaw puzzle. The full picture is missing. “First of all, it may be interesting,” Mr. Gingrich said. “Second of all, it may actually tell us something.” A low-key approach was similarly adopted at the White House, starting with the president. “I have no idea about the Mueller report,” Mr. Trump told a cluster of journalists in the morning before boarding Marine One and departing for Mar-a-Lago, his winter retreat in Florida. As the day drew on, observers on Twitter began placing their bets about the report’s whereabouts, creating fictional explanations about Mr. Mueller’s activities. “Robert Mueller sweating in front of his laptop, staring at a Word doc containing only the words ‘The Mueller Report’ and a blinking cursor,” the comedian Patrick Monahan wrote on Twitter, trying his hand at fan fiction. At that point, not even Peter Carr, Mr. Mueller’s famously tight-lipped spokesman, could seem to resist the fun people were having. “Ha,” Mr. Carr wrote in response to an NBC reporter who sent along Mr. Monahan’s tweet. Back at the White House, a cluster of aides who remained in the West Wing area accessible to journalists turned off the television. They seemed more concerned with a flooding issue that had emerged from Thursday’s rains than the contents of the report, or when it might come. When it finally did come, the White House, which has led Trump supporters in a “witch hunt” chant at various points over the years, struck a relatively formal tone. “The next steps are up to Attorney General Barr, and we look forward to the process taking its course,” Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the press secretary, said on Twitter. “The White House has not received or been briefed on the Special Counsel’s report.” But there was one indicator that Mr. Mueller’s report was at least somewhere near the back of the president’s mind: Emmet T. Flood, a lawyer for the president in the special counsel investigation, accompanied him to Palm Beach. After top Justice Department officials in Washington looked through the report, Mr. Barr’s chief of staff, Brian Rabbitt, called Mr. Flood just after 4:30 p.m. to let him know that the department had the report, and gave Mr. Flood a readout of the letter that would be delivered to Congress. The letter contained important details, including the fact that Mr. Barr’s summary of Mr. Mueller’s key findings could be sent to members of Congress as early as this weekend. The letter also said that there were no instances when Mr. Rosenstein; Matthew P. Whitaker, the former acting attorney general; or Mr. Barr told Mr. Mueller that he could not pursue an investigative action. Back at the Trump International Hotel, the speculation began. As she tucked herself into a booth, Kirstjen Nielsen, the secretary of homeland security, told a reporter that she had no idea when the report would come out before an aide shut down the conversation. At the bar, a pair of state prosecutors in town from Florida were enjoying a glass of wine and watching coverage of the Mueller report on two large televisions — one tuned to CNN, the other to Fox News. “I’ve stopped being surprised at the allegations,” one of them, Bill Beaver, said, adding that he wanted to see what the report actually contained before making a judgment. “We base our jobs in facts.”",The New York Times
2019,Which Cities in California Have the Most Young People?,"California Today Good morning. (Here’s the sign-up, if you don’t already get California Today by email.) Demographic statistics about populations can’t explain everything about why our communities are the way they are: What motivates someone to move to a new city, or to start a family or not, differs from one person to the next. But they’re helpful for spotting trends and exploring larger economic forces. I recently talked with Tina Daley, the head of demographic research for the state’s Department of Finance, about the trends she’s keeping an eye on and what we can learn from them. She said her office had been looking at migration and housing affordability. One data point that jumped out was which cities had the biggest shares of young people. Here are the top cities for residents ages 25 to 34, according to 2017 data from the American Community Survey and compiled by Ms. Daley’s team: 1. Mountain View, with 24.4 percent of its 81,443 residents ages 25 to 34. 2. San Francisco, with 23.5 percent of its 884,363 residents 3. Sunnyvale, with 22.5 percent of its 153,656 residents 4. Costa Mesa, with 21 percent of its 113,821 residents 5. Santa Clara, with 20.7 percent of its 127,131 residents Notice a trend? They’re all on or near the coast. And with the exception of Costa Mesa, which is just inland from Newport Beach, they’re all in the Bay Area, where Ms. Daley said young, highly educated workers were moving, often from other high-cost metro areas like New York. “The people who can afford it are still moving there,” she said. That might not surprise anyone who’s ever heard about wealthy millennials making San Francisco their playground. But what Ms. Daley found more interesting was how different the list was when she looked at cities with the biggest shares of residents under 40. Here’s that ranking: 1. Perris, with 69.9 percent of its 77,895 residents 2. Madera, with 68 percent of its 65,506 residents 3. Lake Elsinore, with 67.6 percent of its 66,412 residents 4. Lynwood, with 66.1 percent of its 71,115 residents 5. Davis, with 65.8 percent of its 68,985 residents These are all inland communities with less expensive housing. Why the contrast? Ms. Daley said it’s because “under 40,” includes children. This, she said, signals that families are seeking out places where they can afford to live. Right now, that’s translating into long commutes for parents who may live in faraway inland suburbs but work in the expensive coastal cities, though Ms. Daley noted things like telecommuting are on the rise. “People are becoming more flexible,” she said. And while she didn’t want to speculate about how those kinds of changes will shape where Californians work and live in the future, she said it was an exciting challenge. “There are these new issues,” she said. “So how do we get the data to figure out what’s going on?” Do you have questions about California’s demographics?

2019,Which Spring Trends to Try First?,"Browsing The most fun ones, of course. Everyone knows that the weather and the Gregorian calendar don’t always communicate. Still, that shouldn’t stop us from getting excited about the official beginning of spring. Even if the vernal equinox doesn’t instantly usher in warmer weather, the ceremonial end of winter is a decent excuse to prep your spring wardrobe. To start, focus on a few key trends for the season, specifically the more playful ones below. Whether it’s grown-up tie-dye or oversize barrettes, there is nothing austere here. And that’s the point. Where didn’t we see tie-dye during the spring shows? It popped up at Calvin Klein, Prada and Dior and dominated at Stella McCartney. Take a cue from the runways and forgo the familiar tie-dyed tee in favor of a more unexpected psychedelic print — on ladylike mules, say, or on a top-handle bag. From left: 3.1 Phillip Lim cargo shorts, $295 at ssense.com; Anna Kosturova silk maxi-dress, $525 at mytheresa.com; Prada patent leather mules, $850 at bergdorfgoodman.com; Amélie Pichard leather bag, $610 at thewebster.us. Bike shorts have been a thing for a while now, but for spring 2019 even Chanel is on board. Steal the Chanel styling trick and offset a classic black pair (or even a more high-voltage option, like a snakeskin print) with a demure boxy blazer.

2019,Opinion | While You Wait for Mueller,"Do lawbreaking, lying to the public and colluding with a foreign enemy add up to innocence? Opinion Columnist This article is part of David Leonhardt’s newsletter. You can sign up here to receive it each weekday. Yes, I know you’ve heard this before, but many observers think it’s finally true: The Mueller report seems to be coming soon. I want to step back this morning and review what Robert’s Mueller investigation (and others) have already uncovered. The brief version: So far, there is no clear evidence that the Trump campaign and Russian officials worked together to coordinate campaign strategy. Trump and his defenders have tried to conflate this with innocence. The president’s mantra is “No collusion.” [Listen to “The Argument” podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.] But that’s both wrong and a brazen lowering of the bar for presidential behavior. Even without any further findings, the Mueller investigation shows that Trump has repeatedly violated his oath of office by lying to the American people, breaking the law, putting his personal interests above the country’s and secretly working with a hostile foreign country. The details: Russia interfered in the 2016 election to help Trump. Russian officials hacked the emails of Democratic officials and created a social media campaign designed to hurt Hillary Clinton and help Trump. Trump campaign officials knew of these foreign efforts and encouraged them. The president’s son did so. As did George Papadopoulos, a campaign adviser. And Trump himself publicly urged Russia to hack Clinton’s emails — on the same day Russian hackers tried to breach her private server for the first time. Trump campaign officials attempted to conceal contacts they had with Russians and other foreign officials. Trump and his associates repeatedly lied to the public and to investigators about their more than 100 contacts — including meetings, phone calls and emails — with Russians during the campaign. Among the examples: Michael Flynn, a campaign aide who became Trump’s national security adviser, lied about phone calls he had with the Russian ambassador to the United States. Campaign officials knew in advance about the WikiLeaks email dumps. Before WikiLeaks released stolen Democratic emails, Roger Stone, a longtime Trump associate, told campaign officials it would happen. Trump was secretly pursuing a business venture in Russia and lied about it. During most of the 2016 campaign, Trump associates worked to build a Trump Tower in Moscow, while publicly denying any such business relationship. Trump’s former lawyer, Michael Cohen, lied to Congress about the talks and was sentenced to three years in prison. Trump directed a subordinate to break the law. During the campaign, Trump directed Cohen to pay hush money to women who claimed to have had affairs with Trump. The secret payments violated campaign finance laws. Trump’s campaign was run by criminals. The Mueller investigation has also uncovered separate financial crimes committed by top campaign officials. Both Paul Manafort, the campaign chairman, and Rick Gates, a Manafort protégé, have been indicted on conspiracy and fraud. Others tied to the campaign, including Papadopoulos, have also received prison sentences. For more: In a Times Op-Ed, James Comey, the former F.B.I. director, writes that he hopes the Mueller report shows that Trump did not hinder the investigation. My newsroom colleagues Larry Buchanan and Karen Yourish have put together a helpful guide to the people implicated in the investigation. FiveThirtyEight’s Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux and Perry Bacon Jr. note that Mueller’s court filings so far amount to a kind of public report. Neal Katyal, a legal expert, has also put together a helpful Twitter thread on the subject. “Don’t focus on the one-line spin. Focus on the facts, judgments, and limitations in the Mueller Report,” he writes. The legal scholar Joyce White Vance notes that the end of the Mueller investigation doesn’t necessarily mean the end of Trump’s legal issues. “Mueller appears to have stayed carefully within his lane, sending cases that strayed from his core mission to US attorneys & DOJ divisions,” she tweeted. “These career prosecutors will work their investigations to a conclusion, even after Mueller closes shop.” And Aaron Blake of The Washington Post outlines what could happen to Mueller’s report once the attorney general has it.

2019,"Whitaker ‘Did Not Deny’ Discussing Cohen Case With Trump, a Top Democrat Says","WASHINGTON — The former acting attorney general Matthew G. Whitaker “did not deny” in a private meeting with House lawmakers on Wednesday that he had spoken to President Trump about an investigation in New York that had ensnared the president and his business, the Democratic chairman of the House Judiciary Committee said. Speaking after the meeting, the chairman, Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, presented Mr. Whitaker’s comments as being at odds with his public testimony last month before the Judiciary Committee. In that hearing, Mr. Whitaker generally would not say if he had communicated with the president about the case, which led to charges against Michael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump’s former personal lawyer and fixer. Mr. Whitaker at the time denied a CNN report that Mr. Trump had yelled at him about the case after Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty to federal campaign finance charges that implicated Mr. Trump. A report by The New York Times after the February hearing recounted another call between the two men about the case in which Mr. Trump asked about the possibility of putting the United States attorney whom the president had appointed in charge of it. “Unlike in the hearing room, Mr. Whitaker did not deny that the president called him to discuss the Michael Cohen case and personnel decisions in the Southern District” of New York, Mr. Nadler told reporters. Democrats are intensely interested in whether the president tried to push Mr. Whitaker, a Trump loyalist, to influence the investigation during his brief tenure. Mr. Nadler called the follow-up interview to clarify portions of Mr. Whitaker’s public testimony. But Mr. Whitaker’s remarks on Wednesday about his conversations with Mr. Trump about the case appear to have been just as ambiguous and at times contradictory. Republicans in Congress and a Justice Department official in the room, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss a private interview, offered alternate characterizations of what was said. “To imply that there’s anything nefarious there is a way overreach of anything that was discussed,” Representative Doug Collins of Georgia, the top Republican on the panel, told reporters afterward. Mr. Nadler said he would have to “analyze the new revelations and see where they lead.” The Justice Department official and Republican aides to Mr. Collins said that at at least one point Mr. Whitaker told the lawmakers that he did not remember a conversation with the president like the one CNN had described. At another point, he said that he could not discuss his conversations with Mr. Trump. They also said that Mr. Whitaker told the lawmakers that the White House had never ordered him to undo the recusal of Geoffrey S. Berman, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York whom the president had appointed but who was not involved in the Cohen campaign finance case. The Times, though, reported last month that on a call late last year, Mr. Trump asked Mr. Whitaker whether Mr. Berman could be put in charge of the growing campaign finance case — not that he had issued a direction. CNN’s report in December said that Mr. Trump had yelled at Mr. Whitaker after two developments in the Cohen case: Mr. Cohen’s decision to plead guilty to lying about the Trump Organization’s work on a real estate project in Moscow and the identification of the president as Individual-1 in related plea papers. The Times also reported that Mr. Whitaker told Justice Department associates that part of his job as acting attorney general was to “jump on a grenade” for Mr. Trump. He also told associates that the New York prosecutors needed “adult supervision.” Portions of Mr. Whitaker’s private remarks on Wednesday appeared to expand on those statements. Democratic and Republican aides both said that Mr. Whitaker told them he had discussions as acting attorney general with fellow Justice Department officials about the “scope” of Mr. Berman’s recusal from cases, the legal theory behind the campaign finance case and whether to fire one or more United States attorneys. Specifically, Mr. Nadler said, Mr. Whitaker said he had discussed “whether the Southern District went too far in pursuing the campaign finance case in which the president was listed as Individual No. 1.” In the meeting, Democratic and Republican aides said, Mr. Whitaker cited the failed prosecution in a campaign finance case brought against John Edwards, the former Democratic senator, and said that he told staff members he believed certain claims in the case were “specious.” Mr. Whitaker’s brief tenure atop the Justice Department was plagued by criticism from Democrats who questioned his qualifications and his decision not to recuse himself from overseeing the Russia investigation despite department ethics officials’ recommendation that he do so based on his past public criticisms of the case. The interview was not transcribed, though aides for Mr. Nadler, Mr. Collins and Justice Department officials present took notes. Democratic aides accused Republicans of selectively representing Mr. Whitaker’s answers about his conversations with Mr. Trump. They did not dispute that Mr. Whitaker had at points said he did not remember or could not comment on the conversations. But near the end of the meeting, the Democratic aides said, Mr. Collins asked Mr. Whitaker if it was correct that he had not spoken to Mr. Trump about the Cohen case. At that point, Mr. Whitaker said that had not, in fact, been his testimony.",The New York Times

2019,White Farmers Are Jailed in South Africa for Killing Black Teenager,"JOHANNESBURG — Two white South African farmers were sentenced to a combined 41 years in prison on Wednesday for killing a black teenager whom they had accused of stealing sunflowers, bringing to a close a case that had inflamed tensions in a rural town and exposed the nation’s enduring racial divisions. During a hearing at the High Court in Mahikeng that was packed with black and white South Africans, Judge Ronald Hendricks described the actions of the farmers, who were convicted of throwing the 15-year-old boy off a moving truck in April 2017, as “disgraceful” and “appalling.” The boy, Matlhomola Mosweu, died after breaking his neck. His death set off riots in the town of Coligny, about 125 miles west of Johannesburg. The two farmers — Pieter Doorewaard, 28, and Phillip Schutte, 35 — were found guilty of murder, kidnapping and other charges. Mr. Doorewaard was sentenced to 18 years in prison, and Mr. Schutte to 23 years. They had claimed that after they caught Mr. Mosweu stealing, they put him on the truck to take him to a police station. But the teenager, they said, then jumped off the vehicle. The judge ruled that the killing had not been planned or premeditated, but had “happened on the spur of the moment.” He added, “The community of Coligny was terrorized by this.” The killing prompted days of rioting and looting in the farming town, especially against white-owned businesses. As in all of South Africa, one of the world’s most unequal societies, racial tensions had simmered just below the surface in Coligny, where farms and other businesses are still largely owned by whites and other individuals who are not black South Africans. Most black residents, who depend on white-owned farms for work, live in a nearby township. Mr. Mosweu had lived in a shantytown for newer arrivals, called Scotland informal settlement. The courtroom was filled with members of the Economic Freedom Fighters, an opposition party that has long pushed for the expropriation of white-owned land without compensation. Pressure from the party, a spinoff of the governing African National Congress, has compelled the A.N.C. to adopt a similar position under President Cyril Ramaphosa. Tensions between white farmers and black residents have grown across the country since the A.N.C. adopted the policy in December 2017. Mr. Ramaphosa has tried to assuage fears in and outside South Africa that the policy would not lead to violence or economic turmoil, but most investors are taking a wait-and-see attitude before national elections in May. Lobby groups for white farmers have accused the South African authorities of covering up what they say is the widespread, racially motivated killings of white farmers. While there is no evidence to support their claims, some have visited the United States to win support for their cause. Right-wing groups and news outlets in the United States have fanned reports that such killings, and even genocide, are being perpetrated against white South Africans. Last August, President Trump, apparently reacting to a report on Fox News, said on Twitter that he was directing his secretary of state to look into what he described as the targeting of white farmers for land grabs and “large-scale killing” in South Africa.",The New York Times
2019,White House Ambitions Cloud Democratic Hopes to Win the Senate,"WASHINGTON — Democratic leaders are convinced that Steve Bullock, the popular governor of Montana, would give the party its best shot at unseating Senator Steve Daines, a freshman Republican, when he stands for re-election next year in a state that President Trump carried by 20 points. But Mr. Bullock has a bigger — if far less attainable — aspiration: running for president. And so it has gone for Democratic leaders as they struggle to recruit a solid slate of candidates that they will need to net the three or four seats necessary to take control of the Senate next year. Four top-tier potential Democratic Senate candidates — John Hickenlooper in Colorado, Stacey Abrams in Georgia, Beto O’Rourke in Texas and Mr. Bullock — are seriously exploring presidential campaigns, forsaking statewide campaigns within their grasp, at least for now, for a national one that would be the longest of long shots. A fifth potential recruit, Richard Ojeda, resigned his State Senate seat in West Virginia to run for president, only to withdraw last month — without committing to challenge Senator Shelley Moore Capito. “This isn’t a bad map like 2018 because we have very few seats to defend,” said Guy Cecil, the former executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. “But the opportunities to pick up seats are limited, and we need the best candidates possible to win the majority. It’s critical that some of the long shots in the presidential primary consider the Senate this year.” Party leaders, guided by Senator Chuck Schumer and Senator Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada, the committee chairwoman, believe they need to nail down Mr. Bullock, and top recruits like him, if they have any chance of riding an anti-Trump wave to Senate control. But it hasn’t been easy. The Democratic Party’s bench is shallow in states that have been dominated by Republicans, like Georgia, Montana, North Carolina and Texas. It is rare for the party to have first-class candidates in such states, let alone talents like Ms. Abrams, Mr. Bullock and Mr. O’Rourke. And getting them to stay at home has proved nearly impossible. Mr. Bullock has told people around him that he has absolutely no intention of running for anything other than the White House, and is concerned about the strain on his family. His wife, Lisa Downs Bullock, a mathematician by training and mother of three, has told friends that she would relocate to Washington only if they were moving into 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, according to two people familiar with their plans. “He’s got the skills to be a really good president,” said Senator Jon Tester, Democrat of Montana — sticking his buzz cut head out of a Senate elevator last week to make one final point. “But, you know, I think he’s got the skills to be a really good senator, too.” It is still early — Mr. Schumer, the Democratic leader, told Mr. Bullock last month, “you can always change your mind” if presidential aspirations do not pan out, according to aides briefed on the exchange. There is plenty of precedent for that. Successful Senate candidates have announced their intention to run as late as the summer before an election. Marco Rubio retired from the Senate to run for president in 2016, left retirement after that campaign fizzled and easily won re-election that fall. But for the coming Senate campaign, few years have been as unpredictable as 2020. The possibilities for Democrats range from a one-seat loss to a six-seat gain, according to pollsters and consultants working on races. That the Democrats are hosting the most crowded presidential casting call in a generation is not helping. The latest new wild card: Ms. Abrams, believed to have been considering a second run for governor of Georgia, is seriously examining a Senate or presidential campaign. She will make an announcement by mid-April, according to a person with direct knowledge of her planning. Revulsion toward Mr. Trump among the Democratic base led to a flood of House candidates last year, putting in play Republican House seats that Democrats had not sought in years. The same rage has produced 15 declared presidential candidates for 2020 so far. But that flood has yet to materialize in Senate races, which many recruits consider costly, exhausting and unglamorous. Mr. Schumer and Ms. Cortez Masto have had some victories. Mark Kelly, a retired astronaut who is married to former Representative Gabrielle Giffords, is challenging Senator Martha McSally, Republican of Arizona, who was appointed to the seat vacated after the death of John McCain. Mr. Schumer is confident that he will have a strong recruit to challenge Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, who has been hugely popular in her state but is facing headwinds in a more partisan political environment. But they have had some failures. This week, Mr. O’Rourke let it be known that he would not challenge Senator John Cornyn next year in Texas, shrugging off Mr. Schumer’s dogged recruitment efforts. Public polling in recent days has indicated that Mr. O’Rourke was tied with Mr. Cornyn after his surprisingly narrow loss to Senator Ted Cruz in November. Internal polling by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee painted a less rosy picture, but Mr. Schumer went all out in pursuit of Mr. O’Rourke, even dispatching a close ally, Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, to El Paso. Ms. Weingarten had a long conversation with Mr. O’Rourke and his wife about the seat, but the couple pretty much ruled out a Senate candidacy, according to people briefed on the exchange. In North Carolina, Democratic leaders have thus far been unable to sell a Senate run to the state’s attorney general, Josh Stein, who is Mr. Schumer’s top pick to challenge the incumbent, Senator Thom Tillis, a freshman. Mr. Stein would have the fund-raising prowess to compete in a race where expenditures by the candidates are likely to exceed $100 million. Mr. Hickenlooper, a former two-term Colorado governor with a centrist bent, would seem perfect to challenge Senator Cory Gardner, who might be the most endangered Republican up for re-election next year, in a state that voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016 and for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012. But Mr. Hickenlooper, who is expected to announce his decision on a presidential run next week in Denver, has already turned down repeated entreaties by the Schumer and Cortez Masto team. Likewise, Mr. Tester and other high-profile Democrats of Montana, including Jim Messina, Mr. Obama’s 2012 campaign manager, have been prodding Mr. Bullock to reconsider. But the Senate is a tough sell for governors, who find it hard to go from running states to running legislative errands as freshmen, and it is an even tougher sell for Westerners who would have to endure long round-trip flights to Washington. Operatives close to Mr. Schumer and Ms. Cortez Masto view Mr. Hickenlooper as a soft “no” — in part because of Mr. Gardner’s vulnerability. That is exceeded only by Senator Doug Jones, the Democrat who triumphed in a special election in Alabama only after his opponent, Roy S. Moore, was accused of sexually assaulting teenage girls, according to recent polling. But Mr. Schumer has made it clear, through intermediaries, that Mr. Hickenlooper has less time to tarry than Mr. Bullock does. Two potentially well-funded candidates, Mike Johnston, a former state senator, and Andrew Romanoff, the former speaker of the Colorado House, have already entered the race, and others may soon follow. Ms. Cortez Masto and Mr. Schumer have adopted a tag-team approach. Ms. Cortez Masto patiently hears out potential candidates’ complaints and concerns, while Mr. Schumer hammers away at the fundamental political reality — namely, that each recruit has a much better chance of being elected to the Senate than the presidency. Mr. Schumer, forever tie-deep in party fund-raising, has become especially active this year. He has made it something of a personal project to persuade Ms. Abrams, who lost a bitter governor’s race last year, to challenge Senator David Perdue in his first re-election campaign. Mr. Schumer recruited Ms. Abrams to deliver a well-received rebuttal last month to Mr. Trump’s State of the Union address. The event demonstrated Ms. Abrams’s ease in front of a national audience, but also her political savvy: Her team placed the audience a few feet farther away than at most similar speeches, so that potential critics could not focus on the facial expressions of the crowd behind her. While Mr. Schumer’s appeals to Ms. Abrams have been more frequent, his partner’s one meeting with Ms. Abrams may have had a bigger effect. Ms. Cortez Masto spoke passionately about what it was like to be the first Hispanic woman elected to the Senate, which made a big impression on Ms. Abrams, according to a person close to her.",The New York Times
2019,White House Blames Fed for Slowing Economic Growth,"President Trump and his top economic adviser criticized the Federal Reserve’s recent interest rate increases again on Friday, blaming the central bank for hindering economic growth while denying any suggestion of a looming slowdown. Just one day after the Commerce Department said the economy slowed more sharply at the end of last year than previously reported, Mr. Trump blamed the Fed for “mistakenly” raising rates last year. “Had the Fed not mistakenly raised interest rates, especially since there is very little inflation, and had they not done the ridiculously timed quantitative tightening,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter on Friday, “the 3.0% GDP, & Stock Market, would have both been much higher & World Markets would be in a better place!” Larry Kudlow, the director of the White House’s National Economic Council, told CNBC on Friday that Mr. Trump would like to see the Fed cut rates by half a percentage point. “This is our view. This is his view. This is my view,” Mr. Kudlow said. Mr. Trump has made no secret of his disdain for the Fed’s recent interest rate increases and its effort to slim down its massive portfolio of government-backed securities. Mr. Trump has blamed the Fed for slowing economic growth and has criticized his handpicked Fed chairman, Jerome H. Powell. After the Fed raised rates in December, Mr. Trump complained to aides that Mr. Powell was going to “turn me into Hoover,” a reference to the man who was president in the early years of the Great Depression. After raising rates for five consecutive quarters, the Fed abruptly changed course this year and said earlier this month that it foresees no additional increases in 2019. Mr. Powell said last week that the Fed would leave interest rates unchanged, as signs of economic weakness in the United States and abroad warrant a more “patient” approach. He also said that the Fed planned to stop winnowing its portfolio of government bonds, which it amassed in the wake of the financial crisis as it tried to prop up the economy. The Fed will end its efforts to shrink that portfolio, known as quantitative tightening, later this year. The Fed, along with many outside economists, sees economic growth slowing in 2019 as the effects of Mr. Trump’s tax cuts fade and as his trade war and weaker growth in Europe and in China contribute to a slowdown. Mr. Powell told reporters earlier this month that, depending on how economic data played out, the Fed’s next move could just as easily be a rate cut as a rate increase. On Thursday, the Commerce Department revised its growth estimates for 2018, saying the economy — as measured from the fourth quarter of 2017 to the fourth quarter of 2018 — stands at 3.0 percent, down a bit from the initially reported 3.1 percent. That is still enough to allow Mr. Trump to claim to have achieved the first year of 3 percent growth since 2005. Mr. Trump has insisted that economic growth will continue at a rapid clip, but he has also begun to blame the Fed for any slowdown that might occur. In an interview with Fox Business Network last Friday, Mr. Trump said that the economy would have grown by at least 4 percent “if we didn’t have somebody that would raise interest rates and do quantitative tightening.” Mr. Kudlow has struck a slightly less pugilistic tone. In an interview with CNBC, Mr. Kudlow said that the economy “fundamentally” looks “quite healthy,” adding that he and Mr. Trump understand that the Fed operates independently. Mr. Kudlow said Mr. Trump had “redesigned, redeveloped and re-engineered” the economy and suggested the Fed was getting in the way of allowing the president’s efforts to take root. “There’s no emergency, just a point of view,” Mr. Kudlow said. “We don’t want to threaten this great recovery.” While Mr. Powell already seems to be following the trajectory Mr. Trump wants, the president said last week that he plans to nominate Stephen Moore to an open seat on the Fed. Mr. Moore, a former campaign adviser to Mr. Trump and a conservative economist, has been pushing for the Fed to cut interest rates, saying their recent increases went too far. The White House has yet to formally nominate Mr. Moore for the Fed seat.",The New York Times
2019,White House Says ISIS’s Last Bastion Fell. So Why Is There Still Fighting?,"WASHINGTON — Clashes are continuing with Islamic State fighters in eastern Syria, United States military officials said on Friday after the White House claimed that American-backed forces had retaken the extremist group’s final sliver of territory. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, told reporters aboard Air Force One that the Islamic State’s caliphate in Syria had been “100 percent eliminated.” She said Acting Defense Secretary Patrick M. Shanahan had briefed President Trump during the flight. Mr. Trump has declared the Islamic State’s defeat several times in recent weeks. Each time, Pentagon officials have gingerly tried to clarify that the group’s remnants remain hunkered down — first in the town of Hajin and now outside the small village of Baghuz on the Syria-Iraq border. Ms. Sanders told reporters to refer questions to the Pentagon, but the Defense Department declined a request for comment. One military official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that Islamic State fighters were hiding underground in Baghuz and were still firing at the troops who were trying to clear the village. In recent weeks the extremist group — which once controlled territory about the size of Britain — has also released several videos outlining efforts to hold its final bastion, a patchwork of burning tents, dwindling military supplies and civilians caught in the crossfire. After the White House announcement on Friday, a spokesman for the American-backed Syrian Democratic Forces tweeted that “heavy fighting continues” around Baghuz. The spokesman, Mustafa Bali, also said that international forces had conducted “several airstrikes” against the extremists on Thursday night. Another senior United States official said on Friday that the Syrian Democratic Forces planned to issue a statement when they believe the final remnants of the caliphate have been liberated. The president’s drive to announce an end to the four-year campaign against the Islamic State was underscored by his unexpected announcement in December that he would withdraw all troops from Syria. That decision came against the advice of most of his national security officials and prompted the resignation of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. As a candidate for president, Mr. Trump had promised to end the United States’ long wars that followed the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Military officials and lawmakers who opposed the troop withdrawal in Syria insisted that an enduring presence of American forces must remain to ensure the defeat of the Islamic State and counter Iranian and Russian influence. Late last month, the White House announced that roughly 400 American troops would remain in Syria for the foreseeable future.",The New York Times
2019,White Meat or Dark? Carving Up Brexit,"LONDON — On his poultry operation outside Manchester, England, Michael Bailey used to raise turkeys and sell them at Christmastime. The whole bird. But most British customers now want their meat cut up, boneless and, most vexingly to farmers, white, not dark. So Mr. Bailey breaks down his birds, leaving behind a pile of unwanted thighs and drumsticks. “We’ve got a high-value turkey, and half of it — well, nearly half of it — they don’t want,” he said. “This causes us a major problem.” For decades, the answer to that problem was the European Union: a frictionless market with idiosyncratic tastes, in which eastern countries crave the dark meat that Britons do not. Along with the turkey leftovers, dark-meat chicken and aging pigs from British farms often land on plates in Eastern Europe, while white meat travels the opposite way. Britons can eat what they want while farmers export what they do not. But now, as with so many other areas of trade and business, Britain’s impending withdrawal from the bloc, the process known as Brexit, stands to throw off the gustatory balance. “We’ve had sort of 20 years of being able to eat what we want, when we want,” said Richard Griffiths, the chief executive of the British Poultry Council. “That’s a privilege. And I don’t think that privilege has really been valued or recognized universally across the country.” Farmers know this little-noticed quirk of the meat trade as carcass balance: One country’s leftovers are another’s prized cuts. Most industries fear Brexit because they need parts from across Europe, often delivered on a tight schedule, to assemble goods like cars or airplane wings. But British farmers are in the business of disassembly, and losing a major market for animal parts could be devastating. Take the pork trade. Britons hunger for the loin and the leg. They eat about 23 million pigs’ worth of loins annually, most of it in the form of back bacon, and 19 million pigs’ worth of legs, according to the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board. But only about 10 million pigs are slaughtered each year in Britain, meaning the country needs to import those cuts. By contrast, Britons eat only about seven million pigs’ worth of pork shoulder, and belly meat ranks even lower, about five million pigs per year. If British farmers cannot sell their extra shoulders and bellies abroad, the pork market collapses. “We need to trade with member states because some parts of the carcass command a better price there,” said Ivor Ferguson, a farmer from Northern Ireland who once raised pigs and now focuses on sheep and cereal crops. Inconveniently for farmers, providing more in-demand cuts means having to find more places to sell the unwanted cuts. When it comes to poultry, Mr. Ferguson said, “If we want to increase consumption of breast meat in the U.K. market, we have to be able to get rid of the dark meat.” Leaving the European Union without some sort of trade deal would be most disastrous for farmers. British pork could face tariffs of around 40 percent, while beef and chicken could face tariffs above 60 percent. Strict border inspections would also add costs and cause delays in many cases. Michael Gove, the environment secretary, has promised that Britain will apply tariffs to food imports to protect British farmers. But he said delays at the ports would be dangerous. “Farmers, especially small farmers, would face barriers to trade,” Mr. Gove told a farming conference in January. But even well short of a no-deal split from Europe, Brexit will create snags in what is now a virtually seamless trading process, adding veterinary costs and border checks. And if farmers cannot make as much money as they once did from dark meat exports, they may be forced to raise prices for white meat chicken, creating what analysts fear will be a two-tier market in which only richer Britons can afford the best fresh chicken. New trade deals could also open the British market to cheaper meat, none more alarming to Britons than chlorine-washed chicken from the United States. Farmers are trying to adjust now, among other things by persuading Britons to start eating cuts they now ignore. Analysts have pitched dark-meat chicken as a healthier alternative to beef, and suggested furnishing Britons with more recipes for how to cook it. Some companies are already slipping dark meat into their recipes. Mr. Bailey, who processes free range and organic chicken, said he sells poultry to a maker of meat pies that for years bought only white breast meat, forcing Mr. Bailey to find another taker for the remaining three-quarters of the bird. But by promising better prices, he tempted the pie maker to try dark meat, too. Six months of cooking tests later, and with dollops of sauce disguising the chicken cut, the pie maker now buys dark meat, too, Mr. Bailey said. “In fact, it enhanced the flavor of the pie,” Mr. Bailey said. “It was a bit of a win in the end.” There is a long road ahead. Britain exports between 250,000 and 300,000 tons of dark meat chicken a year, about 70 percent of it to the European Union, according to ResPublica, a British think tank. Over the decades since technology made it easy for producers to portion and debone meat, people not only developed a taste for certain parts of the bird but also forgot how to cook the whole thing, Mr. Griffiths said. Reversing that trend could take years, he said, though Brexit could very well drive up the price of white meat chicken enough that people would no longer have a choice. “We’ve built up a marketplace where we export dark meat and the value we get from it helps keep down food prices in the U.K.,” he said. The growing importance of the Asian market could soften the blow for pig farmers. China has become a significant buyer of the least pricey parts of the pig, like the feet, and losing the European market might be easier to weather than losing the Asian market. Some less popular cuts like pork belly are also appearing more and more on British restaurant menus, analysts say. Still, farmers can ill afford any upheaval in trade at a moment when Brexit — and the prospect of new immigration restrictions — is already costing them workers. Mr. Bailey said roughly two-thirds of the employees in his poultry operation were from Europe. And certain exports could be stranded in Britain, especially female pigs. After spending their lives breeding in Britain, the pigs are often sent to Germany for processing into sausages. But the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board said in a report released in February that tariffs on agriculture exports would make the practice “uneconomical.” Instead, farmers may be forced to pay to have them killed and disposed of in Britain.",The New York Times
2019,White Officer Placed on Leave After Detaining Black Man Picking Up Trash in Front of His Building,"A white police officer in Colorado has been placed on leave while the authorities investigate why he detained a black man holding a trash clamp in front of the man’s home. The man, who repeatedly told officers that he had been picking up trash in front of the building where he lives and works, was not taken into custody or booked on suspicion of a crime, the police said, but the episode late last week has caused anger and concern in the liberal and largely white city of Boulder, Colo. At a City Council meeting on Tuesday, residents reportedly clacked trash grabbers as Chief Greg Testa of the Boulder Police Department briefed officials on what had happened and announced that the officer had been placed on administrative leave. “This is an extremely concerning issue and one we are taking very seriously,” Chief Testa said. The college town’s population is about 100,000 — 81 percent white and less than 2 percent black, according to census data. And at Tuesday’s meeting, city officials — most of them white — found themselves grappling with issues of structural racism, bias and restorative justice. Video footage of the episode posted on social media begins when the situation is already underway and does not show the entire encounter. A police spokeswoman said on Thursday the footage is of the incident. In a statement on Monday, the police department said the encounter took place Friday around 8:30 a.m. in front of what the property owners call a “cohousing community.” The police said one of their officers, whom they have not identified, “observed a man sitting in a partially enclosed patio area directly behind a ‘Private Property’ sign and initiated contact with the man to determine if he was allowed to be on the property.” The man “gave the officer his school identification card,” the statement said. “The officer detained the man to investigate further and made a request over the radio for additional assistance to respond indicating that the person was uncooperative and unwilling to put down a blunt object. Several officers responded including a supervisor. The object the man was holding was used to pick up trash.” The video footage, about 15 minutes long, shows a man, who also has not been publicly identified, exclaiming: “I don’t have a weapon! This is a bucket! This is a clamp!” Throughout the footage, an officer demands that he drop the “weapon,” and that he sit down; the man refuses, telling the officer that he is a university student. “You have a gun in your hand!” the man yells at the officer. “Yes I do, because you’re not listening,” the officer responds. In a matter of minutes, several other officers — the man counts out eight — arrive. “You said this is a weapon,” the man says, clacking the trash grabber in the air. “It can be used as a weapon,” an officer replies. “Do you feel like this is threatening?” the man asks. Eventually, the voice of another man can be heard on the video footage telling officers “he works for us, he’s our work stay. He’s out here picking up trash.” The officers then gathered and appeared to be in discussion. Then the officer who first approached the man says, “We’ve decided that we’re going to end things at this point.” The officer appears to explain that the man had been “moving” the trash clamp “around” before handing the man a card and departing. “Officers ultimately determined that the man had a legal right to be on the property and returned the man’s school identification card,” the police statement said. “All officers left the area and no further action was taken.” The statement said the department opened an internal affairs investigation the morning of the episode that will result in a report to a panel and ultimately a recommendation to the chief of police. In an email on Thursday, Shannon Aulabaugh, a spokeswoman for the police department, reiterated that the department was “very concerned” about the episode, but declined to comment on it further until the investigation is complete. At a City Council meeting days later, residents held signs that said “Doing Yard Work While Black” and “Black Lives Matter.” As part of the department’s investigation, Chief Testa said officials would interview all of the officers involved and review body-camera footage. That footage showed that one officer had revealed his handgun and it was “pointed to the ground,” the chief said. “I am not making excuses,” he said. “I am just trying to add some needed context.” In addition to asking the chief about issues of bias and racial profiling, members of the City Council pressed him on whether the man had been given an apology. “My plan is to have a personal conversation with him when the time is right and hopefully sooner than later,” the chief said. A man at the meeting identified by The Daily Camera as Sammie Lawrence told the Council that as a young black man from Sacramento, who has followed the case of Stephon Clark — who was fatally shot by the police in his grandmother’s backyard — the confrontation in Boulder was “terrifying.” “This is very scary,” he said. “I really hope we take this seriously, because I deserve a peace of mind as part of this community.” A recent survey of Boulder residents found disparities in how residents viewed the city, including the quality of public safety services. Nonwhite residents viewed police and sheriff services as less positive than white people, according to survey results presented to the City Council this year.",The New York Times

2019,White Woman’s Racist Tirade in Connecticut Store Caught on Video,"[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] It is not clear exactly how an altercation involving a white woman’s racist tirade in a Connecticut supermarket began. But a video posted of the incident on Friday night opened with the woman’s profanity-tinged threat. Over the next minute, the woman, whom police officials identified as Corinne Terrone, hurled a highly offensive racial epithet four times at a black man and a black woman in a ShopRite grocery store in East Haven, Conn., the video shows. She repeatedly swore at the man and woman and twice spat in their direction. All the while, Ms. Terrone’s two children looked on, seemingly frightened. By the time Ms. Terrone’s tirade came to the attention of local officials on Saturday morning, videos of the incident had been viewed and reposted by thousands of people on Facebook and Instagram. That same day, Ms. Terrone resigned from her job as a clerk for Hamden Public Schools in Connecticut, school district officials said. “We don’t tolerate anyone saying even close to the kinds of things that she said in that supermarket on Friday night,” Jody Goeller, the superintendent of Hamden Public Schools, said on Monday. “What she said was vile and disgraceful.” The East Haven Police Department also began investigating the incident on Saturday. As of Monday morning, no charges had been filed against Ms. Terrone, a spokesman for the department, Lt. Joseph Murgo, said. “We’re urging anybody, especially the victims of this racist tirade, to come forward, and let us explore some criminal charges,” Lieutenant Murgo said. Ms. Terrone, of New Haven, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The police have yet to speak directly with either of the targets of Ms. Terrone’s racist slurs or witnesses to it, Lieutenant Murgo said. But they believe the incident started when Ms. Terrone got into an altercation with a man on a motorized scooter. One video that has been shared online starts with Ms. Terrone shouting a threat to “put you in one of those permanently.” She swears and shouts, telling someone to watch the way they talk to her in front of her two young daughters. Shortly after that, Ms. Terrone utters the racial slur for the first time. After that, a man appears to run toward Ms. Terrone, who encourages him to “put your hands on me, come on.” She pulls her phone out, as if to start recording the confrontation. The man then appears to knock the phone to the floor. After that, the video shows Ms. Terrone spitting on the floor in front of the black man and the black woman, who appeared to be with him. Later, as the two are walking away from the confrontation, she appears to spit at the man again. After the incident, Ms. Terrone reached out to police dispatchers and continued her tirade with “more offensive language,” Lieutenant Murgo said. Other than that, the police had not been in contact with her. A spokeswoman for ShopRite, Maureen Gillespie, said that the company was working with law enforcement and had provided surveillance footage. “We are saddened and deeply disturbed that this occurred in our store and affected our customers,” Ms. Gillespie said. Based on the social media footage and video from ShopRite, Ms. Terrone could be charged with breach of peace if someone were to come forward to make a complaint, Lieutenant Murgo said. It was also possible that her spitting could lead to an assault charge, he said. The police are still trying to get in touch with the victims in the video, he said. Additionally, because Ms. Terrone’s children were present during the incident, the police could also explore bringing charges that have to deal with “impairing the morals of children,” he said. The Hamden school district filed a report with Connecticut’s Department of Children and Families on Saturday, Mr. Goeller said. The department’s commissioner, Vannessa Dorantes, said in a statement that the department could not comment on whether it was looking into this incident but that it typically investigated reports of parents “acting erratically or in an impaired fashion” if there was concern that children might be at risk. On Monday morning, with the Hamden community still reeling from the video, the staff at Hamden High School was meeting with students to discuss the incident and help them process it, Mr. Goeller said. “I don’t see how any right-minded person can view that video and not be shocked by it and appalled by it and sickened by it,” Mr. Goeller said. “We want to make sure that our kids are O.K.,” he added later. “And we look at this as an opportunity to talk about these matters.”",The New York Times

I’m a Catholic and a conservative, in that order, which means that I’m against abortion and critical of the sexual revolution, but I tend to agree with liberals that the Republican Party is too friendly to the rich. I was against Donald Trump in 2016 for reasons specific to Donald Trump, but in general I think the populist movements in Europe and America have legitimate grievances and I often prefer the populists to the “reasonable” elites. I’ve written books about Harvard, the G.O.P., American Christianity and Pope Francis; I’m working on one about decadence. Benedict XVI was my favorite pope. I review movies for National Review and have strong opinions about many prestige television shows. I have three small children, two girls and a boy, and I live in New Haven with my wife. I’ve been an Op-Ed columnist at The New York Times since 2017, writing mainly about politics, ideology and gender. These days people on the right and the left both use “liberal” as an epithet, but that’s basically what I am, though the nightmare of Donald Trump’s presidency has radicalized me and pushed me leftward. I’ve written three books, including one, in 2006, about the danger of right-wing populism in its religious fundamentalist guise. (My other two were about the global battle over reproductive rights and, in a brief detour from politics, about an adventurous Russian émigré who helped bring yoga to the West.) I love to travel; a long time ago, after my husband and I eloped, we spent a year backpacking through Asia. Now we live in Brooklyn with our son and daughter. I’ve worked at The Times since 1999 and have been an Op-Ed columnist since 2016. I caught the journalism bug a very long time ago — first as a little kid in the late 1970s who loved reading the Boston Globe sports section and later as a teenager working on my high school and college newspapers. I discovered that when my classmates and I put a complaint in print, for everyone to see, school administrators actually paid attention. I’ve since worked as a metro reporter at The Washington Post and a writer at BusinessWeek magazine. At The Times, I started as a reporter in the business section and have also been a Times Magazine staff writer, the Washington bureau chief and the founding editor of The Upshot. My politics are left of center. But I’m also to the right of many Times readers. I think education reform has accomplished a lot. I think two-parent families are good for society. I think progressives should be realistic about the cultural conservatism that dominates much of this country. Most of all, however, I worry deeply about today’s Republican Party, which has become dangerously extreme. This country faces some huge challenges — inequality, climate change, the rise of China — and they’ll be very hard to solve without having both parties committed to the basic functioning of American democracy.

2019,"Who Could Have Predicted It? (Well, Actually Two Different Psychics)","Mini-Vows Vanessa Beatriz Golenia and Peter Gynd Medley were married March 6 at the Manhattan Marriage Bureau. A staff member of the City Clerk’s Office officiated. On Feb. 23, the couple took part in a celebration ceremony in the Yucatán, Mexico, that was produced by Mia Rovegno, a New York playwright, and took place at Hacienda Kancabá, near the town of Espita. The bride, 34, is the director of strategy at Jwalk, an advertising agency in New York. She graduated from the University of San Diego and received a certificate in account planning from Miami Ad School. She is a daughter of Beatriz L. Golenia and Gerd Golenia of San Diego. The bride’s father retired as a San Diego-based long-haul trucker. Her mother, also retired, was an executive assistant at San Diego Gas and Electric. The groom, who is 37, legally changed his surname to Gynd. He is an artist, independent curator and the director at Lesley Heller Gallery in New York. His conceptual landscape-based paintings and photographs were on display from May 18 to June 3, 2018 at the Ground Floor Gallery in Brooklyn. He graduated from the Alberta College of Art and Design in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. He is a son of Ursula Medley of Powell River, Canada, and Douglas G. Medley of North Vancouver, Canada. The groom’s mother, based in Powell River, is a plein-air oil painter with a focus on the Canadian West Coast landscape. His father, a musician in Vancouver specializing in Cape Breton style fiddle, retired as an insurance salesman there. Ms. Golenia and Mr. Gynd met in Brooklyn in June 2015 — she lived in Greenpoint and he in nearby Bushwick — shortly after he searched for “feminist dating apps,” and subsequently matched with her on Bumble. “I was looking for a certain kind of partner,” he said, “someone who was a very strong, independent woman and wasn’t afraid to speak her mind.” Both of them had gone to their own psychic for a peek into their future social lives. Ms. Golenia’s psychic told her, “O.K., you’re definitely meeting someone. He’s either European or he’s been spending a lot of time in Europe. You’ll know it’s him because he just got out of something, either a relationship or a job.” Two weeks after Ms. Golenia met Mr. Gynd, he mentioned to her that he had just quit a job that had him traveling throughout Europe for the last two years. “I was like, wow,” Ms. Golenia said. “I wondered if this is the guy my psychic was talking about. I had butterflies in my stomach.” Mr. Gynd’s psychic had urged him to get on all of the dating apps he possibly could to find a partner, which led him to Ms. Golenia. “My psychic described my future partner as being German or Swiss and working in the beauty industry,” Mr. Gynd said. “Well, Vanessa is part German and works in the beauty industry.” Neither Ms. Golenia nor Mr. Gynd told the other about their respective psychics until long after they met. “I guess neither of us wanted the other to think we were crazy,” Ms. Golenia said, laughing. They met in person on Pride Day in 2015 over a drink at a bar in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn. After a few dates, Mr. Gynd took Ms. Golenia to Beacon, N.Y., to see the Dia Foundation’s museum. Before the date was over, they made a pact to delete their online dating profiles. “I had dated creative types before, but they lacked stability or were emotionally unavailable,” Ms. Golenia said. “Peter was well grounded with a strong moral compass and as an artist he saw the world in a different, more beautiful way than most others, and I was attracted to that along with the fact that we shared the same values and adventurous spirit.” Mr. Gynd proposed in August 2017 during a grueling 49-kilometer (30.4-mile) hike on the remote western coast of Vancouver Island, on an unnamed beach that the couple called “Engagement Beach.” “Vanessa has this unbinding, positive outlook on life,” Mr. Gynd said. “She will always find the good in any situation, and as far as our situation, she has always shown me true love.” An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of the woman who produced the couple’s celebration ceremony in Mexico. Her name is Mia Rovegno, not Rovengo.",The New York Times
2019,Who Might Replace Theresa May as Britain’s Prime Minister? The Field Grows,"LONDON — Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain has announced that she will step down as the Conservative Party leader on June 7, bringing into the open a party leadership struggle that has been underway on the sidelines for months. But deep divisions within the party and the nation over Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union proved fatal to Mrs. May’s leadership, and it is not clear that a successor would fare any better. The race is already shaping up to be a crowded one, with near daily announcements from Conservative Party lawmakers throwing their hats into the ring. Anyone seeking the job has to be nominated by two members of Parliament. If there is only one candidate, he or she automatically becomes the new leader. If there are more than two, lawmakers vote among themselves to narrow the field to two candidates, who then are put to a vote by the 120,000 mostly white, mostly aging Conservative Party members. The party said it expected to begin the nomination process in the week of June 10, after Mrs. May steps aside, and to complete the process by the end of July. By Wednesday, 11 candidates had declared their intention to run to succeed the prime minister. Others had yet to make a public announcement. Here are the potential successors seen as having the best chance to become head of the Conservative Party and, eventually, prime minister. Mr. Johnson, 54, the former foreign secretary and one of the most outspoken critics of Mrs. May’s Brexit plan, is one of the most polarizing figures in British politics but seen by some hard-line Brexit supporters as a good choice. He was a figurehead in the campaign to leave the European Union, and since the 2016 referendum has pushed for a hard split with the bloc. This stance regularly put him at odds with Mrs. May as she fought for a deal that would, supposedly temporarily, maintain relatively closer ties to Europe, and he regularly undermined her efforts to sell her deal to Parliament. On Friday, that history seemed distant immediately after Mrs. May’s announcement. In a statement posted on Twitter, he thanked Mrs. May for her “stoical service to our country and the Conservative Party” and urged lawmakers to heed her call to deliver Brexit. Mr. Johnson first gained notoriety for his bombastic displays as mayor of London from 2008 to 2016, before returning to Parliament. He was one of the most prominent voices of the Leave campaign that urged Britain to vote for the country’s exit from the European Union, and since the 2016 referendum has advocated a hard split. Mr. Johnson served as foreign secretary in Mrs. May’s cabinet, but resigned in 2018 in protest over her withdrawal strategy. Like Mr. Johnson, Mr. Raab has long advocated a sharp severing of ties with Europe. At 45, he is seen by some in the party as a youthful face who could redefine the leadership role, and he announced his intention to run on Sunday. He served for a short time as Brexit secretary. But he resigned unexpectedly in 2018. At the time, he said he was unable to “reconcile the terms of the proposed deal with the promises we made,” exposing a deep rift within Mrs. May’s cabinet. Ms. Leadsom, 56, has put herself forward for the party leadership before — in May 2016, she went up against Mrs. May after Prime Minister David Cameron stepped down in the wake of the referendum on Britain’s membership in the European Union. She unexpectedly dropped out before the issue was put to a vote, after her chances were damaged by comments she made in an interview with The Times of London in which she suggested that she was a better candidate for the premiership because she is a mother, unlike Mrs. May. This week, she resigned as the leader of the House of Commons, seemingly taking steps to distance herself from the failing leadership. She has been a vocal supporter of a clean break with the European Union. Mr. Gove, 51, the environment secretary, formerly served as justice secretary and education secretary, and is seen by some as a front-runner for the leadership role. Before the 2016 referendum, he campaigned for Britain’s exit, and he has largely backed the prime minister’s strategy during her time in office. He was vocal in his support for Mrs. May, and urged others within his party to support her deal in several iterations. Mr. Gove proved an unlikely ally after he lost to Mrs. May in his bid to succeed Mr. Cameron. When Mr. Gove offered himself up as a reluctant candidate in that leadership race, he very clearly acknowledged what he called his “limitations.” “Whatever charisma is, I don’t have it,” Mr. Gove said at the time. “Whatever glamour may be, I don’t think anyone could ever associate me with it.” Mr. Hunt, 52, replaced Mr. Johnson as foreign secretary, having served as health secretary for the previous six years. Like Mrs. May, Mr. Hunt voted for Britain to remain in the European Union in the 2016 referendum. But in the years since, Mr. Hunt has become a supporter of the decision to leave, citing the “arrogant” and “disappointing” tactics of the bloc’s negotiating team. He was a vocal supporter of Mrs. May’s initial withdrawal deal, though on Thursday he withdrew his support for her “last chance deal” introduced this week. On Friday, he paid tribute to her service, calling her a “true public servant” in a tweet. Mr. Javid, 49, the home secretary, once supported remaining in the European Union but has since thrown his support behind the efforts to leave. On Monday, he announced his intention to run for the head of the party. The son of immigrants from Pakistan, Mr. Javid was a successful banker before turning to politics. Mr. Javid has been positioning himself for a potential leadership role since early this year, making waves with the decision to strip the citizenship of Shamima Begum, the British teenager who traveled to Syria in 2015 to join the Islamic State. But some, including fellow Tory lawmakers, criticized him for the move, calling it opportunistic. Mr. Lidington, 62, supported the campaign for Britain to remain in the European Union, and as Mrs. May’s de facto deputy is seen by some as her natural successor. When speculation arose last year about a possible coup within her cabinet, some tabloids pointed to Mr. Lidington as the most likely next in line. But others believe his prospects are slim. He has long expressed admiration for Mrs. May and worked to rally support for her unpopular Brexit deal, but has said his position has given him a unique view of the difficult nature of the premiership. “One thing that working closely with the prime minister does is cure you completely of any lingering shred of ambition to want to do that task,” he told The Guardian. Mr. Hancock, 40, the health secretary, supported remaining in the European Union, and he has since been a staunch opponent of a no-deal exit from the bloc. He vowed when he entered the race on Saturday to deliver Brexit should he become the next prime minister, but added that his focus would be not just on Brexit, but also on free enterprise and a free society. A graduate of Oxford, Mr. Hancock worked as an economist at the Bank of England and as chief of staff to the lawmaker who speaks for the opposition on economic and financial matters. He became a member of Parliament himself in 2010. Damian Green, a former secretary of state, said in The Sunday Times that only Mr. Hancock had the common sense to heal Britain’s wounds. Ms. McVey, 51, the former secretary of state for work and pensions, voted in 2016 to leave the European Union, and she has recently come out in support of a no-deal Brexit. “The Withdrawal Agreement ship has sailed and needs to be put out of its misery,” she said in a Twitter post on Sunday. “I will take the bold and positive new approach the country needs: leave the EU on October 31 with a clean break so we can all move on & rebuild a UK that works for everyone.” She also said that she would increase school and police funding, while reducing foreign spending. “I’m standing on a blue-collar Conservative platform,” she said. Ms. McVey has previously come under fire for a controversial speech on the rise of food banks, and for voting against same-sex marriage. Mr. Stewart, the secretary of state for international development, has been gaining ground as a measured, moderate Conservative candidate, especially after a certain declaration on Saturday. “I’m afraid I would not be able to serve in a Boris Johnson cabinet,” he told Sky News, on the basis that Mr. Johnson “will try to crash” Britain out of the European Union. He followed this up with a Twitter post that many saw as a jibe against Mr. Johnson, the front-runner in the race to succeed Mrs. May. Mr. Stewart, 46, was a Labour supporter in his teens, and served as a diplomat in the Middle East before entering Parliament in 2010. He was one of the more vocal supporters of Mrs. May’s compromise Brexit deal. “I just think although people pretend they want a Brexit deal, it turns out that far too many Remainers simply do not want to accept the result of the referendum and far too many Brexiteers have convinced themselves that no deal is the sensible, practicable thing to do and I don’t think it is,” he told the political magazine The Spectator last month. Mr. Cleverly, 49, has been a member of Parliament since 2015, making him a relative newcomer to national politics. He put himself forward for the leadership role on Wednesday with an open letter to voters in his district. “To inspire the British people we need to look different, sound different, and offer something new,” he wrote. “I believe I can do that.” Shortly after announcing his candidacy, Mr. Cleverly told BBC Radio he would prefer to come to an agreement for a deal on Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union, but that a no-deal Brexit was not out of the question. “Not delivering Brexit would be significantly more damaging” for the Conservative Party and the country at large than leaving without a deal, he asserted. Mr. Malthouse, 52, entered Parliament in 2015. He is the minister of state for housing, and is seen by many as a rising star within the government. He also brokered the “Malthouse compromise” Brexit plan, which attempted to unite Conservative Remainers and Brexiteers behind Mrs. May’s deal by promising to rewrite provisions relating to the Northern Ireland border, a prospect the European Union has repeatedly ruled out. “We have to unify around a Brexit plan that will get us out on Oct. 31,” Mr. Malthouse told the BBC. “I deal with people honestly and fairly.” Mr. Harper, who was first elected as a member of Parliament in 2005, has served in numerous posts in Britain’s cabinet, including government chief whip and minister for disabled people. But he came under fire during his tenure as the immigration minister that lasted from 2012 to 2014 for being behind the government’s controversial “Go Home” campaign buses, which urged undocumented immigrants to leave Britain or face arrest. Mr. Harper was against Britain’s exit from the European Union, but he has since pledged to deliver Brexit and “honor the decision that the British people took in 2016 to leave the EU,” he wrote in his website. “I am not prepared to see our democracy damaged.” Mr. Gyimah entered Parliament for the first time in 2010, and was previously a minister for various fiels, including universities, prisons and child care. He announced his candidacy with a rare pledge for a Conservative: to hold a second referendum. Mr. Gyimah resigned from Mrs. May’s cabinet in November, after he declared he would not back the government’s proposed withdrawal agreement with the European Union. He said he decided to run for party leader and prime minister to broaden the race. “There is a wide range of candidates, but there is a narrow set of views on Brexit being discussed,” he told Sky News on Sunday. “Parliament is deadlocked,” he said. “We want to be able to bring the country together,” adding that the people’s final say on the Brexit deal would unite Britain.",The New York Times

Mr. Johnson served as foreign secretary in Mrs. May’s cabinet, but resigned in 2018 in protest over her withdrawal strategy. Like Mr. Johnson, Mr. Raab has long advocated a sharp severing of ties with Europe. At 45, he is seen by some in the party as a youthful face who could redefine the leadership role, and he announced his intention to run on Sunday. He served for a short time as Brexit secretary. But he resigned unexpectedly in 2018. At the time, he said he was unable to “reconcile the terms of the proposed deal with the promises we made,” exposing a deep rift within Mrs. May’s cabinet. Ms. Leadsom, 56, has put herself forward for the party leadership before — in May 2016, she went up against Mrs. May after Prime Minister David Cameron stepped down in the wake of the referendum on Britain’s membership in the European Union. She unexpectedly dropped out before the issue was put to a vote, after her chances were damaged by comments she made in an interview with The Times of London in which she suggested that she was a better candidate for the premiership because she is a mother, unlike Mrs. May. This week, she resigned as the leader of the House of Commons, seemingly taking steps to distance herself from the failing leadership. She has been a vocal supporter of a clean break with the European Union. Mr. Gove, 51, the environment secretary, formerly served as justice secretary and education secretary, and is seen by some as a front-runner for the leadership role. Before the 2016 referendum, he campaigned for Britain’s exit, and he has largely backed the prime minister’s strategy during her time in office. He was vocal in his support for Mrs. May, and urged others within his party to support her deal in several iterations. Mr. Gove proved an unlikely ally after he lost to Mrs. May in his bid to succeed Mr. Cameron. When Mr. Gove offered himself up as a reluctant candidate in that leadership race, he very clearly acknowledged what he called his “limitations.” “Whatever charisma is, I don’t have it,” Mr. Gove said at the time. “Whatever glamour may be, I don’t think anyone could ever associate me with it.” Mr. Hunt, 52, replaced Mr. Johnson as foreign secretary, having served as health secretary for the previous six years. Like Mrs. May, Mr. Hunt voted for Britain to remain in the European Union in the 2016 referendum. But in the years since, Mr. Hunt has become a supporter of the decision to leave, citing the “arrogant” and “disappointing” tactics of the bloc’s negotiating team. He was a vocal supporter of Mrs. May’s initial withdrawal deal, though on Thursday he withdrew his support for her “last chance deal” introduced this week. On Friday, he paid tribute to her service, calling her a “true public servant” in a tweet. Mr. Javid, 49, the home secretary, once supported remaining in the European Union but has since thrown his support behind the efforts to leave. On Monday, he announced his intention to run for the head of the party. The son of immigrants from Pakistan, Mr. Javid was a successful banker before turning to politics. Mr. Javid has been positioning himself for a potential leadership role since early this year, making waves with the decision to strip the citizenship of Shamima Begum, the British teenager who traveled to Syria in 2015 to join the Islamic State. But some, including fellow Tory lawmakers, criticized him for the move, calling it opportunistic. Mr. Lidington, 62, supported the campaign for Britain to remain in the European Union, and as Mrs. May’s de facto deputy is seen by some as her natural successor. When speculation arose last year about a possible coup within her cabinet, some tabloids pointed to Mr. Lidington as the most likely next in line. But others believe his prospects are slim. He has long expressed admiration for Mrs. May and worked to rally support for her unpopular Brexit deal, but has said his position has given him a unique view of the difficult nature of the premiership. “One thing that working closely with the prime minister does is cure you completely of any lingering shred of ambition to want to do that task,” he told The Guardian. Mr. Hancock, 40, the health secretary, supported remaining in the European Union, and he has since been a staunch opponent of a no-deal exit from the bloc. He vowed when he entered the race on Saturday to deliver Brexit should he become the next prime minister, but added that his focus would be not just on Brexit, but also on free enterprise and a free society. A graduate of Oxford, Mr. Hancock worked as an economist at the Bank of England and as chief of staff to the lawmaker who speaks for the opposition on economic and financial matters. He became a member of Parliament himself in 2010. Damian Green, a former secretary of state, said in The Sunday Times that only Mr. Hancock had the common sense to heal Britain’s wounds. Ms. McVey, 51, the former secretary of state for work and pensions, voted in 2016 to leave the European Union, and she has recently come out in support of a no-deal Brexit. “The Withdrawal Agreement ship has sailed and needs to be put out of its misery,” she said in a Twitter post on Sunday. “I will take the bold and positive new approach the country needs: leave the EU on October 31 with a clean break so we can all move on & rebuild a UK that works for everyone.” She also said that she would increase school and police funding, while reducing foreign spending. “I’m standing on a blue-collar Conservative platform,” she said. Ms. McVey has previously come under fire for a controversial speech on the rise of food banks, and for voting against same-sex marriage. Mr. Stewart, the secretary of state for international development, has been gaining ground as a measured, moderate Conservative candidate, especially after a certain declaration on Saturday. “I’m afraid I would not be able to serve in a Boris Johnson cabinet,” he told Sky News, on the basis that Mr. Johnson “will try to crash” Britain out of the European Union. He followed this up with a Twitter post that many saw as a jibe against Mr. Johnson, the front-runner in the race to succeed Mrs. May. Mr. Stewart, 46, was a Labour supporter in his teens, and served as a diplomat in the Middle East before entering Parliament in 2010. He was one of the more vocal supporters of Mrs. May’s compromise Brexit deal. “I just think although people pretend they want a Brexit deal, it turns out that far too many Remainers simply do not want to accept the result of the referendum and far too many Brexiteers have convinced themselves that no deal is the sensible, practicable thing to do and I don’t think it is,” he told the political magazine The Spectator last month. Mr. Cleverly, 49, has been a member of Parliament since 2015, making him a relative newcomer to national politics. He put himself forward for the leadership role on Wednesday with an open letter to voters in his district. “To inspire the British people we need to look different, sound different, and offer something new,” he wrote. “I believe I can do that.” Shortly after announcing his candidacy, Mr. Cleverly told BBC Radio he would prefer to come to an agreement for a deal on Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union, but that a no-deal Brexit was not out of the question. “Not delivering Brexit would be significantly more damaging” for the Conservative Party and the country at large than leaving without a deal, he asserted. Mr. Malthouse, 52, entered Parliament in 2015. He is the minister of state for housing, and is seen by many as a rising star within the government. He also brokered the “Malthouse compromise” Brexit plan, which attempted to unite Conservative Remainers and Brexiteers behind Mrs. May’s deal by promising to rewrite provisions relating to the Northern Ireland border, a prospect the European Union has repeatedly ruled out. “We have to unify around a Brexit plan that will get us out on Oct. 31,” Mr. Malthouse told the BBC. “I deal with people honestly and fairly.” Mr. Harper, who was first elected as a member of Parliament in 2005, has served in numerous posts in Britain’s cabinet, including government chief whip and minister for disabled people. But he came under fire during his tenure as the immigration minister that lasted from 2012 to 2014 for being behind the government’s controversial “Go Home” campaign buses, which urged undocumented immigrants to leave Britain or face arrest. Mr. Harper was against Britain’s exit from the European Union, but he has since pledged to deliver Brexit and “honor the decision that the British people took in 2016 to leave the EU,” he wrote in his website. “I am not prepared to see our democracy damaged.” Mr. Gyimah entered Parliament for the first time in 2010, and was previously a minister for various fiels, including universities, prisons and child care. He announced his candidacy with a rare pledge for a Conservative: to hold a second referendum. Mr. Gyimah resigned from Mrs. May’s cabinet in November, after he declared he would not back the government’s proposed withdrawal agreement with the European Union. He said he decided to run for party leader and prime minister to broaden the race. “There is a wide range of candidates, but there is a narrow set of views on Brexit being discussed,” he told Sky News on Sunday. “Parliament is deadlocked,” he said. “We want to be able to bring the country together,” adding that the people’s final say on the Brexit deal would unite Britain.",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | Who Do Jared and Ivanka Think They Are?,"A new book probes the Kushner family’s secrets. Opinion Columnist Many high achievers, particularly women and people of color, suffer from impostor syndrome, the fear that they don’t belong in the rarefied realm to which they’ve ascended and that they will soon be found out. Even Michelle Obama, who is, according to a Gallup poll conducted last year, the most admired woman in America, has said that she feels it. “I share that with you because we all have doubts in our abilities, about our power and what that power is,” she told students in London in December. Well, maybe not all of us. I’ve just finished Vicky Ward’s “Kushner, Inc.,” a scintillating investigation of Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump’s White House sojourn, which comes out on Tuesday. It’s full of damning details: contempt for the entitled, venal couple may be the one thing that unites all of D.C.’s warring factions. Still, the first daughter and her husband remain psychologically mysterious, at least to me. Why don’t they have impostor syndrome, given that their total lack of qualifications for the jobs they are doing makes them actual impostors? According to “Kushner, Inc.,” Gary Cohn, former director of the National Economic Council, has told people that Ivanka Trump thinks she could someday be president. “Her father’s reign in Washington, D.C., is, she believes, the beginning of a great American dynasty,” writes Ward. Kushner, whose pre-White House experience included owning a boutique newspaper and helming a catastrophically ill-timed real estate deal, has arrogated to himself substantial parts of American foreign policy. According to Ward, shortly after Rex Tillerson was confirmed as secretary of state, Kushner told him “to leave Mexico to him because he’d have Nafta wrapped up by October.” As political actors, the couple are living exemplars of the Dunning-Kruger effect, a psychological phenomenon which leads incompetent people to overestimate their ability because they can’t grasp how much they don’t know. [Listen to “The Argument” podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.] Partly, the Jared and Ivanka story is about the “reality distortion field” — a term one of Ward’s sources uses about Kushner — created by great family wealth. She quotes a member of Trump’s legal team saying that the two “have no idea how normal people perceive, understand, intuit.” Privilege, in them, has been raised to the level of near sociopathy. Ward, the author of two previous books about the worlds of high finance and real estate, has known Kushner slightly for a long time; she told me that when he bought The New York Observer newspaper in 2006, he tried to hire her. She knocks down the idea that either he or his wife is a stabilizing force or moral compass in the Trump administration. Multiple White House sources told her they think it was Kushner who ordered the closing of White House visitor logs in April 2017, because he “didn’t want his frenetic networking exposed.” Ward reports that Cohn was stunned by their blasé reaction to Trump’s defense of the white-nationalist marchers in Charlottesville, Va.: “He was upset that they were not sufficiently upset.” Still, even if you assume that the couple are amoral climbers, their behavior still doesn’t quite make sense. Ward writes that Ivanka’s chief concern is her personal brand, but that brand has been trashed. The book cites an October 2017 survey measuring consumer approval of more than 1,600 brands. Ivanka’s fashion line was in the bottom 10. A leading real estate developer tells Ward that Kushner, now caught up in multiple state and federal investigations, has become radioactive: “No one will want to do business with him.” (Kushner resigned as C.E.O. of Kushner Companies in 2017, but has kept most of his stake in the business.) To truly make sense of their motivations, Ward told me, you have to understand the gravitational pull of their fathers. Husband and wife are both “really extraordinarily orientated and identified through their respective fathers in a way that most fully formed adults are not,” she said. Among the most interesting parts of “Kushner, Inc.,” are the chapters about the business history of Charles Kushner, Jared’s felonious father, and his plan to restore his reputation, with Jared’s help, after getting out of prison in 2006. Part of that rehabilitation project was the purchase of a flagship building in Manhattan — 666 Fifth Avenue, an absurdly on-the-nose address — for which the family paid a record amount at the very height of the real estate market in 2007. When the Great Recession hit, the building became a white elephant, its debt threatening the family fortune. Ward’s book suggests that the search for someone who would bail out 666 Fifth Avenue has played a significant role in American foreign policy during the Trump administration. And since the completion of her book, we’ve learned that Trump overrode intelligence officials, who were concerned about Kushner and his family’s ties to foreign investors, to give Kushner a security clearance. In the end, the Kushner family seems to have gotten what it wanted. Last year, Brookfield Asset Management, which has substantial investment from the government of Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund, came to the Kushners’ rescue. (The Qataris have denied any advance knowledge of the deal.) “You’ll notice that the U.S. position toward Qatar changes when the Qataris bail out 666 Fifth Avenue,” said Ward, adding, “We look like a banana republic.” Maybe that’s why Jared and Ivanka appear so blithely confident. As public servants, they’re obviously way out of their depth. But as self-dealing scions of a gaudy autocracy? They’re naturals.

2019,"Who Is Lucy Flores, the Woman Accusing Joe Biden of Kissing Her?","Lucy Flores, a former Nevada state assemblywoman, published an essay Friday in which she described Joseph R. Biden Jr. touching her inappropriately and kissing her on the head during a Democratic campaign rally in 2014, when he was vice president. With Mr. Biden expected to announce whether he will enter the race for president in April, Ms. Flores’s story attracted scrutiny on his interactions with women over his long career in national politics. On Sunday, Mr. Biden released a statement defending himself, saying he did not believe he had ever acted inappropriately on the campaign trail. [Read more about Ms. Flores’s story, and Mr. Biden’s response.] Several candidates for the Democratic nomination were asked over the weekend to weigh in on the accusations, and Ms. Flores herself discussed her essay, and the response to it, in an interview with The New York Times on Saturday and on CNN Sunday morning. Here’s a look at Ms. Flores, her career in politics, and her more recent efforts to speak out on social justice issues, sexism and harassment. In 2009 — her last year in law school — Ms. Flores, a Democrat, won an election to represent Nevada’s Assembly District 28, in the same part of Las Vegas where she had grown up, becoming one of the first Latinas elected to the state legislature. She served two terms in the Assembly, during which she said she focused on issues like education, consumer protection and aid for victims of domestic violence. At one point in 2013, she gave testimony at a committee meeting on sexual education about having had an abortion when she was 16, and subsequently received threats, according to local news reports. Felicia Ortiz, a friend of Ms. Flores’s who is on the State Board of Education in Nevada, said she let Ms. Flores stay with her after someone shot a bullet into Ms. Flores’s house. “Her strength is phenomenal,” Ms. Ortiz said. Ms. Flores ran as the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor in 2014, which was when she met Mr. Biden. The vice president, she wrote in the essay, had agreed to come to a rally to help her fledgling campaign. At first, she wrote, she felt “grateful and flattered.” But as she was preparing to take the stage, she “felt two hands on my shoulders” and “froze.” Then, she said, Mr. Biden leaned in and “inhaled my hair,” and “proceeded to plant a big slow kiss on the back of my head.” Ms. Flores lost the election in a landslide. The prominent Nevada political analyst Jon Ralston tweeted on Saturday that her loss caused her to fall out of favor with the state’s Democratic establishment and with Harry Reid, the powerful former senator. [Sign up for our politics newsletter and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race.] She ran for Congress in 2016 in a bid to represent Nevada’s Fourth District, but lost in a tight primary to Ruben Kihuen — Mr. Reid’s choice — in what she called ""a high-profile, full-of-controversy race.” “I think there have been issues because she has challenged the norm,” said Chris Miller, former chairman of the Clark County Democratic Party in Nevada. In a Facebook post in early 2016, Ms. Flores endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders for president and became a campaign surrogate. She also served on the board of Our Revolution, the Sanders-aligned advocacy group. “I believe that Bernie Sanders will lead the charge, with many millions of Americans behind him, against the unfettered Wall Street greed that has threatened the very existence of the middle class and shackled so many more to permanent poverty,” she wrote in the Facebook post. “I believe that now, more than ever, America needs a political revolution.” After her primary loss in 2016, Ms. Flores moved to California, where she worked at Mitú, a digital media company, and then helped found a company, Luz Collective, focused on empowering Latinas. Ms. Flores has also embraced the role of social justice advocate, speaking out about sexism and harassment in politics in recent years. She gave support to Masha Mendieta, a woman on Mr. Sanders’s 2016 presidential campaign who said she was mistreated. And in a 2017 interview with Nevada Public Radio, she said it was “wonderful” that “we are having this conversation about what is the difference between sexism, what is the difference between sexual harassment, what’s the difference between sexual assault.”",The New York Times
2019,Who Is William Barr? He Decides What the Public Can See in Mueller’s Report.,"After weeks of combing through the special counsel report on the investigation into Russia’s election interference, including whether any Trump associates coordinated with the Russians and whether President Trump tried to obstruct justice, Attorney General William P. Barr released a redacted version of the more than 400-page document on Thursday. Before releasing the report, Mr. Barr spoke at a news conference Thursday morning and delivered a defense of the president, repeating throughout his remarks that the special counsel found no evidence of conspiracy or collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians. Democrats have said Mr. Barr’s decision to deliver remarks before lawmakers or the public had a chance to read the report gave the attorney general a head start on shaping the narrative of the conclusions of the special counsel team, led by Robert S. Mueller III, and delivering an account favorable to Mr. Trump. “In other words, there was no evidence of the Trump campaign collusion with the Russian government’s hacking,” Mr. Barr said on Thursday. Here are several things to know about the man in control of what the public can see in one of the most anticipated government documents in history. William Pelham Barr served as an attorney general during the George Bush administration from 1991 to 1993, meaning he has twice sworn to uphold the Constitution, which is not considered to be a pledge of loyalty to the president. Mr. Barr replaced former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, whom Mr. Trump publicly criticized and harangued after Mr. Sessions recused himself from overseeing the government’s Russia investigation. Mr. Sessions was ultimately forced to resign because Mr. Trump found him to be disloyal, largely related to that recusal. Typically, the attorney general maintains an independence from the White House, but Mr. Trump has demonstrated that is not what he wants from his top law enforcement official. On Thursday, Mr. Trump appeared to be pleased with Mr. Barr’s handling of the report, tweeting a meme that said, “No Collusion. No Obstruction. For the haters and the radical left Democrats — Game Over.” He later referred to the investigation as a hoax during remarks at an event to recognize wounded soldiers. “This should never happen to another president again, this hoax,” he said. As Mr. Barr defended the president, he said the special counsel’s considerations for whether the president obstructed justice must be taken in context. “President Trump faced an unprecedented situation. As he entered into office and sought to perform his responsibilities as president, federal agents and prosecutors were scrutinizing his conduct before and after taking office and the conduct of some of his associates,” Mr. Barr said on Thursday morning, before his department publicly released the report. “At the same time there was relentless speculation in the news media about the president’s personal culpability, yet as he said from the beginning, there was, in fact, no collusion.” The Constitution, according to Mr. Barr’s interpretation, does not consider it a crime for the president to wield his executive powers corruptly, for instance by firing a subordinate or by pardoning a loyal aide. It is an interpretation favorable to Mr. Trump. “He alone is the executive branch,” Mr. Barr wrote in an unsolicited June 8, 2018 memo. “As such, he is the sole repository of all Executive powers conferred by the Constitution.” The document appeared to criticize Mr. Mueller’s inquiry into whether Mr. Trump had obstructed justice, and months later, when Mr. Barr received the Mueller report, which did not take a position on whether the president obstructed justice, Mr. Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein concluded Mr. Trump did no such thing. “There is substantial evidence to show that the president was frustrated and angered by his sincere belief that the investigation was undermining his presidency, propelled by his political opponents and fueled by illegal leaks,” Mr. Barr said on Thursday, in what appeared to be a defense of Mr. Trump’s relentless attacks on his political opponents, his own Justice Department and the special counsel’s investigation. “Nonetheless, the White House fully cooperated with the special counsel’s investigation, providing unfettered access to campaign and White House documents, directing senior aides to testify freely and asserting no privilege claims. And At the same time the president took no act that, in fact, deprived the special counsel of the documents and witnesses necessary to complete his investigation. Mr. Barr said during his confirmation hearing that he was approached, in June 2017, by an administration official who said he was looking for attorneys to add to the president’s defense team. Mr. Barr said he told the administration official he could not take on that role at the time, but he agreed to meet with Mr. Trump the next day. “It was a very brief meeting where essentially the president wanted to know — he said, ‘Oh, you know Bob Mueller. How well do you know Bob Mueller?’” Mr. Barr told senators during his January confirmation hearing. He left his phone number with the president at the end of the meeting. Mr. Barr added: “I didn’t hear — hear from him until, you know, later, but about something different, which was the attorney general position.” [Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter.] Mr. Barr and Mr. Mueller have been friends for 30 years, dating back to their early days at the Justice Department, Mr. Barr told lawmakers in January. He said he applauded the appointment of Mr. Mueller to take over the Russia investigation. And even though he wrote an unsolicited memo that appeared to criticize parts of Mr. Mueller’s investigation, Mr. Barr said he expected their friendship to be intact after the investigation was over. (He also said he was not criticizing Mr. Mueller in his memo). Their families are friends, as well, Mr. Barr has said. Their wives went to Bible study together, and Mr. Mueller has been a guest at two of Mr. Barr’s daughters’s weddings. But some members of Mr. Mueller’s team told associates that Mr. Barr’s four-page letter in March did not adequately describe the conclusions of the special counsel. The special counsel’s investigators wrote multiple summaries of the dense report, and some members of the team thought Mr. Barr should have included them in his letter, which cited just a few partial quotes from the report. Last week, Mr. Barr said he would review the F.B.I.’s investigation of the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia, which would include a review of whether there was any improper “spying” by American intelligence agencies on the campaign’s associates, something Mr. Trump has claimed for more than two years. Before he worked for Mr. Trump, Mr. Barr had defended the president’s calls for new investigations into his former Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton. In November 2017, Mr. Barr said there was “nothing inherently wrong about a president calling for an investigation.” He cautioned that such an investigation should only be launched if the “matter warrants investigation,” and not just because Mr. Trump wanted it.

2019,Who Made My Puzzle?,"puzzle making This month’s constructor spotlight shines on Finn Vigeland. Somerville, Mass. My first published puzzle was a crossword in The New York Times on Oct. 20, 2010, as long as you don’t count the logic puzzles I self-published and distributed to my parents from the ages of 9 to 13. Fun fact about that debut puzzle: I was 18 when it was published, and had been submitting to Will for about a year and a half. Although he hadn’t accepted any of my puzzles yet, he was very courteous and took the time to write detailed responses to my submissions. Eventually, he invited me to the Westchester Crossword Puzzle Tournament, a low-key puzzle event he runs every fall. When I went up to say hi to him at the tournament, he immediately said, “Finn — you’re waiting to hear from me on a puzzle, aren’t you?” He must have been looking at it recently; at the reception later, which is held at his house, I saw my manuscript sitting on his desk. He accepted the puzzle two days later and graciously slotted it to be published only two and a half weeks later. My parents and grandmother always did the crossword when I was growing up. I’d often chime in with just the three or four entries I knew, but as an 11- or 12-year-old, I just didn’t have the knowledge base to make even a dent on a crossword. As such, I gravitated much more toward logic puzzles (grid puzzles and table puzzles — the kind you see in PennyPress and Dell magazines, where you have to match up the person to their profession and street and whatnot). As I reached the ripe, wizened era of my early teens, though, I just started being able to do a bit more of the puzzle. Then I saw the documentary “Wordplay,” and realized there was this whole crossword community out there. Interestingly, though, while the documentary itself was about the top solvers at the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament, I was much more drawn to the DVD extras of “Wordplay,” which included a handful of interviews with top constructors, including Liz Gorski and Merl Reagle. Watching them at work made me open a blank Excel document to try (and fail, many times) to write a crossword. You know, there actually is some extraordinary gratification in the painstaking process of checking every possible fill for a corner until the right one just finally clicks into place. Also, it’s a pretty great icebreaker at parties. I use CrossFire for Mac, which I like just fine, though I gather it’s not quite as advanced as Crossword Compiler for Windows. I both use the “Fill” tab of Crossfire as well as search letter patterns in XWordInfo.com and OneLook.com, so CrossFire is a perfectly acceptable medium for that two-pronged method. I’m not sure I could really quantify this. I’ll add words as I go — if I find a good, new entry in that letter pattern search as I noted above, I’ll add it then and there to my word list. If CrossFire suggests an entry that I know I’d never use, I rescore it below the threshold I’ve set as the minimum word score. I have access to Jeff Chen’s enormous word list as a subscribing member to XWordInfo, so I really have Jeff to thank for such high-quality maintenance of that list. One day, I tell myself, I’ll sit down and do an even finer pruning … but that day hasn’t come yet. I know that aspiring constructors say they are daunted by the word list aspect of construction: Don’t be. There are a lot of great word lists out there (free or by subscription). Get your hands on one and it will do the job. You’ll come to find a degree of word list maintenance that works for you. I spend a lot of time refining the fill in my puzzles, and I like to think I hold that fill to a pretty high standard. Fill is 80 percent of the grid, if not all of it, so it should be things you actually want to see in a puzzle. If I’m using a somewhat tired “crosswordese” entry, I really aim for a more exciting clue. I pretty much always avoid the following: Pluralized names (especially first names) Partial phrases, except for extremely common ones Random Roman numerals (more commonly seen Roman numerals, like III or XII, as on a grandfather clock, are totally fair game). As for failing the breakfast test: I’m all for it. The Times (by necessity, alas) runs vulgarities on its front page. It’s not going to hurt anyone to have a little URINE or ENEMA in our puzzles … and it’s certainly going to help constructors, because those words alternate consonants and vowels. But more important than whether we should put POO in our puzzles via a clue other than [Nanki-___] or [Cock-a-___], blowing up the breakfast test speaks to a larger question of what The Times deems puzzle-worthy. A puzzle I wrote with my good friend Natan Last and the J.A.S.A. crossword class had the entry BELL HOOKS, the famous writer and activist, in it. We were astonished to be told she wasn’t familiar enough for The Times’s crossword audience. I’d love to see the New York Times Crossword get a little blacker, gayer, more female. Obviously, that goes for the demographics of constructors, too, but also the makeup of the grids. I’m wrapping up a puzzle now with MASC in the grid, a common descriptor among queer people. (Although a shortened form of “masculine,” it has widespread usage in its own right — see Urban Dictionary’s second definition.) There were no constraints that forced me to include it in the grid; I wanted to include it. I’d like for it not to wind up with a clinical clue such as “Like the Fr. ‘le,’ but not ‘la’,” but instead, something like “Description in a Grindr bio, maybe.” My Twitter is sometimes fun, if you like crosswords but also urban planning, leftist politics, and Lin-Manuel Miranda. I collaborated on a crossword for the charity puzzle pack Queer Qrosswords, which debuted last year, and I’ll be contributing more for its sequel (planned for May 2019).

2019,Who Needs a Ring to Propose When There Are Puppies and Paintings?,"In a special box on Lauren Viera’s jewelry stand is her most precious possession. It’s a dried-up, shriveled leaf. The leaf, found on the floor of a hut, was presented to her in 2013, wrapped in the shape of a ring when Ms. Viera’s now-husband, Jason Tinkey, a 41-year-old geographer, proposed on a beach in Grenada. “He had wrapped it into a circular thing, and it fit, and that was it,” said Ms. Viera, 40, a Chicago-based freelance writer. The leaf sealed the deal, and they were engaged. Forget the diamond engagement ring. These days, anything from a leaf to a puppy will do the job, as couples seek out ways to create their own love narrative from the very beginning. “Customization is at an unprecedented level among couples who are engaged, or nearly there,” said Kylie Carlson, the chief executive of the International Academy of Wedding and Event Planning, an online school with seven global campuses. “Instagram and Pinterest offered unprecedented access to ideas and examples,” she said. “For better or for worse, some were eager to be that next viral hit.” Whether guided by the hope of fame or the simple desire to do their engagement their own way, the latest crop of newly engaged couples aren’t flashing sparklers. “The trend of bending the rules started a few years ago, and has been gaining steam ever since,” said Lauren Kay, the deputy editor of The Knot. “While a ring is meant to be a symbol of love, other things can absolutely take its place,” she added, “especially if jewelry isn’t important to the couple, or if a diamond is a stretch financially.” Damon Jones said he and his now-wife, Eve Ewing, a writer, are averse to diamonds because of the mining injustices. Mr. Jones, an economist, also believes that the value of diamonds is inflated through marketing and rationing. Mr. Jones suggested that instead of a diamond ring, they create a scholarship so their engagement investment could have more of a lasting impact. The Ewing-Jones Scholarship sends a Chicago high school freshman to a nonprofit summer program called the Leadership Academy at the W.E.B. Du Bois Scholars Institute at Princeton University. (The couple declined to disclose the amount of money they put into the scholarship.) “For the price of a midlevel diamond engagement ring, we could send a student to this program for two summers,” Mr. Jones said. “Of the two decisions, to embrace an act of service and to avoid a common tradition, the former was the more important thing that we focused on.” Others are avoiding that common tradition simply because of the expense. The typical American spends about 4 percent (or two weeks) of annual pretax income on an engagement ring, according to an online poll conducted for The Upshot by Morning Consult. The average cost for an engagement ring last year was $5,000, according to the WeddingWire, a research and wedding planning website. The Knot reported an average of $6,351 in its 2017 study, up from $5,095 in 2011. An engagement ring wasn’t present when Grant Dragan, 37, an investment banker from Chicago, proposed to his now-wife, Kathleen Dragan, 38, a children’s book author. After telling her that she was his best friend, he asked her to marry him, presenting her with plane tickets to visit Paris. She was ecstatic. “I didn’t care at all about the lack of a ring,” said Ms. Dragan. “Your engagement says a lot about who you are as a couple, and in my mind, we were equal partners who loved adventure and were excited about our future together.” For Stephanie McKenna, 30, of Oakland, Calif., the entire proposal and what followed was representative of her alternative views on weddings and marriage, where a diamond didn’t belong. She also didn’t wear a white gown for her wedding day, which was last May. She opted instead for a gold beaded 1920s dress. Ms. McKenna, who is a graphic designer, took her then-boyfriend, John McKenna, a 34-year-old bartender and bladesmith, on a trip to New Mexico, where she proposed to him with an engraved tie bar. Following the proposal, the couple got matching engagement tattoos on their ring fingers. Sometimes, however, proposals without the ring get a little lost in translation. Mark Ruthman, 42, a product manager with the American Medical Association originally from Highland Park, Ill., presented a piece of paper containing three photos of puppies to his then-girlfriend after they returned from a trip visiting his relatives. “Will you be my mommy?” the paper said. Merav Ruthman jumped up and down, as she had always wanted a dog, and was just waiting for the right time in her life to adopt. She was so excited, in fact, that she initially missed what the paper said at the bottom: “And will you marry my daddy?” Ms. Ruthman, 39, a Chicago-based independent clothing designer, recalls saying, “‘Who’s the dog’s dad?’” When the confusion was cleared, she accepted his proposal, and the couple adopted a dog together, a basset-beagle mix, before getting married. Other times, the non-diamond proposal was exactly what was requested. Nivard Bronckaers, a 28-year-old lawyer living in Brussels, fell in love with his boyfriend on date No. 3. They discussed marriage — and the prospect of a diamond engagement ring. “I absolutely didn’t want a ring, as I find it a bit much to have an engagement and a wedding ring as a man,” Mr. Bronckaers said. “Kasper was, however, set on diamonds, and kept teasing me in the following years that I would need to wear the ring if he’d buy it and ask me.” When the proposal came, complete with a closed jewelry box, Mr. Bronckaers was nervous about the prospect of a diamond ring, but said “yes” anyway. It was a surprise diamond-encrusted watch, and Mr. Bronckaers has worn it every day since. They’re planning a September wedding. The upshot: Anything goes.",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | Who Should Be Embarrassed?,"If Jussie Smollett’s racists were imaginary, then conservatives can argue the racists we all see are imaginary. Opinion Columnist “FBI & DOJ to review the outrageous Jussie Smollett case in Chicago. It is an embarrassment to our Nation!” With that tweet, Donald Trump took the absurdity of America’s obsession with a trivial crime and entertainment story and heightened it. But it was just the kind of story that he and conservatives love, one that mixes race, criminality and culture. They need desperately to find emblems of minority pathology to justify their calloused, draconian approach to minority issues. The Hate Crime Hoaxer, the Mexican Rapist, the America-Hating Muslim, the AIDS-Infected Haitian: each of these ideas has a particular serviceability. In their minds, I believe these archetypes work to invalidate criticism and to inoculate them from accountability. For the record, if Smollett did what he is accused of having done, it was not only wrong, but also stupid. But I also believe that the case is little more than tabloid fodder that the media, spurred by wails from conservatives and always so desperately insecure about being accused of liberal bias, has pumped up and stretched out. Everyone is trying to make this case bigger than it is and to mean more than it does. At its core, it’s just a story about an alleged lie told by a television actor. It is a story about an alleged hate crime that didn’t happen, but that was staged by Smollett. The police diverted quite a few resources to investigate his claim, then came to the conclusion that the event was a hoax. Finally, the case was dropped before a trial and the records were sealed. It is interesting Hollywood drama, but meaningless in the grand scheme of things. Smollett was charged with making false reports — lying. If the police are correct, there was no assault or death. There was no property damage. There was no theft. The major damage was the damage Smollett did to his own career and reputation. Diverting resources that could be used to investigate actual assaults and murders is a big deal, but if the police and prosecutors believed he did this, then they should have financial restitution as part of a plea deal. It is an ugly truth that money and power make a mockery of our justice system. Some people sit in jails for weeks, months or even years waiting for a trial because they can’t afford bail. Others pay up and go home immediately. Some people must use overworked public defenders. Others can afford high-powered legal teams. Some people are not shown preferential treatment. Others are. Often, the people most injured by the negative impacts of this corrupt system are the poor, black and brown. But in this case, Smollett, a black man, was the one with the wealth and the power. Prosecutors cut him a break that I don’t think they would have cut for the poor and the powerless. None of this is of any real consequence beyond the local authorities and Smollett himself. And yet, more than two whole months after the precipitating event, people are still trying to make Smollett the embodiment of race problems in America. The dimwits at “Fox & Friends” went so far as to say the case, if it had been true, had the potential to ignite “race riots in major cities across this country.” Ridiculous. Others bemoaned the horrible impact the case would have on other hate crime victims being believed. As a theory, that certainly sounds plausible, but where are the data to support such a claim? Smollett didn’t invent incredulity about vulnerable people and crime, so neither is he likely to significantly alter it. I believe a bigger problem than people not being believed is that they are believed, but no one cares what happened to them. Even the media is far more interested in the hoax angle to this story than they ever were about the alleged hate crime. As Phillip Bump wrote in The Washington Post in February, the debunking of Smollett’s claim had gotten far more coverage than the initial claim. Folks, what you are seeing is a media being bullied into bending over backward to placate the people who endlessly accuse them of bias. I believe you are also seeing an expression of subconscious race bias in the media itself that truly registers sensation at the thought of this black man’s deception. Smollett’s greatest offense in this regard was not lying, if indeed he did, but lying about white people who support a racist in the White House. Conservatives need this Smollett story to have legs. If Smollett’s racists were imaginary, then they can argue the racists we all see are imaginary. They can paint our condemnation of the white supremacy we see resurging all around us as mere callous manipulation, which is the accusation against Smollett. The fact that the media is still obsessing about this story two months in and being used by people who want to push a narrative that Smollett damaged race relations, rather than acknowledging that race relations have already been ripped to shreds in the Trump era, is the real embarrassment.

2019,"Who Should Own Photos of Slaves? The Descendants, not Harvard, a Lawsuit Says","NORWICH, Conn. — The two slaves, a father and daughter, were stripped to the waist and positioned for frontal and side views. Then, like subjects in contemporary mug shots, their pictures were taken, as part of a racist study arguing that black people were an inferior race. Almost 170 years later, they are at the center of a dispute over who should own the fruits of American slavery. The images of the father and daughter, identified by their first names, Renty and Delia, were commissioned by a professor at Harvard and are now stored in a museum on campus as precious cultural artifacts. But to the Lanier family, they are records of a personal family history. “These were our bedtime stories,” Shonrael Lanier said. On Wednesday, Ms. Lanier’s mother, Tamara, 54, filed a lawsuit in Massachusetts saying that she is a direct descendant of Renty and Delia, and that the valuable photographs are rightfully hers. The case renews focus on the role that the country’s oldest universities played in slavery, and comes amid a growing debate over whether the descendants of enslaved people are entitled to reparations — and what those reparations might look like. “It is unprecedented in terms of legal theory and reclaiming property that was wrongfully taken,” Benjamin Crump, one of Ms. Lanier’s lawyers, said. “Renty’s descendants may be the first descendants of slave ancestors to be able to get their property rights.” Jonathan Swain, a spokesman for Harvard, declined to comment on the lawsuit. [For more coverage of race, sign up here to have our Race/Related newsletter delivered weekly to your inbox.] Universities in recent years have acknowledged and expressed contrition for their ties to slavery. Harvard Law School abandoned an 80-year-old shield based on the crest of a slaveholding family that helped endow the institution. Georgetown University decided to give an advantage in admissions to descendants of enslaved people who were sold to fund the school. A series of federal laws has also compelled museums to repatriate human remains and sacred objects to Native American tribes. The lawsuit says the images are the “spoils of theft,” because as slaves Renty and Delia were unable to give consent. It says that the university is illegally profiting from the images by using them for “advertising and commercial purposes,” such as by using Renty’s image on the cover of a $40 anthropology book. And it argues that by holding on to the images, Harvard has perpetuated the hallmarks of slavery that prevented African-Americans from holding, conveying or inheriting personal property. “I keep thinking, tongue in cheek a little bit, this has been 169 years a slave, and Harvard still won’t free Papa Renty,” said Mr. Crump, who in 2012 represented the family of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teenager killed by a community watch member in Florida. Ms. Lanier is also represented by Josh Koskoff, a lawyer who represents families of the Sandy Hook elementary school massacre victims. Renty and Delia were among seven slaves who appeared in 15 images made using the daguerreotype process, an early form of photography imprinted on silvered copper plates. The pictures are haunting and voyeuristic, with the subjects staring at the camera with detached expressions. The daguerreotypes were commissioned by Louis Agassiz, a Swiss-born zoologist and Harvard professor who is sometimes called the father of American natural science. They were taken in 1850 by J.T. Zealy, in a studio in Columbia, S.C. Agassiz, a rival of Charles Darwin, subscribed to polygenesis, the theory that black and white people descended from different origins. The theory, later discredited, was used to promote the racist idea that black people were inferior to whites. Agassiz viewed the slaves as anatomical specimens to document his beliefs, according to historical sources. The daguerreotypes were forgotten until they were discovered in an unused storage cabinet in the attic of Harvard’s Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology in 1976. They were thought to be the earliest known photographs of American slaves. Notes found with the images give small clues as to the identity of the slaves — their names, plantations and tribes. Renty was born in Congo, according to the label on his daguerreotype. In 2017, Ms. Lanier and her daughter attended a conference at Harvard on the links between academia and slavery that included speakers such as Drew Faust, Harvard’s president at the time, and the writer Ta-Nehisi Coates. They said they were offended to see the speakers positioned under a huge projection of Renty’s face. Mr. Coates, the author of a widely discussed article making the case for reparations, said in an interview that while he deeply respected the scholars at the conference, he sympathized with Ms. Lanier’s cause. “That photograph is like a hostage photograph,” Mr. Coates said of Renty’s image. “This is an enslaved black man with no choice being forced to participate in white supremacist propaganda — that’s what that photograph was taken for.” He said he understood how Ms. Lanier felt seeing it at the conference. “I get why it would bother her,” he said. “I wasn’t aware of all that at the time.” Interviewed at her home in Norwich, Ms. Lanier, a retired chief probation officer for the State of Connecticut, said she had not heard of the photos until about 2010, when she began tracing her genealogy for a family project. Her mother, Mattye Pearl Thompson-Lanier, who died that year, had passed down a strong oral tradition of their family’s lineage from an African ancestor called “Papa Renty.” Shonrael, Ms. Lanier’s daughter, wrote a fifth-grade project about her ancestor in 1996. The lawsuit could hinge on evidence of that chain of ancestry. Ms. Lanier’s amateur sleuthing led to death records, census records and a handwritten inventory from 1834 of the slaves on the plantation of Col. Thomas Taylor in Columbia and their dollar values. The slave inventory lists a Big Renty and a Renty, and listed under the latter is Delia. Ms. Lanier believes that Big Renty is her “Papa Renty” and the father of Renty and Delia, and has traced them to her mother, who was born to sharecroppers in Montgomery, Ala. Her genealogical research has its skeptics. Gregg Hecimovich, who is contributing to a book about the slave daguerreotypes, to be published by the Peabody next year, said it was important to note that the slave inventory has the heading “To Wit, in Families.” Big Renty and Renty are at the top of separate groupings, he said, implying that they are the heads of separate families. “I’d be very excited to work with Tamara,” said Dr. Hecimovich, who is chairman of the English department at Furman University. “But the bigger issue is it would be very hard to make a slam-dunk case that she believes she has.” Molly Rogers, the author of a previous book about the images called “Delia’s Tears,” said that tracing families under slavery was extremely complex. “It’s not necessarily by blood,” she said. “It could be people who take responsibility for each other. Terms, names, family relationships are very much complicated by the fact of slavery.” One intellectual property lawyer, Rick Kurnit, said he thought Ms. Lanier would have a hard time claiming ownership of the daguerreotypes. He said the famous photograph “V-J Day in Times Square,” for instance, belonged to the photographer and not to the sailor or the nurse who are kissing. But that image, of course, was taken in a public space. Yxta Maya Murray, a professor at Loyola Law School, Los Angeles, said that images taken by force were tantamount to robbery. “If she’s a descendant, then I would stand for her,” Professor Murray said of Ms. Lanier. One argument for keeping the daguerreotypes in a museum is that they are fragile physical objects, which degrade when exposed to light, said Robin Bernstein, a professor of cultural history at Harvard who has studied them. She declined to take a position in the legal dispute, but said that the images were safe at the Peabody. “Frankly, there are other repositories to keep them safe,” she said. “What I do know is that no ordinary individual such as myself could keep them safe in a home.” The question remains what Ms. Lanier would do with the images of Renty and Delia if she were to win her case in court. Ms. Lanier, who is asking for a jury trial and unspecified punitive and emotional damages, says she does not know, and would have to have a family meeting about it. She does not rule out licensing the images. Mr. Crump, her lawyer, had another idea. The daguerreotypes, he said, should be taken on a tour of America, so that everyone can see them.",The New York Times
2019,Who Will Be the 2020 Climate Candidate? There Are Lots of Choices,"Climate Fwd: Also this week: We’re getting ready to live without plastic packaging. How hard could it be? Welcome to the Climate Fwd: newsletter. The New York Times climate team emails readers once a week with stories and insights about climate change. Sign up here to get it in your inbox. Hi, everybody! As the world heats up, we’re seeing the effects in the oceans, which have absorbed about 90 percent of the heat trapped by excess greenhouse gases since midcentury. Our colleague Kendra Pierre-Louis has written two warm-ocean articles since our last newsletter. One, with Nadja Popovich, looks at the increasing number of ocean heat waves and the damage they are doing to marine life. The other covers a study that says fish populations are declining as oceans warm, putting a major source of the world’s nutrition at risk. That’s more evidence that climate change is on the march. But in Washington, President Trump is increasingly isolated in his denial of climate science, even among some senior Republicans. He is still getting his way on environmental issues in Congress, however, most recently with the confirmation of Andrew R. Wheeler, a former coal lobbyist, to head the Environmental Protection Agency. But activists are pushing the Democratic leadership to take on warming as a major issue. That hasn’t worked in the past, said David Axelrod, who was chief strategist to President Barack Obama. “Climate change, to our frustration, was never an issue that rung a bell with voters, particularly in the throes of coming out of an economic crisis,” he said. “But now we’re a decade down the road, and the road is surrounded by floods and fires in a way that is becoming more and more visible.” More visible, yes — but still open to a degree of rhetorical twisting. Brad Plumer explored the “weather wars,” in which scientists are increasingly comfortable explaining the links between extreme weather events and climate change, but every cold snap gets trumpeted by those who deny the scientific evidence for global warming. Another recent study suggested that people may become inured to weather extremes over time. The researchers looked at billions of messages on social media and found that when weather extremes occurred repeatedly, people were less likely to comment about them online. Researchers suggested that this phenomenon might limit the public’s willingness to support action on global warming. Well, you might ask, which is it? Will climate change shift the goal posts of normality, or will there be louder calls for action? The 2020 presidential race might help sort that out. It’s official: The 2020 Democratic presidential field is now awash with climate candidates. Over the weekend, Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington announced that he would run, declaring himself the “only candidate who will make defeating climate change our nation’s No. 1 priority.” In fact, every other Democratic presidential candidate has underlined his or her commitment to curbing planet-warming emissions — making the 2020 election much different from four years ago, when climate change was rarely mentioned. “For far too long, climate change didn’t get nearly the attention that it deserved, either on the campaign trail or off, and that clearly has changed in a major way,” said Tiernan Sittenfeld, senior vice president for government affairs at the League of Conservation Voters. In addition to Governor Inslee, Senators Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have all identified climate change as a top campaign issue, as has John Hickenlooper, the former governor of Colorado. To varying degrees they have all also expressed support for the Green New Deal, a nonbinding congressional resolution that calls for a 10-year mobilization to dramatically reduce the burning of fossil fuels in the United States. Some political scientists have suggested that extreme weather has made the issue of climate change more immediate for voters. Others say that President Trump’s denial of climate science has actually highlighted the problem. And the Green New Deal and one of its main sponsors, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, have sparked new enthusiasm among Democratic voters. Thomas J. Pyle, the president of the Institute for Energy Research, a think tank that supports fossil fuels, said that, with so many Democratic candidates talking about climate, it would be harder for a candidate like Governor Inslee to stand out. “If he ran in the last go-round he could probably distinguish himself as Mr. Green Jeans, but he’s just going to be one more voice in the choir promoting these extreme ideas,” Mr. Pyle said. One thing that’s been missing from the early campaign discourse, however, is what the candidates would actually do. For all the talk of a Green New Deal, there has been little support for its main policy prescription: a price on carbon. Robert Shrum, a professor of politics at the University of Southern California and a longtime adviser to Democratic candidates, said he was not concerned by the lack of specifics at this point. “There will be a lot of push in the Democratic primaries to pin people down on specific positions, but right now it’s early days,” Mr. Shrum said. “What’s clear is that the climate issue really matters.” When it comes to leading a sustainable lifestyle, I think I’m doing an O.K. job. But I have to admit that I waste a lot of plastic. I just took a quick look around my kitchen and found about 20 food products in nonrecyclable plastic packaging, including baked tofu, smoked salmon, goat cheese, spices, cereals and chocolate chip cookies. In a matter of days, all that plastic will end up in the trash can, and it will later be part of the roughly 35 million tons of plastic that waste disposal services collect every year in the United States. Though some of these plastics will be recycled and reused as something else, chances are that they’ll eventually wind up in a landfill or in the environment anyway. According to a United Nations estimate, by 2050, there will be roughly 12 billion metric tons of plastic litter in landfills or the environment worldwide, and it will stay there for hundreds of years because plastics decompose so slowly. Since most food products and toiletries come in disposable plastic packaging, is it possible to avoid using plastic in this way? Sophie Bortolussi, a dancer and choreographer in New York City, has been trying to do just that for about a year — “for the common good,” she said. Finding staples like bread, yogurt, coffee and pasta in reusable or biodegradable packaging was easy, but nowadays she very rarely buys sparkling water, olives, berries and cookies. She shops in food co-ops, farmers’ markets and old-school grocery stores that sell products in bulk. “I’ve created new habits around my plastic-free lifestyle by learning what I can buy and where,” she said. She’s far from the only person trying to go “zero waste.” Many converts chronicle their waste-free lifestyles in blogs and YouTube videos, and some pioneers, like Lauren Singer, have started businesses that sell package-free products. Sabrina Katz, 24, says she was once a “shopaholic,” but in college she came across Ms. Singer’s blog Trash Is For Tossers, which inspired her to go plastic-free. It wasn’t easy — she had to give up chips, many tofu products, granola bars and Oreos. But three and a half years later, she still buys most of her groceries at stores that sell in bulk and takes them home in Mason jars. “The foods that I find in bulk are really healthy foods — things like beans, whole grains, oats, pasta and fresh fruits and vegetables,” she said. “That means that I cook most of what I eat, which is a blessing and a curse.” Like Ms. Bortolussi and Ms. Katz, I want to see if I can reduce the amount of plastic I waste. Over the next week, I’ll adopt a lifestyle free of plastic packaging. I think it will be “a blessing and a curse.” Next week, I’ll let you know how the experiment went.

2019,Who Won Last Night’s N.C.A.A. Tournament Games,"Here is who won on the first day (and night) of the N.C.A.A.’s men’s basketball tournament. (No. 10) Minnesota 86 — (No. 7) Louisville 76 Minnesota, coached by Richard Pitino, came alive with 3-pointers, a hallmark of Louisville, once coached by his father, Rick Pitino. Family drama settled, on to the next one. (No. 3) LSU 79 — (No. 14) Yale 74 Yale, which trailed by 9-0 and by 16 points at halftime, could not come all the way back against L.S.U., which made enough free throws down the stretch to win. (No. 5 Auburn) 78 — (No. 12) New Mexico State 77 It was the buzzer-beater that wasn’t. New Mexico State’s Trevelin Queen fired a would-be 3-pointer that could have provided an astonishing upset.

2019,Opinion | Whom to Elect for a Foreign Policy Crisis at 3 A.M.?,"So far, no Democratic candidate is claiming to be ready. Opinion Columnist As the 2020 campaign gets underway, we’ve heard about a Green New Deal, Medicare for all, breaking up Amazon and universal basic income — to name but a few of the ideas raised by Democratic presidential hopefuls. But one issue has been largely absent: foreign policy — the potential use of force, great-power competition and the management of alliances that will be more important during the next presidency than it has been in three decades. Maybe I missed it, but I haven’t heard any of the Democrats running on the argument that he or she is the best person to answer the White House crisis line at 3 in the morning. They all seem inclined to let that call go to voice mail. I hope that doesn’t last, because that phone will be ringing. This will be an extraordinarily volatile and confusing time for U.S. foreign policy. We’re in the post-post-Cold War era — an era when being secretary of state, let alone president, has become a terrible job. (If anyone asks you to become secretary of state, say you had your heart set on secretary of agriculture.) The post-Cold War era had its issues — 9/11, Iraq and Afghanistan, to be sure — but it was in many ways a unipolar belle epoque, in which an American hegemon stifled any serious great-power conflict. The post-post-Cold War era, which has been slowly unfolding since the early 2000s, requires a president to manage and juggle three huge geopolitical trends — and the interactions between them — all at once. The first is the resurgence of three big regional powers: Russia, China and Iran. Each is seeking to dominate its home region and is willing to use force for that purpose. This trend is compellingly described in a new book by Michael Mandelbaum, the Johns Hopkins emeritus professor of U.S. foreign policy, titled “The Rise and Fall of Peace on Earth.” As Mandelbuam notes, in Europe, Russia has occupied part of Ukraine. In East Asia, China has claimed most of the Western Pacific as its own territory, contrary to international law; has built artificial islands there; and has placed military installations on them. In the Middle East, Iran has trained and funded proxy forces in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen and has pursued nuclear weapons. “The three have an important motive in common: All are dictatorships trying to generate support among those they rule through aggressive nationalism, at the expense of their neighbors,” Mandelbaum (with whom I co-wrote a book in 2011) remarked to me. “The combination of their insecurities and their ambitions has revived political and military competition among the strongest countries in the world. Indeed, the world of 2019 more closely resembles the world of the Cold War than of the 25 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall.” If this first trend requires a president who can manage strength — ours and that of Russia, China and Iran — the second trend will require a deft touch at managing weakness. We are going to see more and more weak states — like Venezuela, Libya, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and many in sub-Saharan Africa — either fall apart or hemorrhage lots of their people, because they are unable to manage the stresses from climate change, population explosion, ecosystem breakdowns and the rapid accelerations in globalization and technology. If you think managing strength is hard, try managing weakness — try attempting to put broken countries back together. It’s hell on wheels. But that will be a big challenge for the next president because the mass migrations of people away from these disorderly and failing states to zones of order, which is what is driving the current U.S. and European border crises, are not going away. Consider this Washington Post report last week: “The number of people taken into custody along the Mexico border jumped an additional 31 percent last month as an unprecedented mass migration of families from Central America pushes unauthorized crossings to the highest levels in a decade, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection figures.” The story added that last month, the busiest February at the border since 2007, authorities detained 76,103 migrants, up from 58,207 in January, and it quoted Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan as saying: “The system is well beyond capacity and remains at a breaking point.” For the third trend, the next president will have to manage not only rival superpowers and disorder but also super-empowered small groups and individuals, because of how technology acceleration is putting incredibly powerful, cheap, small tools — for cyberwarfare, election hacking and financial hacking — into the hands of small units, vastly expanding their attack surfaces. These cyber tools are all getting fast, cheap and deep. That is, they can go deeper inside your company, your email, your election, your power grid or your bank account — every single day. This makes them easier to be weaponized by small units (like North Korea) and individuals so they can have outsize impacts through deep fake, deep surveillance, deep cyber theft. Which brings us back to the thesis of “The Rise and Fall of Peace on Earth.” The resurgent competition between us, China, Russia and Iran means that instead of our having their cooperation “to try to manage state failure and the technological tsunami, the three revisionists are making them worse,” Mandelbaum told me. “Russia and Iran took the lead in devastating Syria, producing a flood of refugees that has, among other things, destabilized Europe. And all three have weaponized the new technology, hacking the U.S. and Europe and, in the case of Russia, even interfering with an American election.” This means there will be even more pressure on the next president to find allies and build alliances to maintain order. Only the U.S. has the ability to organize coalitions to deter Russia, China and Iran, Mandelbaum argues. Only the U.S. has the resources and the experience to lead a global effort to try to cope with state failure. “And since much of the new technology was invented and applied here, the U.S. is in the best position to figure out how to cope with it.” Among President Trump’s greatest foreign policy weaknesses is his inability to build and maintain alliances. Few other countries want to follow him into battle. The winner of the 2020 election, whether Trump or someone else, is going to pay for the way Trump has allowed our traditional alliances to wither and has made the U.S. administration (not people) so unpopular with populations from Canada to Mexico to Europe to Asia to the Middle East that many of their leaders do not feel comfortable standing with our president, even if they are so inclined. That is not Trump’s only poisoned legacy. The other is that he shows no interest in democracy promotion, and that, too, is more important than ever, because democracies are much less prone to war. But we’re in a democracy recession now. Leaders from China to Egypt to Uganda to Turkey are all making themselves presidents for life. “The principal disturbers of the peace — Russia, China, and Iran — are all dictatorships that seek popular support, can no longer get it through economic growth, don’t have the option of getting it through democracy, and in fact fear that democratic demands and democratic forces will unseat them,” Mandelbaum said. “Their aggressive policies are designed to protect their regimes against, most of all, democracy.” So hold onto your hats: Great-power conflict is in, but U.S. democracy promotion is out. We need allies more than ever, and we have fewer than ever. And some guy in Moldova with a cellphone and a few cyber tools can now shut off the power grid in Montana. No wonder no one wants to boast being the best person to answer the White House crisis line at 3 a.m. They all prefer to let it ring and hope that it’s a wrong number.

2019,Who’s Investigating Justin Trudeau — and What Do They Hope to Find?,"Canada Letter In Canada, the House of Commons’ justice committee generally goes about its work in earnest obscurity. Jody Wilson-Raybould, a former cabinet minister, dramatically changed that with her appearance on Wednesday, which stretched on for almost four hours. [Want the Canada Letter in your inbox every week? Sign up here.] Ms. Wilson-Raybould accused Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, his aides and others of applying improper pressure and making “veiled threats” to get her to reach a settlement in a criminal corruption case involving SNC-Lavalin, the major construction and engineering company in Montreal. We did, of course, keep a watch on her testimony, its immediate aftermath and the possible consequences for Mr. Trudeau: [Read: Trudeau Promised a Fresh Approach to Politics. Now He’s Embroiled in Scandal] [Read: Trudeau’s Political Woes Mount With Demands for More Inquiries] [Read: Trudeau’s Ex-Attorney General: ‘Veiled Threats’ Were Made to Drop Case] It’s risky to predict how this will all play out, both in the short term and for October’s federal election. That’s in part because those outcomes will likely be affected by a series of investigations, both active and proposed, into the actions of the prime minister and his aides. Here’s a look at who’s seeking answers, what they could uncover, and who else might still take a peek: What’s Already Underway • Parliamentary hearings: The House of Commons’ Standing Committee on Justice is where Ms. Wilson-Raybould finally broke her silence this week. It’s also where other key players are set to appear, notably Gerald Butts, Mr. Trudeau’s friend who stepped down last month as his top political adviser amid the scandal. But the justice committee isn’t set up to run a full-scale investigation. It has neither a team of people digging up evidence, nor the power to order up internal government documents. And, as the opposition has repeatedly pointed out this week, the Liberals control the committee. This makes it unlikely that anything the panel does will inflict much harm on Mr. Trudeau. • An ethics investigation: After a request from two New Democratic Party lawmakers, the conflict of interest and ethics commissioner, Mario Dion, is also on the case. But by law, he can only look for possible conflicts of interest. Simply applying pressure for political advantage doesn’t amount to such a conflict, earlier commissioners have ruled. Past investigations by the ethics commissioner’s office have dragged on for more than a year, and the office has no power to order serious sanctions. What May Come Next • A criminal investigation: The Conservative leader Andrew Scheer and others have asked the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to look into possible obstruction of justice. The police force, citing standard policy, will not confirm whether it’s started an investigation or plans to do so. And there’s a good chance that we’ll never know whether the Mounties made Mr. Trudeau the target of an investigation. The reason goes back to 2005, when the force sent a fax to a New Democratic member of Parliament confirming that it was investigating then-Finance Minister Ralph Goodale in connection with illegal stock trading. Arriving in the midst of a federal election campaign, the fax exploded like a bomb. Mr. Goodale was cleared; a public servant in the finance department later pleaded guilty to insider trading charges. An investigation later found no fault with the police force, but the Mounties were widely criticized as having meddled in politics. They have been more circumspect about politically sensitive investigations since then. Today, as Mr. Trudeau’s public safety minister, Mr. Goodale oversees the Mounties. •An independent public inquiry: Jagmeet Singh, the leader of the New Democrats, was the first to push for an independent special commission to look into the affair, and the idea has support from other opposition parties. Mr. Trudeau has taken the position that the Justice Committee hearings and the conflict of interest investigation are all that’s needed. An inquiry is the least appealing option for the Liberals, who remember all too well the Gomery Commission. Then-Prime Minister Paul Martin meant for it to clear the air around the Liberals after a corruption scandal involving the previous Liberal government. But it backfired. Evidence presented at the inquiry only highlighted the corruption, and Mr. Martin’s loss in the 2006 election was widely attributed to the hearings. Any inquiry into the current scandal is unlikely to be finished before October’s vote. But the hearings would certainly provide the kind of publicity the Liberals don’t want leading up to, and during, an election campaign. — This week’s Trans Canada and Around The Times highlights were compiled by Lindsey Wiebe, the Canada audience growth editor. —Hockey Night with Huawei?

To the Editor: “Afghan Leaders’ Anger Over Peace Talks Is Focused on the U.S. Diplomat in Charge” (news article, March 16) did not fully capture the concerns of Afghans over the talks between the United States and the Taliban. We Afghans are getting angry, frustrated and worried. We are angry that a monumental deal about the future of our country is being made without our presence. Our elected government and our people are being sidelined from the peace talks. We are frustrated that the United States is considering agreeing on a timeline for the withdrawal of American troops in exchange for the Taliban’s empty promise to oppose international terrorist organizations in Afghanistan. The Taliban’s ambitions for an Islamic emirate, a theocratic totalitarian government, have not changed. We are worried that American taxpayers’ frustration over the expensive and unending Afghan war will push their leaders to make a rushed decision with dire consequences for Afghanistan. A precipitate withdrawal of American troops without a successful peace deal between the United States, the Afghan government and the Taliban will lead to a protracted civil war.

2019,"Why Allen Weisselberg, Trump’s Money Man, Could Face Scrutiny Next","[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] In testimony before Congress this week, Michael Cohen cast himself as a central figure in schemes that could threaten the presidency of Donald J. Trump. But Mr. Cohen said he didn’t work alone, unexpectedly mentioning by name the involvement of another member of Mr. Trump’s inner circle, Allen Weisselberg, more than 20 times. The revelations are set to intensify the scrutiny on Mr. Weisselberg, Mr. Trump’s unassuming 71-year-old chief financial officer, who already is a focus for federal prosecutors in New York. On Wednesday, Mr. Cohen specifically identified Mr. Weisselberg as helping mastermind a strategy to mask reimbursements to Mr. Cohen for his payment to Stormy Daniels, the pornographic film actress who said she had an affair with Mr. Trump. Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, said after Wednesday’s hearing that he “probably will” want to call additional witnesses, including Mr. Weisselberg, to gather additional evidence about the hush-money payment. A Democratic official said that the House Intelligence Committee anticipates calling Mr. Weisselberg to testify, as well. Mr. Cohen said in the hearing that the payment was ordered by Mr. Trump, which violated campaign finance laws because it was intended to buy Ms. Daniels’s silence so that she could not hurt Mr. Trump’s prospects right before the election. Mr. Cohen said he had paid Ms. Daniels with his own money, and then was repaid by the Trump Organization. “Allen Weisselberg made the decision that it should be paid over the 12 months so that it would look like a retainer,” Mr. Cohen told lawmakers, describing how reimbursements were made monthly. Mr. Cohen submitted to Congress a copy of a $35,000 check — labeled exhibit 5b — that he said was one of those monthly payments. It was signed by Mr. Weisselberg and Donald Trump Jr. Mr. Weisselberg declined to comment through his lawyers. But it is clear why lawmakers and investigators might home in on him as they examine the Trump Organization’s finances. After Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty to campaign finance fraud and other crimes in August, federal prosecutors in Manhattan began focusing on what role the Trump Organization and its executives, including Mr. Weisselberg, played in the campaign finance scheme, according to people briefed on the matter. As part of the investigation, Mr. Weisselberg was granted limited immunity to testify before a federal grand jury last year. But there has been no indication that he has cooperated with prosecutors. Mr. Weisselberg, an accountant, began his career doing the books for Mr. Trump’s father in a dingy building in Brooklyn. For decades, he has represented Mr. Trump on paperwork for everything from complex real estate deals to the operations of the antique carousel in Central Park, which the Trump Organization runs. In 2015, a lawyer representing students who alleged they were defrauded by Mr. Trump’s education venture, Trump University, questioned Mr. Weisselberg during a deposition, describing him as “Mr. Trump’s eyes and ears for his investments.” Mr. Weisselberg replied, “Am I his eyes and ears? From an economic standpoint,” court records show. In 2016, Mr. Trump settled the case for $25 million. Corey Lewandowski, a former Trump campaign official, wrote in a book that he co-authored, “Let Trump Be Trump” that Mr. Weisselberg “knows of every dime that leaves the building.” Aside from Mr. Weisselberg, several other Trump associates may now be asked to testify before the House in the wake of Mr. Cohen’s hearing, including three executives at the Trump Organization: Matthew Calamari, Alan Garten and Ronald C. Lieberman. But Mr. Cummings said the committee would have to proceed carefully to avoid interfering with the investigation by federal prosecutors in the special counsel’s office and the United States attorney’s office in Manhattan. Still in an indication of what may come, Mr. Cummings has sent letters to two lawyers he said were involved in preparing Mr. Trump’s federal financial disclosure filing, which originally omitted payments he made to reimburse Mr. Cohen for the payment to Ms. Daniels. The letters requested that the lawyers, Sheri A. Dillon and Stefan C. Passantino, appear for interviews with the committee in March. Ms. Dillon is a tax lawyer who represents Mr. Trump. Mr. Passantino was a deputy White House counsel at the time focused on ethics, but has since left and now advises the Trump Organization on how to deal with House investigations. Mr. Weisselberg has previously been questioned under oath, in a lawsuit filed last year by the New York attorney general against the Trump Foundation, Mr. Trump’s charitable organization, where he served as treasurer. In late December, the foundation was dissolved after the attorney general accused it of fraud. The United States attorney’s office in Manhattan and the New York attorney general’s office declined to comment. Mr. Weisselberg’s involvement in the hush money payments to women first surfaced last year, when federal prosecutors seized recordings from Mr. Cohen’s office. On one of the recordings, Mr. Cohen was heard saying, “I’ve spoken to Allen Weisselberg about how to set the whole thing up.” For his part, Mr. Trump has expressed confidence that Mr. Weisselberg will not turn on the president. “100 percent he didn’t,” Mr. Trump told reporters for Bloomberg when asked last year whether Mr. Weisselberg had betrayed him. “He’s a wonderful guy.” Others are not so certain. “I am sure Allen does not want to hurt Donald, I am sure there is an affection there,” said Barbara Res, a former executive with the Trump Organization who is a critic of the president. “But he’s in a terrible position — and Donald put him there.” One secret to Mr. Weisselberg’s lifelong career with the Trump family is his earthy modesty, according to friends and biographers of Mr. Trump. He wears dark, unflashy suits and cultivates a salt-and-pepper mustache. He still shows up to his desk in Trump Tower every day, watching over the organization’s finances. “He did whatever was necessary to protect the bottom line,” Mr. Trump wrote about Mr. Weisselberg in his book “Think Like a Billionaire.” As a child in Brownsville, Brooklyn, Mr. Weisselberg played punchball until dark and rode the city bus to school for 15 cents. In “The Aurora,” the green, clothbound yearbook of the Thomas Jefferson High School class of 1965, he appears as a cowlicked teenage boy, and names his dream profession: accountant. President Trump’s father made that dream come true: In 1973 he hired Mr. Weisselberg to do his accounting at an office in Gravesend, Brooklyn. Mr. Weisselberg never lost his Brownsville humility, even as his employer lavished him with things like private jet rides to the pool at Mar-a-Lago and at least one advantageous real estate deal. “He is the embodiment of an accountant,” said Gwenda Blair, who interviewed Mr. Weisselberg for her 2000 book, “The Trumps.” Mr. Weisselberg’s lifestyle has remained modest, even as he rose to an office on the 26th floor of Trump Tower. He lived in a ranch-style house in Wantagh, Long Island with his wife of nearly 50 years, Hilary, before selling it in 2013 for $468,000. In 2002, they spent $282,000 for a vacation property — a low-slung house that backs up to a lagoon in Boynton Beach, Fla. Most recently, the Weisselbergs rented an apartment in a Trump-branded building on Riverside Boulevard. (In 2016, over 800 residents voted to strip the Trump name from its facade.) Mr. Weisselberg’s loyalty has been well-compensated, and his whole family has benefited from the relationship with Mr. Trump. One of Mr. Weisselberg’s sons, Barry, has been the property manager of Trump Wollman Rink for the past 17 years, according to his LinkedIn profile. There, he once hosted Hanukkah on Ice, dialing up his dad and putting him on speaker phone so he could hear the holiday songs. Barry Weisselberg declined to comment. Mr. Weisselberg’s other son, Jack, works at Ladder Capital, a real estate investment trust that is one of the Trump Organization’s biggest creditors. Jack has benefited in other ways: In 2000, his father purchased a one-bedroom apartment in the Trump Parc East building overlooking Central Park. It cost $152,500, which appears to have been purchased profoundly under market value, according to property records. He transferred the deed to his son Jack, according to property records, who flipped it for more than four times the original price in 2006. Jack Weisselberg did not respond to email or phone messages. Aside from an awkward cameo on the second season of Mr. Trump’s television show, “The Apprentice,” Mr. Weisselberg has until recently stayed out of the limelight, focusing on serving his boss. In his books and in interviews, the president has described Mr. Weisselberg as his go-to man, whether it was to help pick carpet swatches for a development, or to strong-arm firms with which he contracted. In Mr. Cohen’s testimony on Wednesday, Mr. Trump’s reliance on his C.F.O. was on display. When it came to paying back his fixer for the hush money, Mr. Cohen said the president turned to Mr. Weisselberg. “He acknowledged to Allen that he was going to pay the $130,000,” Mr. Cohen said, “And that Allen and I should go back to his office and figure out how to do it.” An earlier version of this article misidentified the street where the Weisselbergs rented an apartment in a Trump-branded building. It is on Riverside Boulevard, not Riverside Drive.",The New York Times
2019,Why America Loves Alex Trebek,"Katie Couric, Cher, Stephen A. Smith and former contestants expressed support and hope for the ‘Jeopardy’ host after he revealed his cancer diagnosis this week. When Alex Trebek announced this week that he had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, the outpouring of shock and support started immediately. Katie Couric, a longtime fan of the show who has turned down multiple invitations to participate in Celebrity Jeopardy for fear that “I’m going to choke and embarrass myself,” offered to introduce Mr. Trebek to a specialist in pancreatic cancer. Ms. Couric said that she had long found Mr. Trebek to be a reassuring presence, since she first started watching with her husband Jay Monahan, who was diagnosed with colon cancer and died in 1998. “He always crushed it on ‘Jeopardy,’” Ms. Couric said of her husband. “It was one of the many reasons I loved him. He could’ve kicked Ken Jennings’ butt.” (Mr. Jennings won 74 consecutive games.) Others who sent their best wishes to Mr. Trebek also said they strongly associated the show he has hosted for 35 years with a family member. That includes the sports commentator Stephen A. Smith, who tweeted that “Jeopardy” had been his mom’s favorite show. “Over the years, anytime I went home at 7 p.m. in New York City, she was laying in the bed watching ‘Jeopardy.’ I had to sit there and watch ‘Jeopardy’ with her if I was going to spend time with her,” Mr. Smith said. Mr. Smith’s mother died in 2017. “My heart goes out to him,” he said of Mr. Trebek, “because every time I see him, I see my mom.” Mr. Trebek, who will turn 79 in July, took over “Jeopardy” in 1984, when the show was revived by its creator Merv Griffin. (It had previously been canceled several times.) With Mr. Trebek at the helm, the quiz-show game sped up and its viewership increased, cementing its place as an evening ritual for families in the United States. Originally from Canada, Mr. Trebek became an American institution — and, then, in 1997, a U.S. citizen. He and the show both seemed so impervious to age that viewers reacted with shock to any mild change, such as when Mr. Trebek shaved his mustache. And larger modifications, such as when the show revoked a work-week-long limit on how many times a winner could return to compete in the next day’s contest, proved contentious. “I call it term limits,” said Richard Cordray, a five-time champion in the 1980s who went on to become the first director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. “We always were annoyed. All of us who won five times thought we would go on forever.” That small gripe aside, Mr. Cordray spoke admiringly of Mr. Trebek’s star quality, remarking on the way it propelled the show for so long: “Obviously he’s someone that people have really liked having in their living room for the last 35 years. It’s true of certain newscasters, it’s true of a few others — it’s a difficult quality to put your finger on but when somebody has it, it’s very apparent and he has it.” Fans expected Mr. Trebek to go on forever as well, though Mr. Trebek has suffered several health scares in the past dozen years, including two heart attacks and a fall in 2017 that required him to undergo brain surgery. “He just seems sort of immortal,” the journalist Jeffrey Toobin said in an interview. “I don’t think of him as having aged much.” “I’ve always found that when you arrive in a hotel room where you have no real sense of where you are, turning ‘Jeopardy’ on is always kind of a grounding experience,” Mr. Toobin said. “It was serenely the same at all times. Yet always interesting to watch.” Ms. Couric echoed that thought. “His omnipresence is very reassuring,” she said. “Jeopardy” contestants who had met Mr. Trebek recently were as taken aback by the announcement as anyone else. Kristin Philips, who works at the University of Washington and whose “Jeopardy” episode aired Thursday night, said that there had been nothing to indicate that anything had been affecting Mr. Trebek when she filmed with him in January. “I was literally aghast,” she said of the news. “I had no idea.” Sara Callori, a physics professor in Redlands, Calif., who appeared on the show two years ago said that she was surprised, but that she admired Mr. Trebek’s stoicism in the video in which he made the illness public. Ms. Callori has taken to watching the show while she feeds her 10-month-old. “We watch it when he eats breakfast in the morning,” she said. “I was hoping that he would grow up watching Alex Trebek host ‘Jeopardy’ the way I did. I still hope that’s true and that can continue.” Since Mr. Trebek’s announcement, the community of “Jeopardy” alumni has sprung into action, organizing events on his behalf. Chelsea Cohen, a contestant from 2019, is one of several who is setting up a play-along contest to benefit those afflicted with pancreatic cancer. Though home viewers may occasionally detect an edge of condescension in Mr. Trebek’s tone, contestants on the show described him as warm and gracious, putting effort into making them feel special, even though he had done the same for thousands of others. Claire Sattler, the high schooler who won the 2018 Teen Tournament, recalled Mr. Trebek telling her and her peers that it was his favorite of the competitions featured on “Jeopardy.” She assumed he said similar things to everyone. She was moved, later, she said, when in a speech to the competitors’ parents, Mr. Trebek started to tear up when he talked about how proud they should be of their kids. Asked what she would say to Mr. Trebek now, Ms. Sattler thought for a moment. “I hope he knows that he does have the whole support of every person who’s been on ‘Jeopardy,’ every ‘Jeopardy’ fan, along with his family and friends,” she said. “Whether he’s around for 20 more years or whether he’s not, he’s made such an amazing mark on so many individuals. And I just want him to know that as proud as he was of all of my friends in the teen tournament, we’re just as proud of him.” “I’m gonna fight this and I’m gonna keep working,” Mr. Trebek said in his announcement.",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | Why America Needs a Stronger Defense Industry,"Investing in the sector means more jobs at home and improved security abroad. Mr. Navarro is an assistant to the president and the director of the Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy. On Wednesday, President Trump will visit Lima, Ohio, to tour the Joint Systems Manufacturing Center, one of America’s premier defense facilities and the last tank factory in the Western Hemisphere. The story of the day may be about how the Trump administration saved the Lima plant from a near-death experience under President Barack Obama. The story for the history books, however, is about how the factory perfectly encapsulates President Trump’s maxim “economic security is national security.” The Lima factory, operated by General Dynamics, builds the M-1 Abrams, the Army’s main battle tank. This heavily armored war horse played a key role in both the liberation of Kuwait during the Persian Gulf war in the early 1990s and the Iraq war beginning in 2003. It remains a stalwart of Army operations today. In 2012, the Obama administration sought to close the Lima plant as part of the mandated budget sequestration process. Fortunately, the Republican-led Congress rejected that move and appropriated enough funds to keep the factory in business — but the number of employees fell sharply, to just 75. Enter President Trump, with a far different view of the role of a strong military in both defending our homeland and revitalizing our manufacturing base. As part of his significantly increased defense budgets for 2019 and 2020, the president has requested an additional $11 billion to buy combat vehicles like the Abrams, as well as the Stryker combat vehicle, also manufactured in Lima. Even better, spending that $11 billion could actually mean saving money in the long run. By expanding production in Lima, by accelerating the modernization of the Abrams and other armored vehicles and by increasing other economies of scale, the Defense Department will achieve significant cost reductions: Unit costs for the Abrams are expected to drop by more than 10 percent. In terms of economic security, the Trump defense budget is helping to create good manufacturing jobs at good wages, including in communities like Lima that have fallen behind economically. The revitalized Lima plant will directly employ a little more than 1,000 employees. And plants like the one in Lima are drivers for thousands of more jobs in the supply chain across the country. Consider, for example, the ripple effects of the Lima plant. In Ohio alone, 198 of its suppliers are spread out across the state’s 16 congressional districts. These mostly small and medium-size businesses churn out components ranging from bearings, castings and industrial packaging to electronic assemblies, pressure gauges and steel. The impact is not limited to Ohio. Honeywell manufactures the Abrams engine in Alabama, Allison manufactures its transmissions in Indiana, the tank’s main gun is made at the Watervliet Arsenal in New York, special armor comes from the Idaho National Laboratory, and the gun tube preforms come from Ellwood in Pennsylvania. In terms of national security, state of the art tanks like the latest versions of the Abrams are critical tools in increasing the effectiveness of American ground forces, enabling the decisive defeat of the threats outlined in our National Security Strategy and National Defense Strategy. A less obvious, but no less important, benefit comes from sharing these upgraded combat vehicle capacities with our allies and strategic partners through conventional arms sales. In the Middle East, Kuwait’s tank fleet consists of 218 Abrams tanks, and its military is planning to double that number. Saudi Arabia has 374 recently upgraded Abrams tanks, while Egypt has the largest fleet, at 1,130. Australia commands a fleet of 59 Abrams tanks and may order 100 more. Taiwan may soon buy 108 Abrams tanks as well. Those arms sales not only help create good jobs at good wages in America — a principle not well understood by the Obama administration — they also enhance America’s capacity to bolster and stabilize our regional alliances, even as they may reduce the need to deploy more American soldiers overseas. Here, then, is what the grand strategic view from Lima, Ohio, will look like from the presidential podium: While President Dwight Eisenhower in many ways viewed the “military-industrial complex” as a source of waste and inefficiency, the Trump administration sees our defense industrial base as the unshakable foundation of both economic and national security. The president’s bold decision to rescue the Lima plant from the Obama budget sequestration oblivion will reap this nation benefits for years to come. Both the workers and the war fighters of America will be the better for it. Peter Navarro is an assistant to the president and the director of the Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy.

2019,Why Apple’s Big Streaming Play Matters,"California Today Good morning. (Here’s the sign-up, if you don’t already get California Today by email.) Yesterday, Cupertino got the kind of fevered coverage usually reserved for the unveiling of Apple’s latest gadget. But this time, the product wasn’t a watch or a phone. During the two-hour event at the Steve Jobs Theater on Apple’s campus, the company’s leaders detailed its plans to take on Hollywood by creating its own TV shows and documentaries. They also announced a news subscription service and a credit card. Yes, big-name celebrities like Steven Spielberg, Oprah Winfrey and Reese Witherspoon were on hand for the spectacle. But tech watchers were also paying close attention because the announcements are part of a major shift for the Silicon Valley mammoth. Here’s what you need to know: Why is this such a big deal? Apple has spent a decade establishing its dominant place in consumers’ pockets by getting them hooked on iPhones. But after years of record-breaking profits, phone sales are slowing and the company is facing intense competition from the likes of Amazon and Netflix. So, instead of betting on another gadget, Apple made clear yesterday that it’s “trying to make sure you never leave all those Apple devices you have acquired over the years,” as my colleagues Daisuke Wakabayashi and John Koblin reported. That means Apple is bulking up on content and services, and focusing less on hardware. Not that there isn’t a lot of Apple hardware already out there: The company counts roughly 1.4 billion active devices as the perfect vehicles for its new content. What’s this about more subscription services? First, there was Apple TV Plus, the video streaming service, which will have original programs and will include shows from networks like HBO, Showtime and CBS. Beyond that, details were sparse. No price was given. But, as my colleague Edmund Lee explained, one thing’s for sure: You won’t be able to get your favorite Netflix shows. There was more on Apple News Plus, which was described as the “Netflix of news,” but it also raised questions about Apple’s place in an information ecosystem that’s been brutal to existing publishers. A subscription will cost $9.99 per month. It will let subscribers read 300 magazines as well as articles from newspapers including The Los Angeles Times and The Wall Street Journal. Executives with The Journal said they’ll hire new staff members to write content that’s exclusive to the Apple app, which Bloomberg described as a risky move that could “cannibalize existing readership.” Neither The Times nor The Washington Post has signed on. Apple also announced a video game subscription service, Apple Arcade, which is set to start this fall. (We often link to sites that limit access for nonsubscribers.

Every Saturday morning, we email runners with news, advice and some motivation to help you get up and running. Sign up here to get it in your inbox. I want to let you know about a special event The New York Times is holding on the Saturday before the Boston Marathon. Our own Lindsay Crouse — who is a 2:57 marathoner! — is moderating The Race Is On: Top Runners Talk Competition, a panel discussion with Des Linden, winner of the last Boston Marathon; Shalane Flanagan, winner of the 2017 New York City Marathon, Tatyana McFadden, a Paralympian and five-time Boston Marathon winner; Sarah Sellers, who finished second in last year’s race along with other speedy pro women, including Sarah Crouch, Lindsay Flanagan, Sara Hall and Jordan Hasay. They’ll talk about how the women’s field is getting faster than ever before, and how we got here. The chat will start at 3 p.m. April 13 at the Calderwood Pavilion, 527 Tremont Street, Boston. Tickets are $25; readers of this newsletter can use the code RUN for $5 off. If you aren’t running the Boston Marathon on April 15 (as many of us, myself included, are not!) you could give a virtual run a try on that day. This week, I looked into the trend of paying to run races wherever you want. You’re not physically part of a crowd, but you can have some of the sense of participating in a group event — usually with a medal to show for it. I admit that I was surprised at how popular virtual races have become. I run races because I like the communal aspect of the sport and being challenged by other runners. But for runners who can’t necessarily dedicate a day to a race, or who want to try racing without doing it in front of other people, virtual runs are providing a different kind of experience. On the plus side, there’s no crowd at the parking lot or lines for the porta-potties, but there’s also none of the usual support at rest areas or cheering at the finish line.

2019,Opinion | Why Are Republicans Embracing Economic State Planning?,"The U.S. should not copy China’s command-and-control playbook. Markets are still best at driving economic growth. Ms. de Rugy is a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. China’s post-Mao economic boom has occurred only to the extent that the country became capitalist. With “Made in China 2025,” Beijing’s 2015 anticapitalist plan for an industrial policy under which the state would pick “winners,” China has taken a step back from capitalism. (It recently dropped the “Made in China 2025” name, though the policy remains.) It won’t work, but China’s new industrial policy has worked one marvel — namely, scaring many American conservatives into believing that the main driver of economic growth isn’t the market but bureaucrats invested with power to control the allocation of natural and financial resources. Exhibit A is a report just out from the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, headed by Marco Rubio of Florida, on how to counter Beijing’s plan. The report echoes widespread fears about China’s plan to use top-down, nonmarket means such as tariffs, subsidies and capital restrictions to pursue global dominance in 10 industrial sectors like clean-energy cars, robotics and aerospace. The Rubio report asserts that such dominance “would be an unacceptable outcome for American workers.” Mr. Rubio’s somewhat surprising response is to in effect call for the United States to adopt its own industrial policy. It would include prioritizing manufacturing, protecting American companies in industries China wants to make headway in, restrictions on investments and capital flows, tax changes that encourage United States tech companies to spend more on research and development rather than on buybacks, and support for small businesses. China’s economic growth and sheer size are something to reckon with. Yet that doesn’t mean that authoritarian methods will enable China to attain economic dominance. I thought we learned this lesson after many American intellectuals, economists and politicians were proven spectacularly wrong in predicting that the Soviet Union would become an economic rival. State planning will darken China’s economic prospects. Its resources are limited, so any expansive government investment in one, two or 10 sectors of its economy diverts resources from other sectors, threatening their future growth. Free-market proponents usually understand that, plagued by ignorance of all-important localized knowledge, government officials cannot outperform the market at picking winners. In practice it ends up picking losers or hindering the abilities of the winners to achieve their greatest potential. Central planning is antithetical to innovation, as is already visible in China. You can give Senator Rubio some points for consistency: Believing that top-down government planning works in China, he now believes it also works in America. Still, the same obstacles that limit the carrying out of many government policies in the United States — for example, the initial failure to open and maintain the HealthCare.gov website — will ensure that many of Beijing’s plans will fail. But even if this time really is different and China becomes “the global leader in innovation and manufacturing,” it still doesn’t follow that the United States government should respond with more of its own interventions. First, the law of comparative advantage still holds and so it would continue to be beneficial for China to import products that are produced more efficiently elsewhere. Second, the United States has instituted industrial policies in the past out of unwarranted fears of other countries’ industrial policies. The results have always imposed great costs on consumers and taxpayers and introduced significant economic distortions. Conservatives — who take pride in their respect for history — should learn about the failed United States industrial policies of the 1980s, which were responses to the Japanese government’s attempt to dominate key consumer electronics technologies. These efforts worked neither in Japan nor in the United States. The past has taught us that industrial policies fail often because they favor existing industries that are well connected politically at the expense of would-be entrepreneurs and start-ups offering more innovative solutions. And so contrary to the Rubio report, we should not prioritize manufacturing, to cite one example. Yes, manufacturing generates the majority of export revenues in rich countries. But despite popular opinion, trade’s benefits are not measured by the amounts that are exported. As economists since Adam Smith have pointed out, the ultimate goal of trade is to receive as many imports as possible. Also, Mr. Rubio’s report errs in concluding that because manufacturing wages are high, policymakers should work to increase employment in manufacturing. Wages in manufacturing are high because labor-saving innovations have increased workers’ productivity and, thus, their wages. But any workers artificially shifted into manufacturing would be redundant — and being redundant, their productivity and their wages would be low. This doesn’t mean there’s no role for government. In fact, the Clinton years should have taught politicians that the most effective industrial policy is to clear and protect spaces for innovation, as was done in 1997 with the administration’s Framework for Global Electronic Commerce. This posture of “permissionless innovation” for digital commerce kick-started the development of the American-led commercial internet. The same lesson applies to the competition for 5G technology (mentioned only twice in the Rubio report). China might end up leading in 5G patents and hardware production. This possibility raises privacy concerns — for instance, that China would influence the worldwide convergence on 5G standards to aid it to spy on users. Still, it’s difficult to believe that the Chinese could impose an anti-privacy standard with so many privacy watchdogs at the table. If there are national security issues, they should be addressed with national security means, not economic policy. We shouldn’t allow fear-mongering to hobble America’s free enterprise system. That system has proved remarkable at delivering what consumers care about, like speed, broadband services and applications. The researcher Brent Skorup lays out many simple ways the government could encourage 5G development in the United States. For starters, Mr. Skorup notes, the federal government could free up underused parts of the federal radio spectrum for new uses like 5G. Then, the federal government should work with states and cities to repeal statutes that prohibit homeowners from freely installing 5G equipment on their own property (which would expand broadband access). Local officials should see the 5G rollout not as a mere revenue generator but as a national campaign for a more innovative and dynamic economy. China’s economic future is bright, but only as long as it rejects large-scale industrial policy and instead recommits to competitive markets. We shouldn’t copy its recent command-and-control playbook. Rather, we should stick with the time-honored policies that have made the United States the titan to topple in the first place: free trade, competitive markets, reasonable regulations and the rule of law. Maybe China will decide to mimic more of our behaviors instead. Veronique de Rugy is a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University.

2019,Opinion | Why Are We Still Slaughtering the American Bison?,"Restoring herds to Native American land after 150 years would be a simple reparation for the country to make. But the cattle industry won’t allow it. Contributing Opinion Writer In a 120-acre pasture on an Indian reservation in northeastern Montana, five prime examples of America’s national mammal rumble and snort. They shake their enormous heads and use them to plow aside the snow to get to their feed. In the night, I like to think, they put those shaggy heads together to ruminate on the weird politics of the American West and blast clouds of exhausted air out their shiny nostrils. These five, all males, arrived last month from Yellowstone National Park, the last great refuge of the wild bison that once dominated the American landscape from Pennsylvania to Oregon. Their arrival marks the beginning of what will ostensibly become a pipeline sending surplus bison from Yellowstone out to repopulate portions of their old habitat. Since 2000, it has been the custom to send 600 or 1,000 prize Yellowstone bison to slaughter every year at about this time to keep the park’s booming population at roughly 4,000 animals. The meat goes mainly to tribal nations. Even so, the culling is perverse and wasteful: Yellowstone is home to genetically pure wild bison, coveted by national parks, Native American tribes and conservation groups across the West. But Yellowstone is also home to a notorious disease called brucellosis, dreaded by cattle ranchers everywhere. And while Congress in 2016 designated the American bison the national mammal, everyone knows that title comes with fine print reading “other than cattle.” And when it comes to cattle — a species that is not native to North America — the politics always gets weird. Much of the talk about brucellosis could leave a person thinking that bison are the source of the problem. A typical document headlined “Brucellosis and Yellowstone Bison,” from Aphis, the Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, declares that “brucellosis and Yellowstone Bison Overview Brucellosis” have “cost the federal government, the states and the livestock industry billions of dollars in direct losses and the cost of efforts to eliminate the disease.” And that is no doubt true. The livestock industry has suffered heavily from brucellosis, which lowers milk production and can cause cows to miscarry. But it’s worth adding that the livestock industry also introduced the disease to this country. The cattle infected the bison, not the other way around. As usual, the tribes are paying a heavy cost. In 2014 the Sioux and Assiniboine tribal nations at Fort Peck Reservation, in northeastern Montana, spent more than $500,000 building a double-fenced, state-of-the-art quarantine facility, according to Daniel Wenner, a lawyer for the tribes, and did so based on assurances that they would be on the receiving end of that pipeline of surplus bison from Yellowstone. This facility can handle 350 bison, double the combined capacity of the two quarantine facilities near Yellowstone maintained by the Park Service and Aphis. The plan, says Robbie Magnan, fish and game director for the tribal nations, was for the Sioux and Assiniboine to put bison through the late stages of the elaborate protocol for testing whether they are free of brucellosis, then release some into a 13,000-acre fenced range, and send some on to help start herds on other reservations. But until the arrival of that token shipment of five males in February, the quarantine facility has stood empty, they say. “The Montana livestock community” and its allies in state and federal agencies “have obstructed this effort at every turn,” Mr. Wenner said. In addition to decades of apparent bureaucratic slow-walking by Aphis and the State of Montana, the obstructionists got help last year when vandals broke into the Park Service quarantine facility and released scores of bison that were due to go to Fort Peck. In June, the interior secretary at the time, Ryan Zinke, piled on, forcing out the superintendent of Yellowstone National Park, who had been a strong proponent of the move to Fort Peck. Mr. Zinke was sympathetic, according to Mountain Journal, an environmental news site, to “a carefully orchestrated populist revolt” by eastern Montana ranchers “using Bundyesque fear tactics to thwart Yellowstone bison from being relocated there as seedstock for building new public herds.” There are plenty of paradoxes to the effort to keep the bison from getting to Fort Peck. The first is that brucellosis is typically transmitted in the aborted fetus and fluids of an infected cow. Transmission by bulls is unlikely. That means the five bulls sent to Fort Peck as a token of cooperation have spent most of their lives being quarantined at great expense for a disease they don’t spread. The next shipment of Yellowstone bison tentatively scheduled to go to Fort Peck, possibly later this year, is also all bulls. This is a good way to not build new herds, which may be the point. But Mr. Magnan, fish and game director for the tribal nations, isn’t complaining. He hopes that taking the males through the quarantine process will persuade officials that the reservation can handle the females, too. Another incongruity has to do with the lack of evidence implicating any bison at all in transmission of brucellosis. In an authoritative 2017 study, scientists traced the genetic lineage of the Brucella bacteria in 27 cattle herds infected around Yellowstone since 1998 and found bison not guilty on all counts. The culprits in every case were elk. There are, however, no plans to contain or cull elk. But unlike bison, elk don’t compete with cattle for grazing rights on public lands. The Montana state veterinarian, Marty Zaluski, argues that the genetic study means nothing, except that elk interact with cattle more than bison do. “It defies logic to say that Brucella bacteria in bison magically do not affect other animals,” he said, adding that a Brucella infection in a cattle herd in South Dakota in the 1980s was “most likely from bison.” The state has also delayed use of the Fort Peck quarantine facility, he said, because “we don’t have jurisdiction — it’s an independent sovereign nation and not subject to state regulation.” That means the state might have no way to enforce an order for testing or euthanasia. The Fort Peck tribes have offered to sign an agreement to accept state jurisdiction over quarantined animals, Dr. Zaluski acknowledges. “My concern is all of these agreements are severable, and possession is nine-tenths of law,” he said. “It’s ultimately extremely difficult for me to go into an agreement that potentially jeopardizes Montana’s disease control program when we know those agreements can be severed.” The notion that Native Americans won’t keep their word is also moderately paradoxical. “Since 1492,” said Mr. Magnan, “Europeans have made promises and reneged on everything, and yet they hang it on us?” He doesn’t bother to add that the 19th-century annihilation of bison was in large part a deliberate campaign to destroy and displace the Plains Indians. Or that restoring bison to the tribes at Fort Peck and elsewhere, after 150 years, ought to be one of the easier acts of reparation for the United States to undertake. The bison deserve better, too. They are an integral part of the Great Plains landscape they helped create, and their patchy way of grazing is beneficial for water resources, for plant growth and for plant and animal diversity. Keeping them locked up in Yellowstone turns them instead into glorified zoo animals. This country will never get back the “immense herds of buffalo, elk, deer and antelopes feeding in one common and boundless pasture” witnessed with awe by Meriwether Lewis in 1805. But with a measure of care and tolerance on both sides, we could still allow our national mammal to become something grander and more glorious than a buffalo-nickel treat for tourists.

2019,Why Baltimore Persists as a Cultural Beacon,"Notes on the Culture The city (population 600,000) has produced an eclectic variety of artists, including John Waters, Joyce J. Scott, David Simon and Abdu Ali. “HEY, WHERE THE [EXPLETIVE] are we anyway today?” asks one of the troupe members of Lady Divine’s Cavalcade of Perversions in the opening moments of John Waters’s raucously disgusting 1970 film “Multiple Maniacs.” The answer was the front lawn of Waters’s parents’ house in the Baltimore suburb of Lutherville, Md. Much of the film, like many in Waters’s oeuvre, spills out across the streets of Baltimore; the final sequence recalls the gleeful opening of “A Hard Day’s Night” (1964) turned on its head, with crowds of young people charging down city blocks in flight from the rampaging drag queen Divine. (Just before this, Divine is sexually assaulted by a giant lobster, one of the more disturbing non sequiturs in a film that consists of almost nothing but them.) In the world that Waters established in “Maniacs,” and deepened, if that’s the word for it, in “Pink Flamingos” (1972), “Female Trouble” (1974) and many more, Baltimore is an unfathomably weird place: aggressively grotesque, sexually abject and cheerfully violent. It is a city where anything — see: lobster attack — can happen. One watches his proudly queer, exhibitionistic stock company the Dreamlanders in these early films (a contemporary review of “Maniacs” in the Baltimore Sun notes that the “heavily Baltimorese” accents are the funniest thing about the movie) and cannot help but wonder admiringly, and at times nervously, about the psychology of the city that produced it. [Coming later this spring: the T List newsletter, a weekly roundup of what T Magazine editors are noticing and coveting. Sign up here.] WATERS’S FILMS along with, in very different registers, the writer Anne Tyler’s psychologically acute family novels and David Simon’s sprawling television epic of urban corruption, “The Wire,” represent the triumph of an intensely local vision. In the work of these three artists, each of whom broke important ground in depicting Baltimore to the world at large, there is a deep allegiance to the city’s particularity, a burrowing into the character of the place. Their work feels different in kind both from that produced in larger cities like New York and Los Angeles and from that originating from smaller, intellectual hubs such as Providence, R.I., and Oxford, Miss. Together, they stand as a kind of trio of city bards, fiercely loyal to a complicated area that defies cliché and casual explanation. A deep variant of the strange runs through the water in Baltimore, and the fact that such an eclectic group of artists has committed its life and work to an otherwise relatively inconsequential midsize city is rare in today’s cultural landscape. I was born in Columbia, Md., a suburb of Baltimore, and though I have no claim to being a city native, I travel to Baltimore and its surroundings every year or two. In that time, I’ve come to understand the city’s character as being shaped by its contradictions, geographically and culturally, which have always defied categorization. I also see a city that inspires an underdog identification, perhaps in part because of its nebulous identity — Baltimore is worlds away, psychically, but not much of a drive (when the traffic abates) from both the seats of power in and around Washington, D.C., and the rural coastal communities of the Eastern Shore. When I spoke with Dan Deacon, the electronic musician who has been a central figure in the city’s D.I.Y. music scene for well over a decade, he cited a speech from an episode of “Homicide: Life on the Street,” the 1993 to 1999 television series based on David Simon’s pre-“Wire” book about crime in Baltimore, to articulate the city’s neither-here-nor-there quality. In the scene, a murder suspect tells a detective he’s got the “homegrown look”: “That not too southern, not too northern, not on the ocean but still on the water look.” One hears something of this in-betweenness in John Updike’s review of Tyler’s novel “Earthly Possessions,” from 1977, in which he notes that “she is at peace in the semi-countrified, semi-plasticized, Northern-Southern America where she and her characters live.” Tyler, who has set most of her 22 novels in Baltimore since moving to the genteel Roland Park neighborhood in 1967, writes about the city as though it were a small town, capturing the interconnected fates and yearnings of her working- and middle-class families. When I wrote to Tyler asking how the city has influenced her fiction, she responded, “For me as a writer, the value of Baltimore has been the character of the city itself — the fact that it is a character, with its own distinctive quirks and foibles that color every story set there.” Updike saw Tyler’s work as part of a Southern literary tradition, noting that “she holds fast, in her imagination and in her person, to a Baltimore with only Southern exits; her characters, when they flee, never flee North.” “The Wire,” on the other hand, surely the most high-profile depiction of the city in the 21st century, fits more naturally into what might be considered a Northern tradition, one in which the unruly, labyrinthine nature of urban life is central to the show’s conception of the city. Simon and his collaborators’ layered storytelling humanizes the police, drug dealers, politicians, teachers and journalists who call the city home, placing the city’s poor and powerful on equal narrative footing and delving deeply into the causes of the city’s profound racial and economic inequality and injustice. As the primary lens through which many nonresidents come to know the city, it might, perhaps, give the casual viewer the impression that Baltimore consists mainly of drugs, murder and political corruption. (In Gary Shteyngart’s latest novel, “Lake Success,” a group of German tourists take a “Wire”-inspired tour of West Baltimore — the war on drugs has officially become a theme park.) Simon’s gimlet-eyed take on the city is always one of dichotomies and revelations: The drug dealers are philosophers, the police brutal poets of vulgarity. Nothing is ever just one thing. THOUGH THESE THREE represent only the most historically visible of the city’s artists, the current vein of work being produced, much of it by the city’s majority black population, is fueled by many of the same conditions that have long made Baltimore a site of such originality. The longstanding availability of cheap space in which to work and experiment combined with the interconnected collegiality of its arts communities has fostered this energy, even as Baltimore’s residents, artistic and otherwise, struggle with the city’s dire political conditions. This paradox — the devil’s bargain of a city that operates as a laboratory for bold visions in exchange for social and economic precariousness — is at the heart of the city’s creative life. The option to leave for somewhere bigger, more “important,” is always present, which makes staying a conscious act of loyalty. (Adam Jones, the Orioles’ most popular player for the last 10 seasons, once quipped that his favorite place in Baltimore was the airport; fans forgave him.) But the best way to understand the city’s strangeness — its ability to be not a lesser New York or a quieter Atlanta — is the richness of its underground, a place that feels very much alive in Baltimore. The work of the musician Abdu Ali, for example, combines the influences of punk, rap and Baltimore club (the city’s explosive, ecstatic brand of hip-hop inflected house music) to create something bracingly new. A gender nonconforming artist, Ali spoke about the need to recognize the contributions of women and queer artists to the city’s musical history — particularly the pioneers of Baltimore club, such as Miss Tony, who recorded tracks and spun records in drag through most of the ’90s, and K-Swift, one of the city’s most popular young D.J.s at the time of her death in 2008 — while also expanding the scope of what’s possible in the city. In 2013, Ali co-founded a concert and party series called Kahlon, which had the explicit goal of putting alternative and experimental black, L.G.B.T.Q. and women-identified artists on the same stage. As a Baltimore native, Ali noticed that too many of the shows they were going to, often dominated by straight, white artists, “didn’t reflect what the city really is, and what brings the charm to the city.” “It’s the only city left that’s cheap enough to have a bohemia,” John Waters told me, still willing, on a hectic day, to fulfill his lifetime role as ambassador to Baltimore’s creative byways. “It used to be people said, ‘I moved here,’ and people said, ‘Why?’ And now, when I say I have an apartment in New York, people say, ‘Why?’ It’s the opposite of what it used to be.” (As if his committed relationship with the city needed any more emphasis, a huge exhibition of his visual art, “John Waters: Indecent Exposure,” opened at the Baltimore Museum of Art last fall.) In the wake of the family-friendly musical adaptations of “Hairspray” (1988), including a live television version two years ago that reached more than 11 million viewers, it’s easy to forget how subversive much of Waters’s work remains. “Pink Flamingos” has not been tamed by time; if anything, it might be even more shocking now, removed from its immediate post-60s context of ritualized taboo breaking. The entire movie feels like looking through a keyhole into a very particular, and quite varied, fetish party. A large woman in a baby crib relentlessly demands eggs; a man flexes his anus (in close-up!) in time to “Surfin’ Bird”; a live chicken is crushed between a couple as they have sex. Divine is treated throughout as a kind of dominatrix deity, responding to all dissent with violence. There are many places in America, one imagines, that would disinherit the person who produced such scenarios, or at least treat them warily. But Waters has become a synecdoche for the city — the embrace of queerness, of “perversion” of all kinds, a stand-in for Baltimore’s willingness to accept all comers and to make art out of whatever’s around. Something of the early Waters spirit — the handmade quality, the risk taking, the defiance — feels present in much of the work now produced in Baltimore. Stephanie Barber makes elliptical and playful films that leap from dense conversations about the artistic process into unexpected bursts of song and dance. “There’s an ability to fail here that there might not be in other cities, and I mean that in the most beautiful, radical way,” she told me. The notion of risk as being essential to the creative process is palpable throughout her work — her 2017 film “In the Jungle” metaphorizes the artist’s journey as a scientist’s lonely and dangerous fieldwork in an endearingly kitschy jungle — and the city allows her and others to enact that risk in ways that would be impossible in a city with a more glaring national spotlight. Her films, like Waters’s, though with a wry delicacy that couldn’t be more different than his approach, speak a secret language. But the lack of spotlight in the city also presents difficulties for artists, for whom a robust critical discourse is both a sign of success and an encouragement. Deacon described an indie music scene — which has produced nationally known artists such as Beach House and Future Islands — where “there’s a lot of potential energy” that’s been somewhat hampered by the loss of the city’s underground warehouse show culture, as well as the shuttering of City Paper, the city’s alternative weekly, in 2017. But he also noted that the arts community has made significant steps toward addressing its blind spots in recent years, particularly regarding race and inclusion. POLITICS, AND PARTICULARLY the city’s cruel racial politics, both recent and past, are never far from the surface in discussions about Baltimore today. Black communities were the victims of residential redlining beginning in the 1930s, creating generations of wealth disparity and inadequate services. In April 1968, the city, like others across the country, boiled over into violent unrest following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., leaving six people dead, about 700 injured and widespread damage to businesses and property. Over the following decades, white flight led to a significant population decline, with many businesses following the city’s middle-class residents to the suburbs. In 2015, Freddie Gray, a black man arrested for illegal knife possession, was gravely injured while in police custody and died a week later, setting off protests calling for the investigation and prosecution of the officers responsible. The protests immediately following Gray’s funeral became violent, resulting in nationally broadcast images of burned police cars and businesses. In the following months, the city saw a spike in homicides (the reasons for which remain disputed); over the following year, the officers involved in Gray’s apprehension and transportation were charged with crimes related to his death, but after the initial trials resulted in three acquittals, the charges against the remaining three officers were dropped. If it were ever possible to work and live as an artist in Baltimore while ignoring the city’s pervasive racial injustices, large and small, that time has long passed. The sculptor Joyce J. Scott and the photographer Shan Wallace represent two generations of Baltimore visual artists, both committed to depicting the city’s African-American history and its present-day existence through their respective mediums. Scott, 70, creates beautiful, troubling sculpture and jewelry, which often incorporates delicate traditional beadwork and confronts the horrors of the country’s racial history: Her piece “Lynched Tree” (2011-15) is a large, amorphous sculpture that depicts a body hanging upside down by the legs from the ceiling, spilling chains, beads and bones onto the gallery floor below. Wallace, 27, is part of the new guard, a photographer whose work shifted after attending a rally held in response to the killing of Trayvon Martin in 2012. She photographs, she wrote to me, “the essence of this city, the black communities, the resistance and resilience of black people.” She gives the subjects of her work copies of the photographs in order to demonstrate “the value of archiving with the goal of empowerment.” Her work draws its force from its insistence on the beauty and significance of everyday life among communities that have not historically been recorded with such careful attention. Baltimore has thus far resisted the overdevelopment that has sanded off some of the weirder edges of other cities with thriving arts communities like Austin, Tex., Portland, Ore., and, most notoriously, San Francisco. Rather than lamenting the bygone days of some artistic peak, the city is able to point to a living lineage, a continuity that is renewed with each new generation. I think of Ali and their peers like Butch Dawson and Jpegmafia, for example, responding directly to the legacy of Baltimore club, a genre that remains largely unknown outside the city. Rather than tearing things down and starting new, the artistic tendency of the city is to create layers, riffing on what came before and changing it in the process. In the course of writing this essay, I was surprised by the number of people who, even as they protectively warned me against essentializing or pigeonholing the city, posited Baltimore as a microcosm of the country as a whole. On some level, I understood what they were telling me — don’t ignore the complicated history, the glaring inequality, the struggle to make beauty out of darkness. But Baltimore also feels, in its insistence on maintaining a local culture through community and self-identity, like a holdout from an older tradition, one that can get lost under new construction. The city will change, one hopes — socially and economically — for the good. But, with any luck, it will continue to be the odd, ambitious place where murderous drag queens roam the streets. You still can’t do that in D.C.",The New York Times
2019,Why Birthrates Among Hispanic Americans Have Plummeted,"WENDELL, N.C. — Yoselin Wences grew up with a constant refrain from her parents, immigrants from Mexico who became a landscaper and a cook. “The mind-set was, ‘Don’t be like us,’” she said. “‘Don’t get married early. Don’t have children early. Don’t be one of those teen moms. We made these sacrifices so that you can get educated and start a career.’” She followed that advice, and now, at 22, Ms. Wences, a junior at North Carolina State University, will soon become the first member of her family to graduate from college. When asked about children, Ms. Wences replied that for her, they were years away. “Probably around 34 or 35,” she said. “That age range seems ideal to me.” As fertility rates across the United States continue to decline — 2017 had the country’s lowest rate since the government started keeping records — some of the largest drops have been among Hispanics. The birthrate for Hispanic women fell by 31 percent from 2007 to 2017, a steep decline that demographers say has been driven in part by generational differences between Hispanic immigrants and their American-born daughters and granddaughters. It is a story of becoming more like other Americans. Nearly two-thirds of Hispanics in the United States today are born in this country, a fact that is often lost in the noisy political battles over immigration. Young American-born Hispanic women are less likely to be poor and more likely to be educated than their immigrant mothers and grandmothers, according to the Pew Research Center, and many are delaying childbearing to finish school and start careers, just like other American-born women. “Hispanics are in essence catching up to their peers,” said Lina Guzman, a demographer at Child Trends, a nonprofit research group. The Hispanic decline is helping to drive a major shift in the country’s fertility patterns. Child Trends found that 2016 was the first year in which American women ages 25 to 29 did not have the highest birthrate. Instead, the rate was highest among women in their early 30s. In the last year, as demographers have tried to better understand what is driving the country’s overall declining fertility rate, they have looked more closely at the data broken down by race and ethnic group. The fertility rate for Hispanics — defined by demographers as people who report they are of Hispanic origin on birth certificates — dropped to 67.6 from 97.4 births per 1,000 women. By contrast, the rate for non-Hispanic whites fell by 6 percent to 57.2, and by about 12 percent for blacks to 63.1, according to Child Trends. The implications of the Hispanic decline are broad. With the white population shrinking, Hispanics account for the majority of the population gains in the United States. And while their fertility rates are still the highest for any major racial and ethnic group, the steep drops in recent years are having an effect. The United States population grew by just 0.6 percent last year, the smallest increase in 80 years, according to Ken Johnson, a demographer at the University of New Hampshire. He noted that, at current rates, young Hispanic women will have an average of two children, down from three just a decade ago. The largest decline in Hispanic fertility rates has been among women of Mexican heritage, Dr. Guzman said. That is significant for the nation’s fertility patterns because of the sheer size of the Mexican origin population, which accounts for nearly two-thirds of all Hispanics and around 11 percent of the American population, according to the Pew Research Center. Ms. Wences’ parents, who came to the United States permanently in the mid-1990s, met on a tobacco farm and settled in a rural patch of Wake County, which contains Raleigh and its suburbs. Soon after, when her father was 21 and her mother was 23, Ms. Wences was born. There weren’t many Hispanic families in the area at the time. Ms. Wences recalled spending more time with children who were not Hispanic and discovering differences. Their parents were much older than her parents. They worked at desks, not outside. “I remember mentioning my mom had my sister when she was 15 and I kind of got the side eye,” she said. Ms. Wences once bragged to a friend, as they walked on school grounds just before a snowstorm, that her father was the one who sprinkled the salt crunching under their feet. Her father, Enrique, later told her not to talk about his work. “He said, ‘You don’t want to be like me, mija,’” she recalled, using a Spanish abbreviation for “my daughter.” “I want you to go to school. I want you to do better than me.” Mr. Wences, 43, said he was self-conscious that he did not finish high school. It was a regret that would power him through seven-day workweeks for 25 years so that his daughters could get an education. One of the happiest moments of his life was when Yoselin called him from her car in the parking lot of Wake Technical Community College, where she was studying for an associate degree, to tell him that N.C. State had accepted her transfer application. Ms. Wences said that if she got pregnant now, she would probably have to drop out of college. “I’d feel embarrassed that the sacrifices that my dad made up to this point would be going down the drain,” she said. Between 2007 and 2017, the population of Hispanic women of childbearing age in Wake County grew nearly 50 percent, drawn by a booming local economy. Yet the fertility rate for Hispanic women dropped by about 47 percent, according to Dr. Johnson. The rate for women who were not Hispanic dropped by about 16 percent in the same period, he said. Birthrates tend to follow economic cycles. The fact that the American rate has not picked up along with the economy in recent years has puzzled demographers. In a survey late last year, the top reasons young women gave for delaying children involved money — children were simply too expensive. But several young women interviewed for this article said that was not the case for them. Many came from large extended families with aunts and cousins who would care for a baby if need be. Many of those women had been raised by siblings in Mexico as their parents worked. “I have a very supportive circle,” Ms. Wences said, adding that if she wanted to go through with having a baby, her boyfriend’s parents would probably help. “But what is the point of having a child if you can’t enjoy it?” Some women said their lives were so busy — many worked full time while also going to school — that they did not have time for friends, never mind boyfriends. Many lived at home in distant suburbs, instead of on campuses in the city, making socializing difficult. “At the moment, I am not thinking about dating anybody,” said Bianca Soria-Avila, 28, who is in her last year at Wake Tech in Raleigh and lives with her Mexican immigrant parents in Wendell. She works full time as an insurance agent. “I don’t have friends. I don’t want to talk on the phone or to go out. I need to graduate,” she said. Having children later might be common for young Americans, but it is unusual for Ms. Soria-Avila’s older Mexican-American relatives, who often react with raised eyebrows when they ask her age at family gatherings. “They laugh and say ‘When I was your age, I already had four kids,’” she said. “I tell them if I had kids now, I wouldn’t be able to do what I want to do.” For now, Ms. Wences said she was focused on finishing her bachelor’s degree in psychology. Her associate diploma hangs on her father’s living room wall. “My wish for her is she keeps on in her education and becomes somebody,” Mr. Wences said. “I want her to be comfortable, to have control over herself and her life.” So far, his wish is coming true. “She came out 100 percent what I hoped,” he said.",The New York Times
2019,Why China Silenced a Clickbait Queen in Its Battle for Information Control,"BEIJING — She was known as China’s clickbait queen, an irreverent blogger who prescribed shopping to combat sadness (“better than sex, orgasms, strawberry cake”) and makeovers to win back cheating husbands (“men are visual animals”). But late last month, Ma Ling, a blogger who commanded an audience of more than 16 million people, went conspicuously silent. In the battle for control of the Chinese internet, the authorities had designated Ms. Ma a threat to social stability, pointing to an article she published about a young man with cancer whose talent and virtue were not enough to overcome problems like corruption and inequality. The state-run news media accused Ms. Ma of circulating false information, and her social media accounts were wiped from the internet. The silencing of Ms. Ma, better known in China by her pen name, Mimeng, reflects a broader campaign by President Xi Jinping to purge the public sphere of popular voices that the ruling Communist Party finds threatening, no matter how innocuous they may seem. “There is no longer any freedom of speech in China,” Jia Jia, a blogger who writes about history, said of the campaign. “In the end, no one will be spared.” Since coming to power in 2012, Mr. Xi has imposed the most extensive censorship in China in years, flooding the airwaves with communist propaganda and reining in investigative journalists and social media celebrities. Now Mr. Xi is pushing to tame one of the most vibrant corners of the Chinese internet: the more than one million self-help gurus, novelists, sportswriters and other independent writers who make up the so-called “self-media.” Since December, the authorities have closed more than 140,000 blogs and deleted more than 500,000 articles, according to the state-run news media, saying that they contained false information, distortions and obscenities. The party seems concerned that independent commentators, who have become a primary news source for China’s more than 800 million internet users, are drowning out its propaganda messages. It also probably worries that independent media sources could help fuel social unrest in 2019, a year of politically sensitive anniversaries including 30 years since the crackdown in Tiananmen Square. “Bloggers are seen as encouraging discontent in society and potentially causing social instability,” said Hu Xingdou, a political economist in Beijing. But Mr. Hu said the risk of unrest might actually increase if individuals were not permitted to air grievances online. “Our society should allow multiple voices,” he said. “Only in this way can discontent be released.” Such blogs represent one of the last bastions of relatively free discourse in China and have proliferated in recent years as the state-run news media has become more heavily focused on praising Mr. Xi and his policies. For many writers, blogs are a lucrative business, with readers paying small fees for content and advertisers paying for mentions of their products. To avoid China’s strict laws on news gathering, many bloggers occupy a gray area, framing their views on current events as commentary. The freewheeling competition for eyeballs has led to an alarming rise in fake news, a concern that the government often uses to justify its crackdown. But Mr. Xi is targeting much more than false information. The authorities have blacklisted writers who traded celebrity gossip, analysts who discussed rising property prices and advocates who wrote about problems in the countryside. In interviews, bloggers described the silencing of Ms. Ma as a clear warning to independent media in China: The party is in charge, and writers must play by its rules. But while the range of banned topics in China was once clear — independence movements in Tibet and Taiwan, and the bloody crackdown in Tiananmen Square in 1989, for example — the party’s red line has become much more ambiguous. China’s trade war with the United States is now considered sensitive. So too, sometimes, are musings about the futility of work, a theme often derided by censors as promoting “slacker culture.” Li Yongfeng, who runs a popular book review channel, said he avoided publishing articles that mentioned social movements or past or present political leaders, even to offer praise. “The Chinese government always sees itself as a serious father,” he said. “He always wants to control his people and to determine what they like and dislike.” Mr. Xi has demanded absolute loyalty from state-run news outlets, saying their names should include the word “party.” And he has urged officials to take command of new media by deploying tools like blogs and apps to promote communist ideology. Lotus Ruan, a researcher at the University of Toronto who studies the Chinese internet, said she expected censorship to grow as the rules became more arbitrary. “At the end of the day, it is up to authorities to decide what constitutes ‘positive energy’ and what does not,” she said. In December, the Cyberspace Administration of China listed offenses by bloggers that included distorting government policy and party history, “flaunting wealth” and “challenging public order.” But the party defines those terms widely. An account that focused on women was suspended last year after the authorities said its posts on sexual health were “distasteful.” Similarly, an account run by a nonprofit named NGOCN was shut down in December after it published articles on a chemical spill in eastern China, said Wu Lilan, the group’s executive director. Increasingly, the party is seeking to limit content that depicts life in China as a constant struggle. That seems to have driven the attacks on Ms. Ma, the clickbait queen. Ms. Ma, 42, already had detractors who accused her of making money by manipulating people’s emotions with articles like “I Love Money, It’s True” and “Men Don’t Cheat for Sex.” She charged $113,000 to advertisers for a mention on her blog and bragged about paying her interns nearly $90,000 a year. In January, Ms. Ma, a former journalist who started her blog in 2015, came under attack after publishing “The Death of a Top Scorer From a Poor Family,” a post about a hardworking 24-year-old man who died of cancer. The article suggested that even though the man was bright and virtuous, he was still powerless in the face of the high cost of health care. The article was widely circulated online and prompted debate about China’s wealth gap, surging medical costs and the value of education — common complaints of China’s middle class. Soon, however, internet users pointed to factual errors and said the piece had been invented. Ms. Ma had to apologize and promise to “communicate values with more positive energy.” But the government did not relent. People’s Daily, the flagship newspaper of the Communist Party, accused Ms. Ma of manipulating public opinion. Her social accounts were deleted on Feb. 21. Ms. Ma did not respond to a request for comment, nor did the Cyberspace Administration of China. Wang Yongzhi, an outspoken commentator in the eastern city of Hangzhou, said the broader problem was that China’s leaders paid little attention to social issues, leaving a void that bloggers helped fill. Mr. Wang said he had begun blogging because it provided a “seed of journalistic freedom” in a tightly restricted society. But on Jan. 1, he said, he closed his WeChat blog because he had grown tired of the constant battle with censors. “It is becoming unbearable,” Mr. Wang said. “The party simply can’t tolerate anyone who has a big influence on society.”",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | Why Colleges Like Trump’s Campus Speech Order,"Deans don’t want call-out culture either — they just can’t say so out loud. Mr. Bauerlein is an English professor at Emory and a senior editor at First Things. College presidents don’t want President Trump stepping into campus affairs and making threatening orders about speech — or so they say. After the president previewed an executive order on campus speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference this month, Robert Zimmer, president of the University of Chicago, warned that it would make the government, “with all its power and authority, a party to defining the very nature of discussion on campus,” and lead to the “inevitable establishment of a bureaucracy to enforce any governmental position.” The order itself, which the president signed on Thursday, has softer language, stating that federal officials shall “ensure institutions that receive federal research or education grants promote free inquiry, including through compliance with all applicable federal laws, regulations and policies.” President Trump’s remarks at the signing ceremony, however, were harsher. He called universities “anti-First Amendment institutions”; he denounced “ideological intolerance”; and he stated that the $35 billion per year that schools receive in research funding “is now at stake.” The case would seem a perfect occasion for school leaders to rebuke a politician whom they despise, and do so on principled apolitical grounds. Even a conservative should object to this federal intrusion into academic affairs. But consider the actual pressures and burdens on the president of a research university that takes in grants by the millions every year. The college presidents won’t say so, but in light of their daily duties, this “speech” aspect of the executive order may look to them like a godsend. The order originates in specific incidents: a student harassed by school officials for her anti-abortion messaging, the creation of illiberal speech codes, and the shout-downs that conservative speakers like Heather Mac Donald and Charles Murray have endured during their campus visits. College leaders aren’t happy with this. They prefer that a student manning a table for the group Turning Point USA be left alone, and that Ben Shapiro have his say on Wednesday and leave on Thursday. They favor free speech even as they openly disagree with the conservative’s opinions. But that’s not enough for some students, who object to the very presence of an outspoken conservative on campus. They have forced administrators to draw a line on impermissible speech that the administrators don’t wish to draw. Administrators want open inquiry and lively debate, but the students often have a historically disadvantaged identity that the college leaders feel they must respect — African-Americans against racism, women against rape culture. This is a dilemma that outsiders don’t appreciate. They see 19-year-olds chanting “No more racism!” while everyone else in the lecture hall, including the conservative speaker and the security guards, stand in silence, and they wonder why nobody makes them stop. Conservative critics put it up to liberal bias, but that’s not really the problem. It has to do with the relationship the administration has formed with undergraduates from the beginning, especially with those from underrepresented populations. Selective schools are in a fierce competition to attract applicants and build a properly diverse and elite freshman class. They have recruited these students with glowing promises and triumphant predictions: “You will prosper here — this is the very best place you can be!” the brochures tell them. Recruiters phone and text underserved groups with exciting accounts of graduates’ success. Students arrive full of hope and happiness. The last thing deans want is for these youths to become upset and angry. It brings bad publicity and makes the campus look like a place of turmoil, not joy. These students intimidate the highest officials in a university more than outsiders can imagine. A student at Yale yelling at the professor who tried to reason with her did tremendous damage to Yale’s brand, but the administration couldn’t come down on her without compromising its pledges of inclusivity and anti-discrimination and sensitivity. This is why, even if they won’t say it publicly, many university administrators most likely welcome the federal government’s heavy hand. President Trump has taken the burden of free speech off their shoulders. Administrators now must stop the illiberalism of the activists as a matter of federal policy. That means canceling speech codes and punishing disrupters. Schools can’t lose federal funding; they need it to function. Now, they have an answer to the students crowding their offices and storming the lecture hall: “Yes, you must be quiet or you will be disciplined. I have no choice — it’s the law.” Mark Bauerlein is an English professor at Emory and a senior editor at First Things. The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

2019,Opinion | Why Courtrooms Are Kryptonite for Alex Jones,"Shock jocks lose their power when forced to tell the truth, the whole truth. Mr. Warzel is an Opinion writer at large. Nothing like a three-hour deposition under oath to turn an excitable conspiracy theorist into a man subdued, deferential and humbled. That’s the Alex Jones who the world met for the first time on Friday, when attorneys for families of the victims of a school shooting posted his deposition online. The deposition was given earlier this month in conjunction with a number of lawsuits on behalf of parents of victims of the attack in 2012 at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. Mr. Jones, the longtime misinformation-peddler and founder of the radio and online show Infowars, is being sued for defamation for saying repeatedly during his broadcasts that parts of the Sandy Hook shooting were staged and that the tragedy was a “false flag” operation, designed to take away firearms from American citizens. For anyone familiar with his broadcasts and style, the deposition is a jarring piece of evidence. It is also perhaps the most revealing portrait of Mr. Jones — one that strips bare the bloviating host to expose a huckster. Amid his heavy sighing and wincing, the hours of out-of-court testimony show the real Alexander Jones: a man caught between the desire to defend his conspiracy empire and a legal system that threatens to bring it all crashing down. On camera and in public, the stocky Texan is famous for his meandering soliloquies and belligerent, occasionally violent verbal outbursts. The Alex Jones persona orbits around his volatility, keeping audiences entertained and colleagues on their toes. It’s never quite clear whether he’ll laugh and burst into song, pound the table in a fit of rage or begin dramatically weeping. The deposition video features Mr. Jones from the waist-up, sitting at a table — a camera angle similar to his online broadcasts. However, unlike an Infowars episode, the host is not in control. Instead, Mr. Jones is peppered with aggressive questions from an attorney. His confidential sources are exposed to be message board trolls and cranks. He’s made to read from a disturbing police report, chronicling the testimony of emergency medical workers who attended the shooting at Sandy Hook, and then immediately watch footage of his past broadcasts, in which he declares that elements of the violence were part of a “false flag” operation. In the video, Mr. Jones occasionally attempts to slip into his Infowars persona. But his digressions are dismissed by lawyers as “nonresponsive.” At one point, Mr. Jones, evidently weary from questioning, asks for clarification of the lawyers’ meaning of the word “staged.” His question is cut off. “I’m not here to answer your questions,” the lawyer says. “You’re going to tell me what staged means when you said it.” “This is such a rare public insight to his character and integrity,” Joshua Owens, a former Infowars employee who worked closely with Jones until 2017, told me on Friday evening after watching the deposition. “As someone who regularly saw his dynamic with others, no one speaks to him like this. [No one] asks these kinds of questions, pressures him to answer, or expects him to remain composed long enough for it to go anywhere productive.” Mr. Owens left Infowars after disagreements with Mr. Jones. For more than two decades, Mr. Jones has built a big business on specious claims and fear-mongering. When pressed on false claims by critics, his classic response tends to be that he’s merely asking questions others are too afraid to ask. Portions of the deposition are vintage Infowars: Mr. Jones blames “the media""; suggests that he is actually the person who is the victim of an unfair smear campaign; casts doubt on the veracity of the Infowars clips the lawyers have presented to him as evidence and suggests they’ve been heavily edited and that the audio was altered. “That’s Alex Jones’s M.O.,” Owens said of the deposition. “To flood any topic with confusion and doubt so no one can grab onto anything.” But under oath, Mr. Jones’s tactics fizzle. And the deposition highlights a troubling reality: The legal system may be the only way to defang a well-known conspiracy theorist at the height of his powers. Not only does the parade of lawsuits related to the Sandy Hook shooting cast him as a villain, but they threaten to expose and, perhaps drain, the funding sources that keep Infowars running without advertisers. There’s plenty at stake; documents reviewed by The New York Times last September suggest the bulk of Mr. Jones’s money comes from his business selling supplement products, allegedly netting more than $20 million in revenue per year. Near the end of the questioning, Mr. Jones suggested his claims about the Sandy Hook massacre were the result of a mental disorder. He said he “almost had like a form of psychosis back in the past where I basically thought everything was staged, even though I’m now learning a lot of times things aren’t staged.” The deposition footage is a rare occasion where Mr. Jones’s anger is caged. But I saw it once before, while covering his child custody trial in 2017, where he claimed that his Infowars persona was “performance art.” Throughout the trial, Mr. Jones, frustrated at being legally compelled to stay quiet, was restless and irritable. On the stand, he couldn’t maintain his composure. His behavior — pretending to lack specific knowledge, wagging his finger at opposing counsel and refusing to answer yes or no questions — was far more reminiscent of a spoiled child than a multimillionaire media tycoon. It’s unsurprising that the opposing legal team chose to release the deposition footage online, where it received tens of thousands of views in just 24 hours. In the sea of viral clips of Alex Jones, he always appears larger than life — and, crucially, in tenuous control of whatever narrative he’s spinning. That control is largely the source of his power over his audience, his employees and his critics. But this new set of viral clips busts the myth of Alex Jones, presenting him in a situation he can neither engineer nor spin. He’s a man who has lost control of the narrative. And it’s this performance — more than any ruling from any judge — that poses the greatest threat to the Infowars empire. The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

2019,Why Did Four Top Democrats Just Say No to 2020?,"Call them the announcements that weren’t. Over the past two days, Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor; Eric H. Holder Jr., the former United States attorney general; and Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon officially declared … drumroll, please … that they would not be running for president in 2020. A fourth Democrat, Hillary Clinton, also said “I’m not running” to a New York City television station. Such is the state of Democratic fervor to challenge President Trump that the party now has a subset of politicians: the almost-rans. Mr. Bloomberg said he felt his time and personal fortune would be better used promoting immigration reform and gun control and fighting climate change. Mr. Holder wants to continue focusing on ending gerrymandering. Mrs. Clinton, who never seriously pursued a third primary bid, said she would keep “standing up for what I believe.” And Mr. Merkley will seek a third term in the Senate in 2020, after the State Legislature rejected his request to allow him to run for both positions simultaneously. [Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter.] “I have felt like I’m sitting on a fence, and I’m getting really uncomfortable sitting on those pickets,” said Mr. Merkley in an interview. “At some point, you just have to say, ‘O.K., I’ve weighed it and reweighed and here’s the right thing to do.’” But there are also other challenges and obstacles facing potential 2020 candidates right now. There are already 14 Democrats running for president, and there is a good chance that a 15th one could enter in the coming weeks: former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who would take up a significant share of the ever-thinning oxygen in the packed race. Another big name, former Representative Beto O’Rourke, is also expected to announce his presidential intentions soon. Mr. Biden and Mr. O’Rourke would add enormous pressure to the competition among the candidates for aides, donations, volunteers, media attention and voter support. The primary race has already created at least one star, with Senator Kamala Harris, of California, attracting enthusiastic admirers who regularly express the hope that they are witnessing the party’s “next Obama.” While the four Democrats who just said no to 2020 did not appear intimidated by a Harris, Biden or O’Rourke candidacy, building an organization and commanding attention only gets harder amid multiple star candidates. There’s also the looming deadline of March 31, when candidates must report their first quarter finances to the Federal Election Commission. Those returns will be scrutinized as an early show of relative strength — or weakness — in the race. “There is a sense that if you’re going to build a presidential team, if you’re going to build the fund-raising base, you’re going to have to work night and day, and you can’t wait forever to do that,” said Mr. Merkley. “There’s a compelling sense of many people feeling like you’ve got to decide by the end of the first quarter.” Candidates who can self-finance their campaigns, like Mr. Bloomberg, would still face a fierce competition to be heard, not only among others in the race but amid intensifying efforts by Democrats on Capitol Hill to investigate the Trump administration. Even the first Democratic debate in June doesn’t hold the promise of much airtime: Depending on how many candidates qualify, the event could become a two-night affair, with candidates assigned a spot based on a random drawing. It didn’t go unnoticed by Mr. Bloomberg that he was the last billionaire considering a bid for the Democratic nomination. Tom Steyer, the California liberal activist, opted against running earlier this year, and if the former Starbucks chief executive Howard Schultz runs, he has said he would do so as an independent. “I believe I would defeat Donald Trump in a general election,” Mr. Bloomberg wrote in a column published Tuesday. “But I am cleareyed about the difficulty of winning the Democratic nomination in such a crowded field.” Populist progressives like Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have made combating the influence of money in politics a core message of their presidential candidacies — arguments that might have proved challenging for Mr. Bloomberg, whose aides said he would spend at least $500 million of his own fortune to defeat President Trump in 2020. Mr. Bloomberg’s moderate, pro-business record and generally favorable view of Wall Street would likely also have posed problems in a party that has shifted left on economic issues like taxing the rich and regulating big banks. Some of those arguments could have posed challenges for Mrs. Clinton, too, who spent decades cultivating a network of high-dollar donors and close relationships with Wall Street to fund her campaigns. Democrats lost more than 1,000 seats in state legislatures and governorships during President Barack Obama’s two terms in the Oval Office, and those defeats found increased scrutiny once Mr. Trump ascended into the presidency and the Democrats held diminished political power. In the three years since, grass-roots organizations and Democratic Party leaders have pledged to take recruitment and support for nonpresidential races more seriously, leading some candidates who had considered a run for president to look further down the ticket. In Mr. Merkley’s video announcing that he would not run, he said, “We need both strong leadership in the Oval Office and strong leadership in the Senate,” a sentiment that was met with applause on social media. Stacey Abrams, the Georgia Democrat who lost her bid for governor in 2018, is being heavily recruited for another statewide race in Georgia. . Mr. O’Rourke, the charismatic Texas Democrat who is expected to run for president after losing a Senate bid in 2018, has also faced several calls to focus his energy at home. [Who’s in? Who’s out? Keep up with the Democratic field with our candidate tracker.] Jeff Hauser, of the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington, tweeted that other Democrats should take a page from Mr. Merkley’s “principled and realistic playbook” and run for Senate. “We need to address the climate crisis, confirm judges & Justices, and in general begin the process of De-Trumpification,” he wrote. Mr. Bloomberg’s non-announcement announcement included plans to invest further in climate activism, which is another way Democrats are choosing to focus on the party’s overall health. Mr. Steyer decided he would instead put his money behind efforts to impeach Mr. Trump. Both Mr. Steyer and Mr. Bloomberg said that, unlike Mr. Schultz, they would not consider a third-party run, which could risk helping Mr. Trump win re-election by siphoning votes from the Democratic candidate. Another thing the four non-candidates have in common: They all represent the back end of a rapidly changing Democratic Party. After their defeat in the 2016 presidential election, a more liberal, more uncompromising wing of the party begin to emerge, desperate to throw off the institutional connections to more centrist figures like the Clintons and Mr. Obama. It was this wing that has helped move presidential candidates further to the left, pushing them to embrace policies like “Medicare for all,” the Green New Deal and the rejection of corporate PAC money. The new crop of Democrats are also more keen to talk about the importance of a candidate’s identity, particularly millennials and nonwhite activists who are driving grass-roots changes among Democrats — “Anybody But a White Guy 2020,” reads a popular sign at presidential rallies. And youth-led social movements about sexual harassment, racial justice, and gun control in recent years have forced Democrats to answer uncomfortable questions about the lack of equitable representation among their caucus in terms of race, gender, and class. Figures such as Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Holder would have been an ideological mismatch for this emerging leftist voice. Mrs. Clinton already struggled to appease the party’s left flank during her 2016 run, and the litmus test issues have only moved further from her core policy center since. Social justice activists were raring to challenge Mr. Holder on his record on police reform as head of Department of Justice. Even Mr. Sanders seemed caught off guard during a recent appearance on The Breakfast Club, the urban radio show targeted to millennials, when a host asked him, “Do we need another white guy as president?”",The New York Times
2019,Why Did I Lose My Sense of Smell?,"Ask Well Impaired smell is common, particularly in the elderly, but in about one in six people, no cause can be identified. Q. I have completely lost my sense of smell and can taste only a few things. I have seen doctors and taken tests, but no answers. I know I’m not the only one with this problem. Any ideas? A. Humans are able to perceive an astounding one trillion odors. But our sense of smell is fragile. About a quarter of adults, and more than half of those over 80, have some degree of olfactory impairment. The sense of taste is often affected at the same time, as the neural pathways of smell and taste commingle in the brain. Having an impaired sense of smell may be more than a nuisance. Studies have linked a decreased sense of smell to a heightened risk for Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, multiple sclerosis and premature death. Common causes of a decreased sense of smell include nasal problems, such as deviated septum and nasal polyps; viruses, such as rhinovirus and Epstein-Barr virus; chronic sinusitis; head injury; and certain cancers. Environmental exposure to cigarette smoke, alcohol, air pollution and toxins further increase the risk. Yet, in about 16 percent of people, no cause can be identified. Eating nuts and fish has been associated with protection against smell impairment, as have exercise and use of cholesterol-lowering drugs and oral steroids. It is unknown, however, whether changing one’s dietary or exercise habits will improve the sense of smell. Medical evaluation typically begins with an otolaryngologist, an ear, nose and throat doctor who will use a standardized scratch-and-sniff test to assess any olfactory deficits. Laboratory tests of blood and nasal mucus and imaging studies, such as CT or M.R.I. scans, are often needed. In some cases, endoscopic surgery, a flexible camera inserted into the nose, may aid in diagnosis and provide therapeutic benefits. Treatment, of course, depends on the cause. When the cause is viral, the sense of smell usually returns with time, but steroid medications may hasten recovery. Patients with chronic sinusitis and nasal polyps may get relief from steroids and surgery. In select cases, monoclonal antibody medications may help. If you are among the 16 percent of patients in whom no cause for impaired sense of smell can be identified, you might find help at a clinic that specializes in taste and smell problems. Your otolaryngologist can refer you to such a clinic, which is usually found at large academic medical centers. Do you have a health question? Ask Well",The New York Times
2019,Why Did Mueller Bypass a Call on Obstruction? What We Know and Don’t,"WASHINGTON — In the days since Attorney General William P. Barr wrote to Congress describing the still secret report by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, a mystery he introduced remains pressing: Why did Mr. Mueller take no position on whether President Trump obstructed justice? Mr. Barr spoke briefly by phone on Wednesday with Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York and the House Judiciary Committee chairman, who has criticized Mr. Barr’s decision to step into the gap left by Mr. Mueller’s team and clear Mr. Trump himself. Mr. Nadler has called on Mr. Barr to swiftly turn over the entire Mueller report, but he said it was “apparent” after they spoke that the Justice Department would not meet his April 2 deadline and that he would not commit to making it public without redactions. “We’re not happy about that, to put it mildly,” Mr. Nadler said. In the meantime, Mr. Barr’s letter offered scant clues. He wrote that Mr. Mueller decided not to make a “traditional prosecutorial judgment” about whether the evidence was sufficient to establish whether Mr. Trump committed a crime but did not explain Mr. Mueller’s reasoning, beyond quoting the special counsel as stating that the question raised “difficult issues” of law and fact. Nor did Mr. Barr say whether Mr. Mueller intended for him to step in and immediately render a judgment, or whether the special counsel instead believed Congress should decide how to proceed on the question without the Justice Department weighing in — at least for now. It is a crime to subvert an official truth-finding proceeding, like a grand-jury investigation, with a bad motive — like covering up personal wrongdoing or embarrassments. Obstruction can be a crime even if investigators fail to prove any underlying criminal offense. As a matter of criminal law, Congress has made it a felony, punishable by 20 years in prison, to obstruct or impede any official proceeding, or try to do so. As a matter of constitutional law — the type in which a president can be impeached for “high crimes” and removed from office by Congress — no written definition or standard exists for obstruction. But both presidents subjected to impeachment proceedings in the modern era, Richard M. Nixon and Bill Clinton, were accused of that offense, among other things. Mr. Barr did not specify. But he said that “most” of Mr. Trump’s actions investigated as potential obstruction of justice were “the subject of public reporting” and that “many” of them “took place in public view.” More than two years of criminal indictments and steady revelations about Trump campaign contacts with Russians reveal the scope of the special counsel investigation. A litany of the president’s actions that have come to light includes: unsuccessfully pressuring James B. Comey, then the F.B.I. director, to end an investigation into the former national security adviser Michael T. Flynn; firing Mr. Comey and then telling the Russian ambassador that the dismissal took “great pressure” off the president over Russia; excoriating Justice Department leaders over the Russia investigation; making at least two aborted efforts to fire Mr. Mueller and shut down the inquiry; and dangling pardons in front of potential witnesses. Though nothing in the Constitution says a president cannot be indicted and criminally prosecuted while in office, the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel has opined that presidents are temporarily immune from criminal charges during their terms. That interpretation of the Constitution is disputed, but it is binding on Justice Department prosecutors — most likely including Mr. Mueller. Mr. Barr wrote to lawmakers that he did not rely on this idea when he declared the evidence insufficient to accuse Mr. Trump of illegal obstruction. But Mr. Barr did not say whether a factor in Mr. Mueller’s decision to sidestep the question was the awkwardness that would flow from making any informal accusation that the president committed a crime without a way, for now, to resolve the matter through a trial. Obstruction usually takes the form of corrupting evidence, like destroying documents or suborning perjury. Though made in impeachment proceedings, not criminal charges, the accusations against Mr. Nixon and Mr. Clinton both fit that category. But the actions by Mr. Trump that attracted scrutiny instead center on his exercise of presidential powers over the criminal justice system. This raises a constitutional question: May Congress make it a crime for a president to exercise executive authority in a corrupt way? Doing so would subject the motivations behind a president’s decisions to second-guessing in court. Many legal scholars say that obstruction laws do apply to a president who abuses his powers to corruptly impede an investigation, arguing that the Constitution does not put the president above the law. But supporters of a stronger vision of executive power, including Mr. Trump’s legal team, disagree. No court has ruled on this issue. Mr. Barr, who has also long espoused a robust vision of executive authority, wrote an unsolicited 19-page memo last June for the Trump administration that strongly pushed the view that obstruction statutes cannot constrain a president’s exercise of his constitutional powers — regardless of his intent. One of the many things that remain unclear is whether Mr. Barr’s view of executive power played a role in Mr. Mueller’s decision to sidestep any conclusion about obstruction. Mr. Trump’s defenders, including his legal team, have objected to accusations that his actions impeded the Russia investigation. They disputed Mr. Comey’s understanding that Mr. Trump was tacitly directing him to end the Flynn investigation and noted that firing the F.B.I. director does not end any particular investigation the bureau is pursuing. Mr. Barr’s terse explanation of his own reasoning — his deputy, Rod J. Rosenstein, concurred, he said — emphasized the difficulty in proving Mr. Trump’s intentions. He stressed that while it was not dispositive that Mr. Mueller had found no illegal conspiracy with Russia for Mr. Trump to cover up, the president should be given the benefit of the doubt about his motives when interpreting ambiguous evidence. Still, Mr. Barr did not address other reasons that Mr. Trump may have had for wanting to stymie a searching look at his actions during the presidential campaign: that it might uncover other crimes or embarrassing acts, like his scheme with his personal lawyer Michael D. Cohen to pay hush money to a pornographic movie actress claiming to have had an affair with him, and the continuing inquiries into his financial dealings that also spun off from Mr. Mueller’s investigation.",The New York Times

Mr. Barr’s terse explanation of his own reasoning — his deputy, Rod J. Rosenstein, concurred, he said — emphasized the difficulty in proving Mr. Trump’s intentions. He stressed that while it was not dispositive that Mr. Mueller had found no illegal conspiracy with Russia for Mr. Trump to cover up, the president should be given the benefit of the doubt about his motives when interpreting ambiguous evidence. Still, Mr. Barr did not address other reasons that Mr. Trump may have had for wanting to stymie a searching look at his actions during the presidential campaign: that it might uncover other crimes or embarrassing acts, like his scheme with his personal lawyer Michael D. Cohen to pay hush money to a pornographic movie actress claiming to have had an affair with him, and the continuing inquiries into his financial dealings that also spun off from Mr. Mueller’s investigation.",The New York Times

2019,Opinion | Why Do Central European Nationalists Love Israel So Much?,"Benjamin Netanyahu provides a very attractive model. Contributing Opinion Writer Periods of major political transformation have never been particularly easy for Jews, and the current moment is no exception. Anti-Semitism is ascendant in Europe and many fear that the resurgence of nationalism will exacerbate it. But there is a twist: Anti-Semitism’s rise in Europe is being accompanied by a growing fascination among Europe’s hard right with Israel and, in particular, its prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. This captivation is particularly acute among the governing national populist parties in Central Europe, a region where anti-Semitism has historically found fertile ground. Central European leaders view Mr. Netanyahu as a close ally. Last year, the Visegrad Group, an organization for cooperation between Central European countries, announced plans to hold a meeting in Israel — its first outside of Europe. That plan was ultimately foiled by a spat between Poland and Israel over the Holocaust, but the symbolism was nonetheless significant and leaders from the three remaining Visegrad Group countries — Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia — went to Israel. For his part, Mr. Netanyahu has cultivated relationships with Central European populist leaders. He called Viktor Orban a “true friend of Israel” at the same time that prominent members of the Jewish community in Budapest were criticizing the Hungarian leader for the anti-Semitic tones of his campaign against George Soros. Why are Central European populists attracted to Mr. Netanyahu’s Israel in the way that Western European leftists of the 1960s and ’70s were once mesmerized by Fidel Castro’s Cuba? Undeniably, there is realpolitik here. Israel is a rational actor and like any rational actor, it wants allies. Mr. Netanyahu sees in the governments of Central Europe potential defenders within the European Union who could help dampen pressure from Brussels over Israel’s checkered human rights record. To that end, he has frequently visited the region. His efforts have been repaid: The Czech Republic, Hungary and Romania recently blocked a European Union statement criticizing the United States over its plan to move its embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. For Central European governments, a special relationship with Israel is a way to benefit from Israel’s dynamic economy and cozy up to President Trump and his pro-Israel administration. It is widely believed in the region that in order for a leader of a small Central European country to get an invitation to visit the White House, he should either buy a lot of American military equipment or Mr. Netanyahu should lobby for the visit. But the populist alliance with Israel is more than a marriage of convenience and strategic calculation. Shlomo Avineri, the great liberal Israeli scholar, once argued that while Israel is in the Middle East, its politics are often East European. It’s not just that the former Soviet Union is the No. 1 source of emigration to Israel these days, though that, too, seems to be affecting the country’s politics. Many of the founders of the Jewish state were from Central and Eastern Europe and their political imagination was shaped by the politics of the newly independent states that emerged in the region after World War I. Zionism in many respects was the mirror image of the nationalistic — and often anti-Semitic — politics that dominated Central and Eastern Europe between the two world wars. What attracts Eastern European populists to Israel today is their old dream realized: Israel is a democracy, but an ethnic democracy; it defines itself as the state for Jews in the same way East Europeans imagine their countries as a state for Poles, Hungarians or Slovaks. It has preserved the heroic ethos of sacrifice in the name of the nation that nationalist politicians covet for their own societies. Then there’s demographics. Central and Eastern Europeans see Israel as the only Western society that is winning the population war by reversing the trend of demographic decline. At the moment when Eastern Europe is the fastest shrinking region in the world, Israel’s success in persuading diasporic Jews to return, and its efficacy in convincing Israelis to have more children, looks like a miracle. East European populists also share Mr. Netanyahu’s mistrust in anything that appears post-national or hints of cosmopolitanism. They agree with Yoram Hazony, a conservative Israeli political philosopher and Netanyahu supporter who is the author of the influential “The Virtue of Nationalism,” who says that the major political clash in world history is neither between classes nor nations, but between nationalists who believe that the nation state is the best form of political organization and imperialists who advocate for universal empire. For Mr. Hazony and for his followers, the Roman Empire, the Hapsburg Empire, the Soviet Union, the European Union, and even the post-Cold War United States are just different embodiments of the idea of universal empire. And the responsibility of genuine nationalists is to fight for their destruction. Mr. Netanyahu provides an attractive model of politics in other ways, too. He fights elections like they are take-no-prisoner wars and his voters are willing to forgive accusations of corruption against him. Mr. Orban sees much to admire there. Meanwhile, he is willing to weather criticism from the rest of the world, while simultaneously retaining the right to feel like a victim — a strategy the Law and Justice party in Poland is emulating. Israel is a small country, but thanks to its economic and military power it plays in the league of the great powers, and demonstrates a capacity to defy even the United States. Understanding Central European nationalists’ fascination with Israel helps us grasp their political dreams, but it also reveals their limits. A key to Israel’s nationalist politics and its resistance to international pressure is the Israeli argument that the country faces existential threats. Yes, sometimes Israeli politicians cynically exploit those threats, but still the threats are real. The same cannot be said of Central Europe, which now as part of the European Union enjoys the most peaceful period in the region’s history. Populist leaders in Central Europe view Israel as the model of how a small state could be sovereign and heroic. But it is the dream of a normal life rather than a fantasy of heroic sacrifice that ultimately motivates most East Europeans. In other words, it is easier to admire Israel than to persuade their societies to emulate it. The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

2019,Why Do Garfield Phones Keep Washing Up on This Beach?,"LONDON — For three decades it was a mystery that seemed to defy belief. Bright orange plastic novelty phones shaped like the grumpy cartoon cat Garfield kept washing up on the rocky Atlantic shoreline of Brittany, in western France. Over the years, locals have picked up hundreds of pieces of the phones, including paws, headset cables and even Garfield heads, forever fixed in his familiar smirk. But nobody knew exactly where they came from. Last week, volunteers cleaning the beaches solved the puzzle: The source of the Garfield phones was a long-lost shipping container, nestled in a rocky sea cave. “This waste is over 30 years old, and we are still finding bits,” Fabien Boileau, the director of the Iroise Marine Natural Park, told the news site FranceInfo, citing it as an example of plastic debris that never fully breaks down and contributes to ocean pollution. The disturbing longevity of these plastic pieces, some of which look practically new, have made the Garfield phones into a local symbol of marine pollution. The mystery of the phones gained national prominence after journalists at FranceInfo reported on the case as part of a campaign called Pollution Alert. Around 148 million shipping containers are sent by sea each year, according to the International Maritime Organization, a United Nations agency. Between 2008 and 2016, shipping companies lost over 1,500 containers on average each year, most during accidents such as capsizing, running aground or when sailing in heavy seas, according to a survey by the World Shipping Council, a trade association. In one accident alone in 2014, more than 500 containers were lost from a ship run by the company Maersk in a storm in the Bay of Biscay. Depending on what is in them, lost containers can have long-lasting effects on marine life and coastal communities. (Most of the containers lost in the 2014 Maersk accident were empty, and none contained hazardous material, the company said.) Rules on reporting and dealing with lost containers vary globally. As part of an action plan on marine waste, the International Maritime Organization plans to discuss in May setting standard procedures for the reporting of lost containers and for addressing liability for plastic consumer goods lost at sea. Volunteers in Brittany tracked down the source of the Garfield phones after a local man told them about a big storm that struck in the early 1980s. Last week they ventured into the sea cave, normally cut off by the tide and only accessible a few days each year, where they found metal from a container and Garfield-shaped phone shells, still containing potentially dangerous electronic components. The telephones appeared to have been those made by Tyco, advertised in the 1980s as “real phones for real fun.” They feature a keypad, have a classic electric “ring” — and Garfield’s eyelids slide half-open when the user picks up the handset. They have survived as vintage items, still sold on auction websites and at flea markets. They will also very likely continue to haunt the Brittany shoreline. “Behind the fun character of Garfield, there is plastic pollution that does not decompose in the ocean, and that we will continue to face for years,” said Claire Simonin-Le Meur, a local volunteer.",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | Why Do We Think Suffering Is Good for Us?,"A psychiatrist wonders if there’s a way to use drugs to speed up the painful work of therapy. Dr. Friedman is a psychiatrist and a contributing opinion writer. Feeling anxious or depressed and want to get better? You have to really work at it and suffer through years of therapy and sometimes try lots of drugs. No pain, no gain, or so we’ve been told. That would make a stoic happy, but as a psychiatrist — and an admittedly impatient one — I know that just because something feels bad doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s good for you. I’m pretty confident that people who are suffering prefer relief sooner rather than later and that if there was any way to make the treatment — be it psychotherapy or medication — more effective, they would gladly try it. So I am cautiously optimistic that on Tuesday, the Food and Drug Administration approved esketamine, a nasal version of the drug ketamine, which appears to relieve depressive symptoms far faster than other antidepressants. There are risks: The drug is potentially addictive, heavy use can impair cognition, and it could induce a psychotic reaction in some patients. But if prescribed judiciously, esketamine should be a boon to the 25 percent of people with depression who fail to respond to current drugs. I have been wondering if esketamine could be used for another purpose, too: to strengthen the effects of therapy. This is because it targets the neurotransmitter glutamate, which plays an important role in learning and memory. There is intriguing neuroscience research that suggests that it may be possible to boost the efficacy of psychotherapy with drugs that share some of ketamine’s effects, somewhat the way athletes can enhance their performance with steroids. A while back, I saw a young woman who had been mugged on her way home from work. She was pushed to the ground by an unseen assailant who stole her wallet and fled, leaving her shaken up but otherwise unharmed. In the next few weeks, she become increasingly anxious when walking alone at night and had intrusive flashbacks of the assault during the day. Normally, you would lose this fear after being back on the street a few times and seeing that nothing traumatic happens. But she’d developed classic post-traumatic stress disorder, in which a previously safe situation provokes a persistent, and visceral, sense of danger. She began exposure therapy with one of my colleagues in which she gradually confronted the situation she feared — a dark city street — alongside her therapist, who assured her that nothing terrible would happen. Like many people, she found this treatment upsetting and emotionally draining, but she stuck it out and eventually recovered. What if we could use a drug to speed up a difficult treatment like that and make it more effective? The psychologist JoAnn Difede and her colleagues at Weill Cornell Medical College, where I also work, addressed that question with a study in 2013 of 25 patients who developed PTSD after Sept. 11. They randomly assigned the participants to virtual reality exposure (12 weekly sessions of simulated attacks on the World Trade Center combined with patients’ recounting their traumatic experience in vivid detail) with either the drug d-cycloserine or a placebo. Subjects who received exposure along with d-cycloserine showed faster and greater improvement in their PTSD and depressive symptoms, and the benefits persisted after six months of follow-up. Of course, this was a very small study. A 2017 meta-analysis of 21 studies found that d-cycloserine was superior to a placebo in boosting the short-term effect of exposure-based therapy, though any long-term effects were less consistent. Studies of the drug in rodents have also found that it helps the animals recover from the fear of shocks much faster than a placebo. How might this work? D-cycloserine is an antibiotic that, like ketamine, increases the activity of glutamate in key brain regions, which promotes connections between neurons. It seems to amp up the molecular machinery of learning. And psychotherapy is all about learning — to overcome fear and to better handle stress, among other lessons. For decades, psychoanalysts were against medicating anxiety at all, because they believed it would interfere with the therapeutic process. Fortunately, those days are largely over. Many are now comfortable giving patients anti-anxiety benzodiazepines like Klonopin if they are having a hard time grappling with issues that arise in therapy. Treating excessive anxiety can allow patients to better face their pain and fears. This research suggests we could be doing more to use drugs to turbocharge therapy. The timing of drug and treatment is probably crucial. In one study, rats were trained to fear a particular context (cage) or a cue (white light) by pairing them with a mild shock. The animals then underwent fear-extinction therapy, either in one long session after receiving a benzodiazepine or in two sessions with the drug given in between. The latter group were more successful at getting over their fear, which suggests that some exposure therapy must precede the medication. But maybe, with the help of the right drug, just a little therapy could go a long way. One small study randomized 20 subjects with PTSD to receive just two sessions of therapy in addition to either MDMA (the party drug Ecstasy) or a placebo. Those who got MDMA had fewer PTSD symptoms and were more open and less “neurotic” than those who took a placebo at a two-month follow-up. It’s not that surprising. MDMA is known to promote openness and lack of defensiveness, both of which might be conducive to attaining insights. Could that wisdom be as enduring as the kind acquired during months of therapy? It’s possible. After all, therapy and prescription drugs like antidepressants change the brain in surprisingly similar ways. It was Aeschylus, the ancient Greek tragedian, who wrote that it was God’s law that “he who learns must suffer.” Even in our sleep, he wrote, “pain that cannot forget, falls drop by drop upon the heart, and in our own despair, against our will, comes wisdom to us by the awful grace of God.” I hate to argue with Aeschylus, but I see more and more evidence that there’s no need to suffer quite so much on the way to self-improvement.

2019,Opinion | Why Does the U.S. Tolerate So Much Risk?,"The United States has a higher threshold than other developed nations for allowing corporations to risk the health and safety of consumers. The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section. The United States increasingly stands apart from European nations in its approach to regulation. Europe is willing to constrain potentially harmful corporate behavior on a precautionary basis, while the United States requires stronger evidence of danger. The difference was on display this week as the European Union moved more quickly than the United States to ground a popular airplane, the Boeing 737 Max 8, after a pair of fatal crashes. The European Union Aviation Safety Agency acted Tuesday “as a precautionary measure.” Britain, which acted separately, and slightly before the Pan-European regulator, offered an even more explicit account of its reasoning, explaining that it was grounding the Boeing planes because authorities did not know the cause of the most recent crash, of an Ethiopian Airlines plane on Sunday. The Federal Aviation Administration, by contrast, said until Wednesday that the absence of information was the reason it was letting domestic airlines keep the planes in the air. And on Wednesday, when the F.A.A. joined other nations in grounding the planes, the agency insisted that it was acting because it had obtained new evidence. Daniel Elwell, the agency’s acting administrator, defended the pace of its decision-making, telling NPR on Thursday, “We’re a data-driven organization. … We make safety decisions based on what we know.” There were no crashes between the two decisions, but the difference remains significant. Both regulators had the same information in hand and, for roughly 24 hours, the F.A.A. decided to subject American airline employees and passengers to a greater degree of risk. The difference in risk tolerance is only part of the story. The Trump administration has openly discouraged the enforcement of a wide range of existing federal regulations. The Wall Street Journal reported the total value of fines imposed on commercial airlines by the F.A.A. in 2018 was 88 percent lower than the total value of fines in 2016. The White House last year proposed to reduce funding and staffing for the F.A.A.’s Aviation Safety Office. Also, nations often are more reluctant to crack down on domestic companies. Mr. Elwell has insisted that the F.A.A. made its decisions solely on the basis of safety. But if safety was the only consideration, then any risk would have warranted action. The F.A.A. is necessarily in the business of balancing the economic benefits of aviation against the safety of passengers. And the economic benefits include Boeing’s role as a major employer and exporter. But the calibration of regulation still plays an important role. The 1992 Maastricht Treaty, which started the project of creating a single set of European regulations, enshrined a “precautionary principle,” meaning that government can impose restrictions even when there is not clear evidence of harm. “Those in public office have a duty not to wait until their worst fears are realized,” Robert Coleman, then the European Commission’s director general for health and consumer protection, said in 2002. The United States, meanwhile, has moved in the other direction. “As European policymakers have grown more willing to regulate risks on precautionary grounds, increasingly skeptical American policymakers have called for higher levels of scientific certainty before imposing additional regulatory controls on business,” David Vogel, a political scientist at the University of California, Berkeley, wrote in a 2012 book on the divide, “The Politics of Precaution.” European nations initially lagged behind the United States in protecting the health and safety of their citizens, which created a popular backlash that gained strength after a series of disasters, including the meltdown at the Chernobyl nuclear plant in 1986. The political environment also has been more supportive in Europe. Right-wing parties in Europe generally are neither as skeptical of science nor as devoted to business as the Republican Party in the United States can be. The consequences are wide-ranging. In 2010, for example, the European Union banned bisphenol-A (BPA), a chemical used in the formulation of hard, clear plastics, from plastic baby bottles. John Dalli, then the European commissioner for health and consumer policy, cited “uncertainty” about the health effects of ingesting BPA by way of explanation. The United States Food and Drug Administration insisted there was no evidence of danger. It did not remove the chemical from its list of approved substances in baby bottles until after manufacturers of baby bottles, concerned about a consumer backlash, stopped using BPA voluntarily. Other recent examples of Europe’s more aggressive approach include a ban on the use of pesticides that appeared to be killing bees, prohibitions on the inclusion of some antibiotics in animal feed and restrictions on waste incinerators. Precautionary regulation imposes real economic costs. In some cases, the more permissive stance of the United States may well be justified. The case of the Boeing 737 Max 8, however, should not have been a close call. Though the risk of another crash was unknown, the F.A.A. should have recognized that the potential for another loss of human life was an unbearable expense. The rapidity of the agency’s reversal — while information about the Ethiopia crash was still quite limited — suggests in this case, at least, that regulators accepted the wisdom of a little more caution.

2019,Why Don’t More American Men Get Vasectomies?,"It’s vasectomy season in the United States. But American women get sterilized at higher rates. [A newsletter for parents with evidence-based guidance and personal stories for your transformed life with kids. Sign up to get NYT Parenting in your inbox every week.] March Madness is upon us, and for urologists throughout the country that means one thing: It’s vasectomy season. Let me explain. Every year, men schedule their vasectomies in conjunction with the N.C.A.A. men’s basketball tournament, so they can watch the games while recovering on the couch with a frozen bag of peas. In fact, at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., so many men sign up for vasectomies during March Madness that appointments reach “max capacity,” said Dr. Tobias S. Kohler, a urologist and men’s health expert at the medical center who has observed this phenomenon ever since he was an attending physician a decade ago. But even though a study last year found a peak in the number of vasectomies during March — and also at the end of the year during the holidays — most men in this country don’t opt for sterilization: They rely on their female partners to prevent pregnancy. In the United States, female sterilization is twice as prevalent as vasectomy, according to 2015 estimates from the United Nations — despite the fact that vasectomy is equally effective, less invasive and carries a lower risk of complications. Why? It’s a blend of cost, misconceptions and fears about the procedure, and cultural expectations about what truly defines a man. Chris Lopez, 34, a father of three boys in Suffolk, Va., said even though he and his wife are not planning to have more children, he’s against the idea of a vasectomy. “If I couldn’t produce kids for some medical reason or biological reason, I know for a fact it would make me feel not good about myself,” he said. For Mr. Lopez, the ability to rear children is tied to his beliefs about masculinity. A man is many things, he said: strong, brave, a good dancer — but also, he’s supposed to be able to “have kids if that’s what he wants.” Then there are the practical considerations, he added. Looking ahead 20 years, will he and his wife still be married? Will she even be alive? “Maybe I meet a younger woman or something like that and she wants to have kids, and then I can’t give that to her,” Mr. Lopez said. His wife, Sarah Kennedy-Lopez, 38, said she laughed when she and her husband first discussed these hypothetical scenarios, but even so, she understands where he’s coming from. “Not all couples do make it,” she said, adding, “life does go on should a spouse die.” Their children — a 7-year-old and 4-year-old twins — were conceived via in vitro fertilization, and her chances of getting pregnant without assistance are so low that neither of them uses birth control. So she isn’t pressing the issue. “A couple times I have said to him, ‘Well, you know you could get a vasectomy and take care of that, so there would be no worries,’ and he says, ‘No, no, no — I’m not doing that. You can go and get your tubes tied,’” she said. “But I wouldn’t want to do that either, especially because I feel like I went through enough in conceiving our children in the first place.” Studies have shown that men who receive vasectomies in the United States are typically white, non-Hispanic and live in the North Central and Western regions of the country. They also tend to have private insurance. Vasectomy is covered either partially or in full under most insurance plans, but the procedure may require a referral from a primary care provider. Without insurance, the price is usually about $1,000. Vasectomy reversals, however, are not covered by insurance, and the procedure is cumbersome and expensive. By contrast, the Affordable Care Act required insurance companies to cover 18 types of contraception used by women, including sterilization surgery, and no co-payment is required. Aside from cost, getting a vasectomy often requires multiple visits to the doctor — first to establish consent, then to have the surgery and later to figure out when the sperm has been purged from the ejaculate. The entire process can take three months or more. Dr. Anuj Khattar, a fellow with Physicians for Reproductive Health who practices in the Seattle area, estimated that after the initial consultation, 20 to 30 percent of his patients end up either changing their minds or simply not showing up for the procedure. “I think part of the fears around vasectomy is that it’s so permanent,” Dr. Khattar said, adding that some men worry about “losing some of their virility and their ability to enjoy sex.” But “physiologically, it doesn’t affect any of those functions,” he said. “There’s just a lot of misinformation.” Ryan Cragun, a professor of sociology at the University of Tampa and father of one, said that despite his desire to get a vasectomy, he too had last-minute doubts: “Oh my gosh, I’m basically sterilizing myself,” he recalled thinking. Even though it is estimated that about half a million men receive vasectomies in the United States each year, Dr. Cragun said it isn’t something men tend to talk openly about. Post-vasectomy, he reports his sex life has improved, especially now that his wife is no longer taking birth control. “Her libido is up, there’s no condom involved — it’s better. That’s a win-win in every regard,” he said. In some countries, including Britain, South Korea, Canada, Ireland, Spain and Australia, the prevalence of vasectomy exceeds that of female sterilization, according to the United Nations. But worldwide, just like in the United States, female sterilization is far more common, and couples who use contraception choose methods designed to be used by women. Caila Smith, 25, a mother in Huntington, Ind., said she was encouraged to get her tubes tied by some of her health care providers after she became pregnant with twins a second time. She didn’t like the side effects of the birth control pill or Depo-Provera injections, both of which she had tried in the past, so she opted for tubal ligation after her children were born, in part because it was covered in full by insurance and she was told she could get the procedure done during her cesarean section. After enduring a painful recovery, she learned that her fiancé could have gotten a vasectomy at minimal cost and that she now has a higher risk of ectopic pregnancy, something that wasn’t clear to her beforehand. “They gave me a form and I guess I just kind of skimmed through it, you know, without digging too deep into what could happen,” she said. “If I knew then what I knew now, I feel like I would have pushed for him to get a vasectomy.” Unlike vasectomy, which is a quick outpatient procedure to cut and seal the tubes that carry sperm and block the transfer of sperm to the ejaculate, tubal ligation is far more invasive and often conducted under general anesthesia. The surgery, which involves cutting or blocking the fallopian tubes, carries higher rates of complications, including damage to surrounding organs, said Dr. Holly Bullock, an assistant professor in the department of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Arizona College of Medicine in Tucson. The procedure does have its benefits, however. “It is immediately effective and can be completely her decision that does not rely upon a partner’s follow-through to get the procedure and the follow-up post-vasectomy semen analysis to prove that it was effective,” Dr. Bullock said. Tubal ligation may even reduce the risk of ovarian cancer, particularly among women who have BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutations, according to the American Cancer Society. And removing both fallopian tubes entirely, a procedure called salpingectomy, is thought to reduce the risk even more, Dr. Bullock said. That’s because doctors now believe that some ovarian cancers originate in the cells of the tubes. But, she added, she recommends vasectomy to patients who are exploring permanent options. Marco Cabrera, 38, a father of two in Traverse City, Mich., who had a vasectomy in 2016, said, “I feel like this is one place where men need to quote-unquote man up,” adding that he knew men who had refused to get vasectomies, insisting that their wives undergo sterilization instead. “I’m just really unimpressed with some of the men I meet,” he said. Despite having had complications after the surgery, “I still think the vasectomy was worth it,” he said. “I don’t have to worry anymore. I know I’ve done my part.”",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | Why Housing Policy Is Climate Policy,"In California, where home prices are pushing people farther from their jobs, rising traffic is creating more pollution. Senator Wiener is the chairman of the California Senate’s Housing Committee. Dr. Kammen is a professor of energy at the University of California, Berkeley. California has long been seen as a leader on climate change. The state’s history of aggressive action to reduce air pollution, accelerate the use of renewable energy and speed the transition to a low-carbon, climate-resilient economy has inspired governments around the world to set more ambitious climate goals. But there is trouble on the horizon, and California’s climate leadership is at risk. Across most of the state’s economy, greenhouse gas emissions have been trending steadily down. But ballooning car traffic on city streets and freeways is negating much of that progress. In California, about 40 percent of greenhouse gas emissions are from transportation, and they are increasing. In some California counties, two-thirds of emissions are from vehicles. In November, the California Air Resources Board released an update on efforts to reduce pollution from transportation. The numbers were alarming. Despite headlines about California’s push for more electric vehicles, pollution from cars is still climbing. “With emissions from the transportation sector continuing to rise, California will not achieve the necessary greenhouse gas emissions reductions to meet mandates for 2030,” the board warned. The solution? “Significant changes to how communities and transportation systems are planned, funded and built,” the board said. Put more directly, in order to solve the climate crisis, we have to solve the housing crisis. Numerous climate researchers have a similar conclusion. In an assessment of the carbon footprint of 700 California cities, experts with the Renewable and Appropriate Energy Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley, including one of us (Dr. Kammen), found that, for most coastal California cities, “infill” housing — that is, housing built in urban areas, near transit, jobs and services — can reduce greenhouse gas pollution more effectively than any other option. Other research has confirmed this work, and bolstered the case for using denser housing and public transportation as weapons against climate change. The relationship between housing and transportation emissions is not complicated. The housing crisis in our cities and job centers — California is short 3.5 million homes, according to a report by the McKinsey Global Institute — is forcing more workers to “drive till they qualify,” the term used by real estate agents for what a growing number of Californians have to do to find housing they can afford. As cities that are job centers make it hard or impossible to build housing — for example, through de facto bans on apartment buildings in areas zoned for single-family homes — people who are priced out move further away, resulting in sprawl that covers up farmland and open space, clogs freeways and increases greenhouse gas emissions. Of the 100 largest U.S. metropolitan areas, these are the 20 with the greatest proportion of residents working full-time who spend 90 minutes or more getting to their jobs. (Nationally, 72 percent of these super-commuters drive.) Eight of these areas are in California; the San Francisco area has seen the most growth in ultra-commuters since 2005.

By The New York Times | Source: Apartment List The results are anything but equitable. By making housing shockingly expensive near jobs and transit, cities force low-income and working-class people to live far away from where they work. Our communities lose their economic diversity, while the abundant opportunities, services and neighborhood amenities of cities are walled off to all but the very wealthy. Low-density, single-family-home zoning is effectively a ban on economically diverse communities. Californians need more and better alternatives to cars for transportation, and easier access to walkable communities and affordable housing near mass transit. Of course, we also have to accelerate the electrification of our vehicles, another way to reduce pollution from cars. But, as the air resources board has found, electrification alone cannot happen fast enough to solve the problem, and we need to reduce the number of miles people drive by 25 percent. In his first major speech since taking office, Gov. Gavin Newsom placed solving the housing crisis at the top of his agenda. Under his proposed budget, cities that don’t build enough housing will lose state transportation funding. And this legislative session, a bipartisan coalition of California legislators is supporting the More Homes Act, which is sponsored by one of us (Senator Wiener). The bill would override local restrictive zoning by legalizing small to midsize apartment buildings (up to five stories) near job centers and public transportation and set minimum affordability standards for some of those units. The legislation would also help existing renters keep their homes in areas that qualify for new housing. The measures are intended to stem the growth of super-commuters — workers who are priced out of areas near their jobs and forced to drive long distances to get to work. Cities across the United States face issues similar to those in California, too many of which have largely closed the doors to new residents — only to force them into similar patterns of crushing commutes and worsening pollution. Measures like the More Homes Act offer a road map to cities and states that want to address these issues head-on. In fact, we’d argue that surging interest in urban housing and transportation issues, and the rise of the grass roots Yes in My Back Yard movement that’s behind it, is perhaps the most hopeful development in the American climate movement in recent years. Unlike many of our climate policy challenges, housing and transit are largely controlled by cities and states. If we can build more momentum for more homes near transit and jobs, we can continue to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, in California and around the country, and make sure our progress continues apace.

2019,Opinion | Why Impeaching Trump Is ‘Worth It’,"People say that the 1998 impeachment of Bill Clinton hurt Republicans. Did it really? Mr. Reines is a former senior adviser to Hillary Clinton. The impeachment of Bill Clinton backfired on Republicans. It’s a sentiment repeated daily without question on cable news, in Congress and probably inside the White House. But exactly how did impeachment backfire? With two decades of hindsight, it’s not clear the Republicans faced any lasting consequences — a perspective that should inform any Democrat considering whether to undertake the same effort against President Trump. The case for why impeachment hurt the Republicans is straightforward. Most obviously, it didn’t work: President Clinton was not convicted and removed from office. In fact, in early 1999, at the height of the impeachment process, he was more popular than at any other time of his presidency. Furthermore, in the fall of 1998, at the first opportunity for voters to express their feelings at the ballot box after the House voted to begin an impeachment inquiry, the Democrats picked up five seats in the House of Representatives, an embarrassment that drove Newt Gingrich from the speaker’s office. But consider what followed. First, the Republicans went on to take or hold the White House in three of the next five presidential elections — including the 2016 race between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. And while Democrats did gain a handful of House seats in midterm elections in 1998, the Republicans maintained control for eight more years, until disapproval of the Iraq war finally tipped Congress to the Democrats in 2006. On the Senate side in 1998, the Republicans maintained their 55-45 majority. With the exception of a 17-month window in 2002 and 2003, Republicans controlled the Senate until 2006. In short, the Republican wave of 1994 endured for nearly a decade after the failed impeachment. It’s true that Mr. Clinton was not removed from office, but Republicans used the fact of his impeachment as a cudgel first against his vice president, Al Gore, and later against his wife. While its impact can’t be quantified, it sure didn’t help either in their election bids. Finally, and most important, the very myth that the 1998 impeachment hurt Republicans protects them today, when pressure to move against Mr. Trump is met with concerns about the political fallout. Clearly, we need to reconsider that myth. Basically, a high crime committed by a Republican won’t be prosecuted because a Democrat was persecuted over a misdemeanor. There are many reasons for Democrats to contemplate impeachment today that go beyond politics. Substantial evidence has already emerged showing that the president has abused his office to the detriment of the American public. That evidence deserves a thorough and transparent airing in Congress, arguably the only venue available for trying a sitting president. Still, as pundits never tire of saying, impeachment is a political process, not a legal one — and the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and Senator Chuck Schumer are right to wonder whether it makes sense to seek impeachment, especially given the unlikelihood of enough Republicans breaking ranks in the Senate. On Monday, Ms. Pelosi said that, for now, Mr. Trump was “not worth” the cost of impeachment to the country. But impeachment is worth it, politically, and not just because of what history shows us. If anything, Democrats are in an even better position than Republicans were in 1998 to benefit, or at worst not suffer, politically. For one thing, 22 Republican senators are up for re-election in 2020, against just 12 Democrats. Especially if the public support for impeachment continues to grow, a Republican vote to acquit the president could tip at least a few vulnerable Republican seats. Also, one reason people think the Republicans suffered for 1998 is that everyone knew, then and later, that it was a crassly political move — Mr. Clinton’s lapses, however you judge them, were personal, not the sort of “high crimes and misdemeanors” that impeachment is intended to address. Most voters today, whether they support Mr. Trump or not, will probably see a potential impeachment against him differently. Especially as the evidence mounts, reasonable people will more and more conclude that the Democrats are doing their civic duty by pursuing impeachment (and those who disagree probably wouldn’t vote Democratic anyway). There is also a mounting political cost to not impeaching Mr. Trump. He will hail it as exoneration and he will go into the 2020 campaign under the banner “I Told You So,” declaring that for all their talk of removing him from office, Democrats had merely been playing politics for three years. All this assumes that impeachment won’t happen. But the political case is so strong, and the evidence against Mr. Trump so persuasive, that however unlikely, it is not impossible that 20 Republican senators join the Democrats. But perhaps the most persuasive political case for impeachment is the long view. Set aside what it would mean for the 2020 elections. Mr. Trump is a pernicious, divisive figure who is poisoning our politics, and hopes to do so for years to come. Should he lose in 2020, he has already laid the groundwork for an all-out assault against the media, the political establishment and the Democratic Party itself. Politically, we — the country, not just the Democratic Party — cannot accept that risk. Impeachment might be the only remedy we have.

2019,Why International Women’s Day Isn’t Going Away,"For all the progress women have made, they are still a long way from true equality. LONDON — After a series of historic firsts and long-overdue breakthroughs, 2018 was called “the Year of the Woman.” A record 36 women won seats in the United States House of Representatives in midterm elections in November. Ireland voted to repeal one of the world’s most restrictive abortion bans. Ethiopia appointed its first female president. And women in Saudi Arabia were not only allowed to attend a public soccer match for the first time, they were also permitted to drive legally. But it was also the year when there were fewer female Republicans in the United States Senate than men named John in the same chamber. International Women’s Day, observed on March 8, was made a public holiday in Berlin, the German capital, in January. It has always been a way to celebrate women’s achievements and to call attention to all the work still left to be done on a global scale. (The theme for 2019 is “Balance for Better”: seeking gender balance in the boardroom and elsewhere.) In fact, more than 30 female leaders — past and present — recently warned in an open letter that progress was eroding, with Susana Malcorra, the former Argentine foreign minister, telling The Guardian that some countries led by “macho-type strongman” leaders are a factor. It was a reminder that global gender parity still remained out of reach. Here are some numbers that tell the story. That’s the minimum number of women and girls on the planet who have undergone female genital cutting, the United Nations says. The number of women and girls around the world who did not attend school in 2016, according to the Global Partnership for Education, an international organization. That was the share of female chief executives at United States’ Fortune 500 companies in 2018 — 24, down from a record 32 in 2017. Between 1901 and 2018, 904 individuals (some have won more than once) have been awarded the Nobel Prize, with just 52 women winning the Nobel Prize and prize in economic sciences, according to the Nobel’s website. This is how many women and girls alive today who have been married before the age of 18. Twelve million girls marry before age 18 every year — 23 girls every minute, according to Girls Not Brides, a global partnership of civil society organizations that focuses on ending child marriage. Child marriage, any formal or informal union where at least one of the parties is under 18, can be a result of traditional practices, gender inequality, poverty and illiteracy, experts say. In Ethiopia, for example, 40 percent of girls were married in 2017 before they were 18; 14 percent had become wives before the age of 15. The #MeToo campaign was a watershed moment in the movement to fight gender violence, as women from all walks of life publicly shared their own stories of rape, sexual harassment and other kinds of assault. One in three women around the world have experienced either physical or sexual violence, according to the World Health Organization. One in five women and girls ages from 15 to 49 have reported being victims of physical or sexual violence by an intimate partner, the United Nations said, adding that 49 countries have no legislation protecting women from domestic violence. This is about how many women are murdered globally every year for having “dishonored” their families. In 2017, the United States Defense Department received 6,769 reports of sexual assault involving service members as either victims or subjects of criminal investigation — 4,193 were from women, according to a statement released in May. On Wednesday, the first American woman in the Air Force to fly in combat, Senator Martha McSally, Republican of Arizona, revealed in powerful testimony before a Senate committee that she had been raped by a superior officer and sexually assaulted multiple times during her career. Women account for more than half of all people living with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS. And AIDS-related illnesses remain “the leading cause of death for women of reproductive age,” according to Avert, an international charity. This is the portion of female representation in national parliaments in the world, according to the United Nations. The percentage of women agricultural landholders in the world, the United Nations says. Governments have passed laws to fix the gender wage gap, and some companies, such as PwC and Shell U.K., are making an effort to narrow the discrepancy. But globally, women still earn 77 percent of what men do, the United Nations said. Women may make up almost half of the world’s population, but more than 2.7 billion of them are legally restricted from having the same choice of jobs as men. Men in 18 countries even have the right to legally prevent their wives from working. And some jobs, such as domestic work, are entirely unpaid. “The global value of this work each year is estimated at 10 trillion U.S.D. — which is equivalent to one-eighth of the world’s entire G.D.P.,” according to Oxfam. Over all, female participation in the global work force remains low compared to that of men — 26.7 percent lower, according to figures from the United Nations. Finally, as women break barriers — NASA is planning the first all-female spacewalk on March 29 — no woman has ever been known to hold these jobs: Secretary general of the United Nations; archbishop of Canterbury; Catholic priest; prime minister of Belgium, the Netherlands or Spain; governor of the Bank of England; and president of the United States. An earlier version of a picture caption with this article referred incorrectly to the holiday for International Women's Day in Germany. It was made a public holiday in the state of Berlin, not a national holiday.",The New York Times
2019,Why Is California All Over the College Admissions Scandal?,"California Today Good morning. (Here’s the sign-up, if you don’t already get California Today by email.) The college admissions fraud scandal that erupted Tuesday captivated the country — unsurprisingly, given how it hit straight at the heart of intersecting debates about class, wealth and privilege, and how thoroughly it seemed to lay waste to myths about American academia as a meritocracy. Dozens of people were charged in a scheme that involved wealthy parents paying bribes to get their children into elite universities, like Wake Forest, Yale, Stanford, U.S.C. and U.C.L.A. Also accused were top coaches whom federal prosecutors said accepted millions of dollars in exchange for help getting the students “recruited” as athletes, even if they didn’t play sports. You can read more about the case — the Justice Department’s largest ever college admissions prosecution — here, in this story by my colleagues Jennifer Medina, Katie Benner and Kate Taylor. And you can read up on how the alleged scheme worked, according to court documents, in this explainer. What struck me about the case was the involvement of many parents and participants from California. The actresses Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin, as well as Ms. Loughlin’s husband, the designer Mossimo Giannulli, all of Los Angeles, were among the parents accused. So were financiers from ritzy Bay Area suburbs, a vineyard owner from San Francisco and executives from coastal Orange County. Decorated water polo and soccer coaches at California schools have been fired or placed on leave since the news broke. And the man at the center of it all, William Singer, ran his business from Newport Beach, after working as a college counselor in Sacramento. So what is it about the Golden State that allegedly fueled this kind of scheme? I asked Jerome Karabel, a U.C. Berkeley sociologist who has written extensively about college admissions. On a broad level, he told me, the case reveals a fundamental “crisis” in American society. “As America has become more and more unequal, affluent parents have become increasingly desperate to pass on their advantages to their children and to avoid downward mobility at all costs,” Mr. Karabel said. “Elite colleges have become seen as insurance against downward mobility.” That effect is magnified in California, one of the most economically unequal states in the country — which also happens to be home to some of the most desirable universities in the country. “California is an epicenter of enormous wealth,” he said. “And basically where you have major concentrations of wealth, you have the possibility of corruption.” Mr. Karabel said that the alleged scheme appeared to stem less from the parents’ desire to make sure their children learn than from “parental anxiety” in a society in which being rich is the best way to stay rich, and if you fall, there’s less of a safety net. In other words, he said, “The costs of failure are higher and the rewards of success are also higher.” Still, I talked to Doug Haynes, vice provost for Academic Equity, Diversity and Inclusion at U.C. Irvine, and he emphasized that thousands of first-generation college students are getting world-class educations at California’s public universities in particular. The scandal, he said, is troubling in large part because it erodes students’ trust in those institutions. “They put their faith in the university to provide clear criteria and confidence in an admissions process that is based on their past achievements and future promise,” Mr. Haynes said. “I think that bond, that trust is so important because it helps distinguish us from other higher education systems in the world.” (We often link to sites that limit access for nonsubscribers.

2019,Why Is Israel’s Justice Minister in an Ad for ‘Fascism’ Perfume?,"JERUSALEM — In a provocative campaign ad released late Tuesday night, the right-wing justice minister of Israel, moving in slow motion and cast in black and white, appears to be modeling for a luxury perfume. “Fascism,” the perfume bottle label reads — a taunt to the minister’s critics, three weeks before Israelis vote. Israeli political ads make even their cheekiest American counterparts look staid by comparison: In the sprint to Election Day, voters’ social media feeds have been buffeted by ads showing an actual targeted killing and a less authentic flatulent hippo. Perhaps, then, it was only a matter of time before someone here turned “fascism” into the name of a perfume — spritzed on by Ayelet Shaked, the right-wing justice minister, whose combination of youthful attractiveness and zeal to curb the power of the liberal-leaning judiciary have made her the lawmaker the Israeli left most loves to hate. Indeed, such an ad would have made sense coming from the left, or from a satirical television show, much as “Saturday Night Live” once spoofed Ivanka Trump with a faux ad for a scent called “Complicit.” What was unexpected was that Ms. Shaked herself, and her New Right party, would be responsible for the mockery. In the ad, a camera lingers on Ms. Shaked, 42, as a narrator rattles off the many fronts in her long-running siege on the judicial system. “Judiciary revolution,” the narrator announces in Hebrew. “Reducing activism. Appointment of judges. Governance. Separation of authorities. Restraining of the Supreme Court.” “Fascism,” the ad proclaims in English, showing a perfume bottle with that as its label. Finally, Ms. Shaked breaks the fourth wall. “Smells like democracy to me,” she says, a rebuttal to her critics that gives away the gag. Israeli commentators were taken aback by the ad, some finding the joke too on-the-nose or the subject too serious to make light of. Others observed that to a non-Hebrew-speaking international audience, the ad’s humor was utterly imperceptible, so that it seemed as though Ms. Shaked were indeed happy to bathe herself in eau d’autocrat. With time running out before the elections set for April 9, however, some analysts saw another motive behind the ad. Anshel Pfeffer, a columnist for the newspaper Haaretz, suggested on Twitter that Ms. Shaked had deliberately sought to generate attention for her New Right party at a time when it was “plummeting in the polls,” by using “gaslighting humor to troll the leftists and try and re-establish some street cred.” “By the reactions,” he added, “it’s working.”",The New York Times
2019,Why Is Russia Helping Venezuela?,"MOSCOW — On a rainy afternoon this week, a group of Russian officials and oil executives gathered for Mass in a Catholic church tucked away behind the imposing secret service headquarters in central Moscow. They did not come to pray. Instead, they were commemorating the late Venezuelan leader Hugo Chávez, who poured billions of dollars into Russian weapons and machinery, and showing support for his embattled successor, Nicolás Maduro. Mr. Maduro is fighting to save the political system he and Mr. Chávez have built, with Russian support, for two decades. Mr. Maduro’s catastrophic economic mismanagement has led the opposition to claim the country’s leadership with the support of the United States, the European Union and most South American nations. To Russia, it was the latest attempt by the West to topple an adversarial government and check President Vladimir V. Putin’s global outreach. The Kremlin reacted by closing ranks around Mr. Maduro and offering him unequivocal diplomatic support, which was on display at St. Louis of France Church on Wednesday. Russia’s top Latin America diplomat, Alexander Shchetinin, and Igor Sechin, the powerful chief of Russia’s biggest state-owned oil company, Rosneft, were among those who laid flowers on Mr. Chávez’s memorial. But behind the official show of unity, Russia’s economic and political elites are becoming increasingly divided on how best to preserve their interests. As Mr. Maduro and the opposition leader, Juan Guaidó, settle into a war of attrition, the Kremlin faces a stark choice: to double down on its ally or to be among those who choose his successor. The path Mr. Putin takes will help determine whether Venezuela peacefully changes government, slides into civil war or consolidates as a repressive pariah under Mr. Maduro. “Russia’s global image and weight is at stake in Venezuela,” said Vladimir Rouvinski, political scientist at the Icesi University in Cali, Colombia. “The initial shock and fear in Russia that they would lose everything in Venezuela is being replaced by the possibility that they can become part of a negotiated transition and ensure their interests are respected.” These interests range from Venezuelan oil projects and military contracts held by Russian state firms to the geopolitical value of having an anti-American ally in the Western Hemisphere. In recent years, Rosneft has emerged as Venezuela’s biggest oil partner and lender of last resort, taking stakes in five crude-producing projects and lending Mr. Maduro’s government around $7 billion in return for oil. Venezuela still owes Rosneft about $2.3 billion, according to a company presentation in February. Venezuela also owes $3.1 billion to the Russian Finance Ministry for weapons, trucks and grain purchased on credit. Finally, Moscow’s state arms exporter has lucrative contracts to maintain Venezuela’s Russian-made tanks, fighter jets and air defense systems. “These are significant sums, but it’s not something that would sink the Russian economy,” said Alexander Gabuev, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Moscow Center. “It’s about Putin’s ability to project Russia as a global power.” Close ties with Venezuela have allowed Mr. Putin to challenge America in its backyard. Both Mr. Chávez and Mr. Maduro have traveled to Russia, visiting machine gun factories and state farms. Mr. Chávez was one of the few leaders to recognize the Russian-backed separatist republics of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, while Mr. Maduro supported the Russian military campaign in Syria. Russia responded with symbolic gestures like flying a Russian chamber choir to Mr. Chávez’s hometown and inaugurating a Hugo Chávez street in Moscow. These economic and personal ties have made Russia arguably the only ally besides Cuba that can exert influence on Mr. Maduro, said Mr. Rouvinski, the political scientist. They have also raised the costs of Mr. Maduro’s downfall to the Kremlin. To try to loosen these ties, Venezuela’s opposition has repeatedly said that Russia’s investments would be respected by a new government. The country will need capital to recover from its dire economic crisis, they said, and Russian companies would be welcome in the reconstruction. By sticking with Mr. Maduro, Russia increases the opposition’s dependence on America, which could lobby a new government to cancel Rosneft’s contracts and send Russian weapons to the scrapyard, the opposition lawmaker Angel Alvarado said. “The longer they wait, the more they risk losing everything,” he said. “Their investments are safe here, but they need to come to the negotiating table before it is too late.” The Trump administration has repeatedly said that all options are on the table to force Mr. Maduro’s exit, including military intervention, a specter that has split Russian policymakers. On one side are pragmatic technocrats and career diplomats who believe Mr. Maduro’s disastrous economic performance makes his government unsustainable. Russian diplomats have reopened channels with Venezuela’s opposition after a brief halt following Mr. Guaidó’s proclamation, according to opposition leaders and people close to the Russian Foreign Ministry. In public statements, Russian Foreign Ministry officials have gone in the past few weeks from unequivocally supporting Mr. Maduro to offering to mediate negotiations with the opposition or hold talks on Venezuela with the United States. Venezuela has largely disappeared from the saber-rattling talk shows of Russian state television. This contrasts with the hard-line position taken by Russia’s defense and security establishment, which includes Rosneft’s Mr. Sechin, a former KGB officer. They see Venezuela’s political crisis as part of a global campaign of American subversion against Russia, and believe backing Mr. Maduro is a matter of principle and self-defense. America’s “goal is liquidation of governments of inconvenient countries, the undermining of sovereignty,” Russia’s chief military strategist, Gen. Valery V. Gerasimov, said at a conference in Moscow last week. “Such actions are currently observed in Venezuela.” Rosneft has emerged as Mr. Maduro’s economic lifeline since the United States slapped crippling sanctions on Venezuela’s oil industry in late January. The company said it will lift its production in the country this year and has begun to take up some of the Venezuelan oil exports that used to go to America. Rosneft’s delivery of gasoline and oil diluent to Venezuela has helped the state-owned Petroleos de Venezuela, known as Pdvsa, avoid collapse. It has also been good business for Mr. Sechin. Left without alternative buyers, Pdvsa is forced to sell to Rosneft at a steep discount, according to a Rosneft official and oil trader with knowledge of the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity. “Sechin has positioned himself to Putin as Venezuela’s curator, the person who will keep the Russian flag flying there,” said Mr. Gabuev of Carnegie Center. “He has too much wagered on Maduro.” Beyond Rosneft’s opportunistic oil buying, the Kremlin’s effective support of Mr. Maduro is checked by Russia’s economic realities. Real income in Russia has stagnated since Mr. Putin annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, sapping domestic support for foreign interventions like Mr. Putin’s campaign to prop up Syria’s Bashar al-Assad. “How much milk can we provide to our kids if we don’t build another missile for Syria?” asked Maria Potapova, a manager at the Blagoveshchensk Dairy Plant in Russia’s Far East. “They have all the money for Crimea and Syria. Why not spare some for us?” The threat of American sanctions has scared away most Russian corporations still doing business in Venezuela. Russia’s second-largest oil producer, Lukoil, said last month it had stopped trading Venezuelan oil; the state-run Gazprombank, once one of Pdvsa’s main bankers, has stopped opening new accounts for Venezuelan clients. Even small-time orchid importers have left the country. A $1.5 billion Kalashnikov machine gun plant built by the state-run RosTec in Maracay, meant to symbolize Russia and Venezuela’s military cooperation, remains an empty shell 12 years after the start of construction. Conditions in Venezuela are terrible and the government has to change, said a person involved in the RosTec project, who spoke on condition of anonymity. What Russia wants, he added, is to have a say in who comes next.",The New York Times
2019,Why Is Silicon Valley So Obsessed With the Virtue of Suffering?,"Noted The Stoics and friends continue to be the dominant thought leaders from Google to Apple — and a new entrepreneur lobbying firm has even named itself Cicero. The wealthy of Silicon Valley ought to be living their very best lives right now. John Doerr, an early Amazon and Google investor, calls their moment “the greatest legal accumulation of wealth in history.” And yet, the people of Silicon Valley seem determined to make themselves miserable. They sit in painful, silent meditations for weeks on end. They starve for days — on purpose. Cold morning showers are a bragging right. Notoriety is a badge of honor. So the most helpful clues to understanding Silicon Valley today may come from its favorite ancient philosophy: Stoicism. An ancient Greek school of thought, Stoicism argued that the only real treasures in life were inner virtues, like self-mastery and courage. The Stoics offered tactics to endure pain and pleasure without complaint. These virtues are paraded on the website of a new entrepreneurship-focused lobbying firm, the Cicero Institute. The organization started quietly last year, and is intended to advocate for start-up interests. Its landing page is adorned with a quote from Cicero, a Roman philosopher-statesman who embraced much of Stoicism’s ethical systems while remaining skeptical of its metaphysics: “I have always been of the opinion that unpopularity earned by doing what is right is not unpopularity at all but glory.” As stocks rise despite crises, as a new wave of wealth rises in the American West, and promotions and payouts come despite scandals, the old mantra that every start-up is going to save the world now rings hollow. But tenets of Stoicism — which can be interpreted to argue that the world and its current power structure are correctly set as they are — fit right in. Stoicism has been the preferred viral philosophy “for a moment” for years now — or two decades, by one count. The topic of Stoicism usually comes up in the Valley in terms of the maintenance of the personal life. Start-ups big and small believe their mission is to make the transactions of life frictionless and pleasing. But the executives building those things are convinced that a pleasing, on-demand life will make them soft. So they attempt to bring the pain. “We’re kept in constant comfort,” said Kevin Rose, the founder of Digg, in an interview on Daily Stoic, a popular blog for the tech-Stoic community. Mr. Rose said he tries to incorporate practices in his life that “mimic” our ancestors’ environments and their daily challenges: “This can be simple things like walking in the rain without a jacket or wearing my sandals in the December snow when I take the dog out in the mornings.” Tim Ferriss, the region’s popular life hacker, wrote on his blog that Stoicism is “an ideal ‘operating system’ for thriving in high-stress environments.” Elizabeth Holmes, the founder of the disastrous health diagnostics start-up Theranos and star of a new HBO documentary about its collapse, would often cite “Meditations,” by Marcus Aurelius. Rank-and-file tech workers frequently have more than one Stoic text on their bookshelves. Y Combinator, the start-up incubator, includes “A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy,” by William B. Irvine, on its list of books for entrepreneurs to read. Ryan Holiday’s life-hacking books on Stoicism are especially popular, and seed the philosophy afresh to newcomers. (Mr. Holiday is one of the authors of “The Daily Stoic,” a daily meditation book for the barefoot-running and bowhunting crowd.) Then there are the founders who may not call themselves Stoics, but who are practicing some of its tenets. They include Jack Dorsey, the C.E.O. of Twitter, who likes to walk five miles to work each day and meditates in silence 10 days each year. He recently discussed “D.I.Y. cold tubs” and “one meal a day” in a podcast taping with Ben Greenfield, who evangelizes about health. Ada Palmer is a professor of early modern history at the University of Chicago and a novelist. Her books are popular in Silicon Valley, and she often visits for dinners with tech workers. “It’s very interesting to see their sort of sad lethargy,” Dr. Palmer said. “When you’re 37, rich, retired and unhappy, it’s very perplexing.” To her, it makes sense that they then turn to Stoicism. She called Stoicism “a wonderful therapy against grief and the blinders of the rat race.” “So much of Stoicism is about achieving interior tranquillity,” she said. That works for business leaders. Other schools of thought during Stoicism’s ancient rise had warned that politics and the pursuit of wealth would lead only to stress and risk, Dr. Palmer said, and some encouraged retiring from active life and even renouncing property. But Stoicism did not. Instead, Stoics believed that everything in the universe is already perfect and that things that seem bad or unjust are secretly good underneath. The philosophy is handy if you already believe that the rich are meant to be rich and the poor meant to be poor. “The new popularity of Stoicism among the tech crowd is, in my view, strikingly similar to Stoicism’s popularity among the powerful elites of ancient Rome,” Dr. Palmer said. “As Rome took over, it surged in popularity because it was the one system of ethics that worked well for the rich and powerful.” The Cicero Institute comes at a time of tension in Silicon Valley, from a person with a complicated history there. Joe Lonsdale, who founded the institute along with his wife, Taylor, is also a founder of Palantir, the data analytics firm long mired in controversy for its work supporting surveillance and predictive policing. In 2015 The New York Times Magazine reported on his relationship with an undergraduate mentee, who accused him of sexual abuse. He denied the charges. (The student sued him, he countersued, the suits were withdrawn; Stanford banned him from campus but then reversed that decision.) Mr. Lonsdale became friends with Peter Thiel at Stanford and, like Mr. Thiel, has spoken out against “social justice warriors.” Public anger about big tech is growing, and political leaders are beginning to take note. The Cicero Institute promises to fight for the business opportunities of entrepreneurs by focusing on deregulation, with special attention paid to making it easier to build start-ups around prisons, health care and education. Mr. Lonsdale proposes that “private prison contracts tie financial incentives to performance measures,” for instance. Cicero, for his part, retired, but then re-entered the ancient political arena when he saw rising corruption. He was ultimately killed for it. Of the institute’s mascot, Dr. Palmer said: “They’ve chosen the one who comes out of inaction when there’s a crisis to try to prevent a coup.”",The New York Times
2019,"Why Is There Flooding in Nebraska, South Dakota, Iowa and Wisconsin?","When a warm rain fell on a flat, frozen landscape, “the ingredients were in place.” A historic snowy winter is turning into record spring flooding across a wide area in the middle of the United States, as major rivers spill over their banks, break levees and inundate towns and farms. The governors of Nebraska, South Dakota, and Wisconsin have declared emergencies, and Iowa’s governor has issued a disaster proclamation. At least two people in Nebraska have died in the floodwaters, and two others are missing. Hundreds of families have fled their homes, especially in the Mississippi and Missouri flood plains, where levees were breached in many areas. Offutt Air Force Base, outside Omaha, said that one-third of the base was underwater on Sunday. Even the National Weather Service said it had to evacuate its offices in Omaha on Friday because of rising water. [Read more on how the record floods have left a devastating toll on farmers and ranchers.] Rain was the immediate cause. The Weather Service’s Omaha office recorded 1.37 inches last week; more fell to the north and west, with Norfolk, Neb., getting 2.27 inches Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. That isn’t all that much by itself, though it is more than the area usually gets at this time of year: Omaha, which averages less than an inch of rain in all of March, already has had 2.15 inches this month. The devastating effect came mainly from what the rain fell upon: a snow-covered region that was unable to absorb much of the blow. “A lot of it stems from the fall flooding in September and October,” said Mindy Beerends, a senior meteorologist at the Des Moines office of the National Weather Service. “The soil was saturated in the fall.” That moisture stayed in the ground all winter, deep-frozen, while snow piled up on top of it, she said — and then, “on Wednesday and Thursday, warm air moved in, and we got rain, and the snow melted.” “The higher-than-average precipitation, combined with warm temperatures, snowmelt and the frozen ground, was a perfect storm for flooding,” Ms. Beerends added. “The ingredients were in place.” The flat, frozen land, unable to soak in much of the water, spread it fast and furious, the way liquid would spread across a tiled floor. And the runoff quickly filled many rivers and streams to overflowing. “The ground was like concrete,” said Kevin Low, a hydrologist at the service’s Missouri Basin River Forecast Center. “In January, temperatures took a nose dive and we’ve had deeply frozen ground all the way south into Missouri.” Forecasters knew that the snowy winter was building up the potential for spring flooding. In February, the Army Corps of Engineers lowered the reservoirs along the Missouri River to try to make room for excess runoff. The snowpack began to melt the weekend of March 9 and 10, leading to widespread snowmelt of two to three inches in many places and four inches in isolated spots, according to the National Weather Service. Some places had the equivalent of six inches of water in 24 hours, Mr. Low said. “This would not have been historic if we had not had the two inches of rain on top of that,” he said. “We would have had some minor-to-moderate flooding. Instead, we have 30 locations that hit records in central and eastern Nebraska, and northwest Iowa, including two locations on the Missouri River itself.” Under models of climate change, a warmer atmosphere can hold more water, and thus the likelihood of intense inundation increases. Mapping the severity of the region’s flooding, which has killed three people. River levels have peaked in many areas and have started to recede, but parts of Nebraska, Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin and South Dakota still face “historic to catastrophic flooding,” the National Weather Service said on Monday. Warm weather will continue to melt snow this week across the vast area drained by the Mississippi and Missouri rivers, from the northern Great Basin to the Northern Rockies, and water levels downstream in Missouri are expected to keep rising for several more days. A headline with an earlier version of this article misidentified one of the states affected by severe flooding. As the article correctly noted, they are Nebraska, Wisconsin, South Dakota and Iowa. Ohio is not among them.",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | Why Jacinda Ardern Matters,"New Zealand’s prime minister is emerging as the progressive antithesis to right-wing strongmen like Trump, Orban and Modi, whose careers thrive on illiberal, anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant rhetoric. Mr. Aaron is a journalist. AUCKLAND, New Zealand — Jacinda Ardern, the prime minister of New Zealand, has been exemplary in her response to the massacre in Christchurch, where 50 Muslims were killed in two mosques by an Australian white supremacist and his accomplices. Ms. Arden provided a frame for national grief by embracing the Muslim immigrant community and by firmly insisting, in a tweet after the attack, “Many of those affected will be members of our migrant communities — New Zealand is their home — they are us.” She set the tone for the country’s response, framed the incident as a terrorist attack and insisted that her country will reject violent extremism. Ms. Ardern, 38, took over as prime minister in October 2017, after generating a measure of “Jacindamania” and leading her New Zealand Labour Party to victory. Her stature as a serious progressive politician has not been affected by her celebrity status; Ms. Ardern leads in polls even as some of her policies receive mixed reviews. Christchurch marks a turning point for Ms. Ardern and for New Zealand. She has set high benchmarks for messaging and leadership during this crisis. She is expected to unveil specific proposals to reform the country’s gun laws before Monday. Ms Ardern, wearing a black scarf, comforted families of the victims — a remarkable gesture given the reactions Muslim women’s headgear provokes in many Western countries. New Zealanders have followed their leader’s example. Citizens are declaring that the attacker does not speak for them, donations are pouring in for families, condolence books are being signed, flowers placed in front of mosques. On Sunday, church congregations sang New Zealand’s soaring national anthem that speaks about “men of every creed and race” gathering before God’s face in a “free land.” Through the aftermath, Ms. Ardern has consciously sought to reinforce state ideology and elevate it above private prejudice. She recognizes politics as the domain that decides a nation’s values and is providing strong narrative direction for a society suddenly dealing with exposed fault lines. She is reminding Kiwis to come to terms with the altered composition of her nation and, in fact, told Donald Trump that the best way he could support New Zealand was by offering “sympathy and love for all Muslim communities.” On Tuesday, while speaking in the Parliament, she told the grieving families, “We cannot know your grief, but we can walk with you at every stage.” And in a pathbreaking gesture, Ms. Ardern said she will never mention the name of the terrorist, thus withholding the notoriety he sought. She implored others to “speak the names of those who were lost, rather than name of the man who took them.” Ms. Ardern is emerging as the definitive progressive antithesis to the crowded field of right-wing strongmen like President Trump, Viktor Orban of Hungary and Narendra Modi of India, whose careers thrive on illiberal, anti-Muslim rhetoric. Like its exceptional prime minister, New Zealand has a national culture unlike any other in Europe or the Americas. Its isolation and distance makes its distinctiveness possible, and the difference is palpable. It is a spectacularly beautiful country with a population of five million occupying an area larger than Britain. Though an urbanized country with a stable developed economy, it has a pace and an outlook of life that seem at odds with the extractive demands of modernity. Migrants from developing countries relate easily to friendly Kiwis and are often surprised to see children and adults walk the streets barefoot. There are superb public libraries and innumerable public spaces in the form of beaches, bays and parks. Community ties are crucial, work-life balance matters, long weekends are sacred. Public-funded advice bureaus help migrants settle in. The streets are safe, schools are free and university costs are relatively modest. Kiwis complain about lack of public investment in specialized health care but it is already impressive for a foreigner: a full course of prescribed antibiotics costs $3.43. New Zealand grapples with neoliberal pressures but is attempting to hold on to its social democracy. Of course, the country has its problems. Lack of housing is a serious concern, attributed to a property market spiked reportedly by Chinese investors over the years. Maori communities seek compensation for historical dispossession, which is being addressed by a tribunal and conscious promotion of indigenous culture. Mental health comes up as an underdiscussed issue and public infrastructure needs more investment. Cities like Auckland grew rapidly in the last decade owing to thousands of foreign students and workers, which increased pressure on services in ways that Kiwis did not expect. Many New Zealanders are still getting used to diversity and often regret that “the country has changed.” This yields resentment among some that right-wing figures seek to stoke. Muslims have been subject to racial slurs and hate speech since the Sept. 11 attacks in the United States, but as Mohamed Hassan, a Kiwi journalist put it, not in ways that one’s “life would be on the line.” But there is a vibrant political debate on immigration and about the need to import skilled labor without provoking domestic tensions — all conducted without rancor or vitriol. Migrants will not deny sensing subtle forms of exclusion in securing jobs or promotions at work, but the ingrained commitment to everyday civility among New Zealanders is something an immigrant appreciates the most. Ms. Ardern has a tough road ahead to ensure that the country’s “profile” does not change. The challenges she faces resonate with those in other democracies. It remains to be seen if in her case normative habits and deliberative practice can prevail over nasty right-wing subcultures that are amplified by technology, social media and weapons. Combating bigotry and prejudice entails both law enforcement and cultural change. The former is easier, the latter less so. Ms. Ardern will need to use her country’s civility to confront social divisions rather than allow it to foster silences that block a fuller expression of equality for marginal groups. Her government will need to craft newer meanings of national belonging to translate the tolerated and unwanted into the desirable. Democratic discourses must ultimately aim to bridge ethnic silos and parallel cultural lives. It is a challenge fraught with risk for a liberal politician, as a perceived overreach in social engineering can provoke a conservative backlash. It is not easy dealing with both a grieving community and a nation whose self-image has been dented. Right now her moral clarity is inspiring the world.

2019,Why Lifting Weights Can Be So Potent for Aging Well,"Phys Ed People who discovered that they enjoyed and felt capable of completing a weight-training session subsequently joined a new gym and showed up for workouts. Weight training by older people may build not only strength and muscle mass but also motivation and confidence, potentially spurring them to continue exercising, according to an interesting new study of the emotional impacts of lifting weights. The findings intimate that people worried that they might be too old or inept to start resistance training should perhaps try it, to see how their bodies and minds respond. We already have plenty of evidence, of course, that weight training can help us to age well. By our early 40s, most of us are losing muscle mass, at a rate of about 5 percent a decade, with the decline often precipitating a long slide toward frailty and dependence. But older people who lift weights can slow or reverse that descent, studies show. In multiple experiments, older people who start to lift weights typically gain muscle mass and strength, as well as better mobility, mental sharpness and metabolic health. But lifting helps only those who try it, and statistics indicate that barely 17 percent of older Americans regularly lift weights. So, as part of a larger study of weight training and the elderly, scientists at the University of Jyvaskyla in Finland recently decided to see if they could discover how weight training changes the minds as well as the musculature of people who had not done it before. To start, they turned to 81 older men and women who were part of their health database and who had agreed to begin resistance training. These volunteers were all between the ages of 65 and 75 and, like many Finns, healthy and physically active. But they did not lift weights. For the full study, they began a twice-weekly program of supervised, full-body resistance training at the university to familiarize participants with proper technique and build a base of strength. After three months, the group was randomly assigned to continue training once, twice or three times a week, while a separate, untrained group served as controls. Periodically, the researchers checked the volunteers’ strength, fitness and metabolic health, and also their attitudes about the workouts, including whether they found them daunting or inviting and how difficult it was for the volunteers to find the time and resolve to show up. This routine lasted for six months, by which time the people lifting weights had almost all gained strength and improved various markers of their health, even if they had lifted only once a week. But then, after the months of supervised lifting, the exercisers abruptly were on their own. The researchers explained that they could no longer have access to the university facilities and provided them with information about low-cost, suitable gyms in the area. But any subsequent training would be at their own volition. The researchers waited six months and then contacted the volunteers to see who was still lifting and how often. They repeated those interviews after an additional six months. They found, to their surprise, that a year after the formal study had ended, almost half of the volunteers still were lifting weights at least once a week. “We had estimated a rate of 30 percent,” says Tiia Kekalainen, a project researcher at the University of Jyvaskyla who led the psychological study with the senior author, Simon Walker, and others. Also surprising, the researchers discovered little direct correlation between muscle and motivation. The people who had gained the most strength or muscle mass during the study were not necessarily those most likely to stick to the training. Instead, it was those who had come to feel most competent in the gym. If someone’s self-efficacy, which is a measure of confidence, had risen substantially during the study, he or she usually kept lifting. In effect, Ms. Kekalainen says, people who discovered that they enjoyed and felt capable of completing a weight-training session subsequently sought out and joined a new gym and showed up for workouts, despite no longer receiving nudges from the researchers or encouragement and companionship from their fellow volunteers. “They found out that resistance training is their cup of tea,” Ms. Kekalainen says. Most of them also told the researchers that weight training had provided them with renewed confidence in their physical abilities beyond the gym. “They could do things that they thought they could not do before,” she says. Of course, about half of the volunteers had told her and the other researchers that “they preferred other types of exercise,” Ms. Kekalainen says, and those men and women, for the most part, no longer lifted weights. Ms. Kekalainen and her colleagues hope in future studies to explore the issues of what drew some people to the lifting and left others uninspired, and how weight-training routines might be structured to appeal to the skeptical. For now, people interested in starting to lift weights should look for classes or trainers specializing in beginners and learn to lift safely. But the overarching lesson of the study, she says, is that to discover how you feel about weight training, you need to weight train. You don’t have to lift like a bodybuilder (or look like one) to benefit from resistance training. And the best part is that it’s never too late to get started. We’ll show you how.",The New York Times
2019,Why Logic Wrote a Novel,"Footnotes The rapper, whose real name is Bobby Hall, has branched out with a debut novel, “Supermarket.” CreditCreditRozette Rago for The New York Times Bobby Hall, better known as the Grammy-nominated rapper Logic, started writing his debut novel, “Supermarket,” four years ago. He had released “The Incredible True Story,” a dystopian concept album in which two men search for a planet named Paradise in the wake of Earth’s destruction, and finished the script for a film, “Everything Must Go,” now in development with J.J. Abrams’s production company, Bad Robot. He was looking for a new project. “I didn’t want to necessarily just be stuck in music,” he said. “Supermarket,” just published by Simon & Schuster, is a psychological thriller that centers on Flynn, an aspiring writer who has been dumped by his girlfriend. Depressed and desperate for change, he takes a job at a supermarket, hoping to find inspiration through daily minutiae. But nothing is what it seems, and the novel quickly takes twists and turns while tackling issues including depression and anxiety. It’s not the first time he has addressed mental health in his work: His song “1-800-273-8255,” titled after the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, has gone platinum five times. Hall, 29, recorded an accompanying soundtrack timed to the novel’s release this week. He does not consider himself a big reader, he said, but credits Indiana Jones novels and H.G. Wells’s “The Time Machine” as inspirations for the kind of story he wanted to tell. “Bobby is the quintessential multi-hyphenate. He’s a natural storyteller,” Stuart Roberts, Hall’s editor at Simon & Schuster, wrote in an email. “I was instantly taken by the book’s voice and inventiveness.” I talked to Hall about his debut as a writer, mental health, the importance of music to him and what he hopes his fans will take away from this project. “Supermarket” deals with a number of mental health issues — from anxiety and depression to schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. What research did you do before writing the book? The research I did was all personal. I had an anxiety attack and almost passed out when I was in line to see “Star Wars” in December 2015. I was in the most depressed, anxiety ridden place of my life. My mother was bipolar. She took heavy medication to deal with it, and I grew up with friends who were schizophrenic, so I experienced that firsthand. Did you face any challenges while writing the book? How did the process differ, if at all, from writing music? One of the biggest challenges was writing something that stemmed from real life. Nobody wants to talk about anxiety and depression and being scared and feeling crippled at times. It’s not a fun thing to discuss. I have written scripts for my albums before, I have done concept albums, so I guess it is something that has been building up. What do you hope readers to take away from it? I guess the biggest thing is as long as you deal with your problems head-on and face your demons, whatever they may be — mental, physical, emotional — if you truly deal with it, it gets better. And that you can do anything you want. I am a dude with no formal education. I didn’t even graduate from high school. But you can’t let that tear you down. Your characters listen to a lot of contemporary music and artists, like Toro y Moi and Rex Orange County. Can you talk about the relationship between music and the novel? I thought it would be really cool if when readers see that artist’s name and the song on that page, maybe they will play that song while they read. We tend to associate our emotions and experiences with what we are listening to or watching. I just thought it would be cool to add these artists who have given me great memories and pass that on to readers. Are there any other songs or albums or artists you were listening to while writing the book? Oh, definitely — I actually created a playlist on Spotify. Did you always know that you were going to record the soundtrack? It definitely came from writing the book. I was at my old house and making these songs about love. I was feeling kind of lonely, and I realized that is also how Flynn felt. When I was writing these songs for a woman that didn’t even exist at the time, it kind of hit me like, I want to do more than just rap. I love hip-hop, I love rap, it’s in my blood. And it is scary as a musician to have a world of people who know who you are, and that when you do something different, different is not good. Nobody likes different. These were songs that almost would have never come out because I would have been too scared. But I think that fear is a good thing. Let’s talk about the album. How does it relate to the book? It’s not like my other albums — that is why I am so proud of it. It’s all indie music, and if you listen to this playlist you can hear some elements of that in the soundtrack as well. It’s really based on love, and I’ve never done that. I did a couple of love songs in raps when I was 20 and didn’t know a thing and I’ve gone through some ups and downs; I have gone through some very hard times; and beautiful, amazing times. So I decided to write about those, and kind of put myself in Flynn’s position and almost sing as though I were him and be inspired by my own life.",The New York Times
2019,Why Lupita Nyong’o’s ‘Us’ Voice Sounds So Creepy,"There are no shortage of haunting images in “Us,” the new horror film from Jordan Peele. But many of the movie’s most effective jolts are heard rather than seen, from the chilling score (including a macabre riff on Luniz’s “I Got 5 on It”) on down. No sound in the film is more likely to induce nightmares than the voice of its main villain, Red. Played by Lupita Nyong’o in a dual performance (she is also Adelaide, Red’s non-villainous doppelgänger), Red becomes the movie’s most unsettling enigma the moment she first opens her mouth. (Warning: If you haven’t seen “Us,” moderate spoilers about the character follow). In a showstopping monologue at the top of the second act, Red’s speaking voice — a dyspeptic rasp, as if her vocal cords have been gnawed through by rats — suggests someone who has seen the unspeakable, and takes an already eerie performance by Nyong’o to a darker, unearthly realm. [Read the review of “Us,” and watch how Jordan Peele builds suspense in the film.] The sound has provoked strong reactions in audiences and critics. In his review, New York magazine’s David Edelstein described it as “the whistle of someone whose throat has been cut” and “a rush of acrid air from a tomb.” Here’s where the voice actually came from, according to our interviews with both Nyong’o and Peele. Even in his script, Peele kept details about who Red was close to the vest. One of the few clues he did include pertained to the voice. He described it simply as “scratchy” and hinted at a mysterious back story. “I described it as a voice that hadn’t been used in years,” Peele said. Those scarce details gave Nyong’o — who worked closely with Peele in developing the character — plenty of latitude. At a fashion event before preproduction, she found unlikely inspiration when she heard a speaker who reminded her of Peele’s description. It was Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who had spasmodic dysphonia, a neurological disorder that causes involuntary spasms of the larynx. Learning about the disorder helped ground her eventual performance. “I was fascinated, and I started doing research,” Nyong’o said. “I met with people who have the condition and built it from there.” Does Red have spasmodic dysphonia, or just sound like she does? We may never know. But Nyong’o’s research convinced her that the disorder was a plausible consequence of the grim back story Peele’s script had implied. “It’s not really understood why it happens, or how it happens,” she said. “It could be a trauma in your life — someone dying, or a physical assault. It varies. For me, it felt very organic as an inspiration for Red, who’s had this kind of strangled past.” [Read about Lupita Nyong’o and her work on the movie.] Working with the vocal coach Beth McGuire, who also worked with Nyong’o on “Black Panther” and the 2016 Broadway play “Eclipsed,” the actress took her real-world inspiration and suffused it with ghostly malevolence. “Red’s character is very id-driven, so one of the things that we were looking for was for that to come across in the quality of her voice — just the raw emotion, the raw rage,” Nyong’o said. Peele first heard what Nyong’o had come up with during preproduction, when the actress pulled him aside for an informal audition of the voice and her vision for the big monologue. “She sat me down and said ‘Are you ready?’” the director recalled. He wasn’t. “It was like nothing I had ever heard,” Peele said. “So creepy.”",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | Why Mortality Makes Us Free,"THE STONE The heart of spiritual life can not be found in nirvana or heaven, but in the mutual recognition that this life is our ultimate purpose. Mr. Hagglund is a professor of comparative literature and humanities. Of all the world religions, Buddhism enjoys the greatest respect and popularity among those who seek a model for “spiritual life” beyond traditional religion. Even the prominent atheist Sam Harris turns to the meditational exercises of Buddhism in his best-selling book “Waking Up: A Guide to Spirituality Without Religion.” This is understandable, since Buddhist meditation practices can be employed to great effect for secular ends. In particular, there has been success in adapting various forms of meditation techniques for cognitive therapy as well as for practical forms of compassion training. If you learn Buddhist meditation techniques for such therapeutic purposes — or simply for the sake of having more strength and energy — then you are adapting the techniques for a secular project. You engage in meditational practices as a means for the end of deepening your ability to care for others and improving the quality of your life. The aim of salvation in Buddhism, however, is to be released from finite life itself. Such an idea of salvation recurs across the world religions, but in many strands of Buddhism there is a remarkable honesty regarding the implications of salvation. Rather than promising that your life will continue, or that you will see your loved ones again, the salvation of nirvana entails your extinction. The aim is not to lead a free life, with the pain and suffering that such a life entails, but to reach the “insight” that personal agency is an illusion and dissolve in the timelessness of nirvana. What ultimately matters is to attain a state of consciousness where everything ceases to matter, so that one can rest in peace. The Buddhist conclusion may seem extreme when stated in this way, but in fact it makes explicit what is implicit in all ideas of eternal salvation. Far from making our lives meaningful, eternity would make them meaningless, since our actions would have no purpose. This problem can be traced even within religious traditions that espouse faith in eternal life. An article in U.S. Catholic asks: “Heaven: Will it be Boring?” The article answers no, for in heaven souls are called “not to eternal rest but to eternal activity — eternal social concern.” Yet this answer only underlines the problem, since there is nothing to be concerned about in heaven. Concern presupposes that something can go wrong or can be lost; otherwise we would not care. An eternal activity — just as much as an eternal rest — is of concern to no one, since it cannot be stopped and does not have to be maintained by anyone. The problem is not that an eternal activity would be “boring” but that it would not be intelligible as my activity. Any activity of mine (including a boring activity) requires that I sustain it. In an eternal activity, there cannot be a person who is bored — or involved in any other way — since an eternal activity does not depend on being sustained by anyone. An eternal salvation is therefore not only unattainable but also undesirable, since it would eliminate the care and passion that animates our lives. What we do and what we love can matter to us only because we understand ourselves as mortal. That self-understanding is implicit in all our practical commitments and priorities. The question of what we ought to do with our time — a question that is at issue in everything we do — presupposes that we understand our time to be finite. Hence, mortality is the condition of agency and freedom. To be free is not to be sovereign or liberated from all constraints. Rather, we are free because we are able to ask ourselves what we ought to do with our time. All forms of freedom — the freedom to act, to speak, to love — are intelligible as freedom only insofar as we are free to engage the question of what we should do with our time. If it were given what we should do, what we should say, and whom we should love — in short: if it were given what we should do with our time — we would not be free. The ability to ask the question of what we ought to do with our time is the basic condition for what I call spiritual freedom. To lead a free, spiritual life (rather than a life determined merely by natural instincts), I must be responsible for what I do. This is not to say that I am free from natural and social constraints. I did not choose to be born with the limitations and abilities I happen to have. Moreover, I had no control over who took care of me; what they did to me and for me. My family — and the larger historical context into which I was born — shaped me before I could do anything about it. Likewise, social norms continue to inform who I can take myself to be and what I can do with my life. Without social norms, which I did not invent and that shape the world in which I find myself, I can have no understanding of who to be or what to do. Nevertheless, I am responsible for upholding, challenging or transforming these norms. I am not merely causally determined by nature or norms but act in light of norms that I can challenge and transform. Even at the price of my biological survival, my material well-being or my social standing, I can give my life for a principle to which I hold myself or for a cause in which I believe. This is what it means to lead a spiritual life. I must always live in relation to my irrevocable death — otherwise there would be nothing at stake in dedicating my life to anything. Any form of spiritual life must therefore be animated by the anxiety of being mortal, even in the most profound fulfillment of our aspirations. Our anxiety before death is not reducible to a psychological condition that can or should be overcome. Rather, anxiety is a condition of intelligibility for leading a free life and being passionately committed. As long as our lives matter to us, we must be animated by the anxiety that our time is finite, since otherwise there would be no urgency in doing anything and being anyone. Even if your project is to lead your life without psychological anxiety before death — for example by devoting yourself to Buddhist meditation — that project is intelligible only because you are anxious not to waste your life on being anxious before death. Only in light of the apprehension that we will die — that our lifetime is indefinite but finite — can we ask ourselves what we ought to do with our lives and put ourselves at stake in our activities. This is why all religious visions of eternity ultimately are visions of unfreedom. In the consummation of eternity, there would be no question of what we should do with our lives. We would be absorbed in bliss forever and thereby deprived of any possible agency. Rather than having a free relation to what we do and what we love, we would be compelled by necessity to enjoy it. In contrast, we should recognize that we must be vulnerable — we must be marked by the suffering of pain, the mourning of loss, the anxiety before death — in order to lead our lives and care about one another. We can thereby acknowledge that our life together is our ultimate purpose. What we are missing is not eternal bliss but social and institutional forms that would enable us to lead flourishing lives. This is why the critique of religion must be accompanied by a critique of the existing forms of our life together. If we merely criticized religious notions of salvation — without seeking to overcome the forms of social injustice to which religions respond — the critique would be empty and patronizing. The task is to transform our social conditions in such a way that we can let go of the promise of salvation and recognize that everything depends on what we do with our finite time together. The heart of spiritual life is not the empty tranquillity of eternal peace but the mutual recognition of our fragility and our freedom.

2019,Why N.H.L. Player Duncan Keith Calls Himself a Biohacker,"My Workout The three-time Stanley Cup champion is a fan of Joovv lights, ashwaganda herbs, PoV Sport and Lululemon. Duncan Keith, 35, is a three-time Stanley Cup champion and Conn Smythe Trophy winner, who recently played his 1,000th professional hockey game, all with the Chicago Blackhawks. A small-town guy at heart, he splits his time between Chicago and Penticton, British Columbia, where he grew up. He took a moment out of his punishing National Hockey League season (his 14th!) to share his workout and wellness secrets, and why he is obsessed with infrared therapy lights. I get up around 8 a.m. In the 45 minutes before I leave the house, I have a routine: I go upstairs to my lab, where I have a bunch of little things that I do to stay healthy. I try to get as much sunlight as possible, but I also have Joovv lights — they’re red and infrared lights, which are very healing. Then I lay on my Bemer mat, which has electromagnetic currents, for eight minutes. I also have my supplements like glutathione and vitamin C, and liquid herbs like ashwaganda. Sometimes at night, I’ll sleep with a hydrogen inhaler. I’m a biohacker and a part-time hockey player. It’s basically better living with the help of science. During the season, I don’t do a whole lot of heavy lifting. I use PoV Sport, a machine that uses electricity to keep your muscles contracted. It’s about feeling strong without me having to do any excess movement. The off-season is when I work out the hardest. I’m in the gym about five times a week doing strength training. It’s all based on the Evo Ultrafit system that my strength trainer Jay Schroeder does. He’s based out of Phoenix. He trains a lot of professional football players and baseball players. It’s a lot of body-weight stuff and isometrics and speed Russian lunges. I’ll start ice skating in July. By the end of the August, I’m skating four to five times a week. For me, the biggest thing for my skin care is the Joovv light. But then my buddy is a real skin fanatic with lots of different things. He told me about this skin care company called Eminence, and once in a while I’ll use the exfoliator in the steam shower. I don’t love the hotel skin care stuff. I bring my own. I use Ancient Minerals body lotion that has magnesium in it. I order it off Amazon. My skin gets nice and moisturized but also gets a dose of magnesium. I use the Ben Greenfield’s serum, which is a mix of vitamin C and a bunch of different herbs. And then I do use cologne. I use the Tom Ford Neroli Portofino Acqua the most. I wouldn’t say I’m on any specific diet. I’ve read Dr. Mercola’s books and I followed his nutrition plan for a while. But now, I just eat healthy and the biggest thing is getting a lot of calories in. I’m always burning calories during the season, and I’m trying to keep my mass on. I read a lot of books and I listen to podcasts. My favorite is the Ben Greenfield fitness podcast. I guess you could call him a professional biohacker. I also listen to Aubrey Marcus and Joe Rogan. Right now, I’m reading “Medical Medium” by Anthony William. It’s nonfiction and about food and nutrition. I enjoy reading and learning about the body. The first chapter is a little bit goofy, but essentially it’s about how important carbs and fruits are. It goes against a lot of things you hear today. I try to dress nice, but I’m not always thinking about it. I really like AllSaints jeans. I get most of my jeans from there. If not that, then I like Hudson jeans or Vince sweatpants. They’re like a classier pair of sweats. Lululemon is always comfortable. I’ve been on ice skates ever since I was maybe 3 or 4. I was always trying to be a hockey player. But to play professionally, you have to have the determination and focus. I remember there were high school parties that I didn’t go to because I was always working on my game. I missed a lot of those times. You have to set a goal and not let anything get in your way. This involves not only yourself, but also your family and parents. They are all part of it.",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | Why NATO Still Matters,"letter A foreign policy expert writes that a stable and secure Europe will always pay dividends. To the Editor: Re “What’s the U.S. Role in NATO?” (Op-Ed, March 11): Barry R. Posen is certainly right that in the decades since the Soviet Union fell, NATO harmed itself by adding more than a dozen new members, and engaging in out-of-area military “misadventures” in places like Libya. But his prescription — an American pullback from NATO and “returning the European allies to full responsibility for their futures” — is a bridge too far. Let’s remember that NATO was necessary not just because of the Soviet threat, but because the two most destructive wars in history began in Europe in the 20th century, with both requiring large-scale American intervention. As Lord Ismay, the first NATO secretary general, said, NATO was created to “keep the Russians out, the Americans in, and the Germans down.” Russia is now a marginal threat compared with the dark days of the Cold War, and Germany is a robust liberal democracy. But American involvement in NATO — perhaps reduced, and perhaps along with new enforced limits on NATO expansion and missions — remains as critical today as it was in the post-World War II era. After all, ensuring a stable, secure and peaceful Europe will always pay enormous dividends, on both sides of the Atlantic.

2019,Why Napalm Is a Cautionary Tale for Tech Giants Pursuing Military Contracts,"The Shift Over the past few months, a fierce debate has erupted in Silicon Valley over whether large technology companies like Amazon, Google and Microsoft should join forces with the United States military, along with agencies like Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The debate has largely been conducted along ethical lines. On one side are tech executives and many government officials, who argue that at a time when advanced technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning are poised to reshape top issues like drone warfare or border security, American tech giants have a patriotic duty to pitch in. Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s chief executive, summed up this view last year: “If big tech companies are going to turn their back on the U.S. Department of Defense, this country is going to be in trouble.” On the other side are groups of employees at those companies, including many anti-Trump progressives, who don’t want their tools to be used for drone warfare, immigrant detention and other projects they consider immoral. This side took a stand at Microsoft last month when a group of employees wrote an open letter to the company’s top executives demanding that they abandon an Army contract that would adapt HoloLens, the company’s augmented-reality headsets, for use by soldiers on the battlefield. “We did not sign up to develop weapons, and we demand a say in how our work is used,” the Microsoft employees wrote. This is a debate worth having. But there is a more pragmatic question swirling around it, one surprisingly few people are asking. Namely: Could Big Tech’s decision to pursue controversial defense and law enforcement contracts be a financial mistake? As business deals, some of these contracts seem like no-brainers. Microsoft’s HoloLens deal is worth about $500 million — less than 1 percent of the company’s 2018 revenue, but a meaningful sum nonetheless. Amazon, IBM, Microsoft and Oracle are all battling over a Defense Department cloud-computing contract, known as Project JEDI, that will be worth as much as $10 billion to the winning bidder. But these contracts may be less lucrative than they appear. And, in fact, they could come with enormous hidden costs in the form of damaged reputations, recruiting problems and customer boycotts that could swamp any short-term gains. To explain why, let’s consider one of the most notorious military contracts of the past century. In 1965, Dow Chemical, a Michigan-based chemicals manufacturer, was awarded a $5 million Department of Defense contract to produce napalm, a highly incendiary chemical used by American troops during the Vietnam War. transcript Dow was not known as a defense contractor — in fact, until its Pentagon contract, the business was best known for making industrial chemicals and household plastics like Saran Wrap. But over the next few years, as Americans began seeing gruesome images of South Vietnamese children with horrific napalm burns, the antiwar movement set its sights on the company. Activists boycotted Dow Chemical’s products, staged protests at its recruiting events on college campuses and barraged its executives with accusations of unethical war profiteering. (One demonstration outside the company’s annual shareholder meeting featured signs like “Dow Know-How in Every Drop of Napalm.”) Dow Chemical executives dug in their heels. They claimed that napalm was a small part of the company’s overall business, and that it was the company’s duty to provide necessary materials to the military. But the company’s pleas of patriotism were drowned out by the antiwar opposition. As Robert M. Neer explains in his book “Napalm,” Dow Chemical’s reputation plummeted as a result of its napalm contract. Its recruiting ability suffered, and its marketing department was forced to embark on a long and expensive campaign to win back the public’s trust. “We went from being a company that made Saran Wrap to keep food fresh to a kind of war machine,” the company’s former chief executive Andrew Liveris said in 2006. Dow Chemical stopped making napalm for the military in 1969, just four years after it had begun. But the reputational damage haunted the company for decades. (Dow Chemical merged with DuPont in 2017; the company is still a defense contractor, but it produces mainly agricultural and industrial chemicals.) All told, the $5 million napalm contract most likely cost Dow Chemical billions of dollars. And it was the kind of unforced error that could have been avoided if company executives had listened to early signs of opposition, done some risk analysis and changed course. Today’s biggest tech companies are in a similar spot. Many of them, such as Amazon and Microsoft, are among the most beloved brands in the world. They employ lots of conscientious, idealistic engineers whose skills are highly valuable, giving them considerable leverage in discussions about company values. And they are operating in an era of heightened consumer sensitivity — in which one misstep can tarnish a brand for years. Tech companies aren’t making anything as obviously harmful as napalm. In fact, supporters of these deals argue that some of the technologies being offered to the military, such as image-recognition algorithms that can help better target drone strikes, could save civilian lives. But the truth is that tech companies have absolutely no idea how the government will use their products in the future — and how the political landscape might shift, throwing them into an unwanted spotlight. In some ways, Silicon Valley tech companies face the same choice Dow Chemical faced in 1965: Accept controversial government contracts and risk a damaging backlash, or leave those deals to conventional defense contractors and protect their reputations. Already, there are signs of trouble on the horizon. At Stanford, fliers recently appeared on campus walls urging students not to work for Amazon, Microsoft, Palantir and other companies with reported contracts with ICE and law enforcement agencies. And artificial intelligence experts caution that the stigma of being seen as a war profiteer could repel idealistic recruits for years to come. “Top A.I. talent doesn’t want to work for Lockheed Martin,” said Jack Clark, the policy director of OpenAI, a nonprofit artificial intelligence lab. In fact, in today’s corporate operating environment, turning down controversial military and government contracts could be a selling point. Recently, I talked with Rana el Kaliouby, a co-founder of Affectiva, an “artificial emotional intelligence” start-up. Ms. el Kaliouby, whose software uses A.I. to track human emotions, had several early offers from government agencies, including a venture fund backed by the Central Intelligence Agency, that wanted to use the product to improve their surveillance capabilities. Even though the company needed the money at the time, it turned down the deals. Affectiva has since raised more than $50 million from other, nongovernmental sources, and has made ethical A.I. use a core part of its brand. “We wanted to be trusted,” Ms. el Kaliouby said. “We used the core value of integrity and respecting people’s privacy as a way to weed out use cases.” Take note, tech giants. Turning down controversial military and government contracts won’t doom your business. In fact, in the long run, your shareholders might thank you. OpinionMargaret O’Mara",The New York Times
2019,Why Netflix Won’t Be Part of Apple TV,"The first skirmishes have already been fought in what could turn into a tech cold war. “The game is on,” said the Netflix chief executive, Reed Hastings. Apple and Netflix, for better and for worse, have changed how we spend our leisure hours. In the process, the two companies have upended old media habits and created new ones. Apple’s iPhones have already ported over big portions of people’s brains, and Netflix exploded TV time slots, creating the binge and the endless content screen. Where else can you find a soothing Japanese reality show like “Terrace House” and a Brechtian, mind-bending drama like “Russian Doll” in one place? While setting the standard in their chosen areas, Apple and Netflix have gotten along in the past, for the most part. But that period of peace between the two tech giants is about to change. On Monday, Apple will unveil its most ambitious media project yet — a news and entertainment bundle that is likely to offer access to magazines, newspapers, music and, perhaps most intriguingly, original shows and films. And when a tech giant like Apple jumps into entertainment, it’s going to create waves. Famous for its teasing product demonstrations, Apple will play host to Hollywood at its Cupertino, Calif., campus so that it can show off what Reese Witherspoon, J.J. Abrams, M. Night Shyamalan and Steven Spielberg (he of the recent Netflix-films-should-not-get-Oscars argument) have done with the more than $1 billion the company has laid out for its new ambitions. The amount it has spent on new material is nowhere near the $10 billion Netflix will plow into content this year, but Apple has something Netflix does not: more than a billion devices all over the world, which amounts to an infrastructure. That beats out the 139 million people worldwide who have subscribed to Netflix. If Apple is suddenly able to fill the screens of those devices with its own content, as well as programming from other companies it has struck deals with, it will turn itself into a beast sure to put a scare into Netflix. The cordial relations between Apple and Netflix showed signs of fraying last November, when Netflix, led by Reed Hastings, stopped allowing people to sign up for its service through Apple’s iTunes store. Apple had been charging Netflix 15 percent on every sale, a blanket condition of being in the App Store. Now, new subscribers can still download the Netflix app on an Apple device, but they will be sent to an external website to submit payment details. (In the wonky world of internet transactions, where you make the purchase determines how, or if, Apple gets a cut.) In a second sign of frayed relations between the two companies, Netflix has decided to opt out of the Apple bundle, which will upsell subscriptions to HBO and CBS in addition to its original programming. Netflix’s absence from the new platform says a lot about the state of play in the highly competitive streaming industry: a fight is brewing over how content is distributed. Mr. Hastings explained it at a Netflix event earlier this week: “Apple’s a great company. We want to have people watch our service — or our content on our service. And so we’ve chosen not to integrate into their service, because we prefer to have our customers watch our content in our service.” The key word here is “service.” Put it another way: Netflix is a service, or a pipe, that would sit on another service, or pipe, if it agreed to be included in the Apple bundle. And if it had joined forces with Apple, Netflix also would have received little to no data about who is subscribing or watching its stuff. Further muddying the company’s identity, from the Netflix point of view, would be the fact that Apple users who spooled up “Stranger Things” or “Orange Is the New Black” may not be aware that they’re watching a Netflix show. Retaining the brand is as important as owning the data. Apple and Netflix (and others) are now in competition to become the main pipe for digital video — what television is fast becoming — and fixating on other contests, like who wins the most Emmys, is secondary to owning the pipe. The companies are battling for credit card numbers, email addresses and direct access to consumers. The focus on Apple’s programming makes for a tantalizing narrative, given how long Silicon Valley in general and Apple in particular have remained agnostic about owning content. But original Apple fare, like the program set at a morning show starring Ms. Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston, is just the appetizer. The main draw is the bundle, the one-stop service for all kinds of media. Apple’s shows are likely to be free for a period to entice users into other subscriptions, such as CBS and HBO and Starz, with Apple functioning as the reseller. But Netflix is also in the resale business. Although the company promotes its many “originals,” it doesn’t actually own a lot of the shows associated with the service. “House of Cards” and “The Crown,” to cite two examples, are licensed. Netflix’s programming strategy is something of a mystery, because there isn’t a clear through-line on the shows it buys or makes, resulting in a hard-to-define hodgepodge. But that’s by design. Netflix has long maintained that its brand isn’t about any particular aesthetic, like HBO’s. It’s a service that aims to serve up shows for all kinds of viewers, from people who like the teenage thriller “You” to those who are tempted to click on the tile for the dystopian Polish sci-fi show “1983.” The same might be said for Hulu, Amazon or Comcast, all of which fund original content while also marketing other content from channels — like HBO or CBS — within their platforms. Not coincidentally, Comcast announced its own streaming bundle just days ahead of the Apple showcase. Customers who only have Comcast’s broadband service can spend an extra $5 a month to get free streaming movies and TV shows from ad-supported services like Pluto and YouTube. They can also go through Comcast to purchase an HBO or a Netflix subscription. It’s meant to be a one-stop shop for your streaming needs, not so different from what Apple is proposing. A nuance worth noting: Netflix is willing to work with Comcast — a competing distributor — and not with Apple because Netflix sees Apple as the bigger threat. Netflix executives are worried the tech giant will crack the streaming code faster than Comcast, according to two people familiar with the company who were not authorized to talk publicly. Another way of putting it: Silicon Valley companies are wary of what their next door neighbors are capable of. Netflix has 60 million customers in the United States, making it one of the largest distributors in the country. Comcast, the nation’s largest cable company, has 25 million broadband customers. Hulu has 25 million. Amazon Prime has 97 million, but not all are watching its videos. Their reach is minuscule compared with Apple, which has more than 1.4 billion devices in use around the world, including more than 900 million iPhones. That scale explains how Apple Music, a streaming service the company started offering in 2015, garnered more than 50 million paying users so quickly. It also explains why HBO (owned by AT&T), Showtime, CBS and Starz could show up on Apple’s service Monday. The sheer volume of mobile devices in circulation is hard to ignore. Even before it starts offering original programming, Apple is arguably the biggest entertainment distributor on the planet. Still, HBO’s inclusion in the Apple bundle raises questions. Its owner, AT&T, is already a large distributor, with roughly 160 million wireless customers. The company also plans to start its own streaming service — which will include HBO programs and the properties it gained through its acquisition of Warner Bros., like “Wonder Woman” and “Friends” — by the end of the year. From HBO’s perspective, allowing itself to become part of Apple’s streaming effort is not that different from selling its wares via Comcast or DirecTV. It’s just another sales outlet. Even HBO’s own streaming service, HBO Now, had a slow start until Amazon Prime started marketing it. With the push from Amazon, the number of HBO Now subscribers nearly doubled, to five million. (HBO currently has more than seven million online customers, with those who subscribed through Amazon counting for a smaller proportion.) But that kind of indifference could cut against AT&T’s own plans to sell content directly to people. The wireless giant will have to weigh the value of the distribution muscle of Apple or Amazon or Hulu against its own needs. Why did AT&T buy Time Warner (which also included CNN, TNT and Warner Bros.) if not to jump-start its own streaming bundle? It’s worth noting that Apple is hyping its new service at a time when sales of its most lucrative product, the iPhone, have started to lag. It stopped reporting how many devices it sold as of September. Now, it wants investors to look at another line item — its foray into the media business, which is stable and steadily growing. Apple hopes it will grow even faster with the help of Hollywood. Interestingly, that line item (listed as “Services” on the Apple income statement) was once little more than a balance-sheet curiosity. Now, it’s a $40 billion business. The forthcoming bundle could add more than $12 billion to that, according to an estimate from Goldman Sachs. For comparison, the entirety of the Walt Disney Company generated $59 billion in sales last year. CBS, $14 billion. Netflix, $16 billion. Without explicitly trying, Apple has built itself into a media colossus. So what does mean for everyone else? Mr. Hastings said it best on an October earnings call when he talked about the flurry of new entrants into his area of expertise: “The game is on.”",The New York Times
2019,Why New York’s Lettered Subway Lines Are ‘Cursed’,"[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] Subway officials in New York City held a news conference recently to celebrate the system’s progress. The on-time rate for trains hit 76 percent, they boasted, signaling a “renaissance” for the floundering system. But that figure masks a surprising disparity. While the numbered lines have seen a notable boost in reliability, many of the lettered lines are still delivering poor service. The F train has a miserable on-time rate of about 50 percent — the lowest in the system. “It seems like there’s always something, from a sick passenger to signal problems,” said Paul Galloway, an F train rider who lives in Brooklyn and works at the Museum of Modern Art. “It just seems like a cursed line to me.” It is clear that the subway is improving after hitting rock bottom in the summer of 2017, when a train derailed in Harlem and the on-time rate dipped below 65 percent — the worst of any major transit system in the world. The subway’s leader, Andy Byford, has won accolades for making the system more reliable. But the diverging fates of the lines represented by letters and numbers can feel like A Tale of Two Subways — a system where some riders see signs of hope while others continue to endure constant pain. Subway leaders say there are several reasons for the gulf: schedule changes on the numbered lines that boosted the on-time rate; a computer system on the numbered lines that allows workers to more efficiently dispatch trains; the opening of the Second Avenue subway, which eased crowding on several numbered lines; and signal upgrades that improved service on another numbered line. The trend has left some riders wondering how to game the system to get where they are going on time. “The numbered lines have more stops, but they arrive more regularly and are less prone to problems,” said Benjamin Kabak, who writes the Second Ave. Sagas subway blog and lives near several lines in Brooklyn. “Do you roll the dice and take the ideally faster way, or do you take the way you know is going to work?” Monthly rate, on weekdays 90% Numbered lines and 42nd Street shuttle 80 70 Lettered lines and other shuttles 60 50 40 Jan. 2017 Jan. 2018 Jan. 2019 Source: Metropolitan Transportation Authority By The New York Times [Read more on why your subway train might start moving faster.] The seven numbered subway lines are on time about 79 percent of the time, compared to about 68 percent for the fifteen lettered lines. Trains are considered on time if they reach the final stop within five minutes of the schedule. One reason the lettered lines are lagging is that they have older equipment. Some lettered lines are slated to get modern signals, which should improve reliability. But Mr. Byford’s plan to modernize the entire subway will cost billions of dollars, and it is not clear whether state leaders will approve new funding streams for the transit system this year. Still, every line has improved as part of a broader effort to make trains run faster, said Sally Librera, the head of the subways department. Workers are increasing speed limits on parts of the system and replacing faulty signals that slowed trains. Transit officials point to other statistics that show subway service is improving, including fewer major incidents that delay 50 or more trains. “We recognize that we have more to do,” Ms. Librera said. “But we’re encouraged by the progress that we’re seeing.” The subway now has its best on-time rate in four years — a figure that Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo is highlighting as he presses state lawmakers to approve congestion pricing, a proposal to toll drivers entering the busiest part of Manhattan to raise money for the transit system. Mr. Cuomo, who controls the subway, is also pushing for reforms at the transit agency, though the State Senate issued a separate reform proposal. Critics have raised concerns over the schedule changes in late 2017 that made it easier to ensure that certain numbered trains are on time. On the No. 6 line, five trains were eliminated at Grand Central Station in Manhattan during the morning rush from 7 to 9 a.m., according to documents obtained by The New York Times. There were 68 trains scheduled on the 6 line during the morning rush in June 2017. The number fell to 63 last year. The on-time rate for the 6 train jumped to 72 percent in January, up from 52 percent in September 2017. “I’m inherently skeptical when they say we changed the schedule, and now everything is running on time,” Mr. Kabak said. “You’re running the risk of padding the schedule.” [Read more on how NYC tackled subway crime and how it may be coming back.] Subway officials denied padding the schedule and said the changes were needed to accurately reflect how long it took to route trains through the system. “Adjusting schedules to accurately reflect actual system conditions allows for less train congestion and faster, more reliable service,” said Maxwell Young, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs the system. “This, along with other significant factors such as the $800 million Subway Action Plan and deliberately improved operating procedures, have led to the recent subway performance gains.” Though fewer trains are scheduled, the same number of trains are running on the 6 line during the morning rush — an average of about 61 trains, Mr. Young said. Officials also cut service on the No. 1 and 5 lines, which each lost two scheduled trains in Midtown Manhattan during the morning rush. While fewer trains could help raise the on-time performance, they also can lead to more crowded trains and less capacity on the system. Each train can carry roughly 1,000 passengers. Most riders never learned about the schedule changes. The authority’s board did not approve them because they only vote on “major” service changes, said Shams Tarek, a spokesman for the authority. The schedule changes on the numbered lines were considered “minor” and the board was merely notified. An investigation by The New York Times in 2017 revealed that the transit agency was running fewer trains. The Lexington Avenue line, which carries the 4, 5 and 6 trains, regularly failed to meet its schedule, effectively canceling dozens of trains and reducing the system’s capacity by tens of thousands of riders. At Grand Central Station, just 77 of 90 scheduled trains regularly ran through the stop from 8 a.m. to 9 a.m. For years, the lettered trains actually had better on-time rates than the numbered trains, but that shifted in January 2018, shortly after the schedule changes took effect. Ms. Librera cited two other factors behind the resurgence: The Second Avenue line opened on the Upper East Side of Manhattan in January 2017, drawing riders who had previously used the overburdened 4, 5 and 6 lines, which bolstered the on-time rate for those lines. New signals on the No. 7 line also improved service. Most experts agree that the system is bouncing back. Andrew Albert, a board member who represents riders, said he noticed trains running faster along the Lexington Avenue line in Manhattan where they used to move at a snail’s pace. “Absolutely, it’s getting better,” he said. “I’m thwarted less often, and I notice the running times are much faster.”",The New York Times
2019,Why Paying Bribes to Get Your Child Into College Is a Crime,"White Collar Watch Get the DealBook newsletter to make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them.__________ All parents want their children to get into the best possible college. But paying bribes to have them admitted to elite schools as athletes, or having someone provide the answers for their standardized tests, clearly crosses the boundary into unacceptable conduct. On Tuesday, federal prosecutors in Boston charged 33 parents and 13 coaches with engaging in a long-running scheme to get children into colleges by gaming the admissions process. Among those caught up in the case are the actresses Lori Loughlin and Felicity Huffman; William E. McGlashan Jr., a partner at the private equity firm TPG; Gordon Caplan, the co-chairman of the law firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher; and Doug Hodge, the retired chief executive of Pimco. But how is paying bribes or submitting falsified test scores to get a child into a private college like Georgetown or the University of Southern California a federal crime? Mail and wire fraud statutes identify a scheme to defraud as including the “right of honest services.” That turns the dishonesty of getting your child admitted to their college of choice into a crime that is punishable by up to 20 years in prison. The honest-services law had been a means to police corporate or official dishonesty without requiring proof of a benefit to the defendant. But in 2010, the Supreme Court, in the appeal of former Enron chief executive Jeffrey Skilling, limited honest-services fraud to cases involving bribes and kickbacks. Now if a university coach or employee takes payment in exchange for improperly admitting a student who is not otherwise qualified, it can be a federal crime because it violates the honest services owed to the school. For the parents charged in the case, paying the bribe means that they are just as guilty for acting as an accomplice in the fraudulent scheme. How do people go off the rails so easily by engaging in clearly dishonest conduct? The criminal complaint is replete with exchanges that show the parents had little regard for the possible criminality of what they were doing. Mr. Caplan was quoted as telling a cooperating witness in the case: “I’m not worried about the moral issue here. I’m worried about the— if she’s caught doing that, you know, she’s finished.” Another parent charged in the case, Jane Buckingham, is quoted as telling a confidential informant: “I know this is craziness; I know it is. And then I need you to get him into U.S.C., and then I need you to cure cancer and [make peace] in the Middle East.” Ms. Buckingham paid $50,000 to have someone else take the ACT exam for her son, according to the complaint. Mr. Caplan, a lawyer, especially should have recognized that the conduct had crossed the line into criminality. But for Mr. Caplan, Ms. Buckingham and the other parents, getting their child into the best school seemed to override any concerns about ethics. So why would otherwise law-abiding individuals flout the law? The answer may lie in the fact that most white-collar crimes do not have an obvious victim. As a result, individuals can convince themselves that they have not really done anything wrong. Gaming the system to get your child into a top-tier college is much the same. There is no easily identifiable victim, and applicants denied admission may well chalk up their rejection to the luck of the draw or the unknown factors that lead one college to turn away a prospective student and another to accept that person. Of course, the action of the parents charged did cause actual harm, even if the victim is unaware of it. University admissions are largely a zero-sum game, so taking one slot means a worthy student was sent away. Not knowing who that person is does not lessen the harm. Wealth can buy a lot of access. Paying bribes to sneak your child into a favored college, though, might result in short prison terms for some of the parents.",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | Why Should Americans Be Grateful for $137 Insulin? Germans Get It for $55,"Only by the bizarre logic of the U.S. pharmaceutical industry does this drug count as any kind of generic. Dr. Rosenthal was an emergency room doctor before becoming a journalist. This month, Eli Lilly and Company announced with some fanfare that it was manufacturing a generic version of its own best-selling insulin brand, Humalog, which it would sell for half off — $137.35 versus about $275. David Ricks, the chief executive of Lilly, said the company was making this seemingly beneficent gesture because “many patients are struggling to afford their insulin.” But they’re struggling, in large part, because since 2001 Lilly has raised the price of a vial of Humalog to about $275, from $35. Other insulin makers have raised prices similarly. In Germany, the list price of a vial of Humalog is about $55 — or $45 if you buy five at a time — and that includes some taxes and markup fees. Why not just reduce the price in the United States to address said suffering? Instead, Lilly decided to come out with a new offering, a so-called authorized generic. This type of product is made by or under an agreement from the brand manufacturer. The medicines are exactly the same as the brand-name drug — often made in the same factory with the same equipment to the same formula. Only the name and the packaging are different. It is perhaps, a sign of how desperate Americans are for something — anything — to counteract the escalating price of drugs that Lilly’s move was greeted with praise rather than a collective “Huh?” Imagine if Apple sold a $500 iPhone for $250 if it was called, say, a yPhone, and simply lacked the elaborate white box and the little Apple on back. That would be patently absurd. An iPhone in a brown paper bag is still an iPhone. And Humalog with a new name isn’t a generic — except according to the bizarre logic of the pharmaceutical industry. Like so many parts of our health care system, its existence has more to do with convoluted business arrangements than health. Generics, as traditionally understood, are copies of brand name drugs made by competing manufacturers once the original patent protection has expired. To be approved by the Food and Drug Administration, they have to have the same active chemical ingredients as the brand drug, and be absorbed equally into the blood, though they could look different and contain different inactive additives. Historically and in practice they tend also to be far cheaper, because the advent of generics often introduces robust competition into the market. That is why brand manufacturers sometimes produce an authorized generic once they lose patent protection. That way, they can compete at the lower price point, while preserving the original for those with extreme label loyalty. More recently, authorized generics like Lilly’s stem largely from a different strategy — based on the perverse ways money flows through our health system and who keeps the cash. Over the last 20 years, drug makers have continuously raised the price of some essential medicines in the United States because, well, they can in a country that doesn’t set drug prices. And they do — until the bad publicity catches up with them. Mylan got hauled before Congress in 2016 for raising the price of an EpiPen. Now it’s insulin’s turn. The other two major brand makers of insulin products — Novo Nordisk and Sanofi — have raised prices in lock step with Lilly. But they are based in Europe, so the Indiana-based Lilly has been the primary focus of angry protests here. Part of insulin’s price rise in the United States is because of the middlemen who buy the drugs on behalf of insurers and hospitals and negotiate discounts off the list price for their clients. So Lilly often doesn’t make the full $275 a vial (though, since rebates are secret, we don’t know how much less). By selling an authorized generic, rather than merely lowering the brand’s price, Lilly is essentially doing an end-run around those middlemen and giving patients who don’t purchase through an insurer another option. It is also making sure that if and when cheaper versions of Humalog emerge, it will have an offering to compete. In fact, a “biosimilar” version of Humalog already exists. It was introduced to the United States last year. And yet it costs around the same price as the brand name drug. Why? It is made by Sanofi, which has no interest in starting a price war to lower costs. Finally, Lilly has generated a few positive headlines. “Eli Lilly Will Sell Half-Price Version of Humalog, Its Best-Selling Insulin,” this paper reported. Mylan effectively calmed its EpiPen PR crisis by introducing a cheaper authorized generic. Now Lilly, following a similar playbook, is hoping for a similar result. Will it work? Politicians and patients will decide. But they might well keep these two thoughts in mind: If the product being sold was electricity or gas for your car, a price rise of more than 600 percent over 15 years would be regarded as price gouging and wouldn’t be tolerated. And in Germany and many other developed countries, there is no need for a $137.35 vial of “authorized generic” for Humalog. At around $50 a vial, Humalog as Humalog costs far less.

2019,Why Some Republicans Voted Against the Antibigotry Resolution,"Every House Democrat voted for a broadly worded resolution condemning “hateful expressions of intolerance,” but 23 Republicans voted no. WASHINGTON — The House passed a resolution on Thursday that condemned anti-Semitism and other forms of bigotry. The resolution, written by House Democrats, began as an implicit response to comments made by Representative Ilhan Omar, Democrat of Minnesota, that were widely deemed anti-Semitic, but when some Democrats objected to singling her out, the resolution was broadened to condemn other forms of hatred. Earlier this year, House Republicans unanimously endorsed a resolution that condemned white nationalism and white supremacy after Representative Steve King, Republican of Iowa, asked when the term “white supremacy” had become controversial, capping years of bigoted comments that had gone unpunished. This time, they were not so united, and some Democrats demanded to know why. Here is their answer: “The frustration on the Republican side was that they watered down the amendment,” Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the Republican leader, said at a news conference on Friday. (Mr. McCarthy voted for the resolution; one of his top lieutenants, Representative Liz Cheney, voted against it.) “We’re here today because a member of this body issued a series of anti-Semitic statements,” Mr. Biggs said in a floor speech on Thursday. He spoke of the difference between justice and mercy, adding: “We now have a pattern and we begin to wonder how we extend mercy when justice cries out against one who is anti-Semitic. It doesn’t help that Democratic leaders have attempted to rationalize and protect this individual.” In 2016, Mr. Biggs raised eyebrows when he charged that the Jewish philanthropist George Soros was buying a local election for county attorney. Mr. Brooks said he voted against the resolution because its “failure to specifically state opposition to discrimination against Caucasian-Americans and Christians, while reflective of Socialist Democrat priorities and values is, by omission, fatal to the bill.” After Mr. Brooks said in 2016 that Muslims wanted to “kill every gay person in America,” the Alabama chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations demanded an apology. Mr. Buck, in a statement after the vote, criticized the resolution for failing “to address a problem that needed to be confronted.” “Anti-Semitism can’t be compared with any other hate speech without marginalizing the history of Jewish oppression,” he said. “I will not vote to overlook the anti-Semitism which has been covered up by the Democratic leadership.” Mr. Budd, reacting on Twitter, said that he voted against the resolution because it failed to name Ms. Omar or list her comments. The legislation, Mr. Burgess said in a statement, “does not adequately refute the anti-Semitism that has been displayed in the U.S. House of Representatives.” Perhaps the most striking “no” vote came from Ms. Cheney, the No. 3 Republican, because of her role as chairwoman of the House Republican Conference. “Today’s resolution vote was a sham put forward by Democrats to avoid condemning one of their own and denouncing vile anti-Semitism,” Ms. Cheney said in a statement after the vote. The Democrats’ resolution left the party with internal questions about where to draw the line on speech. Mr. Collins was re-elected in November even after he was indicted on a charge of insider trading. He has kept a low profile, but after his “no” vote, he took to Twitter. “After reading the final resolution I did not feel it was strong enough in support of Israel, the only true democracy in the Middle East, and that is why I voted no,” Mr. Collins said. Mr. Conaway said in a statement that House Democrats “must take bigotry of all kinds seriously, not just instances that fit their progressive liberal agenda.” “If Democrat Leaders wanted to specifically address anti-Semitism and a member of their conference who has repeatedly made anti-Semitic comments,” Mr. Crawford said on Twitter, “this resolution failed in nearly every way possible.” Mr. Duncan argued that a true condemnation would have made reference to Ms. Omar, and the comments that prompted the resolution. Mr. Duncan stirred protests in 2017 when he posted on Facebook an image of a white man labeled “Europe” with a noose around his neck watering a small tree labeled “Islam,” with one end of the noose tied around it. “Chew on this picture,” he wrote. “Jeff I know you’re not racist. Let’s put that to the side,” Bakari Sellers, a former Democratic legislator in South Carolina, tweeted in response. “But this is bigoted, ignorant and embarrassing.” In a fiery speech on the House floor on Thursday, Mr. Gohmert complained that the resolution was “watered down.” Mr. Gohmert dealt with his own accusations of anti-Semitism last year after he falsely accused Mr. Soros of collaborating with the Nazis during World War II, a popular myth on the far right. “George Soros is supposed to be Jewish, but you wouldn’t know it from the damage he’s inflicted on Israel, and the fact that he turned on fellow Jews and helped take the property that they owned,” he said on Fox Business Network. Patrick Gaspard, the president of Mr. Soros’s Open Society Foundations, sent a letter to Mr. Gohmert in December demanding an apology for the “disturbing and false anti-Semitic slur.” Mr. Soros was a child in Nazi-occupied Hungary. “Without naming the offender, the chastisement is an empty gesture,” Mr. Gosar said on Twitter. “It’s time for Democrats to take real action against these anti-Jewish remarks.” Mr. Gosar raised eyebrows after the deadly white supremacist march in Charlottesville, Va., in 2017 when he said “an Obama sympathizer” — funded by Mr. Soros — “started the rally,” then repeated the claim that Mr. Soros “turned in his own people to the Nazis.” Mr. Graves criticized the resolution in a statement as “a sham vote” that failed to directly address Ms. Omar or her remarks. Mr. King complained on Twitter that the resolution was weakened because of political correctness, and said it was a “sad day for Congress.” “Victory for hate speech!” he added. In a statement to The New York Times, Mr. LaMalfa said that the resolution — which he called a “last-minute, politically driven catchall smorgasbord” — was an “abomination to the message that should be sent on the anti-Jewish, anti-Israel rhetoric.” Mr. Massie joined his colleagues in criticizing the scope of the measure, asking on Twitter, “Now that the resolution protects just about every group on the planet, can we add ‘babies on the day of their birth’ as a protected class?” A spokeswoman for Mr. Palazzo did not respond to a request for comment. “House Democrats had the opportunity to make a strong statement against this vile bigotry by condemning hateful statements,” Mr. Rogers in a statement. “Instead, they caved to their radical socialist base and took no meaningful action.” Mr. Roy described the resolution in a statement as “a sham cover vote designed to avoid dealing with a rogue member.” In a statement, Mr. Steube said the resolution should have mentioned Ms. Omar by name and the context of her remarks. In a statement, Mr. Walker said that it was a “spineless resolution” that “provided cover to a politician spreading hatred and anti-Semitism.” “It was a very shallow vote,” Mr. Yoho said in an interview on Friday. “They did everything they could to not condemn the one that was brought out to. So I think it was just a show vote.” In a floor speech on Thursday, Mr. Zeldin asked why Ms. Omar was not named in the resolution and noted that she had not apologized for her most recent comments. (She apologized for other remarks seen as anti-Semitic.) “Why would she be more emboldened to refuse an apology altogether?” he asked in a floor speech. “I don’t believe she is naïve. I believe that she knows exactly what she is doing.” Sheryl Gay Stolberg contributed reporting.",The New York Times
2019,Why Store Art When You Can Share It? A Collector’s Trove,"Show Us Your Wall Reginald Van Lee should have bought those Basquiats when he had the chance. Jean-Michel Basquiat, before he was famous, offered two of his paintings to Mr. Van Lee, who declined, having never been a fan. But Mr. Van Lee still wanted to kick himself when he saw a Basquiat sell for more than $110 million at auction in 2017. The decision was consistent with Mr. Van Lee’s principles over the 20 years he’s been collecting: buying only art that he loves, never acquiring a piece solely because it is likely to appreciate in value. That approach is evident in his 55th-floor apartment overlooking the East River, where he has been spending more time since he retired in 2016 from the consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton. The work on the yellow walls is mostly by African-American artists, including the sculptor and muralist Cheryl R. Riley and the emerging painter Tyler D. Ballon, who only recently graduated from art school. With the help of his art adviser, Peg Alston, Mr. Van Lee has acquired mixed media works by Shinique Smith, sculptures by LeRone Wilson and photography by Renee Cox. Mr. Van Lee, 60 — known as Reggie — has even more work (about 400 pieces) at the homestead he recently rejuvenated in Wharton, Tex., land his great-grandmother, a former slave, purchased in 1899. There, he keeps work by artists like Ed Clark, Romare Bearden, Sam Gilliam and Frank Bowling. The collector likes to help develop the careers of young artists, as he has done as a trustee at the Studio Museum in Harlem and a former chairman of the Dance Theater of Harlem. Mr. Van Lee, who was a student at Alvin Ailey when he first came to New York in his 20s, has long been a devoted patron of the arts, serving on the boards of Washington Performing Arts, the Kennedy Center and, under President Obama, the Committee on the Arts and the Humanities. On March 11, the Theater Development Fund will honor him — and the costume designer Bob Mackie — at its annual gala. Mr. Van Lee became enthusiastic about the organization after attending one of its autism-friendly performances of “The Lion King,” where he spoke with a mother grateful for the chance to bring her son to the theater. She had been asked to leave another show when her son, who has autisim, had became too vocal. This resonated with Mr. Van Lee. “As a black man in corporate America,” he said recently in an interview, “I’ve been in many rooms where I know I’m not wanted.” These are edited excerpts from the conversation. You have photography by Gordon Parks and James Van Der Zee as well as recent photographs of students at Dance Theater of Harlem. I have a mixture of established art and people you’ve never really heard of. I think the collection works together. You own Lisa Beane’s “Little White Lie,” which depicts Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings; why don’t you own more political work? I don’t buy political pieces because I like joy in my life. What attracted you to an unknown like Tyler Ballon — his religious-themed scenes of African-Americans? I was blown away. [Gesturing to a large painting over a sofa] This is “The Pietà.” My role in life is to enhance things. I really like to support young artists. You have a bachelor’s degree and a master’s from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and an M.B.A. from Harvard Business School; where did the arts come in? When I was 3, 4 years old, I would draw and paint. In elementary school, I was in the glee club. In high school, I was in speech and drama. The performing arts and visual arts were always something I was very interested in. Pretty early on I discovered I would probably be a better consumer of art and patron of the arts than an artist. Your mother was a nurse and your father a letter-carrier. How did they influence you? The notion of aspiring to achieve things in life was sort of in the blood. All things come from somewhere — the notion of surrounding yourself with beauty. What made you buy the 2006 piece by William T. Williams in your entryway, “Tupelo Honey”? The musicality of it. Maybe it’s the yellow that attracted me. Most collectors have more art than wall space. Is that true of you? I don’t believe in storage. I think art should be seen.",The New York Times
2019,Why Texas Is Nearing Battleground Status (It’s Not Just About Beto),"Hispanics represent the (elusive) upside for Democrats, but it’s a shift in white voters that is making the biggest difference. The dream of a “Blue Texas” has captured the imagination of Democrats for nearly a decade, and Beto O’Rourke has come closer than anyone to making a statewide victory a reality. His strengths as a candidate in his narrow loss in a 2018 Senate race against Ted Cruz — by 2.6 percentage points — led his supporters to push him to run for president, and he obliged them Thursday morning. But his performance may have demonstrated something else: Texas is on the doorstep of emerging as a battleground state, and any number of Democrats might stand a chance to compete there in 2020 for the presidency or the Senate. His relatively close loss is promising for the party because he did not take full advantage of the longer-term trends that might put it over the top sooner than later. His strength came almost exclusively from white voters, not from the growing Hispanic population in the state. None of this is to take away from his accomplishment. He did better than every Democrat running statewide in Texas in the 2018 midterms. It seems unlikely that many Democrats would have fared as well as he did, and you could argue it bodes well for his chances in a presidential race. But on balance his success was a reflection of deeper trends. Mr. O’Rourke’s close result wasn’t because of an exceptional turnout that will be hard for other Democrats to repeat in 2020. Republican voters, defined as those who have participated in a recent Republican primary, turned out at a higher rate than Democratic ones. Neither the Hispanic nor youth voter share of the electorate was higher than it was in 2016, when President Trump won the state by nine points. On the contrary, Democrats in 2020 can be expected to enjoy a more favorable turnout because presidential races tend to draw in more young and Hispanic voters. Mr. O’Rourke might have won Texas last November if turnout had been at the level of a contested presidential race, based on an Upshot analysis of Times/Siena poll responses, actual results and voter file data from L2, a nonpartisan voter file vendor. The data yields an estimate of how every registered voter in Texas would have voted, based on a long list of geographic and demographic factors that predicted vote choice in the Times/Siena polling. Importantly, turnout in 2018 is among those factors, which allows us to fully untangle how much of Mr. O’Rourke’s strength was because of strong turnout among his supporters. The data indicates that two opposing turnout trends influenced the results. The electorate was older, whiter and more Republican than the state as a whole — or than the 2016 electorate. But an O’Rourke supporter was generally likelier to vote than a demographically and politically similar supporter of Mr. Cruz. This was the pattern nationwide, so it is not obvious that this can be attributed to Mr. O’Rourke specifically; it could have been the favorable Democratic environment more generally. Either way, the extra turnout boost probably cut Mr. Cruz’s margin of victory by two points. Mr. O’Rourke might have won with a turnout of around 10 million voters. (The actual turnout was around 8.4 million.) Without the extra edge of a Democratic wave year, it might have taken 11 million votes, a number that is not out of the question in 2020 if Texas is contested as a battleground state. So how did Mr. O’Rourke fare so well? He did it through old-fashioned persuasion, by winning voters who had voted for Republicans and for minor-party candidates. The results themselves make it clear that he won a lot of voters who supported Republicans in other races. He ran three points ahead of the overall Democratic state vote for the U.S. House in 2018 (adjusted for uncontested races), and ahead of every down-ballot Democrat running statewide. Mr. O’Rourke’s personal appeal was probably a factor, and there’s no guarantee a different Democrat can replicate it. His strong favorability rating (plus-10 in the exit polls, 52 percent to 42 percent) is consistent with that possibility, though he might have also had the benefit of a relatively unpopular incumbent in Mr. Cruz. Only 50 percent of voters had a favorable impression of Mr. Cruz in the exit polls (48 percent had an unfavorable one). But Mr. O’Rourke’s personal appeal is not the whole story. After all, many Democrats running for the U.S. House or other statewide offices posted noteworthy performances. The tide lifting all Democratic boats in Texas was an anti-Trump rebellion. Over all, President Trump’s approval rating was at 49 percent in the exit poll and 50 percent in the large AP/Fox Votecast poll. This is consistent with a variety of other survey data, including a recent Quinnipiac poll that put the president’s approval rating at minus-3 among registered voters in the state, 47-50. Gallup, measuring the much more diverse pool of Texan adults, put the president’s approval rating at just 41 percent in 2018. It is notable that Mr. O’Rourke, with 48.3 percent of the vote, fell a bit short of the disapproval number of the president. That could reflect that he was facing a well-known incumbent, which offers on average a meaningful benefit to the officeholder (despite Mr. Cruz’s relative unpopularity). It could also reflect the state’s G.O.P. tradition; some number of Republicans may disapprove of Trump but not be ready to vote for a Democrat. No matter how you explain it, the president’s disapproval rating in Texas would seem to imply that there’s at least some additional upside for Democrats there, beyond what Mr. O’Rourke pulled off. And the president’s far lower approval rating among all adults (as opposed to among registered voters) hints at another opportunity for Democrats: mobilizing unregistered voters. In both cases, Hispanic voters could represent the upside for Democrats. Mr. O’Rourke’s strong showing had essentially nothing to do with the initial vision of a Blue Texas powered by mobilizing the state’s growing Hispanic population. The Texas electorate was only two points more Hispanic in 2018 than it was in 2012, but President Obama lost the state by 16 points in 2012, compared with Mr. O’Rourke’s 2.6-point loss. At the same time, Mr. O’Rourke fared worse than Mr. Obama or Hillary Clinton in many of the state’s heavily Hispanic areas, particularly in more conservative South Texas. This could reflect Mr. Cruz’s relative strength among Hispanic voters compared with a typical Republican. Instead, Mr. O’Rourke’s improvement came almost exclusively from white voters, and particularly college-educated white voters. Whites probably gave him around 33 percent of their votes, up from a mere 22 percent for Mr. Obama in 2012. There’s clearly additional upside for Democrats if they could pair their recent gains among white voters with improvement among Hispanic voters (through some combination of persuasion, higher turnout among registrants and newly registered voters). Can Democrats really turn out Hispanic voters in huge numbers in Texas? There are real barriers, and you wouldn’t expect Hispanic Democrats to turn out in particularly high numbers given their low turnout elsewhere in the country. It is far-fetched to suggest Hispanic mobilization will fundamentally transform the electorate and turn Texas into a blueish state anytime soon. But a more modest increase in turnout or support among Hispanic voters is fairly likely if Texas sees the campaign dollars and attention that come with a contested state in a presidential year. When Mr. Obama contested Virginia, North Carolina and Colorado in 2008, the turnout there increased by an average of 13 percent to 23 percent over 2004 levels, which included a mix of higher turnout among registrants and thousands of newly registered voters. Given the extraordinary turnout in the 2018 midterm election nationwide, it is plausible that turnout will be up substantially in Texas regardless of whether the state is a battleground. Is Texas a true battleground state? Mr. O’Rourke and House Democrats fared much worse in Texas than in clear battleground states like Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan. They also fared worse than in the next tier of Sun Belt battlegrounds, like Florida, Georgia, Arizona and North Carolina. And Texas is substantially more expensive to compete in than any of those states, save Florida. But if you squint at the midterm results, it is not obvious that Texas will be so far to the right of those Sun Belt battlegrounds. The president’s approval rating in the two election surveys was basically the same in Texas as in Florida, Georgia and Arizona (there were no surveys in North Carolina, where there was no statewide contest). Democrats in Texas, including Mr. O’Rourke, fared worse in the major statewide contests, but it was also the only state where the Democrats all faced incumbents in such contests. It is also the state where the Democrats have the most obvious upside in terms of the mobilization of additional voters; the pace of demographic shifts; and the trend toward Democrats in the Trump era. Put it together, and Texas is on the cusp of being a true (if Republican-tilting) battleground state. It might not be immediately and vigorously contested, as Arizona or North Carolina will most likely be, given the greater expense of campaigning in Texas and the fact that it starts out to the right of those states. But if Democrats chose to contest it seriously in 2020, there wouldn’t be anything crazy about that.",The New York Times
2019,Why These Indians and Pakistanis Rarely Discuss Tensions: It’s Just Not Cricket,"In recent days, as India and Pakistan came almost to the brink of war, the members of the Boston Gymkhana Sports Club — a cricket club that, like many in the United States, has members from both countries — did not interrupt their usual social calendar. Some members were on edge about the escalation between the two nuclear-armed nations, which began two weeks ago when a suicide bombing in the disputed region of Kashmir killed more than 40 Indian soldiers. And many had sharply different perspectives on the conflict. Rajiv Shah, 46, who emigrated in 1999 from the Indian state of Gujarat, was approving when the Indian government conducted airstrikes in Pakistan, claiming to kill a large number of terrorists. Others felt that India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, was exploiting the situation, intentionally ramping up tensions in hopes of solidifying his support in the coming elections. At least a couple of members gave some credence to conspiracy theories that the Indian government itself might be behind the terrorist attack. And yet, there was a birthday to celebrate: The club’s founder, Bikram Singh, was turning 53. The club members, accustomed to setting aside their differences and carrying on with their friendships at times of heightened hostility between the two countries, were planning a party. “No matter what, we live and play or interact with people that we completely disagree with sometimes, but we still manage,” said Mr. Singh, whose family is from the northwestern Indian state of Punjab. The past week has seen some people in India and Pakistan openly root for war, while others have urged the country’s leaders to find a way to end the crisis. (Pakistan’s prime minister, Imran Khan — himself a former cricket star — made a move in that direction, and gained an international publicity coup, when he released an Indian pilot whom Pakistan had captured, reducing tensions somewhat, although shelling continued along the disputed border.) In the United States, sentiments were similarly mixed: Some Indian-Americans protested outside the Pakistani consulates in New York and Chicago, accusing the country of harboring terrorists, while others joined marches for peace. But among the members of the Boston Gymkhana Sports Club, there was no palpable unease as they gathered on Sunday evening at Mr. Singh’s comfortable home in Norfolk, about 40 minutes southwest of Boston. Mr. Singh, who had just returned from a vacation to India — his trip home took some 51 hours, because his flight had to be diverted to avoid Pakistani airspace, he said — wore a saffron-colored vest and sipped whiskey. Vegetable fritters and other appetizers were laid out, and club members and their wives and a few teenage children greeted each other with hugs. The roughly 40 guests were a subset of the cricket club’s membership, which Mr. Singh said is between 150 and 200, depending on the year. The majority are from India; Mr. Singh estimated that about 10 percent are from Pakistan. Over all, several members agreed, the club members do not discuss the decades-long conflict between India and Pakistan much. “Some of it is deferential, so you obviously try not to hurt the other person’s feelings,” Nafis Ahmad, 51, who is from Karachi, explained the day before the party. He added: “Our club is kind of gentlemanly in a sense. We try not to delve into topics that are too controversial.” A simple guide to the roots of the conflict and what could happen next. This is striking given how much time the club members spend together. Games last some six hours, and afterward, the club members will often spend another six hours eating dinner and drinking together. In the winter, when they don’t play cricket, they play poker in a large upstairs room in Mr. Singh’s home, decorated with dozens of cricket trophies and nearly as many bottles of liquor. (The amount of socializing has led the club to adopt an unofficial motto: “We also play cricket.”) There have been times when geopolitics have briefly intruded on the club’s bonhomie, and early on, one episode led to a member being ejected. That was in 1999, shortly after Mr. Singh had founded the club, and when it had only one or two Pakistani members. That spring and summer, India and Pakistan briefly went to war in Kashmir. Mr. Singh said he received a phone call one morning from an Indian-American club member demanding that the Pakistani members be kicked out. Mr. Singh said he was stunned. “I said, ‘You know what? You’re not going to play in our club anymore — that’s not the kind of club we are.’ ” On Sunday, at a reporter’s request, a group of the party guests agreed to move into the poker room to discuss the most recent escalation. There was no one from Kashmir, the region at the center of the rivalry, whose residents are often left out of the debate about the two country’s actions. It wasn’t long before differences emerged. Omar Virk, 28, who grew up outside Lahore and came here three and a half years ago to study for his bachelor’s degree at the University of Massachusetts, Lowell, said he believed that India’s prime minister was purposefully stoking the conflict. “Modi is trying to push into this one,” he said. “You know how he won the last election, right? He was anti-Pakistan from the start.” “I disagree with that,” said Moin Ghouse, 38, who is from the Indian city of Hyderabad. “I think Modi is politically savvy enough to understand the risks involved in going for an all-out war,” Mr. Ghouse added. Mr. Virk began talking about theories he said were being discussed on Indian television suggesting that Mr. Modi himself was behind the terrorist attack. “Nobody can prove that,” he added, though he said he had been thinking the same thing. Others said the idea was absurd. Mr. Shah, the club member from Gujarat — Mr. Modi’s home state, where he was chief minister in 2002 when deadly religious riots took place in which roughly a thousand people, mostly Muslims, were killed — said many Indians were thrilled that Mr. Modi had taken a stand and attacked Pakistan in response to the suicide bombing. As competing conversations broke out, Mr. Ahmad, the club member from Karachi, said he had been worried in recent days about the possibility of war, because he believed that India increasingly saw itself as a superpower. “I was a little unnerved that we may be — on the other side of the border, some of our brothers may be a little bit too much trigger-happy, and they would say, ‘O.K., these guys have been doing these shenanigans for us for many, many years, let’s show them.’” One of Mr. Singh’s close friends, Parak Ananta, began reminding the group that dinner was getting cold downstairs. Eventually, everyone went down to eat. Asked when club members last had a conversation like this, Mr. Singh said that it had been years ago, when he started a Facebook group for club members and others to discuss a series of India-Pakistan cricket games. Mr. Ananta had thought starting the group was a bad idea — that passions would run too high, and people would say things they would regret. Looking back, Mr. Ananta said that he felt he had been right; the conversation had damaged some friendships. “We have to be real sometime,” Mr. Singh insisted. “We can’t just be in a cocoon all the time.” Mr. Ananta disagreed. “Even between wife and husband there are certain things that are taboo,” he said.

2019,Why Tim O’Brien Agreed to Write for ‘This Is Us’,"At War When the creators of “This Is Us” decided they wanted the third season to explore one of its key characters’ experiences in the Vietnam War, they knew they had to bring in some support. “We were determined to get it right,” according to Dan Fogelman, the show’s executive producer. The choice of whom to tap was not hard. In June 2018, NBC announced that Fogelman’s “literary hero,” Tim O’Brien, would join the show as a consultant. He ultimately took on a bigger role and joined the writing staff, according to Fogelman. O’Brien’s books about the Vietnam War have sold more than six million copies, won numerous awards and repeatedly been recognized as some of the most important works of American fiction of the 20th century. “The Things They Carried,” probably O’Brien’s most famous work, which he didn’t publish until 1990, conveyed his intimate experiences as an American draftee through haunting short stories that explore the physical and emotional baggage that the soldiers of Alpha Company carried with them in Vietnam. In many ways, his episodic, character-driven storytelling style was a natural fit for “This Is Us.” [For more stories about the experiences and costs of war, sign up for the weekly At War newsletter.] The series, which had its premiere in September 2016, traces the lives of the Pearson family through story lines that jump between the past and present, touching on themes — race, weight, addiction — to which its loyal audience closely relates. The third season opened on Sept. 25, 2018, but it wasn’t until the fourth episode, titled “Vietnam,” that viewers got to experience O’Brien’s influence. “Vietnam” follows Jack after he enlists in the Army because his younger brother, Nicky, was drafted, and what happens once Jack finds himself in Quang Ngai Province in 1971. The episode sets off a multiepisode arc that alternates between Jack and Jack’s son, Kevin, who in the present day travels to Vietnam to learn more about his father’s service during the war. The plot achieves what O’Brien’s books are so well known for: using war as a setting for exploring the human character. In an interview with The Times Magazine, O’Brien talked about writing for “This Is Us” and how an all-volunteer military force changed the way the American public looks at war. What persuaded you to accept Dan Fogelman’s offer to join this season? Well, a number of things. One is that the show is extremely well written. When I got the call, I was interested for that reason, if nothing else. Then I was told that they would be going to the Vietnam War and coming home. That was intriguing to me because so many of us believe that wars, regardless of peace treaties and the ending of hostilities, they go on and on in memory. Not only for the veterans but for the children of veterans and lovers and mothers and fathers: The repercussions go way beyond the people who actually served. I have kids, much like Jack, and I fear that my kids are dealing with the Vietnam War sometimes as much as I am. What Dan was trying to do with Nicky seemed really important and much overlooked. I just haven’t seen anything even try to deal with it, much less deal that pretty darn well. When you approach the Nicky story line, do you go back to your books and experiences for reference material? Like Nicky, I was reluctant to go to the war. I didn’t believe in it. I thought it was wrong. But also like Nicky, I went. What you see of Nicky is that he was beaten down by the war, smothered in blood the way I was. It wrecked him, and what he carried home was a great deal of pain. Some people are heartsick, and some people are lovesick. Warsick. That’s pretty much how I felt when I returned from the Vietnam War. Like I had a bad case of war pneumonia and haven’t been able to shake it in 50 years. Did you see the episode where Nicky and the little boy fish with hand grenades? Yes. The very first time I met Dan and the writers, I told them a story about a group of guys fishing on the South China Sea with hand grenades. They were splashing around, the boat was full of water and one of them dropped a grenade, which exploded and killed him. The lights went on in Dan’s and the writers’ eyes. They needed an incident that wasn’t your standard bang, bang, shoot ’em up: They needed a war story off on the edges of things. And that’s not a story often told. What you saw on the show came right out of my life. It ended up not being an American soldier, but a little Vietnamese boy. There’s a point when Nicky says that the memory he’ll have the day he dies will be that boy’s mother wailing on the beach. That wailing memory is also out of my life. The grief of the civilians over dead kids and dead animals and dead husbands and brothers: They’re wailing for it all. That wail represents the incredible grief of the other that we seem to overlook in favor of veterans — it’s important for America to get a shot of that. Does Nicky’s story line do something we haven’t seen in film or television before? Most films focus on the suffering of the individual soldier, not how it affects others. When I go silent at the dinner table with my own kids, they know what’s going on inside me. Their dad has been writing about Vietnam for 50 years. And somewhere in Orlando, Fla., there’s an old lady who wakes up at 2 o’clock in the morning every day and every night and says, “Where is my baby?” Well, her baby has been dead for 50 years, but for her that war is not over, and she is as much a casualty. In the show, Randall, Kate and Kevin are starting to deal with the pain of a silent father who slammed the door on Vietnam. That ripple effect is what interests me about what the show is trying to do. Is it true you’re not just working on the show’s Vietnam-related material? A little bit. Not very much. I try to cut down other appearances to make room for more Vietnam stuff, basically. I’m just kidding, but I don’t do much with other characters. Sometimes I’ll try my hand at dialogue. But as a novelist, I’m in total control of my vision and my material. I’m the director, actor and writer. But you really have to feel that you’re part of this organism called “This Is Us.” As much as you can, leave your own preferences and identity behind and be faithful to what the show is and wants to be. That was hard at first, but I really enjoyed that new way of trying to make something good. Where does “This is Us” fit into the canon of art about war? The answer will depend on what comes in the future. As it stands right now, only one season has been devoted to war, and of that, only a portion of the season. But the groundwork for what will follow has been laid, essentially through Nicky and Jack. “This Is Us” has demonstrated an authentic and important truth, but it’s still Act 1 of what I hope will be a 10-act play over the next couple of seasons. Do you think the past 18 years of continuous warfare have compelled this generation of veterans to write? I think it has. I’ve met many compatriots of yours, fellow soldiers now writing. Their concerns are not exactly mine, but they’re inexactly mine. The similarities have to do with the aftermath of it all, really — that war is war. The purpose of war is to kill people, and there are consequences to that enterprise. One way of dealing with that is through writing that has the emotional feel of what it is to bear the spiritual and emotional burdens afterward. That’s what the best of the writing coming out of my war and your wars deals with. The main difference between our wars is the absence of a draft. Your generation of combat soldiers is a generation of volunteers. That difference is a huge one, because your generation of soldiers is bearing a much heavier burden than mine did. Anyone who doesn’t want to fight and kill people, or get killed — they don’t have to. That’s a strange predicament for a republic like ours to be in. Do you think volunteers of these wars produce art that is distinguishable from the conscripts of the Vietnam War? It’s subtle, but I think it does. If I were to volunteer, end up in combat in Iraq or Afghanistan, then come home, I’d be asking myself, “Why the [expletive] did I do that?” At least I was able to blame L.B.J., or my hometown draft board, or Nixon. I had somebody to blame, and as sorry as that excuse would be, it still was there. A volunteer has to understand that they did this to themselves. I’ve got two students of mine who are veterans, and this is what they’re mostly writing about: the former boy who chose to do this and now lives with the consequences.",The New York Times
2019,Why Trump Inquiries Are Now Centered in New York,"New York Today [Want to get New York Today by email? Here's the sign-up.] It’s Tuesday. The actor Michael Imperioli, the Westchester County native who played Governor Cuomo in a recent television mini-series, is 53. Weather: Sunny, windy and brisk. It will feel like the low 20s in the morning, but the day will warm up to the high 40s by afternoon. Alternate-side parking: In effect until April 18 (Holy Thursday). The special prosecutor Robert Mueller’s investigation into President Trump is over. Now it’s New York’s turn. Federal and state prosecutors in New York are at the forefront of about a dozen investigations connected to Mr. Trump, which largely grew out of Mr. Mueller’s effort. Here’s a guide to the inquiries. Didn’t the Mueller report settle everything? Hardly. Mr. Mueller investigated two main issues: whether the Trump campaign conspired with the Russian government to interfere in the 2016 presidential election, and whether the president obstructed that investigation. [Read the key Mueller findings.] During that inquiry, evidence of other possible crimes came to light, so Mr. Mueller’s team referred cases to other offices for further investigation. How many investigations are there? About a dozen, according to sources and court documents. Typically, investigations are done in secret, so there is no official count. More than half appear to be in New York. Others are in Washington, Virginia and Los Angeles. Why are so many investigations in New York? Mr. Trump worked in New York for years and ran his campaign from here. That puts the president, his associates and his company, the Trump Organization, in the jurisdiction of New York investigators. Who is investigating in New York? • On the federal level: the Southern District of New York and the Eastern District of New York. • On the state level: the attorney general, the Manhattan district attorney, the Department of Financial Services and the Department of Taxation and Finance. What are they investigating? A lot. Mr. Trump’s business, his campaign, his inauguration and his presidency. They are mostly following his money: where it went and how it was accounted for. One set of inquiries relates to Mr. Trump’s campaign and other activities. Did his business arrange payments to women who claimed they had affairs with Mr. Trump, which may violate campaign finance rules? Did Mr. Trump’s inaugural committee make false filings with the Federal Election Commission? Did the committee receive illegal donations? Did a top campaign and inaugural committee fund-raiser use his connections to the president to bolster his own businesses? People who worked for Mr. Trump are also under scrutiny. Did Mr. Trump’s lawyers plan to offer a presidential pardon to a witness in exchange for keeping quiet? Can three companies that worked with Paul Manafort, the former presidential campaign chairman, be charged under the Foreign Agents Registration Act? Earlier activities are also under investigation. Has Mr. Trump’s family charitable foundation violated tax laws? Did the Trump Organization inflate insurance claims several years ago? Have Mr. Trump and his family underpaid taxes on his father’s real estate empire over several decades? How serious is all this? It varies. Some investigations are civil inquiries, and liability could lead to fines. Federal penalties could include prison time. The prevailing view at the federal Justice Department is that a sitting president cannot be indicted. The prosecutors in Manhattan could consider charging Mr. Trump after he leaves office. What’s next? Expect a lot of silence. This work can take time and is usually not done in public. What’s the takeaway? “By handing off so many cases to other offices, Mr. Mueller ensured that his investigation would live on for months, if not years, with prosecutors in New York,” according to my colleague Ben Protess, who has been reporting on these investigations. New York is poised to become the first city in the United States to introduce congestion pricing, putting new electronic tolls in place for drivers entering the busiest stretches of Manhattan, The Times’s Jesse McKinley and Winnie Hu reported. Details were not ironed out, but state leaders reached consensus that the plan was needed to help pay for much-needed repairs to the city’s subway system.

The father of a Sandy Hook shooting victim died in an apparent suicide. A mayor mulling a 2020 bid? New York was buzzing over Pete Buttigieg, not Bill de Blasio. Representative José Serrano of the Bronx said he would not run for re-election, citing the effects of Parkinson’s disease.

Sometimes, it can feel as if being young in New York City is a crime. In the 1950s, and earlier, it sort of was. “Kids were forming clubs, and adults were calling them gangs,” said Maeve Montalvo, an education coordinator at the Museum of the City of New York. On Wednesday at 5:30 p.m., the museum will host “Kids These Days: The Criminalization of Youth in New York,” a talk featuring Ella Antell, a doctoral candidate in United States history at Harvard University. There is a long record of adults looking at young people with trepidation, Ms. Antell said. Essentially, she said, teenagers gathered, and adults figured they were up to no good and called the groups “gangs.” “Youth themselves during this period didn’t call themselves gangs most of the time,” she added. “They called themselves street clubs or cliques. Adults perceived what they were doing as purely antisocial or purely criminal.” [In 1958, The Times explained teenage gang expressions, such as “cool it” and ”diddley bop.”] The people at the center of this conversation may be young, but the laws governing them are not. In 1933, for example, New York had juvenile delinquency laws that banned “extreme obscenities,” “running away from home” and “endangering the public morals of yourself or others,” Ms. Antell said. That last one “was concerned with controlling the sexual behavior of girls in particular,” she said. Put another way: “It was code word for prostitution.” It’s Tuesday — you don’t have to act your age today. Dear Diary: A friend’s husband found a young cat wandering in the Catskills.

The sweet little calico arrived three days later. The day after she showed up, I took her to my neighborhood vet for a checkup. He whisked her off for shots and blood tests and to treat her for roundworms, and then he brought her back to the examining room. “You just got very lucky,” he said. “I know!” I exclaimed. “She’s such a great cat.” “I was talking to the cat,” the vet said. — Barbara Peck New York Today is published weekdays around 6 a.m. Sign up here to get it by email.

2019,Opinion | Why Trump Keeps Attacking John McCain,"letters Readers suggest envy or mental imbalance. To the Editor: In “McCain Death Hasn’t Silenced a Trump Feud” (front page, March 21), you report that Senator Mitt Romney wrote on Twitter that he couldn’t “understand why the President would, once again, disparage a man as exemplary as my friend John McCain: heroic, courageous, patriotic, honorable, self-effacing, self-sacrificing, empathetic, and driven by duty to family, country, and God.” That’s easy. John McCain was everything Donald Trump is not. John WiseGuerneville, Calif. To the Editor: President Trump’s continued assaults on Senator John McCain seven months after his death aptly remind The Times of his attacks on a Gold Star father, Khizr Khan. But the most obvious comparison is to Mr. Trump’s continued attacks on Hillary Clinton, long after he had beaten her and become president. He can’t let go of Hillary Clinton. He can’t let go of John McCain. These add more weight to the concerns that George Conway, the husband of Kellyanne Conway, has expressed about the president’s mental and emotional health. And it’s time for the Senate to step in and uphold the dignity of Mr. McCain by taking up a proposal by the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, to rename the Russell Senate Office Building (named for a mostly forgotten segregationist and white supremacist) for Mr. McCain.

2019,Opinion | Why Trump’s New Push to Kill Obamacare Is So Alarming,"It’s not just the potential damage to the health care system and the people who depend on it. It’s also the threat, in the administration’s legal logic, to the rule of law. Mr. Bagley is a professor of law at the University of Michigan Law School. Attorney General William Barr was supposed to be a voice of reason in the Trump administration. An old Washington hand, he had the stature and the backbone to protect the Justice Department from a White House that often seems to disdain the rule of law. Turns out it isn’t so. In a stunning two-sentence letter to a federal appeals court, the Justice Department announced on Monday that it would now seek the invalidation of the entire Affordable Care Act — every last one of its thousands of provisions. The irresponsibility of this new legal position is hard to overstate. It’s a shocking dereliction of the Justice Department’s duty, embraced by Republican and Democratic administrations alike, to defend acts of Congress if any plausible argument can be made in their defense. Nor is the Affordable Care Act some minor statute that can be shoved aside without disruption. It is now part of the basic plumbing of the American health care system. It guarantees protections for people with pre-existing medical conditions. It expanded Medicaid to cover 12.6 million more people, and it offers crucial protections to the 156 million Americans who get insurance through employers. Beyond that, the law forces insurers to cover preventive care and contraception without charge; changed how hospitals and physicians bill for their services; requires fast-food restaurants to post calorie counts; cut hundreds of billions of dollars of Medicare spending; imposed hundreds of billions of dollars in taxes; and much, much more. Unceremoniously ripping up the law would inflict untold harm on the health care system — and on all Americans who depend on it. Yet the Trump administration has now committed itself to doing just that. The letter was submitted in a pending case, brought by a group of red states, in which a federal judge in Texas ruled that no part of the Affordable Care Act could stand. The judge reasoned that Congress created a constitutional problem when, in its big tax reform bill in 2017, it eliminated the financial penalty for going without insurance. Because of that purported constitutional defect, the court held, the entire law had to fall. The ruling was indefensible: Legal scholars across the board criticized it as outrageous and predicted it would almost surely fall upon appeal. Indeed, even the Trump administration couldn’t bring itself to argue that the entire law should be scrapped. It agreed there was a constitutional problem, but said that the right remedy was to keep most of the law in place. Only those parts requiring private insurers to sell coverage at the same price to healthy and sick people alike — the protections for people with pre-existing conditions — would have to be struck. That, too, was an outrageous position. It flouted the Justice Department’s duty to defend, a solemn duty, and one that goes to the heart of the rule of law. Without it, the sitting administration could pick which laws it wanted to defend in the courts and which it wanted to abandon. Laws could rise or fall based on nothing more than partisan disagreement. That’s inconsistent with a constitutional system that assigns to Congress — not the president — the power to legislate. And so, at the confirmation hearing on his nomination to become attorney general, Mr. Barr said that he would review the Justice Department’s position in the Texas lawsuit. Apparently he did just that — but instead of mounting a vigorous defense, he doubled down on killing Obamacare. It’s as if Mr. Barr said to his predecessor, Jeff Sessions: “You thought your position was crazy? Hold my beer.” Does the administration really think that the very position it advanced just months ago is so untenable that it must now adopt one that is even more extreme? The shift in legal position won’t make much of a difference in the lawsuit itself. Because a group of blue states has intervened, the appeals court will hear a full-throated defense of the law. Most observers expect the court to uphold the Affordable Care Act; if so, the Supreme Court may choose not to hear the case. But the Trump administration has signaled loud and clear that its campaign against Obamacare is not over; that it will stop at nothing to achieve in court what it could not achieve in Congress; and that it doesn’t care how many people are hurt if the Affordable Care Act is undone. It has also put health care back at the center of the political conversation. Republicans already took a beating on the issue in the fall midterm elections, and Democrats, who released a bill in the House to strengthen the Affordable Care Act, want to keep running on it. They’ll be sure to remind voters of the Trump administration’s zealous commitment to taking away their health care. Along the way, the Justice Department has trashed the duty to defend. That’s not to be taken lightly. The duty is a close cousin to the president’s constitutional duty to enforce the law. If the Justice Department really thinks that Obamacare is so blatantly unconstitutional that it can’t be defended, that implies that the president is violating the Constitution whenever he applies it. It’s not hard to see that as an incipient justification for refusing to enforce any law that the president believes to be unconstitutional, however ridiculous or partisan that belief might be. Hopefully it doesn’t come to that. But the failure to defend the Affordable Care Act is an ominous sign to anyone who cares about the rule of law.

2019,Opinion | Why We Should Take Back Americans Who Fought for ISIS,"I’m an American who fought for Al Qaeda. I was captured, served time and now assist the U.S. in the war on terror. Other Western “foreign fighters” can do the same. Mr. Viñas was an American foreign fighter for Al Qaeda after Sept. 11. What do we do with Westerners who fought on behalf of, or at least traveled to and joined, the Islamic State? Some like Hoda Muthana, who left college in Alabama to join the Islamic State in Syria, have expressed the desire to return to their native country. As the Islamic State loses its last safe havens in eastern Syria and policymakers on both sides of the Atlantic confront the question of what to do with the Western “foreign fighters,” I thought I could add my voice and unique experiences to the discussion. I was the first American foreign fighter for Al Qaeda after Sept. 11. I was captured in Pakistan, turned over to United States law enforcement and brought back to New York. I served time for my actions and have tried to make amends. Others can do the same and contribute to our society and the fight against Islamic radicals — and giving them that opportunity can set a powerful example for our allies and for vulnerable people across the world. Raised on Long Island and a convert to Islam, I traveled to Pakistan and Afghanistan in the fall of 2007 at age 24 because I was opposed to America’s wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and went to defend Muslim lands from the West. It gave me a purpose, and my intention was to fight and die a martyr’s death on the battlefield as a brave Muslim warrior. After joining and fighting on behalf of some local fighting groups against American forces, I ultimately joined Al Qaeda. I was captured by Pakistani authorities in 2008 in Peshawar after training for months at Al Qaeda camps and participating in some military actions; I was subsequently turned over to American law enforcement and brought back to New York. Back in America, I ultimately made the decision to turn on my former fellow jihadists and help the United States fix, find and finish Al Qaeda leadership in Afghanistan and Pakistan. I also provided actionable intelligence to more than a dozen coalition partners. Though the federal judge who sentenced me described my cooperation as “remarkable,” I spent more than eight and a half years in federal prison; surprisingly, I can now say I am a better person because of it. This is where I think I can provide some advice. According to data tracked by the George Washington University Program on Extremism, as few as 59 Americans are known to have traveled to Syria to join the Islamic State. Moreover, President Trump has said, “The United States is asking Britain, France, Germany and other European allies to take back over 800 ISIS fighters that we captured in Syria and put them on trial.” I can say with confidence that arrest, full cooperation, contrition and the promise of rehabilitation can be a viable pathway forward for those Western foreign fighters who do not have “blood on their hands” — didn’t kill any coalition forces overseas — and are willing to admit they made mistakes and are ready to atone for them in prison. I went before the American judicial system and accepted my guilt when it came to the terrorism charges (conspiracy to murder United States nationals, providing material support to Al Qaeda and providing expert advice and assistance) against me. I also expressed my deepest apologies to the court and said that I would like “to turn a bad thing into a good thing.” There are citizens from the United States, Britain, Germany and France, men and women, who joined the Islamic State because of ideological fervor, the promise of adventure, the opportunity to create an Islamic utopia and a perceived religious obligation. It may be hard to see it this way, but they can be a strategic asset for the United States and our European partners. First, like me, they may have had an “insider view” and thus intelligence on how the Islamic State works and was organized, and maybe even leads on the whereabouts of its leadership. Second, these Westerners can provide insights on how they became radicalized and turned to extremism. And third, after they have done time in prison, thought about their decisions and made some peace with themselves about the consequences, they might even be, like me, willing to speak to vulnerable youth and impart to them their hard-earned wisdom. These former “terrorists” will have the legacy as volunteers who “went there and did it” and will be able to vouch that the experience of joining the caliphate wasn’t like the vision presented in slick videos on Twitter, Facebook and YouTube. Instead, joining a Sunni jihadist group overseas is a decision that you will have to live with for the rest of your life or will most likely be a quick trip with a dead end. But they will need some hope that there is life after terrorism. My life is good evidence that there is: Approximately a year ago, coming out of prison, I was on food stamps and unemployed. I can now report that not only am I no longer on food stamps, but I have a job and am thriving in the manufacturing industry. Moreover, I now speak to small audiences about my experiences as a former Al Qaeda member with the hope of better informing intelligence and law enforcement officials and analysts about what led me down this pathway, as well as how I deradicalized and became a contributing member of American society. The United States does not have any type of prison rehabilitation and re-entry program to prepare “formers” for life afterward with mental health services, vocational training or educational programs, but maybe I, and the few others like me who have changed our lives, can be role models for these foreign fighters. The United States can serve as an example for its allies — bring back the Americans who joined the Islamic State and let the American legal system do its work. After they serve the appropriate penalty under law for their actions, the country might even end up with a new counterterrorism resource.

2019,Why Wedding Expos Are Still a Thing,"Field Notes Charlyn Buchanan, a 32-year-old software engineer from Jersey City, stood with a flute of champagne in one hand, and in the other, her Bridelux’s itinerary that detailed upcoming speakers and showcased vendors. This was Ms. Buchanan’s first wedding expo since becoming engaged last August. Her wedding is set to take place at the end of the year, and so she was attending the expo “to gather ideas and create my own intangible vision board and see what’s out there,” she said. She was gifted the $150 entrance ticket, an unheard-of fee for an expo, which typically costs a nominal $10 to $15. In mid-January, Bridelux Atelier, a high-end bridal expo that started in London four years ago, came to the United States for the first time to showcase at the InterContinental hotel, on East 48th Street in Manhattan. Promising the cognoscente of the wedding industry while capitalizing on royal wedding fever, Bridelux brought speakers like the florist Philippa Craddock, who was involved in the wedding of Meghan Markle and Prince Harry. Among the other vendors: Claire Ptak of Violet Cakes; the celebrity event planner Bryan Rafanelli; the stationers Ceci New York; and the veil maker Monvieve Milano. Wedding expos can be found in many cities around the country. They’re often held in chain hotels like the Marriott Marquis and Grand Hyatt, as well as event and convention spaces like Palace of Fine Arts in San Francisco. Some rotate locales, others remain in the same space month after month. Wedding Salon hosts nine shows a year, setting up in Miami, Washington, Chicago and New York. The Long Island Bridal Expo does 36. Some expos are intimate, highlighting three dozen or so vendors for 150 attendees; others showcase 100 or more businesses to crowds of 600-plus. In an Instagram world, where entire weddings are booked and created completely from sources found online — yes Zola and Etsy, we know — many people may wonder how and why expos still exist. The answer is simple: They offer brides and grooms in-person contacts, not to mention prizes and swag bags stuffed with wedding items and discounts. “You’re meeting experts face to face but also are seeing their work, which can be overwhelming on the internet or misleading on someone’s website,” said Tatiana Byron Marx, who founded Wedding Salon 15 years ago. “Brides want to work with people they like. You’re hiring 15 to 40 vendors, each with their own contract. Meeting everyone at their studio is time-consuming.” Like most expos, Wedding Salon offers photographers, videographers, cake makers, florists, D.J.’s, wedding gown designers, and specialists for hair and makeup, among others. Tony Drago, who has run the Long Island Bridal Expo for 28 years, says he tries to showcase local professionals. “Brides can walk around and have true conversations without being harassed,” he said, “and there’s not 200 or 300 vendors so they don’t become numb and forget who they spoke to.” Like others, Mr. Drago makes available transportation options like limousines, buses and trolleys, along with bridal consultants, florists, stationers, table designers and party favor creators. Many expos also try to create experiences through live D.J.’s and band performances, fashion shows, even spray tanners and makeup artists. Couples can envision their first dance or a cocktail hour with sample drinks and canapés. Travel representatives from dreamy destinations are also on hand, some providing giveaways, prizes and discounts. Ms. Marx’s expos tends to skew to a more serious and higher-end consumer, with a $50 entrance fee. She says her shows now include plastic surgeons and teeth-whitening companies. “Expos are not about traditional categories anymore,” she said. During a four-hour slot, Ms. Marx can draw 800 to 1,000 people at a New York show. “These are inspirational, girls’ night out — bring your girlfriend or matron of honor and have fun,” she said. Mickael Georges, a 35-year-old-social worker from Queens, went to Bridelux with his fiancée, Alexandra Colas, 33, a nurse, for the experience. “I’ve never been to anything like this, but I wanted to get a visual of what she likes,” he said. “How can you know what something costs, and pay that much for something when you’re not sure what’s out there? This lets you see everything.” Industry professionals also attend. Julie Lindenman, 32, an event planner in Manhattan who is getting married in June, was spotted taking a lap at Bridelux. “I came to see what everyone is doing, to support my friends in the industry, but also to explore new things for my own wedding,” Ms. Lindenman said. She especially enjoyed meeting the fashion designer Reem Acra. “She inspires me in the wedding world. To meet her and see her collection in person was amazing.” Some expo promoters tour their shows like rock concerts. Bill Heaton, who has run the Great Bridal Expo for the last 38 years, kicks off his tour in Boston or New York. He then spends September through April hitting 25 to 30 cities, moving steadily across the country and ending in California’s Silicon Valley. “National vendors like Williams-Sonoma, Macy’s, Pottery Barn and Sandals, who are interested in meeting couples in every market, follow us for the entire trip,” he said. “Others, like a local wedding cake company in Dallas will only go to that stop and not Houston because they don’t ship cakes there.” Mr. Heaton estimates that 400 to 600 brides attend each show, where 50 to 80 exhibitors are presented. His charge is $10 or $12. Over the years, he’s seen an increased sophistication among brides and grooms. “The idea of the personal marketplace has always been of interest to the consumer,” he said. “The difference is that couples used to be 19 or 20, now they’re getting married at 30. They have careers. And because they’re paying for the wedding, as opposed to having their parents do it, the groom is more involved.” Expos seem great for the would-be wedded, but vendors can pay a chunk of change to be seen. Fees typically start at around $500 and can easily exceed $1,000. Ms. Marx said 50 to 60 percent of her vendors get work. “The match happens at the show, but the transaction happens after the connections and intros are made,” she said. Mr. Rafanelli, a Manhattan-based event planner featured at Bridelux, got a new client within an hour after the expo started. His fees vary, though he says his clients’ budgets typically range from $350,000 to $500,000 for the total cost of a wedding for 200 guests. “Weddings are a fairy-tale fantasy — people aren’t letting that go,” Mr. Rafanelli said. “That’s why they’re here. It boosts their confidence because they crave the ‘how can I do that’ information and visuals they learn at these events. It becomes obtainable, especially when you see everything all at once in one place. You’re drenched in it.” And it was true. By 4:30 p.m., the Bridelux ice sculpture had melted. And the model wearing a Reem Acra wedding dress was seated and taking a much-needed pause. What was left of the sushi looked a little sad. The crowd had thinned out considerably. One of the performers from the list of rotating bands was singing Tracy Chapman’s “Give Me One Reason To Stay Here.” Many attendees had found several. “This was exactly what I needed,” said Ms. Buchanan, the Jersey City software engineer, who at the end of the expo had switched from champagne to a gin and tonic. “Now I’m looking at wedding planning with a completely different attitude. I come from humble beginnings and I’ve always been a minimalist. I don’t have to bring that approach to my wedding. I’m only going to have one. I deserve this. I worked really hard, we worked hard together, and I got to see all of that today.” Read more on how to make the most of your wedding expo experience.",The New York Times
2019,Why Wendy’s Is Facing Campus Protests (It’s About the Tomatoes),"A drive in college towns aims to get the fast-food chain to follow McDonald’s and Walmart in buying tomatoes grown under strict labor standards. CreditCreditTony Cenicola/The New York Times A program created by a group that organizes farmworkers has persuaded companies like Walmart and McDonald’s to buy their tomatoes from growers who follow strict labor standards. But high-profile holdouts have threatened to halt the effort’s progress. Now the group, a nonprofit called the Coalition of Immokalee Workers, is raising pressure on one of the most prominent holdouts — Wendy’s — which it sees as an obstacle to expansion. The Immokalee workers’ initiative, called the Fair Food Program, currently benefits about 35,000 laborers, primarily in Florida. Over the last decade, it has helped transform the state’s tomato industry from one in which wage theft and violence were rampant to an industry with the some of the highest labor standards in American agriculture. “They’ve already been successful in a measurable way at effectively eliminating modern-day slavery and sexual assault, and greatly reducing harassment,” said Susan L. Marquis, dean of the Pardee RAND Graduate School in Santa Monica, Calif., who has written a book on the program. “Pay is substantially higher for these people.” But only 20 to 25 percent of tomatoes in the United States are purchased from growers that take part in the program, the organizers estimate. By late 2014, a few years after the program was up and running, Wendy’s had ceased buying winter tomatoes from Florida and was importing most of that supply from Mexican farms, where forced labor and physical abuse are common. Wendy’s said the change was unrelated to the Fair Food Program. “The smaller brands look at Wendy’s refusal to join the program and make a decision,” said Gerardo Reyes Chavez, a former farmworker who is a leader of the Coalition of Immokalee Workers. “If this is how big corporations are behaving, then it is O.K.” Under the Fair Food Program, buyers like Walmart and McDonald’s agree to pay 1 to 4 cents more per pound of tomatoes. The growers, in turn, agree to pay farmworkers at least the local minimum wage, to which the premium adds a bonus, and to meet a set of labor standards like providing shade and water for workers and ensuring freedom from physical and sexual abuse. Some of the practices are required by law but flouted on many farms. Heidi Schauer, a Wendy’s spokeswoman, said in an email that the company required its tomato suppliers to submit to third-party reviews of their human rights and labor practices. She said the chain had recently committed to buying all of its tomatoes from indoor greenhouse farms, most of them in the United States and Canada, which “strengthens our commitment to treat people with respect.” Several experts questioned the value of such reviews, which are often superficial, as well as the suggestion that greenhouse farms provide more humane work environments. “Indoor greenhouse farms are not inherently better in terms of labor conditions,” said Margaret Gray, an associate professor of political science at Adelphi University who has studied farm labor conditions. In recent weeks, activists affiliated with the Immokalee workers have stepped up pressure at several universities for Wendy’s to sign on to the Fair Food Program. The effort borrows its strategy from a campaign that student activists connected to the Immokalee workers waged against Taco Bell. Over nearly four years, supporters on several campuses persuaded officials to either remove the chain from campus or block it from doing business there in the future. In 2005, Taco Bell’s parent company agreed to buy its tomatoes through the program, becoming the first major company to sign on. Like Taco Bell, Wendy’s is potentially susceptible to protests on college campuses. A significant number of Wendy’s customers are in their teens and 20s, according to Mark Kalinowski, an industry equity analyst. One recent focus of the campaign against Wendy’s is the University of Michigan, where, according to a statement from the company in late January, its campus franchisee has chosen not to seek to renew its lease. Wendy’s later said the franchisee had made the decision a few years ago. But the announcement came just before the local City Council and the university’s student government passed resolutions advocating boycotts of Wendy’s. Last week, the Board of Aldermen of Carrboro, N.C., a town near the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, passed a resolution urging Wendy’s to join the Fair Food Program. And the mayor of Gainesville, home to the University of Florida, has placed a similar resolution on the agenda of a City Commission meeting this week. In an interview, the mayor, Lauren Poe, said that he intended the resolution as a way of supporting farmworkers, not opposing the university, but that he hoped the school would ban the Wendy’s that operated on campus until the company joined the Fair Food Program. The actions coincided with a series of demonstrations organized by the Coalition of Immokalee Workers, whose members are descending on the universities of North Carolina, Michigan and Florida and Ohio State University this week and next. On Tuesday, scores of students and other supporters gathered in front of an administration building at the University of North Carolina, where several speakers, including the human rights activist Kerry Kennedy, implored the school to oust Wendy’s from campus. Officials at the University of North Carolina and the University of Florida say the Wendy’s on their campuses obtain their tomatoes through another company, Aramark, which takes part in the Fair Food Program. While Wendy’s is the immediate target, there are other big companies refusing the Immokalee group’s demands, including Costco and the grocery chains Publix and Kroger. None of those companies responded to a request for comment, but a statement on the Publix website says that the chain regards the campaign as a labor dispute between its suppliers and their employees and that it is “not our place” to get involved. Unless more companies commit to buying tomatoes through the Fair Food Program, growers who haven’t joined will continue to have a market for their products and may not feel pressure to raise their labor standards. “I’m sure there are people that look at all of us who did join the program and viewed it as an opportunity to go do business with brands that didn’t want to sign up,” said Jon Esformes, chief executive of Sunripe Certified Brands, which grows tomatoes in Florida, Georgia and Virginia. Sunripe agreed to join the program in 2010. Like other growers in the program, it must show new workers a video about their labor rights and let the Immokalee group provide education sessions for workers at least once per season. Workers are urged to report abuses to a 24-hour hotline, which is monitored by an independent council that investigates complaints. The council also regularly audits farms for compliance. Fair Food auditors interview at least half the workers on a farm — often hundreds of them — which is far more than conventional auditors typically interview. Growers found to have violated the program’s code of conduct can lose access to buyers. The stakes go far beyond tomatoes. In the coming years, the Immokalee workers hope to bring their model to a variety of crops in many states, where tens of thousands of workers are still vulnerable to abuses. But to do so effectively, said James Brudney, a law professor at Fordham University who has studied farm labor, it is important to show buyers and growers that they can’t avoid taking part in the long run. “They want to be able to make clear that this is a serious market penetration,” Mr. Brudney said.",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | Why White People Need Blackface,"THE STONE To understand this degrading practice, we must examine the white face that refuses to see itself in its own monstrous creations. Mr. Yancy is a philosophy professor and author. In his memoir “Black Boy,” Richard Wright expresses his dismay that white America would continue to fail to understand what it means to be black in America because it “will take a bigger and tougher America than any we have yet known.” I, along with many others, share Wright’s dismay. We have not seen much evidence of that bigger and tougher America when it comes to seriously and collectively interrogating white racism in this country. The recent scandals over prominent whites donning blackface provided a reminder of this failure. Gov. Ralph Northam of Virginia apologized for appearing in a photo in his 1984 medical school yearbook of two students, one in blackface and one wearing Ku Klux Klan “regalia,” and admitted to darkening his face to look like Michael Jackson when he went to a dance party. Similarly, Florida State Representative Anthony Sabatini, while a sophomore in high school, donned blackface, replete with a do-rag, gold chains, sunglasses and a New York Yankees cap. As of this writing, both Sabatini and Northam have refused to resign from their political offices. After these incidents became public, I saw and heard white pundits and commentators condemn these individual cases and persons. This is certainly reasonable. There isn’t much dispute over the racist history and nature of blackface. Condemnation is a sign of greater awareness about this hurtful, racist practice, but it is also a way of distancing: By attributing blackface to a few “bad apples,” they fail to treat this as a teachable moment about the deeply ingrained nature of white American racism. They also ignore the degree to which blackface is actually little more than a perverse expression of whiteness. To face blackface, as it were, head-on, we must address the structure of whiteness that drives it. Blackface is a performance historically grounded in white supremacy and as such, an act of epistemological and ontological terror. In other words, blackface is a form of “white knowing” (in reality, of white unknowing), of white projection, and of stipulating through performance of what it means to be black by way of lies about what it means to be white. Hence, to understand blackface, we must return to the white face that refuses to see itself in its own monstrous creations. Blackface is a product of a long history of whiteness and its attempt to make sense of itself through both the consumption and the negation of black humanity. It speaks to the parasitic nature of whiteness and its need to “feed.” After all, whiteness, in its colonial expression, must consume and yet exclude that which is other, that which is black. Understanding blackface in this way can be an important step toward starving whiteness of its need for the “other,” its need to be what it is not, its need to masquerade, its need to project — or in its root meaning, to “throw forth” — its lies onto the black body and to pretend as if the black body has always been the site of those projections. Blackface also echoes the pain and suffering felt by black people whose bodies and identities underwent transmogrification, where they were rendered grotesque and bizarre, defined by ugly white myths. White American blackface was a grotesque extension of minstrelsy from the Middle Ages, where servant-performers, as Anthony Appiah and Henry Louis Gates state, “entertained their patrons by playing music, singing, telling stories, juggling, or performing comic antics and buffoonery.” Within the white American antebellum context and after, anti-blackness was at the very heart of white blackface minstrelsy. The black body functioned as the repulsive and revolting object of white disgust, with whites “throwing forth” their hatred and lies onto what they themselves had created. White American blackface performers engaged in exaggerated and distorted gestures, warped dialect and racist clowning, all creations of the white American imaginary. As white performers blackened their faces with burnt cork, re-presented the black body in caricatured, silly, ersatz, inferior, horrible, and damnable ways, they were able to mark black bodies publicly as appallingly stupid and subhuman. Within this racist construction, though, white bodies remained “normative,” “intelligent,” “civil,” “nonthreatening,” engaging in “mere entertainment” and they implicitly and explicitly reinforced deeply problematic and false “racial differences” between black and white bodies. As the scholar Ronald L. Jackson argues, “The darkened face, created from the moistened debris of burnt and crushed champagne corks, insolently signified that Whites did not want to see Blacks for who they really were culturally, but, instead, … an iconographic image, a scripted racial body inscribed with meanings and messages Whites enjoyed seeing, ones that were self-affirming and insular.” On this score, American whiteness embodied and embodies an epistemological and ontological divide that it takes as “normative,” as “common sense.” And it tells a self-redeeming and self-congratulatory history that is itself indicative of white power and privilege. As the feminist and white anti-racist activist Peggy McIntosh writes, “When I am told about national heritage or about ‘civilization,’ I am shown that people of my [white] race made it what it is.” At the base of this narrative history are lies and distortions; indeed, more broadly, there is an entire underside of white modernity that consists of enslaved and dehumanized black bodies and often forgotten indigenous bodies across the Americas that were brutally slaughtered and decimated. To use the poet and theorist Vincent Woodard’s terms, blackface in particular can be described as an expression of “consumption rituals” and “consumption practices.” In short, the black body and bodies of color are the subject of white consumption. To conjure the performance of blackface, whites had to engage in a magical trick that involved profound self-deception. White theatrical spaces of blackface performance were forged to confirm the “truth” that white gazes beheld. White people gathered within such spaces to have their worldview proven beyond a doubt. White audiences, through their attendance and their laughter, helped to “validate” the white racist distortions as true. They laughed at those who were deemed fundamentally different from themselves, and that laugher helped to sustain the illusions they had projected, their creations, their myths, authored by an arrogant white race who dared to assume they knew black people better than black people knew themselves. Imagine whites in blackface on the stage: The actor “throws forth” all of the lies and distortions onto the black body. Here is where the combined performance displays a kind of consumptive process. The whites in the audience embrace and internalize the projections. They accept the putrid lies — the happy “darky,” the black “idiot,” the inferior “nigger”— that fill them with self-certainty about their “superior” status. They deny that they have created these lies and that denial sustains their white “purity” and “innocence.” Black people are not the horrible and derogatory racist myths that so many white people have depicted, whether through blackface or other white American pastimes. I know who I am. Blackface tells me absolutely nothing about myself, but it does tell me about whiteness, and its grotesque projections. But what if blackface reveals something far too weighty and threatening for white America, something that would require a bigger and tougher America to confront? What if blackface is clear evidence of the emptiness of whiteness, the hollowness of its being as an identity marker? Blackface is not a black problem. It is a white one, and fixing it is the job of white America. In her book “Dismantling Privilege: An Ethics of Accountability,” the religion scholar Mary Elizabeth Hobgood writes, “For whites to construct an identity outside the racist construct, we would need to give up our socially constructed white selves and embrace the rejected parts of our humanity that requires scapegoats.” I couldn’t agree more. Blackface is the white man’s burden, not ours. George Yancy is professor of philosophy at Emory University.

2019,Why Would an Animal Trade One Body for Another?,"matter Most species undergo metamorphosis, but scientists aren’t sure why the process evolved. One new theory: Metamorphosis gives animals greater access to food. As a child growing up in the Netherlands, Hanna ten Brink spent many days lingering by a pond in her family’s garden, fascinated by metamorphosis. Tadpoles hatched from eggs in the pond and swam about, sucking tiny particles of food into their mouths. After a few weeks, the tadpoles lost their tails, sprouted legs and hopped onto land, where they could catch insects with their new tongues. Eventually Dr. ten Brink became an evolutionary biologist. Now science has brought her back to that childhood fascination. Eighty percent of all animal species experience metamorphosis — from frogs to flatfish to butterflies to jellyfish. Scientists are deeply puzzled as to how it became so common. What evolutionary path could lead to a caterpillar — an admirably adapted leaf-eating machine — to tear down its body and rebuild it as a butterfly? In the May issue of American Naturalist, Dr. ten Brink, now a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Zurich, and her colleagues lay out a road map for the evolution of metamorphosis. It has appeared, they argue, as a way for a species to eat more food. The path to that feast is hard to travel, and metamorphosis has only arisen a few times in history. But once it does, the scientists also find, it rarely disappears. Dr. ten Brink, Andre M. de Roos of the University of Amsterdam, and Ulf Dieckmann of the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Austria created complex mathematical equations that captured some of the fundamentals of animal life — how much food they eat, how fast they grow, how many offspring they had and so on. The researchers began by considering animals that didn’t go through metamorphosis. Keeping the same body through their lives, they are well adapted to one kind of food. But what if their environment contained a second food, one that they could consume as adults if they evolved a different anatomy? Natural selection would prevent the animals from adding the second food to their diet, the researchers found. In this case, evolution favors specialists: If animals evolve to eat the second food, their offspring will become worse at consuming the original diet when they’re young. More of them will die before they can mature. “The obvious solution to the problem is to evolve metamorphosis,” said Dr. ten Brink. Young animals stay well adapted to the original food, while adults switch to the new food with a rebuilt body. But animals pay a steep price to go through metamorphosis. They burn a lot of calories to tear apart the old anatomy and develop a new one. There’s a chance that this complicated process will go awry, leaving them with defects. Metamorphosis also takes time, leaving animals vulnerable to predators and parasites. In many cases, Dr. ten Brink and her colleagues found, the cost of metamorphosis is too high for it to be favored by natural selection. “You have to get back something really good,” she said. Natural selection will favor metamorphosis if adult animals are rewarded with an abundant supply of food — enough to make up for the cost and to allow them to have lots of offspring. In early stages of this shift, the adults will start out poorly adapted to the new food. But there’s so much for them to eat that they still get a decent meal. “I like the concept — I like that they tried to look for the ultimate cause,” said Joanna Wolfe, a postdoctoral researcher at Harvard. But she wondered if food is the only reward that can help drive the evolution of metamorphosis. Some species might benefit in other ways. Adults might take on bodies that allowed them to find mates more successfully, for instance. Larvae in the ocean might change their forms in order to be carried far away by the currents, expanding their range. “I would like to see some things added to their model,” she said. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] Dr. ten Brink agreed that the new study is a foundation for more detailed ones. “This paper is really the start of something,” she said. If animals so rarely evolve metamorphosis, why is it so common? One reason may be that once metamorphosis arises, it’s very hard for a species to lose it. It’s easy enough to imagine a situation where giving up metamorphosis would be a benefit. Imagine an outbreak wiping out the food that adults eat. For the species, it would be advantageous for individuals to remain larval and survive on what food remains. But in most situations, Dr. ten Brink’s study suggests, evolution works against our expectations. If the adult food gets harder to find, natural selection will favor adults that do a better job of finding what little food is left. “It’s an evolutionary trap,” said Dr. ten Brink. “If conditions get really bad, you go extinct.” Vincent Laudet, a biologist at Pierre and Marie Curie University in Paris, said his own research on vertebrates supported Dr. ten Brink’s findings. The first fish species went through metamorphosis, he noted, and it has largely endured for over half a billion years. “In some vertebrates, metamorphosis is camouflaged, but it is never lost,” Dr. Laudet said. When Dr. Laudet speaks of “some vertebrates,” he includes us. When babies leave the womb, their tissues undergo important changes, governed by some of the same hormones that spark metamorphosis in frogs and other animals. “Our birth, biologically speaking, is a metamorphosis,” Dr. Laudet said.",The New York Times
2019,Why You Procrastinate (It Has Nothing to Do With Self-Control),"If procrastination isn’t about laziness, then what is it about? If you’ve ever put off an important task by, say, alphabetizing your spice drawer, you know it wouldn’t be fair to describe yourself as lazy. After all, alphabetizing requires focus and effort — and hey, maybe you even went the extra mile to wipe down each bottle before putting it back. And it’s not like you’re hanging out with friends or watching Netflix. You’re cleaning — something your parents would be proud of! This isn’t laziness or bad time management. This is procrastination. Etymologically, “procrastination” is derived from the Latin verb procrastinare — to put off until tomorrow. But it’s more than just voluntarily delaying. Procrastination is also derived from the ancient Greek word akrasia — doing something against our better judgment. “It’s self-harm,” said Dr. Piers Steel, a professor of motivational psychology at the University of Calgary and the author of “The Procrastination Equation: How to Stop Putting Things Off and Start Getting Stuff Done.” That self-awareness is a key part of why procrastinating makes us feel so rotten. When we procrastinate, we’re not only aware that we’re avoiding the task in question, but also that doing so is probably a bad idea. And yet, we do it anyway. “This is why we say that procrastination is essentially irrational,” said Dr. Fuschia Sirois, professor of psychology at the University of Sheffield. “It doesn’t make sense to do something you know is going to have negative consequences.” She added: “People engage in this irrational cycle of chronic procrastination because of an inability to manage negative moods around a task.” In short: yes. Procrastination isn’t a unique character flaw or a mysterious curse on your ability to manage time, but a way of coping with challenging emotions and negative moods induced by certain tasks — boredom, anxiety, insecurity, frustration, resentment, self-doubt and beyond. “Procrastination is an emotion regulation problem, not a time management problem,” said Dr. Tim Pychyl, professor of psychology and member of the Procrastination Research Group at Carleton University in Ottawa. In a 2013 study, Dr. Pychyl and Dr. Sirois found that procrastination can be understood as “the primacy of short-term mood repair … over the longer-term pursuit of intended actions.” Put simply, procrastination is about being more focused on “the immediate urgency of managing negative moods” than getting on with the task, Dr. Sirois said. The particular nature of our aversion depends on the given task or situation. It may be due to something inherently unpleasant about the task itself — having to clean a dirty bathroom or organizing a long, boring spreadsheet for your boss. But it might also result from deeper feelings related to the task, such as self-doubt, low self-esteem, anxiety or insecurity. Staring at a blank document, you might be thinking, I’m not smart enough to write this. Even if I am, what will people think of it? Writing is so hard. What if I do a bad job? All of this can lead us to think that putting the document aside and cleaning that spice drawer instead is a pretty good idea. [Like what you’re reading? Sign up here for the Smarter Living newsletter to get stories like this (and much more!) delivered straight to your inbox every Monday morning.] But, of course, this only compounds the negative associations we have with the task, and those feelings will still be there whenever we come back to it, along with increased stress and anxiety, feelings of low self-esteem and self-blame. In fact, there’s an entire body of research dedicated to the ruminative, self-blaming thoughts many of us tend to have in the wake of procrastination, which are known as “procrastinatory cognitions.” The thoughts we have about procrastination typically exacerbate our distress and stress, which contribute to further procrastination, Dr. Sirois said. But the momentary relief we feel when procrastinating is actually what makes the cycle especially vicious. In the immediate present, putting off a task provides relief — “you’ve been rewarded for procrastinating,” Dr. Sirois said. And we know from basic behaviorism that when we’re rewarded for something, we tend to do it again. This is precisely why procrastination tends not to be a one-off behavior, but a cycle, one that easily becomes a chronic habit. Over time, chronic procrastination has not only productivity costs, but measurably destructive effects on our mental and physical health, including chronic stress, general psychological distress and low life satisfaction, symptoms of depression and anxiety, poor health behaviors, chronic illness and even hypertension and cardiovascular disease. If it seems ironic that we procrastinate to avoid negative feelings, but end up feeling even worse, that’s because it is. And once again, we have evolution to thank. Procrastination is a perfect example of present bias, our hard-wired tendency to prioritize short-term needs ahead of long-term ones. “We really weren’t designed to think ahead into the further future because we needed to focus on providing for ourselves in the here and now,” said psychologist Dr. Hal Hershfield, a professor of marketing at the U.C.L.A. Anderson School of Management. Dr. Hershfield’s research has shown that, on a neural level, we perceive our “future selves” more like strangers than as parts of ourselves. When we procrastinate, parts of our brains actually think that the tasks we’re putting off — and the accompanying negative feelings that await us on the other side — are somebody else’s problem. To make things worse, we’re even less able to make thoughtful, future-oriented decisions in the midst of stress. When faced with a task that makes us feel anxious or insecure, the amygdala — the “threat detector” part of the brain — perceives that task as a genuine threat, in this case to our self-esteem or well-being. Even if we intellectually recognize that putting off the task will create more stress for ourselves in the future, our brains are still wired to be more concerned with removing the threat in the present. Researchers call this “amygdala hijack.” Unfortunately, we can’t just tell ourselves to stop procrastinating. And despite the prevalence of “productivity hacks,” focusing on the question of how to get more work done doesn’t address the root cause of procrastination. We must realize that, at its core, procrastination is about emotions, not productivity. The solution doesn’t involve downloading a time management app or learning new strategies for self-control. It has to do with managing our emotions in a new way. “Our brains are always looking for relative rewards. If we have a habit loop around procrastination but we haven’t found a better reward, our brain is just going to keep doing it over and over until we give it something better to do,” said psychiatrist and neuroscientist Dr. Judson Brewer, Director of Research and Innovation at Brown University’s Mindfulness Center. To rewire any habit, we have to give our brains what Dr. Brewer called the “Bigger Better Offer” or “B.B.O.” In the case of procrastination, we have to find a better reward than avoidance — one that can relieve our challenging feelings in the present moment without causing harm to our future selves. The difficulty with breaking the addiction to procrastination in particular is that there is an infinite number of potential substitute actions that would still be forms of procrastination, Dr. Brewer said. That’s why the solution must therefore be internal, and not dependent on anything but ourselves. One option is to forgive yourself in the moments you procrastinate. In a 2010 study, researchers found that students who were able to forgive themselves for procrastinating when studying for a first exam ended up procrastinating less when studying for their next exam. They concluded that self-forgiveness supported productivity by allowing “the individual to move past their maladaptive behavior and focus on the upcoming examination without the burden of past acts.” Another tactic is the related practice of self-compassion, which is treating ourselves with kindness and understanding in the face of our mistakes and failures. In a 2012 study examining the relationship between stress, self-compassion and procrastination, Dr. Sirois found that procrastinators tend to have high stress and low self-compassion, suggesting that self-compassion provides “a buffer against negative reactions to self-relevant events.” In fact, several studies show that self-compassion supports motivation and personal growth. Not only does it decrease psychological distress, which we now know is a primary culprit for procrastination, it also actively boosts motivation, enhances feelings of self-worth and fosters positive emotions like optimism, wisdom, curiosity and personal initiative. Best of all, self-compassion doesn’t require anything external — just a commitment to meeting your challenges with greater acceptance and kindness rather than rumination and regret. That may be easier said than done, but try to reframe the task by considering a positive aspect of it. Perhaps you remind yourself of a time you did something similar and it turned out O.K. Or maybe you think about the beneficial outcome of completing the task. What might your boss or partner say when you show them your finished work? How will you feel about yourself? Cultivate curiosity: If you’re feeling tempted to procrastinate, bring your attention to the sensations arising in your mind and body. What feelings are eliciting your temptation? Where do you feel them in your body? What do they remind you of? What happens to the thought of procrastinating as you observe it? Does it intensify? Dissipate? Cause other emotions to arise? How are the sensations in your body shifting as you continue to rest your awareness on them? Consider the next action: This is different than the age-old advice to break up a task you’re tempted to avoid into bite-sized chunks. According to Dr. Pychyl, focusing only on the “next action” helps calm our nerves, and it allows for what Dr. Pychyl called “a layer of self-deception.” At the start of a given task, you can consider the next action as a mere possibility, as if you were method acting: “What’s the next action I’d take on this if I were going to do it, even though I’m not?” Maybe you would open your email. Or perhaps you would put the date at the top of your document. Don’t wait to be in the mood to do a certain task. “Motivation follows action. Get started, and you’ll find your motivation follows,” Dr. Pychyl said. Make your temptations more inconvenient: It’s still easier to change our circumstances than ourselves, said Gretchen Rubin, author of “Better Than Before: What I Learned About Making and Breaking Habits.” According to Ms. Rubin, we can take what we know about procrastination and “use it to our advantage” by placing obstacles between ourselves and our temptations to induce a certain degree of frustration or anxiety. If you compulsively check social media, delete those apps from your phone or “give yourself a really complicated password with not just five digits, but 12,” Ms. Rubin said. By doing this, you’re adding friction to the procrastination cycle and making the reward value of your temptation less immediate. On the other side of the coin, Ms. Rubin also suggested that we make the things we want to do as easy as possible for ourselves. If you want to go to the gym before work but you’re not a morning person, sleep in your exercise clothes. “Try to remove every, every, every roadblock,” Ms. Rubin said. Still, procrastination is deeply existential, as it raises questions about individual agency and how we want to spend our time as opposed to how we actually do. But it’s also a reminder of our commonality — we’re all vulnerable to painful feelings, and most of us just want to be happy with the choices we make. Now go finish up alphabetizing that spice drawer before it becomes your next procrastination albatross.

2019,Opinion | Why You Want to Eat This Baby Up: It’s Science,"Opinion Researchers are beginning to ask why some people want to squeeze puppies and others want to sniff babies. CreditCreditIllustrations by Alvaro Dominguez; Photographs by JGI/Jamie Grill, Alfred Pasieka/Science Photo Library, Emmanuelle Bonzami/EyeEm, and Filo, via Getty Images Contributing Opinion Writer One night back in the 1990s, I dreamed that I’d been stabbed in the stomach. When I bolted awake, pain sent me hurtling to the bathroom where I threw up. It felt as if a creature inside my belly was trying to claw its way out. When I was about 10 years old, I announced to my father that I had decided never to have kids. Dad said, “You’ll change your mind.” But I didn’t, and now, at 30 years old, I had an un-baby growing inside me — an ovarian cyst the size of a grapefruit that, doctors warned me, could at any time rupture and fill my abdomen with blood and pus. I was fast-tracked for an operation and paired with the first surgeon available in my insurance network, on a kind of terrible blind date. “You probably want to know how much weight you’re going to lose when we remove the cyst; women always want to know,” he said. That’s when I allowed myself to loathe him. After the procedure, the surgeon told me that the ovary he had removed contained some worrisome cells that might someday evolve into cancer. He said that after another year or two, I should consider getting “cleaned out.” It took me a minute to understand what he meant. Even though I didn't actually have cancer, he was suggesting a full hysterectomy. “You don’t have to get the procedure right away,” he said. “You could wait. That would give you time to complete your family.” “Complete my what?” I said. He spoke slowly, as if to someone with brain damage. “You need to get pregnant right away and have all your children now.” By “family” he meant kids and a husband, possibly also a Volvo. But for me “family” was my menagerie of eccentric friends — ’zine makers, puppeteers, indie-rock roadies, the seven roommates who shared my house, the boyfriend who slept on his mom’s couch. My first thought was, “How dare he?” My panic was primal — I wanted to hit him, or claw out his eyes. I felt more horrified by the prospect of being pregnant than of having a hysterectomy. I splurged on a second opinion from a top doctor who said that there was no reason for a hysterectomy. But he, too, suggested that if I wanted children, I should hurry. “I have zero desire for kids,” I said. It was in that moment that I knew for sure that I’d always felt this way and always would. If not for my precarious reproductive situation, I probably would have pretended to be ambivalent about kids for 10 more years. I would have told people, “I’m not sure. I’ll decide later.” But now there was no later. So I “came out” to everyone. My boyfriend — who wanted to be a father — dumped me. My mother screamed at me, then mourned. And some friends grew distant. They couldn’t understand. And the truth is, I couldn’t either. Why are most people born with the urge that drives them to have children and others, like me, not? I began to wonder if science had an answer. First, though, I had to learn how other people felt. Because I’d never experienced so much as a pang of baby hunger, I believed this emotion was just an invention — some myth that the patriarchy created to keep women down. My friends set me straight. Several told me, “Actually, baby hunger’s a real thing.” Women and men described the way an infant’s face peeking out of a stroller had forced them to reckon with a keening desire. Soon some of those friends were dads and moms. Like Mary. Back in college, she and I played in a garage band together and shared a pair of white go-go boots. But then something sent us hurtling down different paths. One day, she placed her first baby in my arms and instructed me to sniff the little boy’s head. “You’ve got to smell this,” she said. “It’s like a drug.” I sniffed obediently and said, “I’m not getting anything” — which was my polite way of saying that actually I detected the tang of spit-up. Mary was stumped. “Really? You don’t smell that? It’s like baking bread, but a thousand times better.” [Never be uninteresting. Read the most thought-provoking, funny, delightful and raw stories from The New York Times Opinion section.] She would end up having nine children. And I would have none. We’ve become used to thinking about sexual desire on a spectrum — from heterosexual to homosexual, with lots of people falling somewhere in between. Might there be a reproductive-desire spectrum too? Over the past decade, I’ve been hunting through the scientific literature for answers. And I haven’t found much of anything. Reproductive desire seems like a big subject to have been bypassed by researchers. Perhaps there’s a simple explanation: For most of human history, people — women especially — haven’t had a choice about whether they wanted to become parents. Maybe it was easiest to assume that everyone simply wanted a baby. But as birthrates decline in every developed country, it’s clear that’s not the case. Recently a new window has opened up onto our reproductive desires. And it has to do with, of all things, how we perceive cuteness. Anyone who has been on the internet lately knows that cuteness can get weird: lemurs with Keane-painting eyes, infants dressed as peapods, cats with toast on their heads. The internet offers up achingly sweet “cute porn” because those images grab our attention. There’s something almost aggressive about the way we crave cuteness. Several years ago, the actress Leslie Bibb perched next to Conan O’Brien’s desk and riffed about a baby so cute that it drove her crazy. She pantomimed her extreme reaction to the infant by gritting her teeth and clenching her fists. A social psychologist named Oriana Aragón, who was then teaching at Yale, happened to be watching. In the days that followed, she found herself pondering a subject that doesn’t usually receive much attention from the scientific community: cuteness. Dr. Aragón realized that feelings of tenderness can be so overwhelming that they spill over into a behavior that she calls “cute aggression.” An example, she told me, is “when you see a grandparent pinching a baby’s cheeks and saying, ‘I want to eat you up.’” In fact, sometimes baby-talk can sound downright serial-killer-ish if you take it out of context. You might find yourself telling a puppy that you want to squish it — even though, of course, you’re doing just the opposite and gently caressing it. Dr. Aragón and her colleagues at Yale undertook what are probably the world’s first attempts to scientifically prove the existence of cute aggression. In an adorable experiment, she and her research partners handed volunteers bubble wrap, then showed them a parade of images. Dr. Aragón found that people popped more bubbles when looking at, say, a photo of a kitten than of an adult cat — suggesting that the cutest images do seem to prompt the urge to crush or squeeze. Because the cute-overload feeling lends itself to study, it may help to reveal the parts of our minds devoted to nurturing that have heretofore been hidden. Katherine Stavropoulos, a neuroscientist and clinical psychologist at the University of California at Riverside, has conducted a study on the neural circuitry that is active during cuteness-overload. She asked volunteers to wear caps outfitted with sensors that measure brain activity, and then showed them images of wee little animals. Her results suggested that “cute-aggression” involves the reward system in the brain. In other words, it feels good. But why? “It’s just a completely open question,” Dr. Aragón, who now works at Clemson, told me. Even so, she points out, it’s reasonable to assume that our extreme reaction to cuteness is evolution’s way of making sure that parents do the relentless work of nurturing children. To perpetuate the species, parents must feel driven to hold their babies for hours — and that might explain why the urge to squeeze gets mixed into a cocktail of tender emotions. Now Dr. Stavropoulos hopes to explore whether the brains of parents and childless people react differently to cuteness. She told me she has noticed that her friends who experienced cute-overload around infants seemed to be the ones who hurried to have babies. She herself has no children — at least not yet. “I always thought babies were adorable and sweet,” she said, “but was never overwhelmed by the positive feelings.” It’s dogs that drive her cute-crazy. “Round, floppy puppies that look like cotton balls,” she told me. “I feel like I want to squeeze them until they want to pop — but, of course, I don’t really want them to pop.” This made me realize that I have my own peculiar trigger. When my dog, Sonny, sprawls on the floor, I will massage the soft flesh of her belly and tell her how I’d like to eat her stomach with a spoon because it’s like pudding. Which is weird. But here’s something even weirder: I love to smell her paws. When I confessed this to Dr. Stavropoulos, she said, “I’m happy you brought that up.” She said that she, too, likes to smell her dogs’ paws. The aroma reminds her of corn chips, and like me, she finds it to be “cutest smell ever,” even though this makes no sense at all because “objectively, what’s cute about the smell of a Frito?” Our conversation reminded me of my friend Mary, who adores the smell of a baby’s head. Am I feeling the same thing when I huff my dog’s paws? Science has no answer to this — yet. But maybe this is beginning to change. For the most part, people like me are invisible. We’re rarely studied or quantified. There is a medical term, tokophobia, for women who are terrified by pregnancy. But such women, when they’re discussed at all, tend to be characterized as damaged and in need of fixing. The thing is, many of us don’t want to be fixed. On Reddit, I found a discussion thread called “child-free as a kind of gender or identity issue?"" Commenters on it reported feeling that they couldn’t change and wouldn’t want to. “It’s just who I am,” ran one comment. “From the time that I can remember, I was given baby dolls and I refused to play with them.” The writer added that she had always felt “that I am just not supposed to be someone’s mom” and compared that feeling to “being gay or transgender.” How many of us feel born not to be parents? It may seem as if we’re outliers, but polls suggest that about one-sixth of people of reproductive age aren’t sure that they want children. Many of those people are probably less indecisive than they admit. Few women are willing to declare, “Yeah, put me down as someone who definitely will never have kids.” I know from experience just how hard it can be to say those words out loud. It's so much easier to describe yourself as undecided. Still, around the world, women are quietly opting out. Nearly half of the world’s countries now have fertility rates below the level needed to maintain their population size. In the United States, births are at their lowest level in 30 years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The authors of a new book, “Empty Planet,” are going so far as to warn that the world population will start dropping by midcentury. “Once that decline begins,” they write, “it will never end.” When scholars discuss these statistics, they usually observe the link between the birthrate and female empowerment: Women who have access to birth control, education and self-determination tend to have fewer children. But we rarely talk about the women who — once they’re free to decide — decide to have no children at all. Is this an expression of practical concerns or inborn wiring? The truth is, we just don’t know. Inside millions of minds are fears and yearnings that we still don’t understand. And those feelings will shape the future of humanity.

2019,Why a Big Tech Breakup Looks Better to Washington,"SAN FRANCISCO — A decade ago, when the greed and carelessness of the financial industry came close to destroying the American economy, the overwhelming response by politicians and the public was: Meh. Almost instantly, all was forgiven and forgotten. Now the tech industry — which, among other impressive innovations, provides the world’s knowledge on demand, lets people freely broadcast their diverse opinions and has made shopping as easy as pushing a button — has made some mistakes of its own. It has abused privacy, squeezed the competition and casually spread hate. And that’s just the beginning of the list. Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple might not get away as cleanly as Goldman Sachs and Citigroup. Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, released proposals this month that would force tech breakups and impose severe restrictions on what remained. Another Democratic presidential candidate, Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, covered more briefly some of the same ground, saying, “We have a major monopoly problem.” At a moment when nearly everything in America seems wildly contentious, antitrust action against tech is getting a sober look. Antitrust is the nuclear bomb of regulatory policy, but the reaction to Ms. Warren’s and Ms. Klobuchar’s ideas was surprisingly receptive. “We’ve got to break these guys apart,” Ms. Warren said in an interview on “Face the Nation.” The show could name only one critic of her proposal: Howard Schultz, the Starbucks mogul, who is flirting with an independent run for president to the deep disregard of voters. “A billionaire, right?” Ms. Warren noted. For decades, a politician who mentioned “antitrust” was essentially arguing for more government oversight, which has been dangerous territory at least since the Ronald Reagan administration. “Antitrust” was relegated to the shelf with “socialism” and “wealth inequality” and “higher taxes for higher incomes.” It didn’t help that what could be called “maximum antitrust” — when the Justice Department decides a company is abusing its monopoly power and should be broken up — has a mixed history. The government dropped such a case against IBM in 1982 after more than a decade. It settled its case against Microsoft in 2001. Only AT&T, which agreed in 1982 to dissolve itself into a long-distance company and the seven Baby Bells, could be considered an unqualified success from the government’s point of view. The political landscape is shifting, however, at a speed that dumbfounds even antitrust experts. President Barack Obama thought of the tech companies in the way they think of themselves: as progressive, smart entrepreneurs who want what’s best for America. His administration declined to pursue Google on antitrust charges and hired from the tech industry for top posts. Top staff members later went to work for the tech industry in top posts, too. It was a cozy relationship. “Something has definitely changed,” said Geoffrey A. Manne, the founder of the International Center for Law and Economics, a think tank in Portland, Ore. “Most voters are very fond of Amazon, Apple, Google and even Facebook. But I think there’s also a growing sense of skepticism about all these companies. The shine has come off.” Mr. Manne, who has been a critic of the antitrust arguments against Google and has received funding from the search giant as well as from some of its competitors, including Comcast and AT&T, eviscerated Ms. Warren’s proposal with his colleague Alec Stapp in a recent blog post. They wrote that the senator’s plan to turn the top companies into heavily regulated “platform utilities” would make them as resistant to improvement as sewer systems or Amtrak. And yet, Mr. Manne conceded in an interview, increased regulation is an idea whose time may have come. “There is a long history in America — just not a recent one — of using the power of the state to counteract the economic power of private enterprise,” he said. “We may be at that moment again.” The financial firms were predatory last decade, exploiting weak spots in the mortgage markets in a way that undermined their viability. Google and Facebook, by contrast, offer their services for free, while Amazon built its reputation on selling as cheaply as possible. That makes it hard to regulate them by the antitrust consensus, which for a couple of decades has held that there is no injury unless consumers directly suffer by paying higher prices. Nothing is ever really free, of course, and there has been a dawning realization among some consumers that they are paying for these services with information about themselves. How most users feel about this seems up in the air, as evidenced by a new SurveyMonkey poll done for the news site Axios. The headline finding was that “a growing majority now views our online privacy as a crisis.” But deeper in the survey was the revelation that more than half the respondents said they were unwilling to pay to keep from being tracked by a service they were using. Twenty-one percent said they would pay less than $1 a month, and no more, for the right. Users, it seems, want it both ways: privacy and free services. This is the contradiction at the heart of the internet. Daniel Crane, an antitrust expert at the University of Michigan, said Ms. Warren’s proposal might be a hard sell to voters. “The median consumer probably feels that she gets lots of free goodies from Big Tech and will worry about what it would mean to go after them,” he said. But Mr. Crane noted that being broken up was the least of the companies’ worries. “A likelier consequence is that the next acquisition they want to make will be rejected,” he said. “Even just the rhetoric can complicate their lives and put pressure going forward.” That is already happening. One of the anti-competitive complaints about Amazon is that it prohibited its merchants from selling more cheaply elsewhere. That prevented a new platform from underselling Amazon and gaining a competitive edge. Amazon ended this practice in Europe six years ago, but it continued in the United States. Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut, asked for regulators to investigate in December. Last week, Amazon confirmed that it had dropped the requirement. Antitrust talk emboldens competitors as well. Google controls much of the market for online ads in Australia, just as it does elsewhere. That presents a big problem for News Corporation, which owns eight of the 10 largest papers in the country. The Rupert Murdoch-controlled media conglomerate asked Australian regulators last week to take the “very serious step” of breaking up Google in the country because of the “unparalleled power that it currently exerts over news publishers and advertisers alike.” In this new environment, winning can soon look a lot like losing. Amazon opposed a proposal in Seattle last spring for a corporate tax to help the homeless, and succeeded in getting it cut in half. Then the retailer decided it just couldn’t live with the measure at all. A repeal effort began. The City Council killed the tax just as it was going into effect. At the time, that looked like another triumph for Amazon. But in the months since, even some of those who thought the tax was a bad idea have found their views evolving. “My feelings about Amazon have changed, and not in a good way,” said Julie Shapiro, a Seattle University professor of family law. “I think they want the ability to be a bully and, once they have it, they’re quite willing to use it.” That is the crux of the issue: Can a company be dominant without coming off as a bully? It is no accident that the company that was the subject of the biggest antitrust action in the last quarter-century — Microsoft — had a terrible reputation in the tech community. Voters love innovation, convenience and entrepreneurs. They don’t love bullies. Amazon failed to avoid bullying behavior in its now-abandoned bid to build a headquarters in New York, and Facebook likewise failed last week when it took down Ms. Warren’s posts about Facebook having too much power. The company, which said the posts had violated the use of its logo, quickly restored them, but the public relations damage had been done. “Curious why I think FB has too much power?” Ms. Warren tweeted. “Let’s start with their ability to shut down a debate over whether FB has too much power.”",The New York Times
2019,Why a New York Nun Fought the Power,"[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] Fifty years ago Sister Paulette LoMonaco, a young nun from Queens, went to work for a small social services agency called Good Shepherd Services, serving as a house mother at a group home for teenage girls in crisis near Union Square. Within a decade she was running the organization, building it into a one-stop services provider with a budget of almost $100 million. She worked with the city to shape its pilot after-school program, and was also a force behind transfer high schools, which offered adult dropout students a second chance. She also had a hand in reshaping the city’s foster care system, shifting the emphasis from removing children from troubled homes to propping up those families to keep them together. Along the way she wrangled with five mayors and the archdiocese (over matters of birth control and sexuality, among others). At the end of this year Sr. Paulette is stepping down from the organization she built. “’Cause I’m tired,” she said. “I’m going to be 76. This is a grueling job.” But she won’t leave completely. She plans to keep her apartment in the same group home where she first got her start. Recently, she spoke with The New York Times from her modest corner office in Midtown Manhattan. The following interview is an edited and condensed version of the conversation. The New York Times: I like to think that because you’re stepping down now, that we can speak more frankly than you could in the past. Sister Paulette: We’ll see. Sure, I’m game. I’m still here until the end of the year, and then I’m going to help with fund-raising. What do you see as the significant changes in the city over your 50 years? When we first moved into Park Slope in 1972, Park Slope was an unsafe neighborhood. It had the highest number of kids that were being removed from their homes and put into foster care. That’s why we put a family counseling program there. Today you can’t get real estate there. What are the biggest changes in the way we do social services? I remember for the first time when more children were in preventive services than were in foster care. That was a monumental shift. The pendulum has swung from removal to keeping families together. How has your relationship with the archdiocese changed over the years? We’re affiliated with Catholic Charities, but we have an independent board of directors. We’re not really controlled. How do your approaches to family planning issues go over with the archdiocese? You had to ask that. We follow all of our government contracts, and not all the children that we work with are Catholic, and we respect their ability to make their choices. Does that mean you can’t make recommendations? That means that I don’t want to answer that question. My spirituality is my own. I don’t speak for the Catholic Church. What changes do you see in young people? I think that young people are more stressed out today because of social media. We didn’t grow up with cyberbullying. We didn’t grow up worrying about what someone at school would put up on Facebook, and it’ll be there forever. You run into many teenagers today who have seen or heard of a lot of mass shootings. Here in our city we’ve done a great job at keeping crime down, but it’s just a more stressful environment now. We remember when there were 2,200 murders a year in New York. Now there are 300. But there’s other trauma. At Good Shepherd, so many of the children and families we work with have gone through a lot of trauma. So we’re very trauma-informed. We’ll start out by saying to a young person, What happened to you, instead of, What’s wrong with you? What are the fixable problems that we’re not fixing? This administration wants low income housing to have community centers attached, but they haven’t figured out how to give us money for operations. So we have no money to turn on the lights. That’s a problem I have to fix. I also want to fix summer day camps, because for some reason, this mayor never includes summer day camps for middle schools in the city budget. And middle school is when our kids first start getting attracted to gangs. What drew you into the church? When I was in college I had friends at Fordham and they introduced me to some Good Shepherd sisters, and when I visited them I just fell in love with the way they were working with young people. One day I was volunteering at a hospital and I had to take a girl I’d known to an adult psych ward, and I was freaked. Because I had to leave her in this locked place with people who were very disturbed. And that’s when I decided that that’s what I was going to do. What does a 21st century nun look like? I hope it’s somebody who looks like me. Real. Compassionate. Happy. Mission-driven. And who wants to be treated like a normal person. It’s very annoying that whenever they want to describe a nun in the media, it’s always somebody with a habit and veil. I wish that the media could have a more up-to-date visual of a sister. The culture talks a lot about the effects of celibacy among priests, and whether it’s a good idea. We rarely hear about whether it’s a good idea for nuns to be celibate. Is it time to rethink that as well? To be honest, I haven’t thought about it that much. Religious women join a congregation knowing that that’s a part of the deal. I can be warm and affectionate, but being married is out of the equation. You don’t have a business education. What corner-office advice would you give to other leaders? I’ve always believed in the servant leadership theory, being a servant and helping other people grow. It was started by Robert K. Greenleaf at AT&T, and he wrote extensively about the best way to bring out the best in your people. So many people when they retire have an abstract idea that they’d like to play golf. You actually play golf. No. I have an abstract idea that I’d like to play golf. I play a couple times a year. It is a very frustrating game. What I like is that it’s outside and you can walk. I now can hit the ball. How far is another story. You have done battle with half a dozen mayors, starting with Koch. Who was the most engaging to fight with? Giuliani was tough. Mike Bloomberg I consider a friend. But there were times when they wanted to eliminate one of our programs and I’d say, I am going to be fighting you on this. This administration is progressive, but we don’t always see eye to eye. I feel it’s my responsibility to hold their feet to the fire the way they hold us accountable. It’s mid-March. Have you done your taxes yet? No, because I don’t pay taxes. I don’t get a salary. My salary goes to the community. But the community’s responsibility is to make sure I’m okay. Do you see a Jimmy Carter-type retirement for yourself, or a Gerald Ford type? Jimmy Carter. I’m going to be building houses of one kind or another. He’s really lived out his mission as a man of faith. I hope people can say that about me at the end.",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | Why in the World?,"College sports do have some upsides. But their sheer scale is silly. Opinion Columnist This article is part of David Leonhardt’s newsletter. You can sign up here to receive it each weekday. At 11:15 a.m. local time in Des Moines this morning, March Madness will begin in earnest. The men’s basketball teams from the University of Minnesota and the University of Louisville will be playing each other. It will be the first of 16 games today, and another 80 men’s or women’s games will take place over the next several days. In a couple of recent newsletters, I’ve written about the downsides of college sports, and there are some big ones. Today, I want to talk about some upsides — and about how college sports might be able to achieve a better balance. I assume that many of you have filled out March Madness brackets with your friends, family or colleagues. Those brackets give you an excuse to have some fun together. Some of you are also fortunate enough to have a big rooting interest in one of the teams still playing. Maybe you’ll watch a game together or exchange nervous texts in a game’s final moments. Maybe you’ll end up jumping around your house in joy at some point in the next couple weeks with your kids or siblings. [Listen to “The Argument” podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.] College sports bring people a lot of joy. As one of my college roommates texted me last week, as a way of objecting to my recent criticism of sports, “I’m happier when our basketball team is good.” He’s got a point. Sports create shared experiences in a way that few other activities in this country do. This communal function means that colleges have a good reason to treat some athletes differently from most other applicants. Yes, the colleges should make sure they’re admitting only athletes with the academic preparation to graduate. But I understand why the basketball players representing the University of Minnesota today don’t necessarily need the same academic qualifications as the student oboists or journalists at Minnesota. Those athletes bring something to the campus that few other students can. ‘Why in the world?’ But it’s important to remember something else. Most college sports don’t look anything like basketball. They don’t bring a lot of people together. Their crowds are small. They don’t have many spillover benefits for the other parts of a university. They exist largely for the benefit of the athletes themselves — which makes them not so different from many other extracurricular activities. And these other sports are often disproportionately played by white, relatively well-off students. They don’t add much diversity to a campus. Only 4 percent of male college lacrosse players are black, as Justin Wolfers of the University of Michigan has noted. Only 5 percent of fencers are. In golf, the share is 2 percent. In water polo, it’s 1 percent. Yet colleges treat athletes in these sports as an entirely different species of applicant. The athletes don’t need to have nearly as strong applications as other students. Because so many of these sports exist, the share of athletes at some colleges is shockingly high. “Roughly 20 percent, or one-fifth, of the entering class at the Ivy League universities and the leading small liberal arts colleges are recruited athletes,” Jonathan Cole, a top former official at Columbia University (and, before that, a college athlete), has written. “Why in the world are the schools using up 20 percent of their slots on recruited athletes?” The answer, Cole explains, is that sports have become a kind of arms race. (In a recent newsletter, I mentioned that about one in five students at Williams College, in western Massachusetts, was an athlete, according to an outside estimate. That turns out to be wrong — and too conservative. Williams is on the high end of the distribution, with about 30 percent of students being recruited athletes, according to the college.) Cole is right that this situation doesn’t make any sense. I am fully aware that fencers, golfers, water polo players and other athletes work extremely hard. But so do many other students who participate in other extracurricular activities and have superior academic records. Those other students are often rejected to make room for the athletes. The problem is the special treatment that so many athletes are receiving. In a better system, most colleges would substantially shrink the number of athletes they recruit. Each would keep a modest number of sports — split equally between men and women — for which they would recruit athletes and still give huge admissions bonuses. These wouldn’t be the only teams that colleges fielded. But the other sports would follow a classic scholar-athlete model. The members of the teams would no longer receive extra-special treatment in the admissions process. They would be students who happened to be athletes. And they would compete with other teams filled with similar athletes. Is any college brave enough to move in this direction? Related On this week’s episode of “The Argument” podcast, we talk about what a better college admissions system could look like. We also debate whether President Trump is helping to cause white-nationalist violence. I realize I haven’t dug into the debate over whether college athletes should be paid here.

2019,Why the Plan to Legalize Marijuana in New Jersey Suddenly Unraveled,"[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] All the elements for swiftly legalizing marijuana in New Jersey seemed to be in place: A proposed bill was enthusiastically backed by Gov. Philip D. Murphy and had been endorsed by leaders of the Democratic-controlled State Legislature. Also, statewide polls showed support for the issue. Then the plans unraveled. Some lawmakers were unsure about how to tax marijuana sales. Others feared legalization would flood the state’s congested streets and highways with impaired drivers. Some would not be deterred from believing that marijuana was a dangerous menace to public health. A disagreement existed among lawmakers about how far to go regarding the social justice component in the legalization bill: Fissures grew over whether it was necessary to expunge criminal records for marijuana-related offenses for those found with as much as five pounds of the drug. “Five pounds is a lot of pot,” said Christopher Bateman, a Republican senator who had been considered a swing vote but had come out recently opposing legalization. “That’s not you and I smoking a little bit. That’s a dealer on the corner, selling and distributing.” All of this turmoil put New Jersey’s legalization efforts in jeopardy, and despite more than a hundred calls, texts and personal entreaties from Mr. Murphy to legislators in a final frenzied week, the bill abruptly collapsed on Monday. The failure in New Jersey revealed the difficulties for legalizing marijuana, especially through legislative efforts, rather than the ballot measures used in nine states where the drug has been legalized. Lawmakers in New Jersey, along with those in New York and Connecticut, have tried to painstakingly craft legislation to avoid problems encountered by states like Colorado, which in 2014 became the first to sell legal marijuana and has since endured unflattering headlines. A report released on Monday showed an increase in emergency room visits in Colorado as the drug has become more readily available. For states like California and Massachusetts, legalizing marijuana has led to some negative results: underwhelming tax revenue; a host of public health and safety concerns, such as keeping the drug out of teenagers’ hands; and a burgeoning industry dominated by white corporate interests even as advocates in Hispanic and black communities say their neighborhoods have been most negatively affected by the drug. In New York, legislative leaders and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo have seemed increasingly pessimistic in recent weeks about a quick deal on legalization, and are making contingency plans: Mr. Cuomo, after hearing of legislative trepidation, had already begun seeking alternative sources of revenue to replace those that would have come with legalized marijuana. He has suggested that the state may not be able to pass a bill this year. On Tuesday, Assemblywoman Crystal Peoples-Stokes, a Buffalo Democrat who is sponsoring New York’s legalization bill, said that lawmakers in Albany were still discussing the issue of community reinvestment, something she said was often lacking in other states where the drug has been legalized. “In many ways, they didn’t get it exactly right, and it didn’t benefit the communities that have had the harshest impact,” said Ms. Peoples-Stokes, who serves as the chamber’s majority leader. “We want to change that in New York.” Democratic leaders of suburban places like Nassau and Suffolk County — east of the city — have already announced they will opt out of any legal marijuana plan. “This is a significant shift in public policy, so it comes as little surprise that lawmakers are taking a very deliberative approach,” said Steve Hawkins, the executive director of the Marijuana Policy Project in Washington. “It is easy to grow impatient following decades of enduring a failed policy of marijuana prohibition, but huge strides are being taken in these states and others around the country.” Given what other states have encountered, New Jersey and other states facing financial challenges are reconsidering the possible financial benefits of legalization. Tax revenues in California have fallen well short of projections, and a black market for marijuana continues to thrive, which some cannabis business experts attribute to high taxes. Legislators in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut are also working to answer demands that legalization benefit minority populations disproportionately impacted by the war on drugs by providing job training and ensuring they get licenses to sell or grow marijuana. In New Jersey, the legalization bill caps the number of licenses to prevent flooding the market, establishes a regulatory commission that could respond to market fluctuations and applies a sales tax based on weight rather than as a percentage to ensure a steady revenue stream. New Jersey also pursued one of the country’s most liberal expungement programs by offering a clean slate for those who had been convicted of possessing up to five pounds of marijuana, an amount higher than any other state. And the bill said that some licenses would be reserved for communities with high rates of marijuana arrests and unemployment in an attempt to diversify the industry. The struggles in New Jersey and the slowdown of negotiations in New York have given opponents hope of forestalling or stopping future legalization efforts. “There’s a lot of backlash about the idea that we have to sell pot gummy bears to achieve social justice,” said Kevin A. Sabet, the president of Smart Approaches to Marijuana, a nonprofit organization that opposes legalization. He added that he’s seen an increase in opposition among some black and Latino lawmakers. “They’re seeing it’s safe to be a Democrat and anti-legalization.” Though the political stars seemed aligned in New Jersey, the reality in the State House was far more complex. Despite being hailed by advocates around the country as perhaps the most progressive legalization plan in the nation, some of the loudest opposition came from powerful African-American lawmakers. Ronald L. Rice, a Democratic senator from Newark, argued that legalization would lead to “marijuana bodegas,” which would further push the drug into poor urban communities. Shirley Turner, a black Democratic state senator, visited Colorado to see how legalization worked and returned worried about whether teenagers would be tempted to try the drug if it were legal. And Nia Gill, another black Democratic senator and a former president pro tempore of the senate, cited a Colorado study that found that even after legalization, marijuana arrest rates for black residents were nearly double that of white residents. (Even in states where marijuana is legal, certain limits apply to how much someone can possess and what age they can use it.) “The disparity is never alleviated because the disparity has to do with policing,” she said. “The disparity does not have to do with legalization of marijuana.” Mr. Murphy reached out repeatedly to black lawmakers to assuage their concerns. He also courted the support of civil rights leaders, like the Rev. Al Sharpton and Richard T. Smith, the president of the New Jersey chapter of the N.A.A.C.P., as well as African-American celebrities like Whoopi Goldberg. Days before the scheduled vote, Mr. Murphy held a news conference while being surrounded by religious leaders and civil rights activists. But it was not enough to win over the most senior African-American Democrats who were holding out. “I think we need to look before we leap,” said Ms. Turner. A coalition of veteran white lawmakers, including former law enforcement officials, remained concerned about thwarting driving under the influence of marijuana. In Colorado, officials are still unprepared to deal with this challenge and have yet to develop authoritative field sobriety tests and reliable lab testing, according to a report from the Colorado Division of Criminal Justice. “People are concerned about the inability to measure whether someone who is driving is impaired because of marijuana,” said Richard Codey, a Democratic state senator and former governor. The New Jersey bill would set up a task force focused on policing marijuana and driving and would offer to reimburse communities that hire law enforcement officers trained to recognize drivers impaired by drugs. But it was not enough to sway some lawmakers. “We have a million more registered cars on the road than Colorado,” Mr. Bateman said. In the end, the effort in New Jersey was also sunk by more parochial political reasons. Despite having a stranglehold on state government, Mr. Murphy and Stephen M. Sweeney, the Democratic senate president, have had a frosty relationship and never truly mounted a unified effort to do the arm twisting to secure the necessary votes until the final few days. Mr. Murphy, however, would not admit defeat, saying the decision to call off the vote was merely a setback. Still, no one has said when the bill might be resurrected or whether a new strategy will be deployed. “Eventually barriers do fall,” Mr. Murphy told reporters, “to those who are committed to breaking them down.” An earlier version of this article misstated one of Nia Gill’s former positions. She was president pro tempore of the state senate, not speaker of the assembly.",The New York Times

2019,Why the U.S. and Tunisia Keep Their Cooperation Secret,"TUNIS, Tunisia — Two years ago, American Marines battled Al Qaeda militants in western Tunisia along the border with Algeria. A Marine and a Tunisian soldier were wounded and two other Marines were later commended for their valor in the gunfight. Yet many details of the February 2017 clash remain murky, largely because of the Tunisian government’s political sensitivities over the presence of American forces in its territory. Publicly, American officials will say only that the battle happened in a North African “host” country. The Tunisian authorities have refused to confirm that anything happened at all. Last year, when one of the most detailed accounts of the clash to date surfaced in a report in Task & Purpose, a privately owned American website focused on military and veterans affairs, the Tunisian Ministry of Defense was dismissive. It said the “presence of American troops in Tunisia was only for cooperation and training, not conducting operations.” But in fact, the United States and Tunisia have quietly expanded and deepened their security and counterterrorism ties over the past several years, with some 150 Americans training and advising their Tunisian counterparts in one of the largest missions of its kind on the African continent, according to American officials. And the 2017 clash, confirmed by an American official and an American security expert, was a stark example of the risks American forces face in trying to help their North African allies battle Qaeda-linked groups. The deepening American involvement in an array of secret missions goes largely unreported because of Tunisian and American concerns that publicizing this could attract even more extremist violence. There is also a strong aversion across the political spectrum in North Africa to Western intervention in the region. Still the growing cooperation is notable because it comes at a time when the Pentagon is reducing its presence elsewhere on the continent, especially in West Africa, as the military shifts to focus more attention on challenges elsewhere from Russia and China. “Tunisia is one of our most capable and willing partners,” Gen. Thomas D. Waldhauser, the head of the Pentagon’s Africa Command, told Congress in February. Among the 150 Americans operating in Tunisia is a contingent of Marine Corps Special Operations forces who were involved in the 2017 gun battle. Unarmed American surveillance drones fly reconnaissance missions from Tunisia’s main air base outside Bizerte, the northernmost city in Africa, hunting terrorists who might be seeking to infiltrate through the country’s border with Libya and other areas, American military officials said. The United States had sought permission to fly from bases farther south, where weather conditions are better. But the Tunisians wanted the American presence to be more concealed, officials said. There are other signs of Washington’s increasing security cooperation with Tunisia. Body armor, rifles and night-vision goggles; reconnaissance aircraft and fast patrol boats; radios and devices to counter improvised explosives: The value of American military supplies delivered to the country increased to $119 million in 2017 from $12 million in 2012, government data show. Tunisia was the birthplace of the Arab Spring uprisings and is widely seen as the lone success story among countries that were swept up in the revolts. It emerged with a democratic system and a free society after the 2011 overthrow of its authoritarian president of 23 years, Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. Yet it has struggled to control a threat from Al Qaeda and other radical groups, which have exploited the new freedoms to radicalize followers and establish networks of cells across Tunisia. The problem first became apparent in 2012 with an attack on the American Embassy in the capital, Tunis. Three days earlier in neighboring Libya, militants had attacked the American mission in the eastern city of Benghazi. Four Americans were killed, including Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens. Riots in Tunis and two political assassinations by a Qaeda-linked group, Ansar al-Sharia, followed in 2013. The same year, an insurgency by Al Qaeda’s North African branch began to target the military in the mountains of the Kasserine region near the Algerian border, the area where the 2017 gunfight would later erupt. Attacks on the police escalated around the country. Then in 2015, two massacres of foreign tourists captured international attention — one at a museum in Tunis and the other at the beach resort of Sousse on the Mediterranean. In the National Bardo Museum attack on March 18, two attackers killed 22 people, mostly tourists. Four months later, the shooting on a beach and inside a hotel in Sousse killed 39. In March 2016, jihadists mounted an assault from Libya on police and military posts in the border town of Ben Gardane, which Tunisian forces successfully countered. Bizerte Tunis Sousse ALGERIA KASSERINE TUNISIA Mediterranean Sea Ben Gardane LIBYA 100 miles By The New York Times Tunisia has succeeded in dismantling most of the militant networks since 2015, according to government officials, diplomats and security analysts. But it still faces threats. Last month, a civilian was beheaded and mines were planted near his body. Soldiers were wounded in a separate mine blast, according to the Ministry of Defense. “The jihadist cells have completely given up the playbook of gaining the sympathy of the population,” said Matt Herbert, a director of Maharbal, a Tunisian strategic consulting firm. Now, he said, they are trying to terrorize them. Last October, a suicide attack on Avenue Habib Bourguiba, the main street in downtown Tunis, wounded 20 people. The only person who died was the bomber, a woman identified as Mouna Guebla who was not on the authorities’ radar. But a suicide attack in the capital set off alarm bells for the government because it came after three years of hard work and costly security investment against the terrorist networks. Prime Minister Youssef Chahed supports the fight against terrorism. The government spends 15 percent of its budget on the defense and interior ministries for that purpose, he said recently. But he acknowledged that this had come at a cost for other pressing problems, such as poverty and unemployment. Officials point to improvements in logistics and operations in the fight against terrorism. But the country is still struggling with its porous borders with Libya and Algeria, which serve as transit areas for Al Qaeda’s branch in North Africa and as well as the remains of Islamic State cells in Libya. The 2017 clash involving the Marines was a reminder of the resilience of the jihadists, even amid the combined American-Tunisian efforts. In the Kasserine mountain area, only a few dozen guerrillas are active at any given time. Yet because of its proximity to the Algerian border, the Tunisian Army has struggled to secure it. The team of Marines was on a three-day mission with Tunisian forces when it got into a “fierce fight against members of Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb,” according to one of the award citations for the Marines, who were not identified. Although the Marines were said to be on a “train, advise and assist” mission, the citations made clear that they were fighting and, at times, directing events. The United States command withheld the details of the clash for “classification considerations, force protection, and diplomatic sensitivities,” according to the report by Task & Purpose, which obtained the citations, with some details redacted, through a Freedom of Information Act request. The award citation indicates that the Tunisian forces killed one Qaeda operative in the initial gunfight, but that the unit then came under accurate fire from the rear as the insurgents tried to outflank them and a Marine was wounded. One Marine was commended for tending to his wounded comrade while under fire and winching him to a hovering helicopter. A second was commended for coordinating air support from the helicopter and taking over behind the machine gun when the Tunisian gunner was wounded. In an interview with The New York Times in December, Kamel Akrout, a national security adviser to the Tunisian president, was asked about what had happened that day in the mountains of Kasserine. He would neither confirm nor deny the episode. “We have an intense cooperation with the Americans, but also with other countries,” he said. “Although I can assure you that no Tunisian soldier would accept a foreign soldier fighting on their behalf. They are not with us during operations.”",The New York Times
2019,Why ‘the Worst of Both Worlds’ Is in the Forecast,"California Today Good morning. (Here’s the sign-up, if you don’t already get California Today by email.) The good news for residents of Northern California — which has been battered this week by historic rain and flooding that has been blamed for at least one death — is that the worst is most likely over. The swollen Russian River, which essentially turned the town of Guerneville into an island, is forecast to recede in the next day or two, returning to below flooding levels by early Friday morning, said Scott Rowe, a National Weather Service meteorologist. Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency in five hard-hit Northern California counties yesterday, which aims to help communities recover. The bad news is that these kinds of severe storms are likely to get more frequent, as climate change contributes to what experts say will be a future marked less by gradual, steady warming than by a kind of weather whiplash. That’s how Daniel Swain described it, when I spoke with him recently. He’s the California Climate Fellow for the Nature Conservancy, a researcher, and the expert behind the Weather West blog. I initially wanted to talk to Mr. Swain about wildfires — their increasing severity and frequency — but, he explained, fire and rain and floods are part of climate cycles that are becoming more extreme. “The average condition doesn’t characterize what you experience,” he said. Average temperatures are rising, he said, and what’s starting to become clear is that “the impacts of those warming temperatures are not incremental in living systems.” An average over years doesn’t capture the real effects of a devastating drought and wildfires followed closely by a particularly wet rainy season on environments and communities, which are increasingly being built into wilderness areas. As a result, Mr. Swain said, Californians end up dealing with “the worst of both worlds.” The question then becomes: How do you manage land use to minimize harm from extreme weather? Is it possible to store water when it rains and save it for when the state is wracked with drought? It would be simple to, say, return it all to its natural state. Rip out the concrete in the Los Angeles River, let wildfires burn what they will, never allow construction where there’s any risk of disaster. But Mr. Swain said it’s impossible to ignore the presence of humans or to discount the value of communities that have already been built — even if they coexist with the environment imperfectly. Going forward, he said, there are opportunities to build more sustainably, and for policymakers to think carefully about managing things like groundwater. For now, though, Mr. Rowe, of the National Weather Service, said that another storm could be heading toward the Central Coast next week. (We often link to sites that limit access for nonsubscribers.

But even if you’re far away, take this as an invitation to treat yourself to your favorite pastry: Crystal White’s San Diego bakery Wayfarer Bread & Pastry has such delicious baked goods that I had to visit two days in a row to taste as many possible. It started with a morning bun — a swirl of crisp, buttery dough with a soft, sticky center of honey cream and candied kumquats — and a rich, almost fragile chocolate-cherry scone. Later I got a sourdough and a loaf of seeded rye to bring home and I felt something like pangs of jealousy for the locals who can visit regularly enough to taste the delicious, weekly shifts in the menu, or pop by casually for mortadella pies on pizza night. On the long drive home, I consoled myself with one of Wayfarer’s huge, tender chocolate chip cookies, which I’d stashed away in my purse.

2019,"Wi-Fi on Planes? A ‘Disaster,’ Says Bernard-Henri Lévy.","For a new one-man show, the French philosopher is traveling to 22 European cities this year. All he needs are books, white shirts and his current manuscript. No internet, please. The philosopher Bernard-Henri Lévy has been a fixture on French television screens for decades. His commentary has been mocked, criticized, supported and lauded. Whether in writing, performing or speaking, he has no intention of slowing down. B.H.L., as the French call him, published a new book, “The Empire and the Five Kings: America’s Abdication and the Fate of the World,” in February and now appears in a one-man play “Looking for Europe.” The play, an update of a show Mr. Lévy originally performed in Sarajevo more than a decade ago, will be performed in 22 cities across Europe. Both the book and play assess the United States’s retreat as a global leader and examine the crumbling trans-Atlantic alliance between the United States and Europe. The tour ends in May, when the European Parliament elections begin. All of them, but there is one that is particularly important to me: Gdansk, Poland. I chose it because of the mayor, who was assassinated there. Pawel Adamowicz is the one who invited me. I chose Gdansk over Warsaw and Krakow because of him. I knew him well. His assassination is a heartbreaking tragedy and the performance there, for me, will be more than a performance. It will be a night of mourning and celebration of him. I do not live very differently when I travel and when I don’t, which means I do my duty. My duty is to read, to write and to fight. These are the three things that are my duty. Traveling and not traveling, this is what I do. I like trains because I like the idea of feeling the distance. Plane abolishes distance. It destroys the physical sense of covering the distance, or devouring the distance. The train like the car helps you to have the physical feeling in your body of the materiality of the space. That is the most honest and exhilarating way to travel. I’m annoyed by Wi-Fi. One of the few advantages of planes was that at last you were cut from this universal communication. Now with Wi-Fi even the space of freedom from social networks is taken from you. This is a disaster. I travel with a lot of books. Too many. I broke so often my back with my bags full of books. I always bring a lot more than I can read. I have a Kindle, but I am old school. I like the physical contact with the paper. I like the smell of the paper. I like to be able to devour the book, to take notes in the margin. The physical sense of crossing the book is the same as traveling a landscape. Never a rolling suitcase. I have a feeling that the day someone will see me with rolling luggage it must mean that a bad period is starting for me. Anyone who would see me in the next weeks, months, years, decades, with a rolling suitcase should know that things are not going well for me. It’s self indulging. I have two big black leather bags of French design. Louis Vuitton. I can put my books in there and a few shirts in them. I am always dressed the same way — you know my white shirts — so it’s easy for me. And I travel with the current manuscript. I never check my luggage. I always have two or three bags on me. At least two. I have them with me because I’ve not the patience to wait for them because my books are too precious. I would hate to lose them. The places I discover. I am really a traveler. I love to move. The biggest excitement for me is to discover a new place, a new country, a new rhythm in the air. The most exciting travel is always the travel of tomorrow. I went to Brazil after the election of Bolsonaro, who is to me, a fascist. I was happy to be there with the brave citizens of Brazil who were democratically protesting and lamenting against the election of the stupid, brutal man.

2019,Wife of Ex-Interpol Chief Says Arrest in China was Politically Motivated,"The wife of the missing Chinese former head of Interpol on Thursday dismissed allegations by authorities in China accusing her husband of graft and said his arrest was politically motivated. China will prosecute former Interpol chief, Meng Hongwei, for graft after an investigation found he spent “lavish” amounts of state funds, abused his power and refused to follow Communist Party decisions, Beijing’s anti-corruption watchdog said in a statement on Wednesday. Mr. Meng’s wife, Grace Meng, said in a statement sent to Reuters on Thursday by her lawyers, “The press release openly reveals the political nature of Mr. Meng’s case, without addressing the issues concerning our family’s fundamental human rights.” Interpol, the global police coordination agency based in France, said last October that Mr. Meng had resigned as its president, days after his wife reported him missing while he was on a trip to China. The Communist Party’s Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CDDI) said Mr. Meng was suspected of taking bribes and causing serious harm to the party’s image and state’s interests, adding that he should be dealt with severely. Grace Meng, who has remained in Lyon, France, with the couple’s two children, said the CCDI has not provided any information about her husband’s whereabouts or well-being. “Instead, the CCDI made vague, general, uncorroborated statements,” she said. “Chinese authorities have not formulated actual charges or adduced the alleged supporting evidence.”",The New York Times
2019,Will Canadian Women Turn Their Backs on Their Feminist Prime Minister?,"TORONTO — Being a feminist is not an easy job. Just ask Justin Trudeau. A day after his non-apology for the political crisis engulfing his government, with accusations that he bullied his female justice minister on a criminal case, the Canadian prime minister met with young women in Toronto to celebrate International Women’s Day. But women around the country are grumbling. “You can’t just add women and stir,” said Lise Gotell, professor of women’s and gender studies at the University of Alberta in Edmonton. “Strong feminist leadership is principled, the antithesis of back-room party politics.” The prime minister is arguably not just Canada’s most feminist leader, but also one of the world’s must public proponents of gender equality. He appointed the country’s first gender-balanced cabinet and passed its first gender-equality budget. He increased international aid directed specifically at women, introduced policies to protect women from violence and sexual harassment at work and at home, and unlocked funding for grass-roots feminist organizations across the country. Until recently, it proved a winning strategy. The women’s vote carried Mr. Trudeau’s Liberal Party to power in 2015, and while male support has waned, Canadian women have largely stuck with him. But the glow is fading fast. As the prime minister admitted on Thursday, it’s been “a tough few weeks.” The trouble started when Jody Wilson-Raybould abruptly resigned from the cabinet after a news report accused Mr. Trudeau’s team of pressuring her to negotiate a settlement in a corruption case against a large Canadian company, rather than pursuing a criminal penalty. Compared with political scandals around the world, the accusations seemed tame. But with just seven months until the next national election, they struck at the core of Mr. Trudeau’s image as a feminist politician committed to doing politics in a new, clean way. The loss of Ms. Wilson-Raybould, who had been reassigned to head veterans affairs shortly before she resigned, was particularly bruising. She is not just a woman, but also an Indigenous leader who embodied Mr. Trudeau’s often-stated commitment to correcting the country’s colonial wrongs against its Indigenous population. “He’s all puff, no solid,” said Priscilla Settee, a professor of both Indigenous studies and women and gender studies at the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon. “He is not used to a strong, Indigenous woman being defiant to his power,” she added. “As an Indigenous woman, I know that behavior.” Last week, in testimony before a parliamentary committee, Ms. Wilson-Raybould broke her silence and explained her reasons for resigning — that she felt hounded by the prime minister and his aides to change her decision on the case in an inappropriate way, which she felt would bend the law. She reminded the country that its government had a history of ignoring the law when it came to Indigenous people, and intimated she wouldn’t be part of that. “I am a truth teller in accordance with the laws and traditions of our Big House,” she said, referring to her Kwakwaka’wakw nation’s center of governance and cultural activities. Less than a week later, a second female minister quit Mr. Trudeau’s cabinet. The minister, Jane Philpott, who is also a medical doctor, said in her resignation letter that it was a matter of “acting on one’s principles.” On Thursday, Mr. Trudeau finally told his side. In a rare morning news conference, he repeated that he had done nothing wrong and that at its basis, the problem reflected a breakdown of trust and communication he intended to learn from. He offered no apology. In his remarks, Mr. Trudeau described his leadership as one of collaboration, listening and learning together — a classic feminist approach to power. “There’s one theory that the most effective leaders are adversarial, and tough almost to a fault,” he said. “That’s not what I believe.” He made a point of saying he’d be celebrating International Women’s Day with “incredible young leaders.” “I plan to listen and learn from their lived experiences as we talk about how we can work together to deliver true gender equality in this country and around the world,” he said. For many, it was not enough to erase the image of a group of mostly men ganging up on a woman in order to get her to bend her morals. Add to that the whispers after Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s resignation that painted her as difficult, self-centered and untrustworthy — and the characterization by the country’s male finance minister that Dr. Philpott’s was an act of friendship. “Philpott is an incredibly accomplished and strong cabinet minister and her decision to step down is being reduced to simply being the actions of a supportive friend, falling into sexist tropes,” said Shannon Sampert, a columnist for The Winnipeg Free Press and an associate professor in political science at the University of Winnipeg. She added: “Some feminist prime minister. Too much mansplaining.” Until a month ago, few feminists openly questioned Mr. Trudeau’s sincerity to the cause. The Canadian branch of the international development agency Oxfam gave his government a positive rating in its third annual “feminist scorecard,” saying that its efforts ""have undoubtedly started to pay off,” and that it had offered ""many wins for feminists to celebrate.” While the weekly poll by the Canadian firm Nanos Research showed the party’s popularity had fluctuated among female voters, it still was strong at 44 percent in early January. Since then, it has dropped so much, it could cost Mr. Trudeau next fall’s election, the company’s founder, Nik Nanos, said. “Unless women voters go back to supporting him significantly, a majority is out of reach for him,” Mr. Nanos said. Compounding Mr. Trudeau’s problems is the vocal frustration of Indigenous leaders across the country, many of whom are openly criticizing Mr. Trudeau’s leadership. “This makes me question everything the federal government has done to now,” said Judy Wilson, secretary-treasurer of the Union of British Columbia Indian Chiefs, which represents more than 100 Indigenous groups on Canada’s west coast. “He called it an erosion of trust,” she said. “I disagree with that. I think it’s an erosion of laws and an erosion of transparency and accountability.” The question will be whether Mr. Trudeau can regain his reputation by the election next fall, and whether voters think he’s a worse choice than his competition. Many feminists in Canada bitterly recall the last government under Stephen Harper, a Conservative, which scrapped a national child-care plan, shut down federal Status of Women offices across the country and proposed protecting girls with a national hotline to report “barbaric cultural practices.” Mr. Trudeau is “messing up, which is better than not doing it at all,” said Judith Taylor, an associate professor of sociology, gender and women’s studies at the University of Toronto. “Men who don’t care about equality and justice don’t have to deal with this. He is making a diversified workplace and he’s making mistakes, as we all do.” She wished, however, that he had apologized “so we could all grow with him.”",The New York Times
2019,Will Kim Jong-un Return to Brinkmanship? Weak Economy Is Forcing His Hand,"SEOUL, South Korea — When the armored train carrying Kim Jong-un back from his summit meeting with President Trump in Vietnam reached Pyongyang Station at 3:08 a.m. Tuesday, throngs of flower-waving North Koreans greeted their leader with “boundless emotions and excitement,” the country’s state-run media said. But Mr. Kim returned home empty-handed — without relief from international sanctions — prompting the question of what he will do next: Particularly, will he resume his nuclear and missile brinkmanship to reassert his leverage? The revelation on Wednesday that North Korea had started rebuilding the partly dismantled facilities at Tongchang-ri, where the country tests technologies for its intercontinental ballistic missiles, raised the specter that Mr. Kim was returning to his provocative behavior. But experts on North Korea say Mr. Kim may be boxed in: He returned home without sanctions relief amid strong signs that the North Korean economy is continuing to contract. The deepening economic trouble may force the country to return to the negotiating table. In restarting operations at its missile technology site, North Korea is seeking “to increase its leverage before the next round of talks,” said Koh Yu-hwan, a professor of North Korean studies at Dongguk University in Seoul. “I don’t think the North will resume missile tests anytime soon and risk the resumption of United States-South Korea joint military exercises and even the talk of a military option by the Americans,” he said. Mr. Trump expressed his displeasure at the prospect of new testing. “I would be very disappointed if that were happening,” the president said at the White House on Wednesday when asked about reports on the North Korean missile facilities. “It’s a very early report, and we’re the ones that put it out. But I would be very, very disappointed in Chairman Kim. And I don’t think I will be, but we’ll see what happens. We’ll take a look. It’ll ultimately get solved.” The two-day Hanoi summit meeting ended last week without any agreement on the terms of denuclearizing North Korea, dashing Mr. Kim’s hopes that he could persuade Washington to lift the most punishing sanctions against his country in return for a partial dismantlement of its nuclear program. Officially, both sides remain committed to dialogue, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo expressing hope that the United States will send a delegation to North Korea “in the next couple weeks.” And this week, Washington canceled two major joint military exercises with South Korea to keep the diplomatic momentum alive. But in a telling sign of disappointment, the official Korean Central News Agency’s report on Mr. Kim’s return home made no mention of “comprehensive and epoch-making results” that it had earlier said Mr. Kim was discussing with Mr. Trump in Hanoi. “The Hanoi summit was a knockout defeat for Kim Jong-un,” said Lee Seong-hyon, an analyst at the Sejong Institute near Seoul. “The Kim-Trump romance may be short-lived, especially if Trump determines that playing hardball and cornering Kim Jong-un is popular in the run-up to his next election campaign. In Hanoi, Trump learned how desperate Kim is to ease sanctions.” After the breakdown of the Hanoi talks, Mr. Kim faced growing doubts at home that he could deliver on his promise to revive his country’s troubled economy and keep his long-suffering people from having to “tighten their belt again.” Mr. Kim may engineer a political purge to keep the elites under control and reassert his authority, Mr. Lee said. He may also reshuffle his negotiating team, replacing Kim Yong-chol, a former spy chief who has led negotiations with Washington, with more seasoned Foreign Ministry diplomats, Mr. Lee said. “The greatest achievement” of the Hanoi summit meeting “was to clearly prove that there is no potential for convergence between the current North Korean and American trajectories toward North Korea’s denuclearization,” said Ha Young-sun, a prominent South Korean expert on North Korea, in a column posted on Global North Korea, a Seoul-based website specializing in the North. If North Korea does not correct its course, “the regime will face a second ‘Arduous March,’” Mr. Ha said, referring to a famine in the 1990s that may have killed millions of North Koreans. It remains difficult to measure how much North Korea is hurt by sanctions. The United Nations has warned that the country is benefiting from sanctions loopholes, conducting ship-to-ship transfers of oil and other banned goods, with the help of Chinese and Russian entities. But Mr. Kim’s insistence on sanctions relief during his meeting with Mr. Trump suggested that North Korea has begun feeling pains of sanctions in a way it had never before or that Mr. Kim sees sanctions as the biggest obstacle to his ambitious plan to rebuild the economy. On Wednesday, United Nations and Red Cross officials said that North Korea’s food production last year had fallen to its lowest level in more than a decade, as a prolonged heat wave, along with typhoon and floods, caused the food harvest to drop 9 percent. Maize yields fell more than 30 percent from average levels in some areas, and rice prices are likely to rise this year, aggravating the food security situation, Margareta Wahlstrom, the president of the Swedish Red Cross, told Reuters. That has resulted in a “significant food gap,” leaving around 3.8 million North Koreans in urgent need of humanitarian assistance worth $120 million, according to Tapan Mishra, the United Nations resident coordinator in the North, Reuters said. Since taking power in 2011, Mr. Kim has focused on reviving the economy, allowing more market activities, as well as kicking off a building boom in Pyongyang and in potential tourist zones on the country’s east coast and near its scenic Mount Baekdu. At the same time, he accelerated his country’s nuclear and missile program, proudly announcing in 2017 that he had completed nuclear-armed ICBMs. But it came with a heavy cost. Since North Korea conducted its fourth nuclear test in 2016, the United Nations Security Council has drastically tightened the noose around the North Korean economy, banning all of its key exports, such as coal, textiles and fisheries, and limiting its ability to import oil. After steady growth under Mr. Kim, the country’s economy contracted 3.5 percent in 2017 because of sanctions, according to South Korea’s central bank. It may have contracted 5 percent last year, South Korean economists say. North Korean exports to China plummeted 88 percent to $210 million last year, according to Chinese customs data. China accounts for more than 93 percent of North Korea’s external trade. The widening trade deficit with China — it grew 30 percent last year — threatens the country’s hard-currency reserves and its ability to stock its markets and state-run stores with Chinese imports to keep inflation in check, analysts said. During the Hanoi summit meeting, Mr. Kim made a bold offer by North Korean standards. He offered to dismantle its facilities at Yongbyon, which his country has operated as its main nuclear research and nuclear fuel production complex since the 1980s. In return, he asked Mr. Trump to lift the sanctions imposed since 2016 that have strangled the North Korean economy. But Mr. Trump demanded that the North do more, seeking a more comprehensive denuclearization agreement, rather than an incremental deal in which Washington give up the sanctions leverage it has built over the years. “I’d much rather do it right than do it fast,” Mr. Trump said. His strategy stymies Mr. Kim’s plans to improve the economy and strengthen the legitimacy of his family’s dynastic rule. But time is not necessarily on Washington’s side, Mr. Koh said. “Sanctions certainly hurt, but they will not make the regime collapse or surrender,” he said. “As talks remain stalemated, the North will keep running its nuclear program and produce more fissile materials for more nuclear warheads.”",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | Will Mexico Save Its Vanishing Vaquita?,"Less than two dozen of the tiny porpoises remain in the wild. But there’s plenty the government can do to avert its extinction. Mr. Parker is a journalist. In recent decades, the sleek, wide-eyed vaquita porpoise has been pushed to the brink of extinction by poachers pursuing another critically endangered sea creature, the totoaba, a fish whose swim bladder sells on the Chinese black market for thousands of dollars. The porpoises end up caught in nets intended for the totoaba and killed as collateral damage. The vaquita (its name is Spanish for “little cow”) is a toothed whale and the smallest of all cetaceans; a full-grown female can measure just five feet and weigh only 75 pounds. Thousands of vaquitas once plowed the Sea of Cortez, also known as the Gulf of California, which is bordered on the east by the Mexican mainland and on the west by the Baja California peninsula. Today, their numbers are estimated at around 10 but no more than 22 in the wild. Without a strictly enforced ban on even possessing gillnets, the species will soon go extinct in the wild. Just last week, the badly decomposed body of what was thought to be a vaquita was found caught in a gillnet. There is little time left to act to save the vaquita, yet there is hope. For Mexico’s new president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, the fate of the little porpoise represents political opportunity and the chance of failure. He can do nothing and preside over the first sea mammal extinction in North America in decades. Or he can save one of Mexico’s national symbols and rescue a troubled fishing industry. “This is doable even now,” said Brooke Bessesen, a conservationist and author of a new book, “Vaquita: Science Politics and Crime in the Sea of Cortez.” “We have to come up with solutions that buy time. This is not a numbers game. It’s a game of time.” The Sea of Cortez is 62,000 square miles of azure and turquoise water that ranks as one of the most productive fisheries in the world, with more than 900 species of fin fish, including blue marlin and whale sharks. Commercial fishing started in earnest in the 1940s and is largely concentrated off the Mexican state of Sonora, on the eastern shore of the sea. But poachers are generally thought to be the problem these days. The small-scale fishermen who live on the sea’s western and northern shores motor out in cheap fiberglass skiffs known as pangas, armed with gillnets. These nets, made from near invisible nylon mono- and multifilament, float on or near the surface and are weighted at the bottom. They kill indiscriminately, entangling everything from sea lion pups to great white sharks. Today, there are so many abandoned nets that the government pays fishermen to drag them ashore. Poor poachers still use gillnets to catch the totoaba, whose swim bladder sells for $20,000 on average in China for traditional medicine and even as investments. A bladder is both a high-end business gift and a sort of trophy in itself. The trade is so lucrative that the drug cartels have become involved in the poaching. Last April, Mexican authorities stopped a Chinese man at the Mexico City International Airport with 355 totoaba swim bladders. Three days later, another Chinese man bound for China had 417 swim bladders in two suitcases. And in December, Chinese officials confiscated 980 pounds of swim bladders, estimated to be worth $26 million. Sixteen people were arrested. So it is no wonder that poachers and their gillnets have pushed the totoaba onto the list of critically endangered species maintained by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, and dragged the even more endangered vaquita along with it. The tiny porpoises drown when they are snagged in these nets. The Mexican government shares some of the blame. Warnings that the vaquita might vanish arose years ago when there were still hundreds in the wild, but it failed to take effective actions to protect them. Mr. López Obrador’s predecessor, Enrique Peña Nieto, banned the use of gill nets in the porpoise’s habitat in 2015, for instance, but not their possession. An attempt to capture porpoises to breed them in captivity in 2017 led to one dying; another nearly did and had to be released. The totoaba, however, is being bred in captivity, giving the species a path to survival. But that effort is likely to be counterproductive for the vaquita, because it will only encourage more poaching of the totoaba. The vaquita’s situation is so dire that Thomas A. Jefferson, a San Diego marine biologist and conservationist, said he feared that extinction was its most likely fate. “The conservationist in me doesn’t want to admit that but the biologist has to,” he said. Yet the vaquita clings to life. In October, four were spotted in open water. The little porpoise may possess a unique genetic advantage that could allow it to recover in the wild if just left alone. The vaquita was never widely distributed, numbering perhaps only 5,000 at its modern height and located only in the Sea of Cortez. But there is no evidence that it has hit the bottleneck of birth defects from inbreeding often seen in declining populations. And so, there is hope — if President López Obrador acts swiftly. The vaquita is one of Mexico’s national animals, along with the golden eagle and the jaguar. He’s under economic pressure to do so. But by acting aggressively to save the porpoise, he can also fulfill core campaign promises and emerge a hero, not just in Mexico but around the world. Pressure is coming from the United States. Last year, the United States Court of International Trade in New York temporarily banned seafood imports from Mexico caught in the Sea of Cortez with gillnets. The injunction was issued in response to a lawsuit brought by environmentalists complaining that the Trump administration was not enforcing a 1972 law that protects marine mammals from being killed in the process of fishing. It has been a crippling blow to the fishing industry in the Sea of Cortez, blocking an estimated 1,400 tons of seafood worth $300 million from being sold in the United States. Even before that, the grocery retailer Trader Joe’s had banned blue shrimp from the Sea of Cortez from its nearly 500 stores because of concerns that vaquitas were being killed in gillnets intended for shrimp. Even if he wasn’t facing that economic pressure, saving the vaquita represents an opportunity for the new president. Mexican presidents cannot run for re-election, so Mr. López Obrador is at the zenith of his power at the start of his six-year term. By banning the possession of gillnets, Mr. López Obrador would slow the killing of both the totoaba and the vaquita and perhaps resolve the trade dispute with the United States. By expanding the practice of paying more fisherman to remove ghost nets, he would put idle anglers to work. By allowing video of illegal fishing to be used as evidence in court — it is now not admissible — the Mexican Navy could make poaching arrests stick. And by managing the fishery wisely, he would keep it producing for Mexicans and foreign markets alike. Already this kind of fishery management is taking shape in parts of Sonora. “There has to be some way. But this comes down to López Obrador,” said Ms. Bessesen, the author. “He is the remaining flicker of hope for the vaquita.” So, yes, there is hope. But in the Sea of Cortez, there is little time for either the president or the porpoise.

2019,Opinion | Will There Be Smoking Guns in the Mueller Report?,"I’ve followed the investigation closely. Here’s what I’ll be looking for. Ms. Jurecic is the managing editor of Lawfare. Any week now, any day now — so the news reports go — the special counsel’s office will file the Mueller report. It will round out a trilogy. In 1974, to inform its impeachment proceedings, Congress received what became known as the “road map,” a terse document from the office of the Watergate special prosecutor Leon Jaworski detailing evidence of wrongdoing by President Richard Nixon. In 1998, another investigator submitted a report on a president’s potentially impeachable offenses to Congress: a narrative from the independent counsel Kenneth Starr of Bill Clinton’s misconduct. Following Justice Department regulations, the special counsel Robert Mueller will submit a “confidential report” to the attorney general, Bill Barr. Mr. Barr will decide how much of it to share with Congress and with the world at large. Assuming that some significant portion of the report becomes public, and that it provides an additional factual record beyond what we already know, the question will quickly become how to identify any smoking guns. I’ve spent the last year and a half following the investigation. Here’s a partial list of what I’ll be looking for: In November 2015, according to Mr. Mueller, Michael Cohen, then Mr. Trump’s lawyer, was put in touch with a Russian man who promised Mr. Cohen “political synergy” and “repeatedly proposed a meeting” between Mr. Trump and the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, to help with efforts to construct a Trump Tower Moscow. In January 2016, the office of a “high-level Russian official” — most likely, according to reports, of Mr. Putin’s spokesman Dmitri Peskov — reached out to Mr. Cohen about the project, and efforts on it continued at least into the summer of 2016. How closely were Mr. Trump and his children involved in the Trump Tower Moscow negotiations, and over what period? How much did they know of or encourage Mr. Cohen’s contacts with the Russian government — including tentative plans for a meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin? How did the Trump family and campaign understand the connection between the “Moscow project” and Mr. Trump’s political ambitions? Mr. Mueller estimated in a court filing that Trump Tower Moscow could have generated “hundreds of millions of dollars from Russian sources in licensing fees and other revenues” — an unusually large profit for the Trump Organization. Why was the number so atypically high? “Dirt” on Clinton In spring 2016, according to the special counsel, a professor linked to the Russian government told the Trump campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos that Russia had “dirt” on Hillary Clinton in the form of “thousands of emails.” Around this time, the special counsel’s indictment of Russian military intelligence officials shows that the Russian government had hacked into networks and accounts belonging to the Democratic Party and the Clinton campaign, and would soon begin coordinating with WikiLeaks to disseminate the stolen information. In June, Donald Trump Jr. met with a Kremlin-linked lawyer at Trump Tower in New York in what seems to have been a failed effort to get similar “dirt.” Who else in the campaign did Mr. Papadopoulos tell about his scoop, and how high did that knowledge go? Did Donald Trump Jr. inform his father of his plans before the meeting? Roger Stone and WikiLeaks Mr. Mueller’s indictment of the Trump adviser Roger Stone alleges that Mr. Stone worked throughout the summer of 2016 to get in touch with WikiLeaks and became aware of the organization’s plans to disclose hacked information. Mr. Cohen claimed in his testimony to Congress that he was in the room when Mr. Stone informed Mr. Trump that WikiLeaks was planning a “massive dump of emails that would damage Hillary Clinton’s campaign.” Was Mr. Stone coordinating with the campaign in his efforts to get information from WikiLeaks? How much did Mr. Trump know about what Mr. Stone had found out? And who in the campaign, if anyone, might have been aware of separate efforts by the Republican operative Peter Smith to obtain additional Clinton emails from sources Mr. Smith believed were Russian hackers? Flynn’s Promises to Moscow The national security adviser Michael Flynn was fired just 24 days into his tenure over fallout from his transition-period contacts with the Russian ambassador at the time, Sergey Kislyak — a matter about which he later pleaded guilty to lying to federal investigators. When he promised Mr. Kislyak that Mr. Trump would lift sanctions on Russia imposed by the departing Obama administration, was Mr. Flynn freelancing or was he acting on the instructions of someone higher? Russian Influence Operations Almost every case that Mr. Mueller has filed has illuminated a different facet of what appears to be a systematic, long-running effort by the government of Russia to reach out to Mr. Trump’s world. It’s clear that the Kremlin was attempting to gain access and influence. Was it also out-and-out working to recruit agents within the Trump Organization and campaign? On our side of the Atlantic, to what extent was that outreach welcomed and reciprocated by the Trump team, and to what extent was Mr. Trump a passive beneficiary? Did the Trump Organization and campaign understand and respond to those instances as manifestations of a systematic effort by the Russian government or as unrelated connections with unconnected Russians? Obstruction of Justice Mr. Mueller has also reportedly conducted an investigation into potential obstruction of justice by the president: possible interference with the special counsel’s efforts, and with the F.B.I.’s before that. Mr. Barr, among others, has argued that action authorized by the Constitution — like dismissing the F.B.I. director — by definition cannot constitute obstruction. Will the report sidestep these tricky legal questions by showing efforts by Mr. Trump to derail the inquiry that fall plainly outside the scope of presidential authority? To what extent does the obstruction investigation overlap with the collusion investigation — meaning that the special counsel and the F.B.I. understood the president’s apparent efforts at obstruction as part of the troubling pattern of coordination with the Russian government that incited the investigation in the first place? What proportion of the Mueller report becomes public will hinge on many factors: how much classified information and grand jury material shielded from public disclosure it has; how much of it is arguably protected by executive privilege; to what extent it details criminal conduct, and to what extent Mr. Barr may reasonably argue that the Justice Department has an interest in protecting the privacy of those who are innocent. The Watergate “road map” first became available to the public in 2018, when a judge ordered it unsealed almost 45 years after it was handed over to Congress. The Starr Report, in contrast, was released within two days of its transmission to the legislature. With any luck, the time frame for release of the Mueller report will be closer to the latter than to the former. Quinta Jurecic (@qjurecic) is the managing editor of Lawfare.

2019,Opinion | Will Trump Trade the Future for a Hill of Beans?,"The outlines of a potential trade deal with China suggest President Trump once again is prioritizing superficial gains over America’s long-term economic interests. It’s easy to sell soybeans to China. The Chinese are voracious consumers of the world’s raw materials. Until 2018, shiploads of soybeans from the American Midwest streamed to the processing plants that dot the Chinese coast. So there is no reason to applaud the news that the Chinese government has offered to guarantee large purchases of American soybeans as part of a potential trade deal with the United States that the Trump administration is pushing to complete by late March or early April. Instead, it is a worrying sign that the administration may settle for an ephemeral victory at the expense of America’s long-term economic interests. President Trump, by imposing tariffs on Chinese imports, created an opportunity to improve America’s economic relationship with China. It is a chance that may not come again. The American economy is strong, while the Chinese economy is faltering. China still needs American technologies. And despite Mr. Trump’s distaste for multilateralism, much of the rest of the world shares his concerns about China’s economic policies and trade practices. His decision to go it alone, rather than making common cause with longstanding allies, was ill advised, and his tit-for-tat trade war has caused significant pain for many Americans. Farmers and other American exporters lost access to an important market; consumers are paying higher prices on a wide range of goods. But Mr. Trump was right to argue that China has engaged in unfair competition. The question is whether he can win significant concessions. The proper measure of any deal is whether it achieves Mr. Trump’s stated purpose in starting this trade war: persuading China to curb its use of state subsidies, regulations and various kinds of informal interference that limit the ability of American companies to sell goods and services in China, and help Chinese companies sell goods in the United States. Measured as a share of Chinese gross domestic product, imports of American manufactured products have fallen by more than half since 2000, according to calculations by Brad Setser of the Council on Foreign Relations. One reason is that China aggressively subsidizes the creation of homegrown alternatives. To take a noteworthy example, a government-owned company, the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China, is developing a single-aisle passenger jet, the C919. The airplane is intended to reduce China’s spending on Boeing 737s — and to create a new rival for Boeing in the global market. China’s lax enforcement of its environmental and labor laws also amounts to a significant subsidy for Chinese manufacturing, and an inducement to relocate American jobs to China. Robert Lighthizer, Mr. Trump’s lead trade negotiator, has said the administration expects to make progress on these issues. But the United States has focused its demands on making it easier for American companies to operate in China, including protections for intellectual property and more leeway for foreign financial firms. China has accelerated work on a foreign investment law that would codify some of those changes, including a ban on the practice of requiring foreign companies to share proprietary technologies with the Chinese. American corporate expansion in China would benefit shareholders and executives. But it would not create factory jobs for American workers, Mr. Trump’s stated goal. What’s more, any promises the administration secures from China require an effective enforcement mechanism. The United States has failed in past efforts to hold China to its commitments through the World Trade Organization and through bilateral talks. The United States also is seeking an enforceable agreement to prevent exchange rate manipulation. China accelerated its development by saving rather than spending much of what it earned from exports to the United States. This suppressed the value of its currency, making its exports relatively cheap and American imports relatively expensive. The failure of previous administrations to hold China to account on this front has passed beyond remedy, and China is no longer engaged in currency manipulation, at least as defined under American law. But a framework to monitor and address manipulation could deter future shenanigans. And other countries continue to engage in currency manipulation at the expense of the United States, so an effective deal with China could serve as a constructive precedent. The looming risk, however, is that Mr. Trump will accept a deal that allows him to claim a superficial triumph without forcing China to make enduring changes. In particular, the United States should reject any Chinese offer to guarantee large-scale purchases of American agricultural products like soybeans or energy products like liquid natural gas — indeed, guaranteed purchases of any kind. Such deals could serve Mr. Trump’s desire to reduce America’s annual trade deficit with China. But the achievement would be purely cosmetic. The overall balance of America’s imports and exports is important; the balance with any particular country is not. Past administrations have rejected similar offers from China because they run counter to America’s longstanding goal of reducing the Chinese government’s heavy-handed management of the country’s economy. They would also come at the expense of America’s allies. If China buys more soybeans from North Dakota, it would buy fewer from Brazil. An international consensus that China’s trade policies are problematic has increased pressure on China to make meaningful concessions. Maintaining a unified front would help to ensure that China honors its commitments. Grabbing market share is unlikely to further that objective. Mr. Lighthizer has argued, correctly, that any agreement with China is a step in a long-term process. The United States should not strike a deal that undermines those long-term goals in exchange for ephemeral gains. The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

2019,Will a $20 Million Penthouse Damage New York’s ‘Big Ben’?,"[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] The developers had big plans for the space at the top of an old office building in Lower Manhattan that they were turning into condominiums: a penthouse with a tower valued at nearly $21 million. But there was one problem: The tower held a historic clock sometimes described as New York’s Big Ben. The clock has to be “wound” by hand — heavy weights that keep it ticking have to be reset — every week. It would be accessible only by passing through that very expensive apartment at 108 Leonard Street. The developers dealt with the complication by persuading the city’s Landmarks Preservation Commission to allow them to cut off access to the clock tower, even though it is a landmark. The tower is an interior landmark, one of only 120 in New York City. The massive building itself holds the more common exterior landmark designation. Now the penthouse plan is delayed and the clock is at the center of a court fight, just as a wave of anger is rising against the rich, and the privileges they claim. Economists say income and wealth disparities have swelled to levels not seen since the 1920s, helping to fuel the populist backlash that torpedoed Amazon’s plan to build a campus in Queens. Now Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and state lawmakers are pushing a tax on multimillion-dollar second homes that would be the first of its kind in the nation. In the clock tower case, the developers plan to turn the building into more than 140 apartments, with prices starting at about $1.5 million for one-bedroom units, according to listings on StreetEasy. The most expensive was to have been the penthouse with the clock tower. It was to be spread across several levels, with five bedrooms — although one was marked “gym” and another “spa” on the plans. Long outdoor terraces would provide views of the Brooklyn Bridge and the courthouse that television viewers know from “Law and Order.” Michael S. Hiller, a lawyer for the opponents, said the developers were “seeking to privatize an interior landmark for use as a luxury residential apartment so they can turn an additional profit of more than $20 million.” “It’s not as if they can’t make a killing on this property from the sale of the other condominium units,” he added. For now, the clock tower penthouse is not part of the plan, according to Samantha Sax, the chief marketing and design officer for the El Ad Group, one of the developers. A judge in State Supreme Court ruled in the opponents’ favor in 2016, and the Appellate Division upheld the decision in 2017, saying the landmarks commission’s action was “irrational” and based on advice from its lawyer that the judges said was mistaken. “This majestic clock, and its historically significant functioning mechanism, is a perfect example of the very reason the landmarks law exists,” the appellate judges said in their opinion. Referring to the Landmarks Preservation Commission by initials, they added, “The actions of the LPC in this case are contrary to that purpose.” The state’s highest court, the Court of Appeals, heard the case last month, and a ruling is pending. “Our plans may change depending on what comes out of the litigation,” Ms. Sax said, adding that the case was “not for us to win or not win.” “It’s about whatever Landmarks and the city deem appropriate for the use of the clock,” she said. The opponents have directed their dissatisfaction at the landmarks commission. “This is about preserving preservation,” said Tom Bernardin, who, as the founder of a nonprofit group called Save America’s Clocks, is the lead plaintiff in the case. He and the other opponents say that a landmark should be forever and that the Landmarks Preservation Commission should not allow a builder to close off public space. The commission, in a statement, said its job was “to work with all stakeholders, from property owners to the community, to ensure they are protected.” As for the clock tower, “this project includes an incredible restoration of the building and the banking hall” — a space elsewhere in the building that is also covered by the interior landmark designation — “and preserves an important piece of city history.” In court papers, the city’s lawyer echoed that idea, saying the project had “an overwhelming net positive impact” and calling the opponents’ arguments “long on histrionics but not substance.” The city also said the landmarks law “presumes that owners should be afforded ‘maximum latitude’ to use and adapt what is — it bears repeating — private property.” The blocklong building that houses the clock was owned by the city, which sold it in 2013 to the developers. The next year, the developers went to the landmarks commission about the clock tower, saying that it was inaccessible to the public and that they wanted to electrify the clock mechanism without moving it. Some clock experts worry that electrifying it could ruin it. Access is necessary because the clock can only be maintained by hand, say opponents of the penthouse project. For nearly 40 years, the city’s official clock master, Marvin Schneider, did the job. [Meet the man who turns back New York City’s clocks, hand by hand.] That was easy when the city owned the building, and at first, the new owners — the developers — allowed him in. But in March 2015, he said, they told him he was no longer welcome. The clock stopped soon after that, Mr. Schneider said. “Supposedly, the New York City landmarks law was given a jump-start by the demolition of Penn Station” in the 1960s, Mr. Schneider said. “Something of great significance like that should not have been summarily torn down. There should be protection. So that’s pretty much how I felt about the clock. It’s a testament to American pre-eminence in the clock field in the late 19th century, that a clock like that could be made on that scale to function well enough in this age. You could still set your watch by it.” Ms. Sax, the developer’s marketing chief, said that the clock “had to be protected from dust” during construction for the condominium conversion and that “it was dangerous to have access to the space at the time.” Mr. Schneider, 79, was heartbroken. He had spent nearly half his life tending the clock after resuscitating it in 1980. Back then, Mr. Schneider was a supervisor for the city’s Human Resources Administration with no experience with clocks. He took it upon himself to learn what makes them tick. He and a colleague worked on the mechanism of the clock at 108 Leonard Street during their lunch hours, untangling what had become a jumble of chains and gears. Before long he was looking after more than a dozen classic old clocks, several of them at City Hall. In 1992, Mayor David N. Dinkins named him the city’s clock master, a position Mr. Schneider still holds. But in the court case, more is at issue than access to reset the weights and oil the gears. At the Court of Appeals hearing, Associate Judge Eugene M. Fahey asked how the interior landmark designation affected the value of the tower space. “It eliminates the value of it,” answered James P. Rouhandeh, the lawyer for the owners, according to a transcript of the hearing. Mr. Hiller, the opponents’ lawyer, said in an interview that tower clocks like the one in the building once played an important role in the city. They were meant to be seen and heard, their bells chiming the hours because only wealthy people could afford watches. “The rest of us would have had to wait until the bells went off,” Mr. Hiller said. “That’s the category I would have been in.”",The New York Times
2019,Will a Slighted Star Be the Motivation UConn Needs?,"ALBANY — To protest the absence of his star player Napheesa Collier from the recent list of finalists for the Naismith Trophy — awarded annually to the country’s best college basketball player — the UConn women’s coach Geno Auriemma invoked … James Naismith himself. “Dr. Naismith is rolling over in his grave,” Auriemma said this week. “He is. He never envisioned that somebody that good would be left off his list. “I feel bad for her,” he said of Collier. “If she played at any other school, she’d be the front-runner with the numbers she puts up. But she plays at Connecticut, so what are you going to do?” Auriemma’s theory, that Collier’s omission is part of a backlash to a generation of UConn dominance in women’s basketball, is bolstered by a series of decisions made this month. The Huskies, despite a 31-2 regular-season record and a win over the defending national champion, Notre Dame, received a No. 2 seed in this year’s N.C.A.A. tournament. It was the first time since 2006 the Huskies were not a top seed in a region. But it was the rejection of Collier from the Naismith Trophy’s final four — Asia Durr of Louisville, Megan Gustafson of Iowa, Sabrina Ionescu of Oregon and Arike Ogunbowale of Notre Dame — and a similar snub for the Wade Trophy, the national player of the year award given by the Women’s Basketball Coaches Association, that surprised Auriemma and others. Rebecca Lobo, the former UConn star and current ESPN commentator, is a past winner of both awards. She is also a Naismith voter, and said she had Collier on her ballot. When asked whom she considered the best player in the country to be, Lobo said: “Gustafson has had the best season, I think. But that doesn’t make her the best in the country.” By virtually every measure imaginable, a case can be made that that honor belongs to Collier, a senior from O’Fallon, Mo. In win shares, for instance — the advanced metric that seeks to quantify the number of wins a player produces for her team — Collier ranks just ahead of Gustafson for the most valuable player in the country this season. It is this kind of catchall statistic, Collier’s defenders argue, that best expresses her value. Because while her UConn statistics are impressive — 21.1 points and 10.7 rebounds a game — she does not lead the nation in any individual category. Indeed, it could be that Collier’s versatility hurt her with some voters, even though it makes her so important to Connecticut (34-2), which faces Louisville (32-3), a No. 1 seed, in the N.C.A.A. tournament’s Albany Region final on Sunday. As one W.N.B.A. general manager put it, Collier is “the most turnkey” of the top prospects in the 2019 draft, which will be held on April 10. Gustafson is the old-school post scorer. Ionescu is the playmaking point guard. Durr and Ogunbowale are the two-way shooting guards. Collier? She does everything. She’s 6-foot-1, and Auriemma uses her to guard opposing centers at times, sends her out to face-guard wings and even some guards. Despite this steady diet of the best that opponents can throw at UConn, she ranks 92nd out of 733 qualified players in defensive points per possession allowed, at 0.665, ahead of every player on the Naismith and Wade award lists. She has posted a steal percentage above two and a block rate of nearly 5 percent. And she has done all this at the defensive end while ranking second in the country to Gustafson in offensive points per possession, with an assist percentage (21.5) more befitting a point guard, a rebound rate 120th in the country among 3,393 Division I players and a turnover percentage of only 11 percent, reflecting a decision-making process that has W.N.B.A. teams salivating over the chance to add her. One front-office executive labeled her the “best bigger player in the draft.” Collier did not hide her surprise over the snubs, but said she would continue to strive to achieve goals that are measurable and within her control. “Yeah, I thought it was crazy, but I don’t need people voting to tell me I’m the best,” Collier said. “I know I am. Kobe Bryant only won one M.V.P., so that shows the best player doesn’t always win. And to be honest, right now I’m focused on something they can’t vote on, which is winning a national championship.” Louisville Coach Jeff Walz echoed his friend Auriemma’s incredulity at the lack of respect for Collier. “Yeah, I’m surprised,” Walz said. “I’ve always been a huge fan of Napheesa’s game. I watched her in high school a ton. She’s really impressive.” Walz has an elite player of his own in Durr, and her matchup against Collier on Sunday could serve either as affirmation of Durr’s place on the Naismith and Wade lists or as more evidence that Collier belongs there. But to Auriemma, the fact that UConn is even in a position to play in such a game was largely because of Collier. “Can you imagine how many games we’d win if we didn’t have her?” Auriemma said, adding: “I mean, you talk about who means a lot to their team. I don’t know anybody who means more to their team anywhere in the country than Phee. I can’t imagine.” An earlier version of this article misidentified a finalist for the Naismith Trophy. Arike Ogunbowale of Notre Dame — not Teaira McCowan of Mississippi State — is a finalist, along with Asia Durr of Louisville, Megan Gustafson of Iowa and Sabrina Ionescu of Oregon.",The New York Times
2019,Will the Mueller Report Be Made Public? 17 Answers to What May Come Next,"Maggie Haberman, Michael Schmidt, Mark Mazzetti and more of our journalists explained what the submission of the full report means and what may come next. The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, and his team have finished their long-anticipated report after investigating possible Russian interference in the 2016 election and obstruction of justice by President Trump and his associates. [Read about the special counsel’s full report that was delivered to the attorney general on Friday. ] We asked readers what they wanted to know about the report and what may come next. We received more than 600 questions, and our journalists in Washington responded to a selection. It all depends on Attorney General William Barr. He is now reading the report to see whether Mr. Mueller alleges that President Trump broke the law and to determine how much of the investigators’ findings should be made public. Mr. Barr told Congress earlier this year that he wants to release as much as he can. On Friday, he told Congress he could provide lawmakers with an update on Mr. Mueller’s findings as soon as this weekend. But he could be limited in what he can tell Congress, as the special counsel’s report may contain classified information and evidence obtained by a grand jury. — Michael S. Schmidt Mr. Barr has broad discretion, but it is not absolute. He may not lawfully be able to share information that is subject to grand jury secrecy rules absent a court’s permission, for example. He is also likely to acquiesce to any decision by President Trump to assert executive privilege to withhold certain materials, like communications with the president or agency deliberations. During his confirmation hearing, Mr. Barr said he intended to be as transparent as possible, consistent with the Justice Department’s practices and policies. That could mean withholding information about open investigations or about people Mr. Mueller decided not to charge with a crime. There is also a wild card: Mr. Barr has long adhered to a sweeping view of executive power under which the president, as head of the executive branch, has a constitutional right to control the exercise of discretionary policymaking by a subordinate such as himself. — Charlie Savage Mr. Barr could decline to release any information that is classified or subject to grand jury rules. He could also keep any information from the public that is relevant to ongoing investigations. There could also be a looming battle over any information the White House claims is subject to “executive privilege,” which protects confidential discussions between the president and his advisers. — Mark Mazzetti The investigation by the special counsel’s office is over now that Mr. Mueller has provided his final report to the attorney general. So his team is not expected to seek additional charges. Other federal prosecutors who received information related to Mr. Mueller’s investigation could move forward and seek indictments. For instance, federal prosecutors in New York continue to investigate possible crimes that Mr. Mueller referred to them related to campaign finance violations that ensnared Michael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump’s former personal lawyer. Prosecutors are also investigating a top fund-raiser to Mr. Trump and a former lawyer in the Obama administration. Mr. Mueller had referred both cases to other prosecutors. — Adam Goldman Nothing in the Constitution or federal statutes says that sitting presidents are immune from prosecution, and no court has ruled that they have any such shield. But the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel — under the Nixon administration, and again under the Clinton administration — has opined that “structural principles” in the Constitution implicitly bar indicting a president. Essentially, the idea is that the stigma of being indicted and the burden of a trial would unduly interfere with a president’s ability to oversee the executive branch and carry out his constitutional duties, so any indictment would have to wait until he is no longer president — either through impeachment and removal, or because his term is up. This interpretation of the Constitution is disputed, but it is nevertheless binding on Justice Department prosecutors, including Mr. Mueller. — Charlie Savage There have already been referrals that Mr. Mueller has made to federal prosecutors when he has found evidence of a possible crime that he considered outside his purview. The prosecution of Mr. Cohen began as a referral by Mr. Mueller to prosecutors in the Southern District of New York. House Democrats are almost certain to seek the evidence that Mr. Mueller received during the course of his investigation. A number of House committee chairmen are planning to ask executive branch agencies to preserve documents that they provided to the special counsel. — Maggie Haberman We don’t know what’s in the report. I don’t want to speculate on what the worst-case scenario might be. But we do know that the special counsel had been investigating whether the president obstructed justice when he fired James B. Comey, then the F.B.I. director, in May 2017. Mr. Mueller had also been examining Mr. Trump’s ties to Russia and whether anybody associated with his campaign conspired with the Russians during the 2016 election. Mr. Mueller’s investigation led to charges against more than 30 people, but none of them tied the president to a Russian conspiracy. — Adam Goldman We really don’t know the answer, but Mr. Trump’s lawyers consider it one of their greatest accomplishments that he never sat for an interview. In early 2018, Mr. Mueller threatened to subpoena the president, setting off months of negotiations between the special counsel’s office and Mr. Trump’s lawyers. Ultimately, in November, Mr. Trump answered several questions in writing about what occurred during the campaign. But he refused to answer questions about his time in office — including whether he tried to obstruct justice. This meant that Mr. Mueller’s prosecutors were only left with the statements of other witnesses when they sought to determine why Mr. Trump may have interfered with the investigation. Mr. Trump’s lawyers believed heading off an interview was such a great success because if he had testified, he would have been at risk of making an inaccurate statement and increasing his criminal exposure. — Michael S. Schmidt Good question, we don’t know. Disney World? We do know that some members of his team intend to return to their jobs at law firms in New York and Washington, and others to return to the Justice Department. It has been reported that Andrew Weissmann, one of the senior members of the team, intends to teach at New York University. As for Mr. Mueller, maybe he’ll also go back to working at a law firm or retire. It’s certainly possible that one or more of the House committees investigating various aspects of the case and Mr. Trump will want to call him to testify, though Mr. Barr, the attorney general, will have a say in whether he can do so. — Mark Mazzetti In his letter to Congress on Friday, Mr. Barr said he “may be in a position to advise you of the Special Counsel’s principal conclusions as soon as this weekend.” But we don’t know what is in the underlying report. Here are some categories of elements that may raise legal or policy concerns about disclosure to Congress or the public: 1. Any highly classified information, such as something that could help the Russian government identify and take out an intelligence source; 2. Anything that remains relevant to an ongoing investigation, such as those that Mr. Mueller spun off to regular prosecutors or the ongoing counterintelligence investigation into Russia; 3. Testimony and files that were presented to the grand jury and so are subject to a federal rule of criminal procedure that generally forbids disclosure of such material absent a court order; 4. Negative information about people whom prosecutors scrutinized but decided not to charge with a crime, which the Justice Department normally does not make public (this is why Mr. Comey’s news conference about Hillary Clinton’s email server was so broadly condemned by other law enforcement officials); 5. Internal executive branch information, like confidential communications with the president or agency deliberations, that could be subject to a claim of executive privilege. — Charlie Savage In short, yes. Congress can subpoena just about anything it wants, but that does not mean lawmakers will do so or that they will be successful in getting what they want. Democrats have made abundantly clear that they will be satisfied with nothing less than Mr. Mueller’s full report and access to his underlying evidence. They will start by asking for the Justice Department to share all that information voluntarily. If the department resists, a committee could issue a subpoena to try to compel it to produce the relevant documents. What comes next is likely complicated. There are several reasons the Justice Department might be unwilling to just hand over classified or grand jury information, even under subpoena. In that case, Congress could sue to try to enforce its demand. Then it would be up to the courts to decide who gets to see what. — Nicholas Fandos The White House counsel’s office anticipates being able to review the report to raise possible objections related to executive privilege. We have no sense right now how long that will take, but any effort by the White House to bar the release of elements of the report is sure to set off a political and legal battle. Mr. Barr said on Friday that he anticipates being able to brief Congress within a few days about the special counsel’s “principal conclusions.” But it is not clear how much of the report’s details and underlying documentation he will ultimately provide to Congress and, by extension, the public. Mr. Barr appeared to be lowering expectations during his Senate confirmation hearings when he said he wanted to be as transparent as possible but might provide simply a summary to Congress. — Maggie Haberman We have no information that the full report will be made available to state or federal prosecutors. But during the course of his investigation, Mr. Mueller has referred a number of cases to other federal prosecutors in New York and Washington. — Adam Goldman We still don’t know what’s in the report. In terms of electoral politics, you’re right — it might not fundamentally change the partisan divide over Mr. Trump. His supporters have shown a willingness to stay with him in the face of allegations and behavior that might have doomed a more traditional politician. But you could argue that this report has an importance that goes well beyond partisan politics, reflecting an investigation that yielded substantial results — not least in establishing the degree of Russian interference in the 2016 election. Don’t forget that half a dozen Trump aides have been indicted or convicted. Regardless of Mr. Mueller’s conclusions, Democrats in the House are pressing ahead on issues such as whether Mr. Trump obstructed justice after becoming president. The Democrats say Mr. Barr needs to make as much of Mr. Mueller’s findings public as soon as possible because the American people deserve an accounting of what went on. — Michael S. Schmidt If anyone is to be indicted down the road, it won’t be by Mr. Mueller. It’s now clear that his team won’t try to charge anyone else, because his work is done. To be sure, there are now numerous, ongoing investigations by other federal prosecutors that could mean legal peril for Mr. Trump’s advisers or family members. Remember that in the investigation being run by prosecutors in the Southern District of New York, Mr. Cohen implicated the president in a scheme to pay off two women before the 2016 election. But given Justice Department rules, there isn’t any expectation that Mr. Trump would be in legal jeopardy as long as he’s in the White House. — Mark Mazzetti As of Sept. 30, 2018, the special counsel’s investigation had cost more than $25 million. More than $12 million of that was direct spending by Mr. Mueller’s team. That amount will increase once the special counsel’s office submits its final list of expenses. Those costs included the expenses of Justice Department personnel and other resources that supported the special counsel office. The special counsel says the Justice Department would have incurred those expenses for the “investigations irrespective of the existence of the (special counsel office).” The special counsel also seized more millions in property and fines. — Adam Goldman We wish we knew. Keep in mind there are likely to be two reports: one prepared by Mr. Mueller for the Justice Department and another prepared by Mr. Barr to be shared with Congress and the public. Both reports could be as short as a few pages, or considerably longer. And Mr. Barr could well choose to give the public a more concise report than Mr. Mueller gave him. That said, a senior Justice Department official told reporters on Friday that the report delivered by Mr. Mueller had been “comprehensive.” — Nicholas Fandos Correction: March 26, 2019An earlier version of this article misstated Robert S. Mueller III’s work status before he became the special counsel. Mr. Mueller was a partner at a law firm; he was not retired. Correction: March 22, 2019An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of a senior member of Mr. Mueller’s team. He is Andrew Weissmann, not Weissman.

2019,Will the Mueller Report Be Made Public? Answers to 6 Key Questions,"WASHINGTON — The long-awaited special counsel report is complete, 675 days after Robert S. Mueller III was named to oversee the investigation into Russia’s election interference, whether any Trump associates coordinated with that plot and whether President Trump tried to obstruct justice. Attorney General William P. Barr has the document and notified lawmakers. But it has yet to be made public, and the path to its potential release — or the release of the facts it contains — is complicated. That remains to be seen. Some information is expected to come out because Mr. Barr has to update Congress, but that does not mean the entire report will be public. Mr. Barr sent a letter to the leaders of Congress’s judiciary committees that the special counsel investigation has been completed, which he is required to do, according to the special counsel regulation. Mr. Barr said that he was reviewing Mr. Mueller’s report and might be able to provide lawmakers with the special counsel’s “principal conclusions” as early as this weekend. The regulation also requires that Mr. Barr tell the lawmakers whether he or his predecessors overseeing it opposed any significant step that Mr. Mueller sought to take. Mr. Barr said “there were no such instances” during the investigation. The special counsel regulation sets no time frame or deadline for when Mr. Barr must provide this information to Congress. Mr. Barr is required only to provide lawmakers with very basic facts. He would be operating within the guidelines of the regulation if he were to give Congress a bare-bones notification that Mr. Mueller had concluded his work. In his letter on Friday, Mr. Barr said he planned to consult with the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, and Mr. Mueller about what other details from the report could be given to Congress and the public. According to the Justice Department’s explanation of the regulation, published in the Federal Register in 1999, Mr. Barr has to determine whether releasing the report, or portions of it, is in the public’s interest. Mr. Barr has said repeatedly that he would release as much as he could from the report within the parameters of the special counsel regulations. But, first, Mr. Barr and his aides will have to review the report to determine whether any information is classified or otherwise sensitive, or protected by privacy laws or executive privilege, which can be invoked for sensitive law enforcement materials. The back and forth on what information Congress can and cannot have will most likely be drawn out and have to be resolved by a court. No. Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, has already called for the entire report, without redactions, to be provided to lawmakers. “Regulations governing Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation do not prohibit Attorney General Barr from disclosing Mueller’s final report and investigative materials to Congress,” Ms. Feinstein said in February. And the House overwhelmingly passed a resolution calling for the report to be made public — a largely symbolic move to pressure Mr. Barr publicly to release it. Democrats in the House have also already made the case that seeing the report in its entirety is critical to their ability to conduct oversight and determine whether to move forward with impeachment proceedings. “Congress could be the only institution currently situated to act on evidence of the president’s misconduct,” the chairmen of several House committees wrote in a Feb. 22 letter to Mr. Barr. Further, they wrote, Congress should decide what should be redacted in the report. Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California has said that she does not support impeaching Mr. Trump without support from Republican lawmakers because it is too divisive for the country. Barring new shocking revelations about Mr. Trump, Democrats would prefer to beat Mr. Trump in the 2020 presidential election. Lawmakers have a few options to try to make public details of the investigation, though some could involve years of litigation. They could start issuing subpoenas to Mr. Barr, who could ignore them or refuse them. They could also subpoena Mr. Mueller’s testimony. The Justice Department is likely to resist those demands. If that happens, lawmakers could hold them in contempt and ask the United States attorney for the District of Columbia to prosecute. Lawmakers could also sue to try to force the Trump administration to hand over the requested material. Such litigation could go on for years. Here are some pieces of the jigsaw puzzle. The full picture is missing. The White House could also try to negotiate with Congress, such as making some witnesses available, but not all, said Richard H. Pildes, a constitutional law professor at New York University Law School. The White House is also likely to challenge some requests and assert that the requested information is available to lawmakers through other means. Lawmakers can also use their bully pulpits to pressure Mr. Barr publicly for more information and tie up the Justice Department in hearings and subpoena fights that last for the rest of Mr. Trump’s time in office. That is not clear. Mr. Trump is Mr. Barr’s boss, and there is nothing to stop Mr. Barr from immediately sharing the report with the White House, Mr. Pildes said. But doing so would violate the Justice Department’s longstanding independence from the White House, said Jack L. Goldsmith, a Harvard Law professor who ran the department’s Office of Legal Counsel during the George W. Bush administration. And if the Mueller report includes grand jury testimony, which is protected under federal law, the number of people permitted to see the report shrinks significantly. Mr. Trump, as president, would be permitted to see it in certain circumstances. For example, according to a 1993 opinion by the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel, grand jury information may be disclosed to the president if it relates to his role in helping the department decide how to enforce the law, or if it relates to a national security threat. In another Justice Department legal opinion, written in 2000, the president may have access to grand jury material if it is used as part of his consideration for a pardon. There has been a great deal of discussion about whether Mr. Trump would give presidential pardons to his former aides who have been charged in Mr. Mueller’s investigation, such as Paul Manafort, his former campaign chairman who was sentenced to a total of seven and a half years in prison in two cases. Even if Mr. Mueller and Mr. Barr know that what Mr. Trump is saying publicly is not true, there is no apparent legal duty for the Justice Department to correct the president. Unlikely. First, collusion has no legal definition, though it has become a term of art as a shorthand reference to the Russia investigation. A key question in the special counsel investigation concerns whether Mr. Trump or his campaign was coordinating with Russia to try to affect the outcome of the 2016 presidential election. If Mr. Mueller’s investigation ends without charging Mr. Trump or his aides with conspiracy, some may interpret that to be a “no collusion” finding. Mr. Trump consistently cites government officials and the lack of collusion charges as evidence that there was never collusion between his campaign and Russia.

2019,Will the Mueller Report Be Made Public? Answers to 6 Key Questions,"WASHINGTON — The long-awaited special counsel report is complete, 675 days after Robert S. Mueller III was named to oversee the investigation into Russia’s election interference, whether any Trump associates coordinated with that plot and whether President Trump tried to obstruct justice. Attorney General William P. Barr has the document and notified lawmakers. But it has yet to be made public, and the path to its potential release — or the release of the facts it contains — is complicated. That remains to be seen. Some information is expected to come out because Mr. Barr has to update Congress, but that does not mean the entire report will be public. Mr. Barr sent a letter to the leaders of Congress’s judiciary committees that the special counsel investigation has been completed, which he is required to do, according to the special counsel regulation. Mr. Barr said that he was reviewing Mr. Mueller’s report and might be able to provide lawmakers with the special counsel’s “principal conclusions” as early as this weekend. The regulation also requires that Mr. Barr tell the lawmakers whether he or his predecessors overseeing it opposed any significant step that Mr. Mueller sought to take. Mr. Barr said “there were no such instances” during the investigation. The special counsel regulation sets no time frame or deadline for when Mr. Barr must provide this information to Congress. Mr. Barr is required only to provide lawmakers with very basic facts. He would be operating within the guidelines of the regulation if he were to give Congress a bare-bones notification that Mr. Mueller had concluded his work. In his letter on Friday, Mr. Barr said he planned to consult with the deputy attorney general, Rod J.

2019,Will the Supreme Court End Gerrymandering? Arguments Begin This Week,"GREENSBORO, N.C. — On the east side of Greensboro, the boundary separating North Carolina’s 6th and 13th congressional districts takes an abrupt detour. The line yanks hard to the west until it reaches Laurel Street, turns northward, and disappears into the brown-brick campus of North Carolina A&T State University, where it neatly bisects the nation’s largest historically black college. Five dormitories lie in the 6th district; seven in the 13th. All are in unassailably Republican territory, as the line splits both the university and the city’s mostly Democratic 285,000 residents between two conservative rural bastions. Nikolaus Knight, a senior and political science major, was assigned to a new dormitory after his freshman year — and had to re-register to vote as a result. “We had the power as a student body to sway an election,” he said. “And our voice as a campus was stripped away when we were cut in half.” This is the power of mapmaking by the state’s Republican legislature, which drew new political borders three years ago that allowed Republicans to capture 10 of this state’s 13 House seats last fall, even though nearly half of all House votes went to Democratic candidates. Nobody disputes that the North Carolina map was drafted to elect a maximum number of Republicans to the House, not even the Republicans themselves. The map has a 10-3 Republican tilt, one of its drafters said, “because I do not believe it’s possible to draw a map with 11 Republicans and two Democrats.” On Tuesday, the Supreme Court will hear arguments over whether such partisanship violates the Constitution. One case involves the Republican-drawn map in North Carolina. A companion case centers on Maryland’s 6th Congressional District, which Democrats admit they redrew in 2011 to make it harder for the Republican incumbent there to win re-election. The two cases hold the potential to set the course of American politics for generations. A decision to rein in partisan gerrymanders could reshape House maps in a number of states, largely but not exclusively to the benefit of Democrats. A decision not to rein in the mapmakers would give both political parties carte blanche to entrench themselves and hogtie their opponents when state legislatures draw the next decade’s House districts in 2021. The justices have dodged the issue of gerrymandering for decades, gridlocked over whether it is even possible to distinguish acceptably partisan maps from unconstitutional ones. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. worried aloud last year that creating a legal standard to identify partisan gerrymanders would turn the court into a sort of electoral kingmaker. But now the North Carolina House map could force him and other justices to confront the issue head-on. The redrawing of Maryland’s House map by Democrats was also baldly political, ousting a 20-year Republican incumbent by infusing the rural 6th District with tens of thousands of urban Democrats. But compared with the lawmakers in North Carolina, the Maryland Democrats were restrained, turning down maps that would have wiped out the state’s other Republican-leaning House district as well. Created three years ago, the North Carolina map was drawn for overtly partisan reasons. Indeed, the Republican chairman of the state House Elections Committee, Representative David R. Lewis, opened the drafting session by saying, “I acknowledge freely that this would be a political gerrymander.” Republicans ordered that the next map create “as many districts as possible in which G.O.P. candidates would be able to successfully compete for office.” The result, drawn by the master Republican redistricting strategist Thomas B. Hofeller, met that mandate. It anchored three overwhelmingly Democratic districts in liberal cities — Charlotte, Raleigh and Durham. The remaining urban strongholds, in Asheville, Fayetteville and Greensboro-Winston-Salem, were filleted along party lines, with their most Democratic areas absorbed by otherwise rural Republican territories. Democrats in the state had done their share of gerrymandering in the past, but it was nowhere near what the Republicans were now doing. The map eliminated any competition for House seats in all but the most exceptional circumstances. In November, amid the strongest national Democratic electoral performance since Watergate, only one of the 10 Republican-held House seats was in serious jeopardy (that race, in the 9th Congressional District, was marred by election fraud complaints and will be rerun this summer). Democrats won the three districts that were gerrymandered in their favor by an average of 45 percentage points. That highlights collateral damage from gerrymanders that is sometimes overlooked: Not only do they entrench a majority party, but they weaken the opposition as well. Candidates don’t want to run losing races, and donors and parties don’t want to support them. Pete Glidewell can testify to that. Mr. Glidewell, a real-estate agent and Democratic activist in Elon, about 15 miles from Greensboro, ran in 2016 against the incumbent Republican in the newly drawn Sixth Congressional District, Mark Walker. Mr. Walker had won in 2014 with nearly 59 percent of the vote; Mr. Glidewell was the only Democrat to oppose him. “I thought I was better qualified than him,” he said. “I still do.” Mr. Glidewell soon got a call from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the arm of the Democratic Party that doles out money and tactical support to House candidates. They were seeking a donation. “I said, ‘Ma’am, I am actually running for Congress in this district, and I wish you’d pass along that I need as much help as you say you do,’” he recalled. But to the committee, Mr. Glidewell was a lost cause. “They wouldn’t talk to me,” he said. In the campaign that followed, Mr. Glidewell’s largest contribution, $5,400, came from his wife. His campaign cost $93,300, most of it spent on internet advertising, yard signs and car magnets. “No television,” he said. “We couldn’t afford it.” Mr. Walker’s campaign spent more than that — $94,716, to be precise — on fund-raising consultants alone. That November, Mr. Walker shellacked Mr. Glidewell, 59 percent to 41 percent, and had more than $225,000 in unspent donations in the bank. Other incumbent House members have leftover funds from past campaigns, too — $2.4 million, in one case. “So it’s even more impossible to get a credible opponent,” Mr. Glidewell said. Tim Moreland is a Democratic political operative in Guilford County, where Greensboro is located. He said that uncompetitive districts lead to lazy incumbents, less-qualified challengers and election campaigns that provide little clarity. “We get a lot of politicians who have been in seats for a very long time,” he said. “They’ve never had to run a competitive election, or raise a lot of money, or work to build relationships with the other party. Input from the average voter matters less and less.” Some academics dispute it, but political veterans say gerrymanders widen political divisions because incumbents have no incentive to court moderates and swing voters. “If the most competitive race you’ve got is against some right-wing or left-wing person in the primary, and you don’t have to worry about the general election, you end up with representatives who aren’t really representative,” Thomas Mills, a onetime Democratic campaign consultant who ran his own losing campaign for a gerrymandered House seat in 2016, said in an interview. The case against partisan gerrymanders is not merely a Democratic one. Republican candidates in North Carolina’s three safe Democratic House seats also were disenfranchised, along with their supporters. So were Republicans in Maryland’s 6th District. The plaintiffs in the North Carolina and Maryland cases argue that the maps violate the Constitution in a number of ways. They say the maps effectively punish supporters of gerrymandered candidates for expressing their political preference, violating both the First Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment, which guarantees equal treatment under the law. And they say the maps pervert Article One of the Constitution, whose rationale for frequent House elections was to make the chamber’s members more responsive to the American people. But with a gerrymander, they argue, the people have almost no voice. Yet even if a majority of the justices agree, that may not carry the day for the opponents of gerrymanders. The question of how to spot rigged maps still remains: Since no political map is completely free of bias, how do judges distinguish between the acceptable and the unacceptable? Defenders of North Carolina and Maryland’s maps say the court has no business trying, and will shred its reputation for above-the-fray fairness if it starts deciding whether maps favor one party or another. Partisan gerrymandering, they say, is a political issue best addressed by the politicians in Congress and the states. But that is precisely the issue, voting-rights advocates say: Gerrymanders are creations of lawmakers, who have seldom had much interest in curbing their own power. And the modern tools of map-drawing — powerful computers and software, and an unprecedented cascade of data on voters — have allowed drafters to turn political districts into near-impregnable fortresses that can sustain a party’s hold on power from one redistricting cycle to the next. “Because of the availability of data, we can aggregate voting patterns and organize them in a way that the political system can be controlled by decision makers,” said Douglas Berger, a Durham lawyer and a plaintiff in one of the North Carolina lawsuits. He speaks from experience. His firm’s political-action committee uses data analytics to assess a candidate’s prospects with ever-greater precision before deciding whether to donate to a campaign. Partly because of that, the PAC largely steers clear of supporting North Carolina candidates for the House. Yet technology may also provide an answer to the conundrum that has kept the court from acting. Social scientists have devised a host of new yardsticks in recent years for gauging partisan leanings in maps. Perhaps most important among them is that advances in computing now permit experts to randomly generate thousands and even millions of hypothetical maps, all drawn using the same criteria, that can be compared with the maps challenged in gerrymander trials. Mathematical formulas can then calculate whether a challenged map is part of the pack in its partisan tilt or is at the extremes — a “statistical outlier,” in redistricting parlance. That already has been done in the federal trial challenging the North Carolina gerrymander. There, an expert witness for the plaintiffs randomly generated 3,000 simulated congressional district maps using the same demographic data as the official map that has regularly awarded Republicans 10 of 13 seats. None of the 3,000 gave the party more than nine seats.",The New York Times
2019,"Opinion | William Barr, Media Handler","Ten unanswered questions about the attorney general’s conveniently brief letter. Opinion Columnist This article is part of David Leonhardt’s newsletter. You can sign up here to receive it each weekday. William Barr did a skillful job of managing the news media this weekend. He released a four-page letter summarizing Robert Mueller’s investigation, which rightly received blanket coverage, since it was the only official description of the investigation. But I think much of the media was too credulous about Barr’s letter, producing banner headlines and chyrons that treated it as an objective summary of Mueller’s work rather than as a political document meant to make President Trump look good. And it was very much a political document. Barr, the attorney general, works for Trump. Before he joined the administration, he made clear that he felt some disdain for the Mueller investigation — especially about whether Trump obstructed justice. That disdain surely increased his chances of being appointed attorney general. Trump fired the previous holder of the job, after all, for not doing more to control the Russia investigation. [Listen to “The Argument” podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.] It’s still possible that Barr’s summary of Mueller’s report is fair. But the longer that Barr waits to release a fuller version of the report, the more suspicious we should be. Barr has been around Washington a long time. He understands that an initial story line can matter more than the details that emerge later. Barr has to be very happy with the media coverage he has received over the past two days. “The Barr summary did its job: control the narrative and turn ‘not enough to charge on this’ into ‘no issues with Russia ever,’” as Tom Nichols, a national security expert, wrote. Susan Hennessey of Lawfare put it this way: “It is possible that the report really does say that there is no evidence. It’s also possible there’s a mountain of evidence just short of the criminal standard. Or something in between. Any of that would be consistent with Barr’s summary.” Ten questions As I wrote yesterday, I now assume that the Trump campaign did not coordinate with Russia in a significant way. But I also still have a lot of questions that Barr’s letter didn’t answer. Here are 10 big questions, compiled with help from articles that appeared elsewhere in the last two days; you’ll find links to them at the bottom. 1. Did Robert Mueller find evidence that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia, but that the collusion was not criminal? 2. Related: Why did Barr’s four-page summary appear to define coordination with Russia so narrowly — as an “agreement” between the Trump campaign and the Russian government — and does this word choice suggest that the Mueller investigation found coordination that did not rise to the level of an agreement? 3. What did Mueller discover about Paul Manafort — Trump’s campaign chairman — having shared poll data with a political operative who had apparent ties to Russian military intelligence? (Manafort’s lawyers inadvertently revealed those interactions earlier this year.) 4. Why did Trump and his associates repeatedly lie about their contacts with Russians? 5. Why did Mueller not charge Jerome Corsi, a conservative conspiracy promulgator and an associate of Roger Stone, despite reportedly engaging in plea negotiations with Corsi last year? 6. Does the arrest of Maria Butina, a Russian spy with ties to the National Rifle Association, have anything to do with Mueller’s investigation? 7. Did Mueller find evidence that the activities of Trump or his aides have compromised national security? 8. Did Mueller find any evidence of efforts by the United Arab Emirates and other Middle Eastern countries to influence the 2016 election? 9. Did Mueller issue no decision about obstruction of justice because he believed a sitting president could not be charged with a crime — and thus the decision was ultimately a political matter, to be decided by Congress, rather than a legal one? 10. Did Mueller investigate the possibility that Trump’s businesses helped Russian criminals launder money before he became president, or did Mueller consider this beyond the scope of his investigation? (If he investigated and found no evidence, it would reduce the urgency for the House to pursue this matter.) For more, see Asha Rangappa, a former F.B.I. agent, writing for CNN; Adam Davidson in The New Yorker; Shane Harris of The Washington Post; Garrett Graff, who wrote a book about Mueller’s F.B.I., in Wired; and Nick Akerman, a former Watergate prosecutor, in Washingtonian magazine.

2019,"William Barr, Michael Avenatti, Apple: Your Tuesday Briefing","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning, We’re continuing to cover the fallout from the special counsel’s report, a congestion pricing plan for New York City drivers and a new effort by the British Parliament to figure out a Brexit plan. Mr. Trump and his Republican allies vowed on Monday to pursue and even punish those responsible for the special counsel’s Russia investigation now that it has ended without implicating him or his campaign. The president denounced “treasonous” people who should be investigated themselves, and the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee suggested a separate inquiry into potential anti-Trump bias at the F.B.I. The attorney general: William Barr’s decision to declare that Mr. Trump had not committed a crime — despite the fact that the special counsel, Robert Mueller, stopped short of exonerating the president — has renewed a debate about the role of American law enforcement in politically charged investigations. The special counsel: Now that his report has been filed, Mr. Mueller is poised to return to civilian life as a figure of mystery and fascination. The news media: Journalists faced bipartisan criticism after the special counsel found that the Trump campaign had not conspired with Russia. Dean Baquet, the executive editor of The Times, said. “We wrote a lot about Russia, and I have no regrets. It’s not our job to determine whether or not there was illegality.” The Daily: In today’s episode, a reporter discusses Mr. Barr’s determination that Mr. Trump had not illegally obstructed justice. A plan to install electronic tolls for vehicles entering the busiest stretches of Manhattan would make the city the first in the U.S. to use congestion pricing. State lawmakers agreed on Monday that the plan was necessary to help pay for much-needed repairs to the subway system. Congestion pricing has helped unclog streets in places like London, Singapore and Stockholm, although the plans have been criticized as an unfair tax. What’s next: Many specifics, including the exact price for entering Manhattan’s main business district, are still being considered. The leader of the State Assembly seemed confident on Monday that a deal could be reached before a budget deadline on April 1. For decades, the Sackler family has generously supported museums around the world, as well as medical and educational institutions including Columbia and Oxford. But some beneficiaries are reconsidering their relationship with the family because of its ties to Purdue Pharma, the maker of the frequently abused painkiller OxyContin. More than 200,000 people in the U.S. have died from overdoses involving OxyContin and other prescription opioids in the past two decades. Background: The scrutiny of the Sacklers is part of a broader reckoning in the museum world about who sits on boards and bankrolls programs. The Southern Poverty Law Center is one of the nation’s wealthiest and best-known legal advocacy groups. Last year, it identified over 1,000 hate groups across the U.S. The center is now in an uproar. Its founder, Morris Dees, above, has been fired, and other top executives have quit as staff members raise accusations of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. Parliament takes control: British lawmakers on Monday passed an amendment giving themselves the power to vote on alternatives to Prime Minister Theresa May’s plan for exiting the European Union. Britain will remain in the bloc until at least April 12, although what happens after that is currently anyone’s guess. Boeing tests: During recent simulations of a doomed Indonesian flight involving a 737 Max plane, pilots discovered that they had less than 40 seconds to override an automated system. Trump-Netanyahu meeting: President Trump formally recognized Israel’s authority over the long-disputed Golan Heights as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited the White House on Monday. Vote to override veto: The House will try today to override President Trump’s veto of its resolution to block his national emergency declaration. On Monday, Patrick Shanahan, the acting defense secretary, authorized the transfer of up to $1 billion from military personnel funding toward the construction of a wall on the border with Mexico. Michael Avenatti arrest: Federal prosecutors have accused the lawyer best known for representing the pornographic film star Stormy Daniels of attempting to extort millions of dollars from Nike. Apple’s new offerings: The iPhone maker has announced monthly subscription services for TV programming, video games and news, as well as a credit card. Snapshot: Above, a “super bloom” of wildflowers near Hemet, Calif. The flowers in the hills near Los Angeles have blossomed after heavy winter rains, attracting droves of smartphone-equipped fans. Late-night comedy: Stephen Colbert offered a concession: “Fair is fair. Barr says Mueller says there was no collusion between Trump and Russia,” he said. “So we have to cross collusion off the list of reasons Trump is unfit to be president.” What we’re listening to: This episode of Radiolab, exploring the greatest mysteries in listeners’ lives. There’s a moment when a reporter asks if there is any correlation between a common subway noise and “West Side Story,” writes Remy Tumin, a member of the briefings team. “I think it will bring a smile to your face as it did mine.” Cook: You probably know French onion soup, but what about French onion grilled cheese? Listen: The rapper Silvana Imam rails against Sweden’s racism and sexism in her music, and many see her success as a reflection of her country’s polarized political climate. Watch: “The Act” on Hulu is a disturbing TV mini-series in which a woman discovers that her lifelong debilitating illnesses are fabrications of her mother. We spoke with the show’s creator, who in 2016 wrote a news account about the case. Go: The Andy Warhol exhibition at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York closes on Sunday. Our critic explains why you shouldn’t miss it. Smarter Living: Scientists have begun to determine how we can be more intentional about forgetting, and it’s not just about suppression. Memory depends on a biochemical process that rebuilds the recalled scene, and that retrieval makes the recollection temporarily vulnerable to incremental revisions — say, refocusing less on the painful part and more on assistance or resilience afterward.

Today is the 40th anniversary of the signing of the Egypt-Israeli peace treaty, a direct offshoot of the 1978 Camp David accords. The landmark accords were hashed out in tense talks at Camp David, the rustic presidential retreat in the Catoctin Mountains of Maryland. President Jimmy Carter carried messages and proposals between the cabin of Prime Minister Menachem Begin of Israel and that of President Anwar Sadat of Egypt. The retreat as a vacation spot captured the affection of President Franklin Roosevelt, but not of all his successors. Barack Obama preferred Hawaii or Martha’s Vineyard, Mass. President Trump goes to his clubs in Palm Beach, Fla., and Bedminster, N.J., rather than Camp David. “It’s nice. You’d like it,” Mr. Trump once said of Camp David, adding, “You know how long you’d like it? For about 30 minutes.” The Navy maintains Camp David as an active military base, ready for any president who makes the 30-minute helicopter ride from the White House. A recent Back Story mentioned that NASA was planning its first all-female spacewalk this month. The agency announced on Monday that the milestone had been canceled. The reason?

2019,"William C. Powers Jr., 72, Author of Scathing Enron Report, Is Dead","William C. Powers Jr., a long-serving president of the University of Texas who earlier produced a scathing report in 2002 on the wrongdoing that led to the collapse of the Enron Corporation, died on Sunday in Austin. He was 72. His family said the cause was complications of a fall and of oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy, a rare, adult-onset muscle disorder. Mr. Powers was president of the University of Texas at Austin, the flagship campus of the state’s sprawling university system, from 2006 to 2015. But it was while he was a top legal scholar and dean of the University of Texas law school that he came to national prominence. In 2001 he joined Enron’s board and agreed to lead a committee to investigate the company’s financial dealings. Its findings led to one of the nation’s largest corporate scandals and the collapse of Enron, a Houston-based energy company that had started to implode in 2000. His blistering 217-page report found a culture of deception, self-dealing and self-enrichment at Enron. Controls, it said, had failed at almost every level, and the losers were the company’s shareholders, to the tune of more than $60 billion. Some critics had feared that Mr. Powers would be soft on Enron because the company had donated $3.5 million to the University of Texas, including $276,000 to the law school. But those concerns evaporated once the report came out and Mr. Powers testified before Congress, saying that what he had found was “absolutely appalling.” The Powers Report said that Enron executives had intentionally manipulated the company’s profits, inflating them by almost $1 billion. The report, which served as a road map for more than a dozen congressional and executive branch investigations, placed the blame squarely on Kenneth L. Lay, Enron’s longtime chairman and chief executive, and his protégé, Jeffrey K. Skilling, who was president and the next chief executive. Mr. Skilling, who was convicted on fraud and conspiracy charges in 2006, was released from federal custody last month after serving 12 years of a 24-year sentence; Mr. Lay faced the possibility of the rest of his life in prison but died of coronary artery disease at 64 before he was sentenced. After issuing his report, Mr. Powers returned to the law school, where he was an expert on product-liability law. He served as dean until 2005, when he was named president of the university. During his tenure as president, Mr. Powers spent much of his time clashing with Texas Gov. Rick Perry, a Republican, over the direction of the university and its funding. Still, he completed an eight-year fund-raising campaign that netted $3.1 billion and helped establish the university’s Dell Medical School. In addition, he championed affirmative-action programs, carrying the fight to the United States Supreme Court. In Fisher v. University of Texas, a landmark 2016 ruling, the court said that the university could consider race as one of several factors in undergraduate admissions. William Charles Powers Jr. was born on May 30, 1946, in Los Angeles. His father was an educator,his mother, Mildred Rose (Fluke) Powers, a homemaker. He received his bachelor’s degree in chemistry from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1967 and spent three years in the Navy, stationed in Bahrain. He then attended Harvard Law School, where he was managing editor of Harvard Law Review. He received his degree in 1973. Mr. Powers taught at the law schools of Southern Methodist University, the University of Michigan and the University of Washington before moving to the University of Texas at Austin to teach in 1977. He married Karen Devendorf in 1967; they divorced in 1981. In 1983, he married Kim Heilbrun, who survives him, as do his sons, Matt and Reid; his daughters, Kate, Allison and Annie Powers; six grandchildren; and his sister, Susan Powers. Another sister, Patricia Bemis, died in 2015. As president of the university Mr. Powers faced repeated challenges from Mr. Perry, who wanted the university to be run more like a business. The governor tried to remove professors whom he considered elitists, defund expensive research labs and measure the productivity of faculty members on spreadsheets so that they could be paid according to the revenue they brought in. Mr. Powers rejected this approach, defending research investments and the broader goals of a liberal arts education. “Bill put every ounce of himself into defending the soul of our university,” Gregory L. Fenves, Mr. Powers’ successor as president, said in a statement. “He bravely stood up for what was right.” His clash with the governor put Mr. Powers at the center of a national debate over the value and mission of research universities at a time when higher education was becoming more and more costly. College presidents across the country sided with Mr. Powers and elected him chairman of the Association of American Universities in 2013. Nevertheless, Mr. Powers agreed to resign under pressure. But with the support of much of the faculty, students and donors, he was able to delay his departure until June 2015. The previous year, his adversaries had backed an investigation into reports that Mr. Powers had pressed for dozens of students who were well-connected but who had poor grades to be admitted to the university over the objections of the admissions staff. The investigation found in early 2015 that he had admitted 73 such students over six years. He acknowledged doing so, but defended their admission, saying that the students’ families knew wealthy donors and lawmakers who controlled state funding for the university, and that admitting them would benefit the university in the long run. The investigators concluded that final admissions decisions were the prerogative of the president, that no laws had been broken and that no quid pro quos had been offered or accepted. No disciplinary action was taken against Mr. Powers. Despite his tumultuous tenure, Mr. Powers ended up as the second-longest serving president in university’s history.",The New York Times
2019,William Forsythe: ‘Isn’t Ballet Delightful?’,"The choreographer has recently made an abrupt change in creative direction — back to ballet. In “Full on Forsythe,” Boston Ballet will show off his new moves. The choreographer William Forsythe in Boston.CreditCreditKayana Szymczak for The New York Times BOSTON — “Give me a little booty! Show off! Glissade, glissade, tombé, ballonné, piqué, yessssss!” William Forsythe called out ballet steps, bouncing through them on sneakered feet. “Let’s go, let’s go!” sang Barry White as “Sha La La Means I Love You” played over the speakers. A large group of dancers at Boston Ballet swayed their hips and shoulders to the infectious rhythms, as they watched two principals whirl through a sequence that Mr. Forsythe had just choreographed — part of a new piece he is creating here for “Full on Forsythe,” an evening devoted to his work, March 7-March 17. Mr. Forsythe turned happily to a few observers: “Isn’t ballet delightful?” At 69, Mr. Forsythe has been finding ballet delightful since he first went to a class at 17. But he took an almost 20-year hiatus from what he describes as “working within the academy.” Widely considered one of the most important choreographers working today, Mr. Forsythe is a New Yorker who made his career in Europe. First in Stuttgart, Germany, then for two decades as director of Frankfurt Ballet, he took the genre in new directions by both ignoring and exploring its conventions — taking positions out of classical alignment; testing limits of balance, extension and strength; inventing strategies to generate movement; adding text, film and innovative lighting. Even before Frankfurt Ballet closed in 2004, Mr. Forsythe had headed into more theatrical and improvisational terrain, which he would continue to investigate with the Forsythe Company, a smaller ensemble founded in 2005. Two works created for the Paris Opera Ballet in 1999 were more or less his farewell to the extensions of balletic form that had put him on the map. Audiences craving more of the unblinking modernity that Mr. Forsythe had brought to classical dance had to content themselves with older works. But Mr. Forsythe has come back to making ballet. Since leaving the Forsythe Company in 2015 he has created two pieces (“Blake Works 1,” “Playlist [Track 1, 2]”) for ballet companies and one (“A Quiet Evening”) for a small group of his own longtime dancers — joyous, detailed riffs on ballet technique and tradition, danced to pop music, Rameau and in silence. (“Quiet Evening” will come to The Shed in New York in October.) His new work for Boston Ballet, “Playlist (EP),” will be his first for a North American ballet company in almost 30 years. It shares a program with “Blake Works 1” and “Pas/Parts 2018,” a revised version of one of the 1999 Paris pieces. (His last North American commission, “Herman Schmerman,” created for New York City Ballet’s 1992 Diamond Project, was revived there this season and is currently being performed.) Without the responsibilities of running a company, free to choose where he would like to work, and with time “to practice a lot” at his home in Vermont, Mr. Forsythe — who also has a growing presence in the art world — seems newly invigorated by the joy of working with ballet dancers. “I knew I wanted to move back to strict ballet after the Forsythe Company ended,” he said in an interview after a long day of rehearsal here. “When you look at the great works of Bournonville, Petipa, Balanchine, you realize that the possibilities are endless. It is up to you to find the recombinations that turn the academy into a form of vital communication.” In the early part of his career, as resident choreographer with the Stuttgart Ballet and then director of the Frankfurt Ballet, Mr. Forsythe created ballets that established him as a groundbreaking and often divisive experimental artist in a field that is by definition a historical genre. Mr. Forsythe’s pre-1999 work — like George Balanchine’s — asked why ballet couldn’t be as representative of our time as any work of contemporary art. He pushed Balanchine’s expansion of ballet vocabulary — the elongated extensions, the tensions of weight and balance, the stripped-down aesthetic — into even more extreme terrain. He played with conventions; abandoned ballet’s traditional gender roles; used electronic music (frequently by the Dutch composer Thom Willems); designed his own innovative lighting; and brought text and film into his work, often inspired by philosophical or theoretical writings and ideas. Broadly speaking, European audiences adored it; American critics — with some exceptions — hated it. As a result, until 1998, when the Frankfurt Ballet first began to occasionally perform at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, dance audiences in the United States saw little of his work apart from a few early pieces that began to percolate into ballet companies. But Mikko Nissinen, the artistic director of Boston Ballet, said he was not daunted by that history. “For me, he is the person who has moved the art form forward after Balanchine,” he said. “Our art form is in need of genius and here we have a profound, strong American voice. It baffles me that some people are blind to this.” Fulfilling a long-held desire for his company, Mr. Nissinen entered into a five-year partnership with Mr. Forsythe in 2016; Boston Ballet will acquire at least one of his works each year. If Mr. Forsythe’s earlier ballets were explorations of the outer limits of the genre, his post-2014 work seems to be digging ever deeper into its core, looking hard at ballet’s history to bring it into the future. In “Blake Works 1,” set to seven songs by the English musician James Blake, he mined the rich technical heritage of the Paris Opera Ballet dancers, incorporating combinations that have been passed down by generations of teachers, and emphasizing the beaten footwork and refined arms that are French stylistic hallmarks. He has done something analogous in “Playlist (EP),” which begins with two sections created for English National Ballet and adds another four songs. “I’m looking at all the interesting cross disseminations you get when you have a company made up of dancers from all over the world,” Mr. Forsythe said, noting that the Boston dancers come from Russia, South Korea, North America and Europe, all with different training. “Playlist,” he added, quotes classroom combinations he remembered from teachers and from ballet classes seen while working in Paris, London and Boston. The new work is also sprinkled with ballet history. “Paquita!” called out a dancer, when Mr. Forsythe asked the group if they recognized a sequence he gave them. “It’s the ‘Paquita’ cha-cha now,” Mr. Forsythe laughed, referring to the 19th-century ballet choreographed (in part) by Marius Petipa. “I keep watching the ballet on YouTube,” he said later. “The combinations, the complexities of the choreography, are just genius.” But no matter how inspired by the past, or dedicated to ballet history, Mr. Forsythe’s physical style is distinctively and idiosyncratically personal: classical shapes, subtly transformed by angled hips and shoulders; academic form permeated by disco bounce; constantly shifting dynamics. He is also not choreographing to music by Ludwig Minkus (“Paquita,” “Don Quixote”) or Tchaikovsky. With “Blake Works 1,” and “Playlist (EP),” he has turned to pop music, just as he did early in his career in works like “Love Songs” (1979) and “Say Bye Bye” (1980). “Playlist (EP)” is an honest title. The work is set to six irresistible songs that were on the ever-expanding playlist on Mr. Forsythe’s phone: Peven Everett’s “Surely Shorty,” Lion Babe and Jax Jones’s “Impossible,” Abra’s “Vegas,” Khalid’s “Location,” Mr. White’s “Sha La La” and Natalie Cole’s “This Will Be (An Everlasting Love).” “This was the root of dancing for me,” Mr. Forsythe said. “My first dancing was in clubs and in musicals; I only engaged with ballet later.” Pop music, he added “has very clear structure, just like classical music; the nature of the syncopations and the underlying contrapuntal motors of the music allow the same kind of drive that Tchaikovsky, Prokofiev and Stravinsky brought to ballet music. It has a deep connection to dance that is entirely supportive to ballet.” Mr. Nissinen said he was initially a little surprised by Mr. Forsythe’s musical choices. “Then I thought, why not?,” he said. “I think it’s his reaction to being back in America. He wants to connect with people, bridge to broader audiences.” Working to music “you would listen to on a train,” said Chyrstyn Fentroy, a second soloist, has allowed the dancers to loosen up and find “a swing” to their technique. “It forces you to rethink how you do a tendu or use your épaulement,” she said, referring to the complex relationships between head, shoulder and hips that are vital to ballet. “I love the challenge of ballet,” Mr. Forsythe said one day as he constructed a complicated, overlapping ensemble sequence. “It’s like inventing a knot. You have the rope or cord, and you have to find the right relationships. It’s much harder than people think!” Now and again, that was evident in the studio. Stymied one afternoon by a difficult passage in a pas de deux, Mr. Forsythe got out his phone: “Siri, what’s the next step?” he asked. “You don’t appear to be heading anywhere,” she answered. Laughter all around. Mostly, though, he seemed to know exactly what he wanted, reeling off strings of ballet steps as he demonstrated, the dancers picking up the movements with uncanny speed. (Once he went to consult photographs of M&M candies, lined up in color-coded formations that represented different stages of a section.) Mr. Forsythe maintained he wasn’t aiming for anything groundbreaking or revolutionary. “I like being part of the big ballet conversation,” he said. “This is a celebration of everything ballet has brought to me in life. It’s just another way to love ballet — and there are so many ways.” An earlier version of this article misstated Chyrstyn Fentroy's rank in the company. She is a second soloist, not a corps member.",The New York Times
2019,"William Singer, the Man in the Middle of the College Bribery Scandal","BOSTON — The central figure in the college admissions cheating scandal is William Singer, 58, a Newport Beach, Calif., businessman who prosecutors say managed and profited from the cheating scheme. Mr. Singer, sometimes known as Rick Singer, has been cooperating with federal investigators since September 2018. He pleaded guilty to four charges in federal court in Boston on Tuesday. [Read more on the Justice Department’s largest ever college admissions prosecution] A tan, lean-faced man with close-cut gray hair, Mr. Singer sat very still and looked intently at the judge, Rya W. Zobel, as she explained the charges and detailed the rights he was giving up by pleading guilty. He answered, “Yes, ma’am” whenever the judge asked him if he understood. When the judge asked Mr. Singer to describe his role in the plot, he became expansive, speaking for about 10 minutes about his methods. [The college admissions scandal has raised a lot of questions. We’ve answered them here.] He spoke of arranging for students to take their SAT or ACT exams at sites in Houston or Los Angeles where he had bribed test administrators. The students thought they were taking the tests legitimately, he said, but his proctor would correct some of their answers afterward to make their scores come out exactly how Mr. Singer wanted. He bribed college coaches, he said, to falsely certify that students had been recruited for the school’s sports teams. Prosecutors said he also falsified ethnicities and other biographical details in some cases, to take advantage of affirmative action. [Read more here about how the authorities say the scheme worked, from bribes to doctored photos.] Mr. Singer also described how, after he became a cooperating witness and was told he could not talk to anyone about the investigation, he tipped off several families that his conversations were being recorded by the authorities and warned them not to incriminate themselves. He was released on bail and left the courthouse after the hearing in the company of his lawyers. One of them, Donald H. Heller, said on his way out of the courthouse that Mr. Singer was very remorseful and intended to fully cooperate. “I’m sure there will be more things coming out,” Mr. Heller said. “I can tell you he’s a very stoic person, but this has been very emotional for him, dealing with this, because his whole life has been working with kids getting into college, and it got out of control.” Here are some key points about Mr. Singer, from court papers, statements by his lawyers, past news coverage and a biographical sketch on a company website. The for-profit business: Mr. Singer owns the Edge College & Career Network, also known as The Key — a for-profit college counseling and preparation company offering families help in getting students into competitive colleges and universities. He also owns some related businesses. The nonprofit organization: Mr. Singer established and runs the Key Worldwide Foundation, which purports to be a charity and which prosecutors say was used to disguise the true nature of payments from parents. The charges: One count each of racketeering conspiracy, money laundering conspiracy, conspiracy to defraud the United States, and obstruction of justice. His bail: Mr. Singer was released on $500,000 bond. Eric S. Rosen, a federal prosecutor in the case, said it would be secured by property in California belonging to Mr. Singer’s brother. Prosecutors are seeking the forfeiture of many of Mr. Singer’s own assets and those of his businesses and the foundation under federal racketeering laws. His admission: “Everything that Mr. Rosen stated is exactly true — all of those things, plus many more things I did,” Mr. Singer said in court on Tuesday, referring to a summary of the accusations given by Mr. Rosen. What he was selling: He called it a “side door” into college, one that was sure to open. “If I can make the comparison, there is a front door of getting in, where a student just does it on their own,” Mr. Singer said in court. “And then there’s a back door, where people go to institutional advancement and make large donations, but they’re not guaranteed in. And then I created a side door that guaranteed families to get in. So that was what made it very attractive to so many families, is I created a guarantee.” His career: Mr. Singer started as a teacher and athletic coach, and founded his first college counseling business, Future Stars, in Sacramento in 1992, according to a 2005 profile in The Sacramento Business Journal.

2019,"Winner of $1.5 Billion Lottery Comes Forward (Well, Sort of. Through a Lawyer.)","An anonymous person in South Carolina finally claimed the record-setting prize from October’s $1.54 billion Mega Millions jackpot, opting to collect a one-time lump sum of $877,784,124. The state’s lottery commission announced on Monday that the person had stepped forward, ending questions about why, five months after the winning numbers were announced, no one had claimed the money. It was the largest payout to a single lottery winner in United States history. The winner had until April 19 to claim the money. Winning the lottery comes with a long list of difficult decisions, which may explain the delay in making the claim. Thus far, the winner has followed the typical playbook to minimize or avoid potential complications: The person has stayed anonymous, and has gotten help. The winner retained Jason M. Kurland, a New York lawyer who has branded himself the “Lottery Lawyer” after representing several high-profile winners. In October, Mr. Kurland told The New York Times that the biggest challenge is making sure the windfall does not ruin personal relationships. “It’s natural there’s going to be a strain,” Mr. Kurland said. “It depends on how strong your relationships are before the lottery. If you’re really close with someone and they feel they deserve a gift, it’s really difficult. It’s one of the things winners are freaked out about when they come to me.” The winner was fortunate to be a resident of South Carolina, one of a handful of states where winners are allowed to remain anonymous. In other states, winners have to sit through a news conference, and the publicity can attract all varieties of vultures who would look to take advantage. The winning $2 ticket — 5, 28, 62, 65, 70; and the Mega Ball: 5 — was sold at a convenience store, KC Mart No. 7, in Simpsonville. The store’s owner, C.J. Patel, will receive $50,000. The winner had about a 1 in 302 million shot to get it right. The South Carolina Education Lottery Commission said in a statement that the winner “marvels at how every decision made that day brought the winner to the store, at that very moment, to make the Quick Pick Mega Millions lottery ticket purchase.” The winner had allowed another customer to make a ticket purchase in front of him or her in line, the commission said. “A simple act of kindness led to an amazing outcome,” it said. Lottery profits support higher education, scholarships, K-12 programs and community education programs, the lottery commission said. South Carolina will receive about $61 million in income taxes from the winner. The winner chose the smaller lump sum over an annuity, which would have paid out the full $1.54 billion in smaller payments over 30 years. Most people take the one-time cash payment, but it is not an easy decision.",The New York Times
2019,Wisconsin Judge Blocks Republicans’ Move to Limit Democratic Governor’s Power,"CHICAGO — A judge on Thursday blocked a set of laws pushed through late last year by Republican legislators in Wisconsin that aimed to weaken the power of the state’s newly elected Democratic governor and attorney general, setting off a bitter fight in the state. The judge, Richard Niess of Dane County Circuit Court, issued a temporary injunction on the laws, which included curbing the authority of the incoming governor, Tony Evers, in the rule-making process and limiting the power of Josh Kaul, the new attorney general. The judge said that the Republican lawmakers’ last-minute meeting — a December session just after the election but before the new Democrats could be sworn in — did not meet the requirements of Wisconsin law. And so the measures that emerged from it, he said, “cannot stand.” The case had been brought to court by several individuals and groups, including the League of Women Voters, Disability Rights Wisconsin and Black Leaders Organizing for Communities. Efforts last year by lawmakers in Wisconsin and in other states, including Michigan, to weaken the power of new leaders who won elections in November set off a flurry of angry protests and, in Wisconsin, several lawsuits. The efforts also added to a tense situation emerging in Madison, the Wisconsin state capital, where government is now split after eight years of complete Republican control under Gov. Scott Walker. Republicans still firmly dominate the State Legislature; Mr. Evers, Mr. Kaul, and other Democrats have taken top state offices. Mr. Evers called Judge Niess’s ruling “a victory for the people of Wisconsin” and said that the Legislature had “overplayed its hand by using an unlawful process to accumulate more power for itself and override the will of the people, despite the outcome of last November’s election.” On Thursday, Mr. Evers directed Mr. Kaul to withdraw Wisconsin from a multistate lawsuit challenging the Affordable Care Act — a suit that the state had joined under the previous, Republican administration. Until Thursday, Mr. Kaul had been blocked from withdrawing Wisconsin from the suit; one of the provisions of the laws passed by the Republicans in December prevented the Democrats from removing the state from the case, as they had promised to do during their campaigns. Mr. Kaul filed a motion seeking the withdrawal on Thursday, a spokeswoman for Mr. Evers said. Republican leaders in the State Legislature swiftly pledged to appeal Judge Niess’s ruling, questioning what it meant for other unusual legislative sessions that had been called in Wisconsin over the decades. “Today’s ruling only creates chaos and will surely raise questions about items passed during previous extraordinary sessions, including stronger laws against child sexual predators and drunk drivers,” Robin Vos, the Republican speaker, and Scott Fitzgerald, the Republicans’ Senate majority leader, said in a joint statement.",The New York Times
2019,Wisconsin School Bans Mock Cheerleading Awards After Harassment Accusations,"At an awards ceremony last year for cheerleaders at Tremper High School in Kenosha, Wis., some of the students received awards called “Big Booty,” “Big Boobie” and “String Bean.” Similar awards had been given to students in 2017. Now, prizes like those have been banned in the district. Coaches described the mock awards as good-natured teasing, but some parents and students were appalled, and the event was challenged by the American Civil Liberties Union, which sent a formal warning to the Kenosha Unified School District last month. On Monday, a letter from the district superintendent, Sue Savaglio-Jarvis, said that “the district has taken prompt and remedial action in order to protect the students and to prevent discrimination and harassment from occurring in the future.” “Mock awards of any such kind per the date of this memo are strictly prohibited,” it added. There was also a mandatory training session on discrimination and harassment for administrators, principals, assistant principals and supervisors on Monday. Dr. Savaglio-Jarvis said that district staff members would be disciplined or fired if they harassed students or saw harassment and did not report it. In its warning letter, the A.C.L.U. said it might sue the district because it had “failed to take any meaningful corrective action” in the case. That warning also pointed out that in addition to the awards ceremony at Tremper, there were concerns that another high school in the district, Bradford High School, showed a video in its health classes that seemed to blame victims for sexual assault. The district removed that video from the curriculum. The district also updated a dress code policy last year that had barred girls from wearing yoga pants, leggings and tank tops after the A.C.L.U. challenged its enforcement. On Monday, a spokeswoman for the Kenosha Unified School District said that two coaches involved in the cheerleading controversy were no longer with the district. “Kenosha Unified recognizes our obligation to provide students and staff an environment free of discrimination and harassment and realizes the issues brought forth are not acceptable,” the district said in a statement. “It is our sincere hope that by outlining expectations and providing ongoing training to our staff we can avoid further issues of any kind. At this time, training has started with administration and coaches.” About 100 people, including parents, coaches and students, attended last year’s ceremony in Kenosha, where students also received awards for athletic achievements. Last month, a cheerleader at Tremper High School spoke with The New York Times and described how she felt when the coaches gave the mock awards. “When the girl went up to accept the Big Boobie award, what do you think everyone in the room was looking at?” she said. “I would’ve died.”",The New York Times
2019,Wisconsin’s Annie Pankowski Tries to Leave College Hockey on Top,"This weekend is Wisconsin forward Annie Pankowski’s last shot to go out a winner in college hockey. She is a three-time finalist for the Patty Kazmaier Award, which will be given out Saturday to the best female player in college hockey. She has never won. On Friday, she will play in the Frozen Four with the Wisconsin Badgers for the fourth time. She has never won a national championship. Top-seeded Wisconsin (33-4-2) faces the two-time defending champion Clarkson (30-7-2) on Friday in the semifinals at Quinnipiac University in Hamden, Conn., with Minnesota (31-5-1) and Cornell (24-5-6) vying to play the winner. The title game is Sunday. “All the previous Frozen Fours have been different, but this one is my last,” Pankowski, 24, said. “As a team, we’re really hungry to win it.” A native of Laguna Hills, Calif., whose older sister, Ali, played hockey at Princeton, Pankowski started skating at 4 and played on her first United States national team in 2013, before four years at the North American Hockey Academy in Stowe, Vt. At Wisconsin, she was the team’s leading scorer her first two years, and again this year, with 25 goals and 47 points. She won four conference championships with the Badgers. Yet Pankowski’s hockey career has had devastating setbacks. She was a final cut for the 2014 Olympic team. She did not play for the Badgers in the 2017-18 season as she trained with the national team. But she was cut just weeks before the team was to leave for the Pyeongchang Olympics, after all the players had been assured when training camp began that the 23-person roster was set. The U.S. went on to win the gold medal. Pankowski called it “one of the most awkward, painful experiences of my life.” The day after she was cut, still “heartbroken, confused and angry,” she said, she began the drive back to Madison, where she knew she would find support among coaches, teammates and friends. “Those were the people I needed to surround myself with,” she said. She finished the season practicing with her Wisconsin teammates, and throwing herself into another passion: training dogs. Since her second semester at Wisconsin, she has been a volunteer at OccuPaws, a local nonprofit that trains guide dogs for people with sight and mobility disabilities. The program requires that the dogs live with her. “It’s something outside of hockey and school that’s not stressful,” said Pankowski, who often treats her teammates to dog visits at practice. “You can feel the excitement whenever I bring a dog into the locker room.” Pankowski, the youngest child of two veterinarians, has logged more than 2,000 hours of volunteer time with OccuPaws. That is one of the reasons she is a finalist for another honor: the Hockey Humanitarian Award, which recognizes a male or female player who makes significant contributions to the community through volunteering. Pankowski also works in the lab of Mark Markel, the dean of Wisconsin’s School of Veterinary Medicine, and she plans to start veterinary school there in August. “She’s a rock star as an athlete, a student, a volunteer and a worker in my lab,” Markel said. “I think all her hockey experience, including all the international tournaments she’s played in, has given her the discipline to pull off this off.” Veterinary school is a four-year program, but a yearlong commitment to play in the 2022 Olympics in Beijing is possible, with Markel’s blessing. “If she needs a year off,” he said, “we’re totally supportive of her.” For now, though, her focus is on Friday night and Clarkson, the team that beat Wisconsin in the 2017 title game. The Badgers were the top team in the country all of that season and outshot Clarkson, 41-20, but lost, 3-0. This year, Wisconsin heads into the Frozen Four 10-0-2 in its last 12 games. Pankowski scored Wisconsin’s first two goals in a 4-0 win over Syracuse in the N.C.A.A. quarterfinals last weekend. Watching the game online, Bill Driscoll, the director of hockey at the North American Hockey Academy, said he knew she would “take this game over.” “She has an elite-level shot,” he added. Pankowski was on the U.S. team that won the Four Nations Cup in November, and she will play for the Americans at the world championships in Finland next month. Despite her Olympic disappointments, she has won two gold medals at worlds, in 2015 and 2016. “She’s very cerebral on the ice,” said Bob Corkum, the national team coach. “She knows the spots to get to. She’s not the fastest skater or the strongest player or even the most skilled, but she’s very well rounded. All she does is put pucks in the net.” Whatever the results this weekend, Markel said, he had no worries about how Pankowski will handle them. “I think her resilience is going to be a blessing for her the rest of her life,” he said.",The New York Times
2019,March for a Second Brexit Vote Is Just the Start for Young People,"LONDON — Lara Spirit, an anti-Brexit organizer, was studying politics at the University of Cambridge in 2017, reading about the use of referendums as a way of settling political disputes. It was timely coursework: A year earlier, Britons had voted to leave the European Union. But Ms. Spirit was growing alarmed at the omission of young people from the Brexit debate. Despite warnings in her readings about the risks of referendums, she delayed school and founded a group with other students to push for another public vote on Brexit. They called it Our Future, Our Choice, and on Saturday it will be among a clutch of youth groups helping to lead an expected crowd of hundreds of thousands in a march on Parliament in support of a second referendum. “We were sort of horrified that there hadn’t been a youth group that was a voice on the issue of Brexit,” Ms. Spirit, 22, said. “It will be my generation, of course, who will be making sense of this and dealing with the consequences of the decision we took in 2016.” The fight for another public vote on Brexit, while still marginal among members of Parliament, has gained momentum among Britons, none more so than the young people steeling themselves for a lifetime of arguing about Europe. They look around and see a bleak political landscape: Parliament is deadlocked; Prime Minister Theresa May is still pushing her unloved Brexit plan, even though it has been rejected by her putative allies in the Democratic Unionist Party of Northern Ireland; and the frightening prospect of a calamitous no-deal Brexit seems to be gaining more credibility every day. But the way many young people see it, the political chaos and dysfunction are working in their favor, with the anti-Brexit forces gaining momentum. By Friday, for example, more than four million people had put their names by Friday on a petition to revoke Article 50, the mechanism for leaving the European Union, and those numbers were growing. As Saturday’s march approached, students in Bath and Bristol bought seats on a chartered train to London. Others are coming on buses. And in student union buildings across the country, young people this week were gathering to paint banners and persuade their classmates to join them. Brexit has molded their politics as decisively as the Iraq War did an older generation’s. Worried about a chaotic British exit without an agreement with the European Union, students said they view a second referendum as the only way out of the current impasse and a crucial step to protect gains on climate change and workers’ rights. “It’s awoken a group of people who otherwise might not have been engaged,” said Sally Patterson, 23, an officer at the University of Bristol Students’ Union. “If you have a mate from Greece who might not be able to continue studying next year, you’ve got a stake in their future.” The timing of the march — only six days before the original date of Britain’s departure from the European Union — once seemed risky. Surely, it seemed, politicians would have settled the matter by then. James McGrory, the executive director of People’s Vote, the umbrella group that is organizing the march on Parliament, said the group’s leaders were originally dubious about pouring money and energy into a rally in late March. But younger organizers prevailed on them to hold it anyway. “It was me and senior colleagues who hemmed and hawed, ‘Should we do one or not?’” Mr. McGrory said. “The two things young people in the campaign said were, ‘You should have the courage of your convictions — do it.’ The other thing is they thought we could raise the money online to pay for it.” The chances of a second referendum remain small. Labour Party leaders, who have long dithered over a second referendum, have never energetically backed the idea. The most likely form it would take is a choice between the prime minister’s exit deal and remaining in the European Union. Many polls show that Britons have now gone from mostly thinking Britain was right to leave Europe after the 2016 referendum to mostly thinking the opposite. And support for a public vote has grown, according to a mid-March poll by YouGov, with the option of staying in Europe favored over Mrs. May’s divorce deal or a no-deal exit. With a following of hundreds of thousands of people on social media and email lists, Ms. Spirit’s group has invited young people to Parliament to petition their representatives and arranged for members of Parliament to visit schools to speak about Brexit. The group’s leaders have won big audiences on Twitter by posting video of encounters with pro-Brexit voters. Along the way they have become valuable voices for an anti-Brexit movement that in 2016 was harmed by its association with the political class. (It was the Conservative prime minister at the time, David Cameron, who led the Remain campaign.) “It’s more enjoyable to be the insurgents than the incumbents,” said Mr. McGrory, who is himself a veteran of the 2016 Remain campaign. At Edge Hill University in northwest England, several dozen students were painting banners on Thursday in the students’ union bar. Among the anti-Brexit slogans: “Pulling Out Never Works.” “It feels like an antithesis to the kind of bland politicians and political elite that are pushing Brexit,” Luke Myer, 24, vice president of the students’ union, said. “It’s real, and it’s irreverent as well. We like our memes and dumb slogans.” Students said the atmosphere on campuses had seemed relatively dull in 2016, when the pro-Europe campaign stressed the potential economic problems if Britain left. Now, students are agitating about access to study abroad programs, research funding from Europe and the rights of their European classmates, said Shakira Martin, the president of the National Union of Students. Many students, too young to vote in 2016, argue that so much time has passed since the first referendum that they deserve a fresh vote. In 2016, a majority of older voters favored leaving, while most younger voters wanted to remain. Demographic changes since then might alter the results of a second referendum, with more young people reaching voting age, students say. However sparse the support for a second referendum in Parliament, the campaigners may succeed in laying the groundwork for fights in the months and years ahead for a closer relationship with Europe, said Rob Ford, a professor of politics at the University of Manchester. Just as the Labour government of Tony Blair was blamed for Britain entering the Iraq War, he said, it will be Mrs. May’s government that will bear the stain from Brexit. “If you’re a student, the whole first 10 years of your working life are likely to be impacted to a greater or lesser extent by this Brexit debate,” Mr. Ford said. “It’ll be seen as something Conservatives initiated and presided over.”",The New York Times
2019,"With Big Stars and Paid Subscriptions, Luminary Aims to Be the Netflix of Podcasts","LOS ANGELES — Patti LuPone as a bebop-singing junkie nun in John Cameron Mitchell’s musical follow-up to “Hedwig and the Angry Inch.” A new show from Lena Dunham called “The C-Word.” Series from Conan O’Brien, Malcolm Gladwell and Trevor Noah. It sounds like the latest programming blitz from Netflix. But this lineup — more than 40 exclusive shows, all without ads — has nothing to do with video. The offerings come from a podcast start-up called Luminary that has emerged from stealth mode to unveil nearly $100 million in funding and a subscription-based business model that it hopes will push the medium into a new phase of growth. “We want to become synonymous with podcasting in the same way Netflix has become synonymous with streaming,” Matt Sacks, Luminary’s co-founder and chief executive, said in an interview. “I know how ambitious that sounds. We think it can be done, and some of the top creators in the space agree.” Mr. Sacks, 28, was referring to Guy Raz, known for “How I Built This” and other hit podcasts; Leon Neyfakh, the “Slow Burn” creator and host; and Adam Davidson, a force behind “Planet Money,” the award-winning NPR podcast. All three men have signed on with Luminary for their next shows, which will roll out exclusively on the company’s app in the coming months. Mr. Raz is working on “Wisdom From the Top,” focused on business and political leaders. Mr. Neyfakh will contribute “Fiasco,” an investigative show that delves into governmental imbroglios. And Mr. Davidson has created “Passion Economy,” a podcast about people who experience strokes of genius, like an Amish farmer with no electricity who makes his business skyrocket with the use of an iPhone. Most podcasts are free, but the Luminary app — set to arrive by June — will focus on subscriptions. For $8 a month, subscribers will gain access to Luminary’s ad-free lineup. For creators, Luminary is offering large upfront payment guarantees in exchange for exclusive rights to distribute their work, reducing the risk of a concept and, hopefully, encouraging greater creativity and higher production values. Luminary will also pay creators bonuses if their shows reach certain listening thresholds. “For podcasting to grow, creators must be able to take risks on more conceptual ideas, and the Luminary model provides that comfort,” Mr. Davidson said. Most podcast creators make money by selling ads. Podcasts are expected to generate $514 million in ad sales this year, a sum projected to rise to $659 million in 2020, according to the Interactive Advertising Bureau and PwC. As with radio or broadcast television, which are also reliant on ad sales, reaching the biggest audience possible is the goal. As a result, the same kinds of mass-appeal podcasts tend to get made. That means news shows, sports commentary and lots of chat. Making a living by advertising, as many podcasters have discovered (like YouTube stars before them), is harder than it looks. The scramble is constant. An advertiser could pour in money one month and vanish the next. With podcasting in particular, it is difficult to measure how many people listen to the ads. More podcast apps offer ad-skipping buttons. The Luminary app will not be totally absent of ads. It will also offer a free area, where listeners can play any of the estimated 600,000 ad-supported and nonexclusive podcasts in the market. “Matt has figured out a smart and sustainable way to push the business forward — better discovery for listeners, allowing creators to focus on creating the highest-quality content possible and stop worrying about selling ads,” Liza Landsman, a partner at New Enterprise Associates, a venture capital firm that has invested in Luminary, said of Mr. Sacks. Luminary has 70 employees in New York and Chicago, about 40 of whom are engineers. The company is beginning a marketing campaign on Monday that includes outdoor advertising in New York, Los Angeles and Austin, Tex. To some degree, of course, all media start-ups think they are going to be the next Netflix. The test for Luminary will come in the execution. And there are plenty of challenges. Subscription-based businesses are hot at the moment, but analysts say that consumers will begin pushing back and asking, How many entertainment services do I really need to be paying for every month? Luminary is also entering an increasingly crowded field. Apple devices have long dominated the podcast market, despite what analysts describe as a largely ambivalent approach; Apple has improved its podcasting app over the years, but it has never felt like a priority. That could change now that Google has reintroduced a podcast player and music streaming services like Spotify are looking to podcasting for growth. Last month, Spotify paid a reported $230 million for Gimlet Media, a producer of audio dramas like “Homecoming” and “Crimetown.” Spotify also offers free listening with ads and a premium version for subscribers who pay a $10 monthly fee. And Spotify offers some exclusive podcast shows from stars like Amy Schumer and the rapper Joe Budden. Other podcast platforms include Stitcher, Pocket Casts, Overcast and Castbox. Among start-ups, Himalaya Media, a San Francisco start-up backed by the Chinese audio giant Ximalaya FM, announced last month that it had raised $100 million and would introduce a podcast-distribution app with exclusive shows and a feature that would allow listeners to leave gratuities. Its stated goal? “To climb to the peak of the global podcast space.” Mr. Sacks brushed off the competition. “Just like in the premium television space, there is more than enough room for multiple offerings to thrive,” he said. “What sets Luminary apart,” he continued, “is our exclusive content right off the bat. Nobody comes close.” In addition to new shows from people like Ms. Dunham, whose “C-Word” podcast will offer a weekly look at women who have been deemed “crazy” online, Luminary will serve as the new exclusive home for a half-dozen established podcasts. Those include “Under the Skin,” hosted by the British comedian Russell Brand; a popular sex-focused show with an unprintable name created by Corinne Fisher and Krystyna Hutchinson; and Nick van der Kolk’s eclectic interview program “Love and Radio.” Still, the project that probably best demonstrates where Luminary would like to go is Mr. Mitchell’s new musical. “Hedwig,” the story of an East German transgender rocker, made its debut Off Broadway in 1998 and became a cultural phenomenon. Mr. Mitchell’s new show, “Anthem: Homunculus,” written with Bryan Weller, is not a sequel, although it contains material that was originally intended for one. The musical is set in a small town and finds Mr. Mitchell’s character battling a brain tumor and running out of insurance. He stages an audio-telethon to raise money for his treatment. In addition to Ms. LuPone, the cast includes six Tony Award winners, including Glenn Close, who wails a punk song while ostensibly nailed to a cross. Produced by Topic Studios, the company behind the hit podcast “Missing Richard Simmons,” the musical includes 31 original songs and will unspool over 10 episodes, stretching roughly six hours in total. “I’m very interested in pushing podcasts to a cinematic level of storytelling,” Mr. Mitchell said. “We had other suitors for this project, but none had the imagination of Luminary. Matt understood what I wanted to do immediately.” Also drawing Mr. Mitchell’s attention: Luminary intends to aggressively market individual podcasts to make them feel more like events. Mr. Sacks grew up in Chicago and studied history at the University of Pennsylvania. When he was a junior, he teamed up with friends to create Splash.FM, a now-defunct social network focused on music discovery. After a brief stint at Goldman Sachs post-graduation, Mr. Sacks went to work at New Enterprise Associates. In early 2017, he found himself scrounging for smart podcasting investments on behalf of the firm. But he couldn’t find any he really liked. “Nobody was focusing on content discovery to the degree that I wanted as a consumer: the right person finding the right show at the right time,” he said. “So I decided to build my own.”",The New York Times
2019,"With Bump Stocks Now Banned, Can Buybacks Get Rid of Them?","Governments that want to curb gun violence frequently offer bounties for turning in weapons. New Zealand and Washington State are among the latest. But buybacks have a mixed record. When the New Zealand government announced on Thursday that it would ban military-style semiautomatic weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines, a critical element of the new policy was a plan for the government to buy back the newly banned weapons from private owners. Gun buyback programs have often been mounted in American cities large and small that wanted to reduce gun violence and crime. Washington State just completed one on Monday specifically for bump stocks — accessory devices that make ordinary guns capable of very rapid fire. A federal ban on bump stocks takes effect on Tuesday. The state had set aside $150,000 for the buyback program, which gave Washington residents a $150 voucher for each bump stock they turned in. All 1,000 vouchers were exhausted before the Monday deadline. But there are up to 500,000 bump stocks in the United States — and therein lies the problem. Buyback programs are a relatively easy step for states and localities to try, since they are voluntary and generally require no legislation. But taking a few hundred or even a few thousand weapons out of circulation barely dents the national nonmilitary supply of 300 million firearms — nearly one for every citizen — and gun manufacturers have been adding about eight million more a year, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Moreover, the guns that are turned in tend to be the least likely ones to be used in violent crime. And there is little or nothing to stop guns from flowing back into a community from out of town or out of state. “The people who are highest-risk don’t participate, like young males,” said Jon Vernick of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research in Baltimore. “The highest-risk guns, the newer, higher-caliber weapons and semiautomatics are not what’s collected. You get a disproportionate number of revolvers and broken guns.” Mr. Vernick said the story may be different with buybacks aimed at very specific items like bump stocks, which have not yet been widely studied. Though removing a gun from a household can make that household safer, studies by Johns Hopkins researchers and others have found that buybacks have little impact on gun violence rates in the community as a whole. When the bounty offered for each weapon is low, few people take part. But raising it to attract more guns can have unintended consequences. Baltimore, one of the first American cities to offer a buyback in 1974, tried another in December, offering $25 to any city resident who brought in a high-capacity magazine. But observers quickly spotted that many high-capacity magazines could be bought online for $9 to $15, and then turned in to the city for a tidy profit. Oakland, Calif., had a similar problem with a buyback program in 2008. “If you want to have lots of guns, you raise the incentive,” Mr. Vernick said. “There’s a risk of raising the price too high, and people bringing in cheap, broken guns and using the money to trade up.” After 35 people died in a mass shooting in Australia in 1996, the country undertook a sweeping nationwide program with buybacks, registration requirements and outright bans. The government spent 500 million Australian dollars ($395 million) to collect and destroy about 640,000 guns — roughly one-third of all the guns in the country. Since then, rates of gun violence and gun suicides have tumbled, and there have been no mass shootings in the country. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern of New Zealand pointed to Australia’s success as an inspiration for her plans. When Congress enacted a federal ban on assault weapons and large-capacity magazines in 1994, there was no national, federally financed gun buyback program like Australia’s, though some local governments held buybacks. The ban was riddled with loopholes, most notably exempting weapons manufactured before the law took effect, so it left more than 1.5 million assault weapons in legal circulation, and owners had little incentive to turn them in. The ban expired after 10 years, and a study afterward found that it had only a limited impact on gun crime. The Second Amendment, which enshrines the right to bear arms, and federal laws like the Firearms Owners’ Protection Act, passed in 1986, make it difficult to impose tighter bans or adopt other nationwide measures like mandatory registration in the United States. And the gun industry and the National Rifle Association use their considerable political influence to fight any policy that would reduce or restrict gun ownership. “Registration is the worst anathema for the N.R.A.,” said Mr. Vernick. “Registration is the first step toward confiscation, they say.”",The New York Times

2019,"With Funeral Home Rules Due for an Update, There’s a Push for Online Prices","Your Money Adviser Shoppers routinely use the internet to compare prices, whether for appliances, cars or hotel rooms. But online pricing remains scant for funeral services, putting bereaved and vulnerable people at a financial disadvantage because they’re unlikely to haggle over costs. Consumer advocates are hoping that may finally change because federal regulators are scheduled to take a fresh look this year at a rule that governs how funeral homes share information with the public. Advocates are encouraging an update to bring the rule into the digital age, by requiring funeral homes to post detailed prices online. “We are building a consumer coalition” to promote the change, said Steve Brobeck, senior fellow with the Consumer Federation of America. The federation and allies like the Funeral Consumers Alliance, a nonprofit group that promotes price transparency, argue that the current rule is woefully inadequate for the internet era. The Federal Trade Commission’s Funeral Rule requires funeral homes to provide prices to consumers seeking them over the phone and to give an itemized price list to anyone requesting one in person. But the rule, which first took effect in 1984, when the internet was in its infancy, does not require online disclosure of prices. The typical cost of a traditional funeral, including viewing of the body and burial, was about $7,400 in 2017, according to the National Funeral Directors Association, a trade group. A funeral with cremation, which is increasingly popular, was about $6,300. But costs vary widely, even within the same market. Scott Gilligan, general counsel with the funeral directors association, said about 20 percent of its members — generally those in larger, competitive markets — posted prices online, but the association has not seen major demand for it from consumers. The group’s research, he said, shows that people choose a funeral home mainly because of factors like a relationship with a particular funeral director or a home’s location, with price a less important criterion. There are about 22,000 funeral homes in the United States, and most are family owned, he said. The Federal Trade Commission typically strives to re-evaluate rules every 10 years, said Patti Poss, an attorney in the commission’s consumer protection bureau. The last review of the funeral rule ended in 2008, when, according to the Federal Register, the commission declined to adopt any changes. The 10-year review timeline isn’t mandated, however, and the commission may adjust it, Ms. Poss said. The five-member commission, whose members were all appointed last year, has a full plate, including an inquiry into telecommunications privacy. Still, a review of the funeral rule in 2019 has been scheduled for several years, Ms. Poss said, and is “supposed to happen sometime this year.” She was unable to provide a date when the assessment might start, but said it would be announced on the commission’s website and in the Federal Register. The commission typically seeks public comments to help determine if a rule remains relevant, and whether any changes are warranted. One factor it considers, Ms. Poss noted, is any impact of technological changes. Joshua Slocum, executive director of the Funeral Consumers Alliance, said the rule sorely needed updating. The alliance, along with the consumer federation, unsuccessfully petitioned the Federal Trade Commission in 2016 to speed up its review. Mr. Slocum said posting prices online would make enforcement of the rule far easier, since regulators are able to visit just a small fraction of the country’s funeral homes to check compliance. The commission enforces the funeral rule, in part, with undercover inspections of funeral homes. It reported last year that nearly a quarter of 134 homes in a dozen states visited in 2017 had failed to comply with federal price disclosure rules. An analysis of 200 funeral homes last year by the Funeral Consumers Alliance found just 16 percent with websites included their full price lists online, although about a fourth posted some information, such as packaged services. More recently, research by the alliance and other groups found that online pricing disclosure was spotty even in California, the only state that requires funeral homes with websites to include pricing information online or to list services and note that prices are available upon request. Here are some questions and answers about funeral services: What happens if a funeral home fails to properly disclose its prices? The Federal Trade Commission can seek civil penalties of more than $40,000 per violation. But first-time offenders can enter a training program run by the National Funeral Directors Association that is intended to help increase compliance. Is there anywhere to compare funeral prices online? Commercial websites like Parting.com and a newer entrant, Funeralocity.com, offer funeral home searches and pricing information. Ed Michael Reggie, founder of Funeralocity, said the site let shoppers search prices at funeral homes in 100 major markets and awarded “excellence” status to funeral homes that met its standards and fully disclosed prices. Funeralocity, he said, earns a referral fee when users book services with funeral homes that have that status. The website says those homes agree to offer discounts to users who choose them through Funeralocity. Consumer advocates say they generally support wider availability of information online but caution that third-party websites may have financial incentives to promote one funeral home over another. Mr. Slocum, of the Funeral Consumers Alliance, also said it was difficult to keep pricing information updated since doing so required companies to call or visit the individual funeral homes. As with any website, he said, shoppers should use a healthy skepticism when evaluating services. How can I manage the cost of a funeral? The trade commission advises consumers to gather information in advance, if possible, and to compare prices from at least two funeral homes. It notes that consumers don’t have to buy a coffin from their funeral home. They can buy one elsewhere and have it delivered. AARP’s website offers recommendations for holding down costs, like buying a coffin online and avoiding funeral packages that offer discounted coffins since the funeral home may make up the difference by charging more for other services.",The New York Times
2019,"With Guns Drawn, Officers Raided Home to Get Feverish Child","The police burst into an Arizona home to take custody of a toddler, raising questions about when parents can be stripped of control over their children’s health care. With guns drawn, the police officers broke down the door of the suburban Phoenix home in the early hours of a February morning. “Come out with your hands up!” an officer yelled, with the dark front porch and foyer inside suddenly flooded with light from the officers’ flashlights. The target of the raid: an unvaccinated 2-year-old boy with a high fever. Video from the officers’ body cameras that was released on Thursday shows that moments later, the child’s father emerges, walking out backward with his hands over his head. The boy’s mother then comes out, too, cradling her young son in her arms. The boy was whisked away to a hospital, and since that raid on Feb. 25, he and the couple’s two other children, ages 4 and 6, have been in the state’s custody. The parents have been charged with child abuse. The boy’s case is among the most extreme examples of the authorities overriding the rights of parents to make decisions for their children’s health, and it comes at a time of rising concern about unvaccinated children infecting others around them. The parents, Brooks Bryce and Sarah Beck, say the authorities drastically overreacted. “They treated us like criminals, busting in our door,” Mr. Bryce told a local TV station. “I mean, I don’t know what kind of trauma that did to my kids.” But the Chandler Police Department has defended its role in the confrontation, saying it was compelled to carry out a court-ordered welfare check after the child’s doctor became concerned that the boy might have meningitis, a potentially life-threatening illness, and was not receiving necessary emergency care. In rare cases, parents can be stripped of their ability to make health care decisions on behalf of their children. Even rarer are the occasions when parents lose custody of their children for declining treatment. But with 315 individual cases of measles confirmed in 15 states so far this year, the authorities are on high alert for people exhibiting symptoms of infectious diseases, especially children and toddlers who lack vaccinations for that disease and other illnesses. [Here’s what you need to know about the measles outbreak.] Under Arizona law, parents may decline vaccinations for their child based on personal, religious or medical exemptions. But that law is in opposition to the “parens patriae” theory, a centuries-old principle that empowers the state to look after the interests of children and others unable to care for themselves. “It’s a pretty high standard to meet,” said Douglas S. Diekema, who has been a practicing emergency room doctor for 30 years at Seattle Children’s Hospital. “I don’t know that I’ve ever called Child Protective Services, though I’ve thought about it a couple of times.” Police records show that on Feb. 25, Ms. Beck had taken her 2-year-old boy to a clinic, where his temperature was recorded at above 100 degrees. The child’s doctor became concerned that he could have meningitis, after learning that he was lethargic and had not been vaccinated. Ms. Beck was told to take him to an emergency room. “I called the doctor back and said ‘Hey, I’m not sure how you got this 105 reading, my son’s acting fine,’” Ms. Beck told a local TV station. “‘This doesn’t really seem like a medical emergency.’” The child’s doctor, after learning that Ms. Beck had ignored the recommendation to take the child to the hospital and having follow-up phone calls to the family go unanswered, then contacted the Arizona Department of Child Safety. Asked to do a welfare check, the police officers later arrived at the family’s door, but were not allowed in. The body camera footage released Thursday shows the police twice knocking and trying to enter, before an officer reaches Mr. Bryce by telephone just before midnight, and tells him that he needs to verify that their youngest child is improving. “No, you don’t need to,” Mr. Bryce replies. He remains polite, saying “No, thank you” when he’s asked to come out of his home. An emergency court order was issued, allowing the police to take the child into custody. The officers asked the family to leave their home and take the child to the hospital, the video shows. After two more unsuccessful attempts at knocking at the door, they reminded Mr. Bryce that they had a court order and broke down the door, nearly four hours after they arrived at the home. Though neither parent was arrested, they were each charged with one count of child abuse after an investigation. Two of the children, including the youngest, were taken by ambulance to the hospital, and the third was taken by the Department of Child Safety, according to the police. All three children remain in separate foster care placements, according to The Arizona Republic. Dr. Diekema, the emergency room doctor in Seattle, said that he personally encounters parents refusing a treatment plan “maybe every month or two,” meaning it likely happens in his hospital on a weekly basis. But there are procedures in place to stave off a hospital visit escalating into a child custody battle. Sometimes, he said, a compromise can be found on a less aggressive form of treatment that is acceptable to the doctor; other times, another doctor at the hospital can give a second opinion, which some parents find more comforting. Dr. Diekema, who is also a bioethics professor at the University of Washington School of Medicine, said that he tries to avoid coercion when he can. He recalled telling a patient’s parents, “I hate to say this, but I have to let you know that if you walk out of this emergency department, without agreeing to something that makes me comfortable, I’ll have to call child protective services.” He said that the doctor in Arizona would have been obligated to call the authorities if the family did not follow the clinic’s instructions. The boy was eventually found to have a respiratory illness. A judge has told the child’s parents that the state wants them to regain custody of their children, but it was unclear when that would happen. “We love our children, we love them,” Ms. Beck told another local TV station. “If our children needed help, we would absolutely help them.”",The New York Times
2019,What You Need to Know About Measles and Airplanes,"UPDATE A record 81 U.S. flights were investigated in 2018 for carrying at least one person contagious with the disease, which has had a large number of outbreaks this year. Measles isn’t only in the headlines these days; it may also be on your airplane. An adult contagious with the disease flew from Asia to San Francisco in February, infecting two others — one adult and one child — during the flight, California health departments said this month. It’s an inauspicious development in a year that has already seen 228 cases of the serious and potentially lethal disease in 12 states, including six outbreaks of at least three people. All the outbreaks in 2019 have been linked to travelers who carried measles from countries with lower vaccination rates, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and sickened people in areas of the United States where residents were not vaccinated. Last year, 82 of the 349 people diagnosed with measles carried them into this country from elsewhere, the highest number of imported cases since the virus was declared eliminated from the United States in 2000, the C.D.C. said. With 17 countries under a C.D.C. travel watch because of their high measles rates, including popular destinations like England, France and Italy, halting the spread of measles by travelers doesn’t seem likely anytime soon. A record 81 flights were investigated in 2018 for carrying at least one person contagious with the disease, up from 15 investigations in 2017 and 10 in 2016, according to the C.D.C. Of the 106 aircraft, 66 were on domestic routes and the rest were inbound from foreign airports. Because the United States has a fairly high overall vaccination rate against measles, the general population is largely protected by herd immunity. But there are states, and pockets within states, with far less compliance, and the concern is that infected fliers will transport measles to these vulnerable areas. “Suddenly the single introduction of a case can have explosive consequences,” said Dr. Martin Cetron, the director of the Division of Global Migration and Quarantine at the C.D.C. Measles is considered among the most contagious viruses in the world. Unlike the influenza pathogens, which spread when a person sneezes or coughs but then fall, the measles virus remains suspended in air, “like really light dust particles,” Dr. Cetron said, allowing the pathogens to linger and float for up to two hours. Influenza is spread by an exponent of two, meaning each person who gets it is likely to infect two others in a setting where people haven’t been immunized, he said. Measles is likely to be spread to between nine and 19 people who are not immunized, depending on the setting and the herd immunity of those nearby, he said. In 2014, a 19-month-old child connecting on a flight from India passed measles on to a man at a Chicago airport, even though they didn’t fly on the same plane. The man had arrived from Minnesota and disembarked at the same gate where the toddler was waiting to board the return flight. “Although transmission could have occurred anywhere in the airport where the child and the adult shared airspace, it most likely occurred in the gate area,” the C.D.C. wrote in its report on the incident. It did not identify the airport. The child had received a vaccination against measles at 12 months, but not the recommended booster. The man’s immunization history was unknown. No notification system is set up to alert at-risk travelers of potential measles exposure in airports. On planes, however, the law requires that the C.D.C. be contacted when health officials identify someone with the measles as having been contagious while onboard. In those instances, health officials use the flight manifest to contact those seated within two rows of the infected passenger. They also notify anyone on the plane with a lap child, on the premise that they are more likely to wander around the aircraft, the C.D.C. said. If an unvaccinated person can be notified quickly, then within 72 hours of exposure they can receive a dose of the MMR vaccine, which might prevent them from getting the disease or lessen its severity. If notification comes within six days, or if the person is not eligible to receive the vaccine and is notified within that time frame, then they can receive a shot of immunoglobulin, which are pre-made antibodies. “The protection from both of these is definitely not 100 percent, so none of these is as good as being vaccinated beforehand,” said Dr. Matthew Zahn, medical director for epidemiology for the Orange County Health Care Agency in California. On a plane that carries a contagious traveler, the other people most vulnerable are those who are too young to be vaccinated, who have opted out of getting a vaccine for personal reasons, and the 3 percent to 5 percent of the population who have compromised immune systems because of cancer, advanced rheumatoid arthritis treatments, and other causes, Dr. Zahn said. They may not be eligible to receive the MMR vaccine, a live vaccine which protects against measles, mumps and rubella. “There is a potential for exposure in your community, that’s the reality we live in,” Dr. Zahn said. “Airplane travel in general is one of those instances where that risk becomes a bit higher. People should be aware of that.” Most travelers can take steps to ensure they have protected themselves and those around them: Travelers taking domestic trips should follow the general C.D.C. recommendations: children should receive a first dose of MMR vaccine at 12 through 15 months of age, with a second dose at 4 through 6 years of age. The agency also recommends that teenagers and adults who are not pregnant, and who do not have written documentation of having received the MMR vaccine, get two doses separated by at least 28 days. For those traveling with children on international trips, the C.D.C. recommends an expedited vaccine schedule, counseling that babies receive one dose of vaccine at 6 months through 11 months of age, another dose at 12 through 15 months, and a third dose after that. All vaccinations should be separated by at least 28 days. For anyone eligible for a vaccine who is past their first birthday and taking an international trip, the C.D.C. recommends two doses of vaccine, separated by at least 28 days. Those who are ineligible to receive the MMR vaccine should familiarize themselves with the C.D.C. travel alerts for measles, and talk with their health care provider about the risks. Exceptions to the above include those who have written documentation of adequate vaccination, have had a confirmed case of the measles, have laboratory evidence of immunity, and those born before 1957, who are considered to have been exposed to the disease in their youth. In addition, an estimated 600,000 to 900,000 people between 1963 and 1967 received a different type of vaccination against measles and didn’t develop an immunity. Those individuals should be revaccinated. 52 PLACES AND MUCH, MUCH MORE Follow our 52 Places traveler, Sebastian Modak, on Instagram as he travels the world, and discover more Travel coverage by following us on Twitter and Facebook.

2019,"With Netanyahu Facing Indictment, Israel Braces for a Wild Election","JERUSALEM — Israelis were confronted with a rude new reality on Friday: a prime minister running for re-election while facing indictment for corruption. While there were hints that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu could be losing support, his right-wing allies appeared to be sticking with him and no one was foolish enough to write off a politician who still retains a strong base and has shown Houdini-like skill in escaping seemingly impossible jams before. The only certainty was that Israel was in for a wild ride between now and the April 9 ballot, with analysts predicting that the country’s political scene — loud, fractious and heated at the best of times — would become only more divisive as Mr. Netanyahu, who is seeking a fourth consecutive term, fights for his political life. “He splits the nation,” said Yehuda Ben Meir, an expert in public opinion at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv. “His are the politics of polarization and exaggeration. If he got any more polarizing he’d fall off the planet.” [The cases against Mr. Netanyahu, explained.] Mr. Netanyahu, who has dominated the Israeli political scene for a decade, faces a serious challenge from a newcomer, Benny Gantz, a retired military chief and leader of the new, centrist Blue and White party. After the announcement by the attorney general, Avichai Mandelblit, on Thursday that he intends to indict Mr. Netanyahu on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust, polls have pointed to a growing shift away from Mr. Netanyahu and his conservative Likud party and toward Mr. Gantz, whose military record could inoculate him against Mr. Netanyahu’s strongest line of attack, that he is the only one who can protect Israel’s security. Israel Hayom, the free newspaper sympathetic to Mr. Netanyahu and financed by Sheldon Adelson, the American casino billionaire and a longtime patron, buried its own poll in the Friday edition on page 19, after it put Blue and White a hefty nine seats ahead of Likud. If anything, experts said, Israel Hayom’s polls have tended to be skewed in Mr. Netanyahu’s favor. Still, it may be premature to measure the political effect of the attorney general’s announcement. “It’s too early for the polls to matter,” Mr. Ben Meir said. “It takes time for people to react.” The details of three separate, but interconnected, corruption cases in which Mr. Netanyahu is a suspect were spread over a 57-page document released by the Justice Ministry on Thursday. It included a chart with a monthly breakdown of the hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of cigars and Champagne supplied to the Netanyahus by a Hollywood producer and a millionaire businessman; back-room dealings with the publisher of a rival newspaper, Yediot Ahronot; and a dinner with an Israeli telecommunications mogul that led to a yearslong “give and take” relationship, as Mr. Mandelblit put it, with Mr. Netanyahu allegedly exchanging lucrative regulatory favors for positive coverage. But a deluge of leaks from the investigations over the past few months meant that for most Israelis, there was little shock value in the official revelations. Mr. Netanyahu, who denies any wrongdoing, went about his business as usual on Friday, hosting the president of Liberia, a former professional soccer player. “I told him that the next time he came we might play some football,” a seemingly jovial and relaxed Mr. Netanyahu said in a video. He also kept up his political invective, urging his supporters on Twitter, “Do not let the witch hunt against me confuse you.” Returning to a familiar theme, he denounced Mr. Gantz and his party as the “weak left” and said it would have to rely on the support of Arab parties to prevent a right-wing coalition. In the morning, public radio moved on from the investigations to discuss the problem of traumatized Israeli war veterans. People shopped for the sabbath. There was no reason to panic with the election still nearly 40 days off. “Forty days in an election season is the equivalent of two years in normal time,” wrote Amit Segal, an Israeli political analyst, in his weekly column in Friday’s Yediot Ahronot newspaper. “Until then, the agenda should change several times.” “No one’s jaw dropped yesterday,” he added, quoting the words of a popular Israeli song, “Lovers will love, haters will hate.” Opposition leaders have called on Mr. Netanyahu to resign, and so far, his right-wing allies appeared to still see him as their best bet to return to government. Most of his current coalition partners, and even a would-be successor within his Likud party, issued statements of support, saying the prime minister, like anybody else, deserved to be treated as innocent until proven guilty. Ayelet Frish, a former strategic consultant for Shimon Peres, said there was a perceptible shift among some of the “soft right” away from Mr. Netanyahu’s Likud to other parties. Whether they return home by April, she said, largely depends on Mr. Netanyahu. “Netanyahu is a champion at the negative campaign,” she said, “but it takes time to penetrate. We will have to wait until a minute before the elections.” In the 2015 election, Mr. Netanyahu was widely believed to have ensured a last-minute victory by scaring Jewish voters with a video demonizing Arab voters, saying left-wingers were busing them to the voting booths “in droves.” Palestinian-Arab citizens make up more than 20 percent of Israel’s population. The announcement on Thursday was an interim step in the prosecution. Mr. Netanyahu is now entitled to a hearing to challenge the charges before a formal indictment can be handed down. He insists that the hearing could overturn the attorney general’s decision and quash the cases against him, but his lawyers will need at least six months to prepare, experts say, and it is unlikely to take place before the election. Israeli criminal lawyers say that while the hearings often end in reduced charges or closed cases, that was unlikely in Mr. Netanyahu’s case. The investigation was closely supervised by the highest legal authorities and Mr. Mandelblit’s charges were conservative. He recommended the most serious charge, bribery, in only one case, while the state attorney’s office recommended bribery charges in all three. That makes a formal indictment all but certain. Whether Mr. Netanyahu will still be prime minister by then is not. OpinionBret Stephens",The New York Times
2019,"With No Major New Releases, Juice WRLD Repeats at No. 1","Juice WRLD, the 20-year-old singing rapper of the moment, is spending a second straight week atop the Billboard 200 chart with his new album, “Death Race for Love,” thanks to a slow period for major music releases. No new albums reached the Top 150 this week, leaving the streaming success of “Death Race” (Grade A/Interscope) in the No. 1 spot with a total of 74,000 units by the industry’s math, combining streams and sales. In Juice WRLD’s case, just 3,800 album sales were lifted by 106 million song streams, according to Nielsen, outpacing the runner-up, Ariana Grande’s “Thank U, Next” (Republic). In its sixth week on the chart, Grande’s second album in six months added another 78 million streams and 6,400 in sales, for a total of 66,000 units. The rest of the Top 5 has been hanging around for some time. Though it had the highest sales total of the week (about 16,000), the soundtrack to “A Star Is Born” (Interscope) held steady at No. 3 with 40,000 units in its 24th go-round on the Billboard chart. A Boogie Wit da Hoodie’s “Hoodie SZN” was carried to the No. 4 spot by 50 million streams in its 13th week, while the Queen soundtrack to the biopic “Bohemian Rhapsody” is No. 5 in its 22nd week. The highest-ranking debut came from the rapper Chief Keef, whose “GloToven” mixtape, with the Atlanta producer Zaytoven, lands at No. 153 with 8 million streams and 491 albums sold.",The New York Times
2019,"With Override Vote Coming, Congress Examines Military Cuts That Will Fund Wall","JACKSONVILLE, N.C. — The main road that connects a strip of tattoo parlors, pawn shops and restaurants to Camp Lejeune is still lined with broken trees bent by Hurricane Florence’s winds. Inside the gates, a new threat has arisen for the sprawling Marine Corps base as it contends with billions of dollars in hurricane damage and lingering effects of contaminated water: President Trump’s border wall. On Tuesday, the House will try to override the first veto of Mr. Trump’s presidency and rescue Congress’s bipartisan bid to block the president’s national emergency declaration, which Mr. Trump wants to use to siphon military funds from projects like Camp Lejeune’s reconstruction to build a wall on the Mexican border. Last month, Democrats appealed to Republicans — with only limited success — to vote down the president’s emergency on the lofty grounds of constitutional prerogative and Congress’s control of federal spending. This time, on the veto override, their appeal is more parochial: Look where the wall money will come from. “A bipartisan majority of Congress went on record in voting to rebuke this ill-conceived idea,” said Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee. “Now that members of Congress can see the potential impact this proposal could have on projects in their home states, I hope they will take that into consideration before the vote to override the president’s veto.” The expansive list of Defense Department projects targeted for possible cuts — $12.9 billion in all — spans nearly all 50 states and more than two dozen countries where troops are stationed. Fire station repairs, new schools and training complexes are all slated for potential funding delays to fulfill Mr. Trump’s intent to take up to $3.6 billion in military construction funds for the wall. So are plans for Camp Lejeune’s new water treatment facility. “What may seem small is large to others,” said Monique Gibbs, 39, a Jacksonville, N.C., native who works with survivors of trauma and abuse. On Monday, Patrick M. Shanahan, the acting defense secretary, authorized the first transfer of Defense Department money to fencing construction at the southwestern border: up to $1 billion from military personnel funding toward the construction of 57 miles of border wall, improving roads and adding lighting in Yuma, Ariz., and El Paso, according to a letter sent to the Department of Homeland Security. That transfer was made without having to use the emergency declaration, but the Defense Department is rushing to sign contracts on several projects, hoping that will protect them before officials turn to military construction funds to fulfill the president’s request. But some projects would be hit if the emergency decree survives its congressional rebuke and court challenges, and delays could be consequential for service members and their families. National Guard officials are scrambling to award money to build a $9 million fire rescue station in Peoria, Ill., before it is lost to the border and locals are left with an outdated fire station — built in 1992 and incapable of providing 24-hour support. At Fort Campbell, Ky., home of the historic 101st Airborne Division, base housing and maintenance facilities are throwbacks to the 1950s. The structures have slowly degraded under the rapid deployment tempo of the wars since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, according to congressional aides who recently toured the facility. And without congressional intervention, construction on a $63 million middle school will be delayed and base officials will likely repurpose an aging high school in the interim. In Jacksonville, there is discomfort among residents that money for Camp Lejeune’s projects could be delayed for a wall more than a thousand miles away. John Henley, a defense contractor here, doubted the “financial feasibility” of Mr. Trump’s signature campaign promise, but he also was resigned to a local hit. “I hate to make it so nonchalant; a building or two may fall down before they get repaired,” Mr. Henley, 34, said as he polished off a black cherry and grape snow cone a couple miles from Camp Lejeune. But, he added, “we’re a resilient type.” Efforts to turn the list into political ammunition against Republicans are particularly pointed in North Carolina, where Senator Thom Tillis, a first-term Republican, is running for re-election next year. Mr. Tillis publicly outlined his intent to vote against Mr. Trump’s national emergency declaration last month in a Washington Post opinion piece last month that dwelt on his constitutional responsibilities. Then, just before the vote last week, he changed his mind and voted with the president. Already, the state Democratic Party has blasted out emails detailing which North Carolina projects were on the list — including the Camp Lejeune water treatment facility — and condemning Mr. Tillis for putting “his political career ahead of the well-being” of local military families. That fund-raising email sparked more than double the average amount in donations, according to a person familiar with the results. “This definitely damaged Senator Tillis’s re-election concern in a way that’s unique, more so than the government shutdown or some of the past votes he took,” said Robert Howard, a spokesman for the North Carolina Democratic Party, citing the potential effect on Camp Lejeune, Fort Bragg and other military bases. “We very much understood what the emergency declaration could mean to our state.” Mr. Tillis said on Monday that he was concerned about the potential threat to the projects, but added, “I feel like the critical needs — we’ll be able to secure funding.” “I’m not worried about that,” Mr. Tillis said when asked about Democrats weaponizing his vote and the threat to North Carolina projects. “They’ll always be looking for ammunition.” Republican strategists and several conservative voters said his flip-flop suited them fine. “I’m glad he changed his mind,” said Ann Sulliview, 68, speaking ahead of a Republican convention in Wayne County, where officials emphasized the need to keep both the Senate and the presidency in Republican control. But, she conceded, “he was going to catch flak for that either way he went.” Patrick Gallagher, a Wayne County chiropractor, agreed. “We put him in office because he’s going to help the Republican Party,” he said. “The fact that he had a change of heart shows that he reflected back on why he’s there. He’s not there to thwart what we’re trying to accomplish.” Potentially losing money for military projects, he acknowledged, “is not the best” for the state. But he said it was something he and other conservative voters could accept for Mr. Trump and his wall. “I think we would give that up to do the greater good,” Dr. Gallagher said. “It’s not the best, but we’re forced to do that.” Republican lawmakers who voted against the national emergency declaration found that sentiment prevalent when they returned to their districts. Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri, was disinvited from a Republican dinner after his vote against the emergency declaration, the Kansas City Star reported. And at a town hall-style meeting in Spokane, Wash., on Monday, Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers told about 20 constituents that her vote for the resolution of disapproval — “a difficult vote for me,” she repeated — was a vote against a president trying to secure taxpayer funds without congressional approval, not against a border wall. Some applauded her resolve, but others were unconvinced of her support for Mr. Trump’s border security vision. “I appreciate your vote, but I disagree,” said Kerry Schmidt, 62. “There’s a lot of people fighting against it. Where are the people fighting for it?”",The New York Times

2019,"With Plans for New Hire, El Museo del Barrio Reaches Out to Its Critics","The direction and mission of El Museo del Barrio, the oldest museum in the United States devoted to Latino art, continues to be the center of a roiling debate. The museum announced this week that it is planning to hire a curator who will focus on “the art and culture of historically marginalized Latinx communities in the United States.” The statement, by the museum’s director, Patrick Charpenel, in an email to friends of the museum, appeared to be an effort to reaffirm El Museo’s commitment to its Puerto Rican roots and reach out to critics who have accused EL Museo of being out of touch with its Latinx heritage, which some define as people of Puerto Rican, Dominican and Mexican-American descent and living in the U.S. Earlier this month the museum announced it had hired a new chief curator who had worked at the São Paulo Museum of Art in Brazil. That choice drew criticism from some members of the New York community who favor the museum’s original emphasis as distinct over a more global vision. In his recent email, the director said the new hire will play an important role in increasing the visibility of Latinx cultural outreach, “including but not limited to Puerto Ricans, Chicanos, Afro-descendants from the Americas and LGBTQ populations.” El Museo was founded in 1969 by teachers, activists and artists to emphasize Puerto Rican cultural contributions. Some members of the cultural community have criticized Mr. Charpenel, who came from Mexico in 2017, suggesting that a director and chief curator from Latin America did not have enough knowledge of the art and social struggles of Puerto Ricans and Latin Americans in the United States. In what was widely perceived as a misstep, in January, El Museo canceled plans to honor Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, a German socialite with ties to Stephen K. Bannon and with far-right political parties in Germany and France. On Tuesday, Mr. Charpenel also announced a 50th anniversary show titled “Culture and the People: El Museo del Barrio, 1969-2019,” to open on April 11. He wrote that the exhibition “will reflect on our institution’s activist origins and pioneering role in culture and education.” Last week Marta Moreno Vega, a former director of El Museo, wrote on Facebook that she had withdrawn a self portrait from the show. “It is now an institution divorced from our communities,” Dr. Moreno Vega wrote in remarks first reported by Art News. “I refuse to have my work in an institution that devalues the contributions of El Barrio’s creatives,” she added. A spokeswoman for El Museo, Rose Mary Cortes, said that the institution was “saddened” by Dr. Moreno Vega’s decision, adding: “Her work will be missed in the exhibition’s important dialogue on our collection and legacy.” She added that the museum had been discussing for months hiring a curator specializing in Latinx art. By Friday, several hundred artists and educators had signed a letter demanding the museum “dedicate substantial resources to implement a residency program for emerging contemporary Latinx artists,” and that the staff and board mirror “the diverse Latinx communities,” among other goals.",The New York Times
2019,"With Shows Like ‘The Other Two,’ Comedy Central Looks Beyond Its Core","LOS ANGELES — A few years ago Comedy Central, best known for bro-centric series like “South Park” and “Tosh.0,” was enjoying the ratings, critical praise and cultural cachet that came from looking beyond its young white male template. “Key and Peele” turned goofs on black American identity into highly clickable sketch comedy; “Inside Amy Schumer” did the same with critical assessments of gender norms; and “Broad City” reinvigorated the New-York-strivers genre with its offbeat, feminist millennial sensibility. All were among the buzziest shows on TV. But that was then. “Key and Peele” ended in 2015; “Inside Amy Schumer” has been on hiatus since 2016; and “Broad City” is nearing the end of its five-season run. “South Park” and “Tosh.0,” meanwhile, are still going strong. Which means it is again time for Comedy Central to more aggressively court its “growth audience” — anyone who is not a young, straight, white male — Kent Alterman, the network president, said during a recent interview at his office in Hollywood. Enter a new slate of shows, many of them created by emerging talent with a variety of points of view, that is part of a “conscious attempt to reflect the world we live in,” Alterman said. The first up was “The Other Two,” which debuted in late January. Created by Chris Kelly and Sarah Schneider, former “Saturday Night Live” head writers, the show stars Drew Tarver and Heléne Yorke as the 20-something older siblings of a young YouTube star, whose sudden success coincides with their quarter-life crises. It has a gay lead character (Tarver) and is staffed predominantly by female or gay writers, including Kelly, and early results have been encouraging. The premiere episode was watched by 2.25 million people, including streaming and DVR viewing, and Comedy Central has since seen its female audience climb significantly. Viewing among women ages 18-49 was up by 13 percent in February, according to Nielsen — the most growth of any audience single segment and the network’s biggest spike in that demo since 2014. (The January return of “Broad City,” the lead-in for “The Other Two,” was also a big factor.) Other upcoming new series include “South Side,” set in the predominantly black Englewood neighborhood of Chicago, debuting this summer; and “Alternatino,” a sketch show from a Latino millennial perspective, coming in June; and “Awkwafina,” created by and starring the titular actress and comedian, that will be Comedy Central’s first show with an Asian-American lead. Alterman is loathe to refer to these series as replacements for “Key and Peele” and the like. “It’s not like we have formulaic slots that we’re filling — ‘OK, we lost this kind of show, we have to replace it with this kind of show.’ But I would say that there’s always an ongoing evolution.” That evolution has gained speed since Alterman — who first worked at Comedy Central from 1996 to 2000 before leaving for the movie industry — returned in 2010 as the head of original programming and production. Currently, there are nine women in senior leadership positions, five of which Alterman hired, as well as three people of color and at least two who identify as L.G.B.T. When he was promoted to president of original programming in 2013, he helped make the decision to hire Trevor Noah as Jon Stewart’s replacement on “The Daily Show” and helped to develop “Inside Amy Schumer” and “Broad City.” “I like to think that Kent didn’t just put ‘Broad City’ on the air because we’re women and he needed to diversify the creators,” said Abbi Jacobson, who created and stars in the show with Ilana Glazer. “He has a really wonderful eye for comedy and I think that a lot of incredible comedians right now happen to be women, and he’s giving them a platform to do their thing without a ton of micromanaging.” A similar hands-off approach has allowed the creators of “The Other Two” to give the show — and story lines involving Cary’s sexuality, in particular — a more “authentic” feel, Kelly said. “Sexuality is a big part of our show and the stories we wanted to tell, so it was important that we had other gay writers to help draw from their real experiences,” he said. Bashir Salahuddin and Diallo Riddle, the creators of “South Side,” say Comedy Central has given them the freedom to run their all-black writers’ room (save for the director Michael Blieden, who also wrote one episode) how they see fit. “Even among the executives, there is some diversity in hiring, and that makes the process way less translation heavy,” Riddle said. “Changes in the boardroom have actually helped us get a little bit closer to what we actually want to do.” The show, which Salahuddin describes as a “hard comedy with hard edges,” was shot on the actual South Side of Chicago, an area generally depicted on TV as violent and dangerous, with local nonactors in speaking roles and as extras. “We really wanted something that was not only close to our hearts, but allowed us to let Chicago speak for itself and show people how funny it can be,” Salahuddin said. “Alternatino” stars the “Broad City” alum Arturo Castro in a sketch show (based on his Comedy Central web series) that sends up American ideals about Latino culture in the same vein as Schumer did with modern American womanhood. In one sequence from the pilot, Castro’s onscreen persona is frustrated when a woman he’s dating finds him lacking of the machismo of the Colombian cartel character he plays on the Netflix series “Narcos.” Aside from Arturo, who was born in Guatemala, the writers room has three women, one Mexican-American writer, and four white men. “The packets submitted by young white dudes are incredibly funny — we try to focus on the funny first — but obviously there are things we can’t explain,” Castro said. “I have to check in with [other Latinos] like, ‘Am I being weird about not liking this?’ And they’re like ‘No, no, dude — my mom would kill me if you put that on!’ and I’m like ‘Thank you! I can’t write a stigmata sketch.’” Alterman said that he tries to give creators plenty of freedom, but he also wants to “make sure they’re protecting themselves, too,” with a “mix of more experienced and midlevel [writers with] newbie writers.” “But we never dictate that,” he added. In some cases, however, concerns arise. After “Awkwafina” was green lit for 10 episodes last month, the star tweeted that her writers’ room was staffed with all women — which would be a first for the network and a rarity for any show. Alterman admits he wondered, “Should we have at least one male writer, just to have that point of view?” he said. “And I was just talking with Sarah Babineau … and she said, ‘Uh, no — why do we need to?’” Babineau, the executive vice president and co-head of talent and development at Comedy Central, clarified that there are two men in the “Awkwafina” writers’ room, a writers’ assistant and a writers’ production assistant. But Alterman understood Babineau’s response to his query: “I’m sure that there were years and years where it was all men in the writer’s room and no one thought to ask that question the other way: ‘Do you think we should have a woman in the room?’” Comedy Central has several other series in the works that fit their new, more expansive bill, including “The New Negroes With Baron Vaughn and Open Mike Eagle,” premiering this spring, and pilots for “The Chameleon,” a scripted comedy from the openly gay comic Matteo Lane and “How to Be a Couple” from the writer Naomi Ekperigin (formerly of “Broad City”) and Andy Beckerman based on their real life interracial relationship. But while the network is branching out, Alterman says there are no plans to completely abandon its base of young white guys anytime soon — “South Park” and “Tosh.0,” two of the network’s longest-running shows currently on-air, are also consistently its highest-rated. Last month, Comedy Central announced the return of David Spade, who previously hosted “The Showbiz Show,” a parody of celebrity news programs, on the network from 2005-2007. In this new project, another pop culture-skewering show that debuts later this year, he will be the latest host to try his luck in the post-“Daily Show” slot where previously Larry Wilmore and Jordan Klepper were unable to find success. Spade’s hiring again raises what has become a persistent question: Does late-night really need another straight white guy? Comedy Central executives discussed that issue, Babineau said, but the network’s research indicates that its audience loves Spade. “In the same way that we’re not making programming just for men, we’re not making programming just for women either,” Babineau said. “You look for the Venn diagram where they all intersect,” she added, “where your core and growth will like it.” With Spade’s show being joined by upcoming projects with other white comics like Rory Scovel, Anthony Jeselnik and Tim Dillon, Comedy Central isn’t abandoning young white guys anytime soon. But it’s betting that, as with the network’s past hits told from diverse points of view, inspired comedy will transcend demographics. The brand’s core audience and growth audience are not mutually exclusive, Alterman said. “I just don’t think everything has to look like me for me to think that [it’s] funny.” An earlier version of this article misstated Sarah Babineau’s role at Comedy Central. She is the executive vice president, not the executive producer.",The New York Times
2019,"With Streaks of Gray Hair, Xi Jinping of China Breaks With Tradition","HONG KONG — President Xi Jinping is known for breaking the rules of Chinese politics, amassing more power than any leader since Mao. His latest attempt to shake things up may be one of his boldest moves yet: Mr. Xi is going slightly — though unabashedly — gray, in defiance of longstanding Communist Party tradition. For decades, Chinese leaders have sported unnaturally black heads of hair, a look that symbolized unity and gave the party a youthful veneer. But Mr. Xi, 65, appears to be dispensing with vanity as he presents himself as a relatable and avuncular leader, part of his efforts to soften his hard-line policies. As Mr. Xi takes part in the annual meeting of China’s legislature this week, the silver streaks in his hair have been a hit with delegates and the public. “He’s very humble,” said Gu Yan, 47, an employee at a technology firm in the eastern city of Xiamen. “He’s not afraid to be himself.” Mr. Xi has a history of making sartorial choices that underscore his image as a man of the people. He is often pictured in China wearing a navy blue, zippered windbreaker, a symbol of humility as he leads a campaign against corruption. His salt-and-pepper hair further reinforces that image, as well as Mr. Xi’s desire to be seen as a paternal figure and live up to the nickname by which he is popularly known, “Uncle Xi,” experts say. “It’s not this image of the stodgy cadre who must be exactly dyed and dressed in the right mold,” said Julian Gewirtz, a scholar who studies Chinese history and politics at Harvard. “It’s an image of the party that is more relatable and less apparatchik-like in its aesthetics.” Going gray was not always such a big deal in China — both Mao and Deng Xiaoping, China’s paramount leader, embraced a silver-haired look in their later years. But more recently, as the party promoted a “collective leadership” model to spread power more evenly after the strongman days of Mao, flawless black hair joined the sickle and hammer as part of the Communist uniform. In the past, hair color has often been seen as a symbol of status within the party. In 2015, for example, Zhou Yongkang, China’s former chief of domestic security, was shown confessing to crimes during a sentencing hearing, his formerly jet-black hair having turned into a shock of white while he was in detention. Zhang Jiehai, a sociologist at the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, said that in the past Chinese officials had dyed their hair to obscure health conditions and promote a more youthful image. But now, he said, Chinese officials are younger and society has grown more open. “It has become more natural,” he said. “The leaders no longer need to cover up gray hair.” How exactly Chinese officials maintain the jet-black look is something of a state secret, though copious amounts of dye are probably involved. Mr. Xi’s hair was mostly black when he rose to power in 2012. But as he has grappled with a slowing economy, diplomatic tussles in the South China Sea and a trade war with the United States, his hair has turned grayer. His silver-haired look has not gone unnoticed in the party. In 2016, a delegate at the National People’s Congress said she had noticed during a meeting with Mr. Xi that he had more gray hair. “Our country is so big,” the delegate, Zhu Xueqin, speculated at the time. “He needs to manage all sorts of things and it’s very hard.” Mr. Xi’s example seems to be catching on: At least seven members of the Politburo, an elite 25-member council at the highest levels of the Communist Party, also have gray hair. Prominent officials with gray hair include Liu He, a vice premier, and Wang Yi, the foreign minister. While gray hair might be seen as undesirable elsewhere in the world (President Trump proudly declared on Saturday, “I have no white hair”), in China some view it as a sign of wisdom. At barbershops in China, stylists said they applauded Mr. Xi’s decision to go gray. “It makes him look like he works harder — that he’s laboring day and night,” said Liu Ke, a stylist at a salon in the central city of Xi’an. Jiang Zhirong, the co-owner of a barbershop in a Beijing alleyway, said Mr. Xi couldn’t go wrong. “Whether he dyes his hair or not,” she said, “the president has great style.”",The New York Times
2019,"With Sweeping Document Request, Democrats Launch Broad Trump Corruption Inquiry","WASHINGTON — The chairman of the House Judiciary Committee delivered a flurry of demands for documents from the executive branch and the broader Trump world on Monday that detailed the breadth and ambition of a new investigation into possible obstruction of justice, corruption and abuse of power by President Trump and his administration. In the two months since they took control of the House, Democrats on several committees have begun scrutinizing members of the president’s cabinet, his businesses, his campaign and his inaugural committee, as well as his ties to key foreign powers, including Russia, which tried to disrupt the 2016 presidential election. They have also laid the groundwork to try to obtain Mr. Trump’s tax returns. But the newest requests from Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, the Judiciary Committee chairman, opened perhaps the most perilous front to date for Mr. Trump — an inquiry that takes aim at the heart of his norm-bending presidency and could conceivably form the basis of a future impeachment proceeding. Mr. Nadler was explicit on Monday in saying that the House was no longer content to await the findings of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, and would delve into many of the same issues, but with a different standard of evidence not wedded to a criminal indictment. “We will act quickly to gather this information, assess the evidence and follow the facts where they lead with full transparency with the American people,” Mr. Nadler said in a statement. “This is a critical time for our nation, and we have a responsibility to investigate these matters and hold hearings for the public to have all the facts. That is exactly what we intend to do.” Unlike Mr. Mueller, though, who has access to a grand jury to compel evidence, the Judiciary Committee could face significant hurdles to obtaining some of the material it seeks. Aides to the committee said that they had intentionally limited their initial requests to material already provided to other congressional committees or federal investigators to ensure substantial compliance. But witnesses could still choose to slow-walk production or defy subpoenas. Mr. Trump could choose to go further and assert executive privilege over certain materials, as well. The letters from Mr. Nadler, dated March 4, went to 81 agencies, individuals and other entities tied to the president. They included the Trump Organization, the Trump campaign, the Trump Foundation, the presidential inaugural committee and the White House. The Justice Department and the F.B.I., which have collected substantial evidence on Mr. Trump’s behind-the-scenes interactions with federal investigators, were also recipients. Letters also went out to dozens of the president’s closest family members and aides who counseled him as he sought to suppress the story of a pornographic film actress, Stormy Daniels, whose claim of an affair threatened his presidential campaign, and later as he began attacks against federal investigations into him and his associates, the news media and the federal judiciary. As a part of the inquiry, the committee will also investigate accusations of corruption, including possible violations of campaign finance law, the Constitution’s ban on foreign emoluments and the use of office for personal gain. Mr. Nadler did not mention the word impeachment in any of Monday’s documents, but its specter hangs heavily over Democratic leaders as they wade deeper into the president’s circles. The House Judiciary Committee is where impeachment proceedings begin. In an interview last week with The New York Times, Mr. Nadler said that he believed Mr. Trump had committed crimes while in office and had threatened basic constitutional norms. But he said he did not yet have the evidence to make the kind of overwhelming, bipartisan case against the president he believes he needs before pursuing a step as disruptive as impeachment. Monday’s requests could build that case. Twice in the past half-century, the committee has drawn up impeachment articles based, in part, on the same themes that Mr. Nadler laid out: obstruction of justice and abuse of power. There is already evidence in the public of the kind of actions the committee believes could cross those lines, and Mr. Mueller’s investigation could provide more, even if it does not ultimately recommend charging the president. transcript The politics of impeachment are more charged. The president and the White House have repeatedly rejected accusations of wrongdoing, arguing that Mr. Trump is innocent of many accusations and has broad powers in his office to run the government as he chooses. And there have been few cracks among Republican lawmakers, the president’s congressional firewall. In a statement on Monday evening, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, assailed the inquiry as “disgraceful and abusive,” and called it a “fishing expedition.” “The Democrats are not after the truth,” she said. “They are after the president.” Republicans in Congress assert that Democrats have already decided to target Mr. Trump for impeachment, saying repeatedly in recent weeks that despite public statements to the contrary, the new majority is determined to kick Mr. Trump out of office. “We don’t even know what the Mueller report says, but Democrats are already hedging their bets,” said Representative Doug Collins of Georgia, the Judiciary Committee’s top Republican. “After recklessly prejudging the president for obstruction, Chairman Nadler is pursuing evidence to back up his conclusion because, as he admits, ‘We don’t have the facts yet.’” Democrats also widened another front on Monday, as the chairmen of the Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Oversight committees wrote to the White House and State Department to request detailed documentation related to Mr. Trump’s communications with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and to reported efforts to conceal aspects of those communications. Committees in both the House and Senate have nibbled around the edges of several of the episodes raised by Mr. Nadler. But his investigation suggests a more coherent, deep investigation that could seek to tie together the scheme to pay off Ms. Daniels; the firing of James B. Comey as F.B.I. director; Mr. Trump’s attempts to remove the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III; the president’s apparent dangling of pardons and threatening of witnesses to the investigation; and other events. From Donald F. McGahn II, the former White House counsel, alone, Mr. Nadler requested all documents related to the resignation of Michael T. Flynn as national security adviser; interactions with and the firing of Mr. Comey; attempts to fire Mr. Mueller; communications with Mr. Trump about Jeff Sessions, the president’s first attorney general; and about open investigations into his presidency, among more than a dozen other topics. Mr. Nadler requested documents from Annie Donaldson, Mr. McGahn’s deputy who took exhaustive notes detailing Mr. Trump’s behavior in the West Wing in real time. Other targets include David J. Pecker, the chairman of American Media Inc., which publishes The National Enquirer and played a key role in suppressing Ms. Daniels’s story; Allen Weisselberg, the chief financial officer of the Trump Organization; Alan Garten, its lawyer; Mr. Sessions; and Thomas J. Barrack Jr., a close associate of Mr. Trump’s who led his inaugural committee. Michael D. Cohen, the president’s former lawyer and longtime fixer, who testified publicly last week before another House committee about the illegal hush money scheme, was sent three pages of requests, including any relevant “audio or video recordings.” Mr. Nadler also asked for information from Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser, and his two adult sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump. Ivanka Trump, who is married to Mr. Kushner and works in the White House, was not included among the initial requests. The committee said that additional requests for documents would follow in the coming weeks. Lawyers for Mr. Nadler are prepared for protracted negotiations or outright fights over certain requests. If the recipients of the requests do not voluntarily comply, Mr. Nadler will most likely issue subpoenas to compel them. But even if he does, there are practical limitations that could significantly slow his efforts if a witness were to challenge the subpoena in court. The most significant hurdle could come from Mr. Trump himself. The White House could choose to assert executive privilege to try to protect many of the materials central to the committee’s inquiry, including communications between Mr. Trump, Mr. McGahn and other advisers. Such claims are usually the president’s prerogative, but any such claim would almost certainly lead to a lengthy court fight that could delay the inquiry. In a sign of how taxing the inquiry may become, Mr. Nadler has hired two elite white-collar litigators, Norman L. Eisen and Barry H. Berke, to oversee it with his staff.

2019,"With Trump’s Budget Out, Democrats Must Now Show Their Cards","WASHINGTON — Presidential budgets are by tradition declared dead on arrival even before the details reach Capitol Hill, and President Trump’s $4.75 trillion budget for the 2020 fiscal year received that greeting in spades on Monday. But with a new Democratic majority in the House, the release of Mr. Trump’s budget blueprints marked the start of a consequential budget season. House Democrats must now work out a blueprint for governing that will define the party’s vision in clear terms — and answer burning questions on health care, taxation, climate change and other policy matters that have dogged the new majority since it took control. In short, it is time for the Democrats to show their cards. “We have a very different set of values and priorities,” Representative John Yarmuth of Kentucky, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, told reporters on Monday. “Ours will be a very realistic budget resolution.” The budget is a nonbinding document, and with Republicans controlling the Senate, it may be impossible for the two chambers to work out their differences. Faced with that prospect, Democratic leadership on Monday discussed not holding a vote on the budget, according to a leadership aide. The meeting, first reported by Politico, did not end with a decision. Just as the first budget of the Tea Party Republican era, in 2011, defined the party for years, a budget passed by House Democrats this year would almost certainly have political consequences. Mr. Yarmuth outlined a number of issues that Democrats hope to address in a budget that he said the committee hoped to unveil by mid-April, pointing to health care savings, a possible immigration-law overhaul and infrastructure investment as likely priorities. He pointed to prescription drug pricing, combating the opioid epidemic, infrastructure and investment in cybersecurity as areas in the administration’s proposal that could yield compromise. “The ingredients — in terms of either end of the Capitol — are there to make a reasonable deal,” Mr. Yarmuth said. “The White House is the wild card.” But even without Republicans, Democrats will need to find common ground. An increasingly vocal left flank is adamant that their initiatives — such as “Medicare for all” and the ambitious Green New Deal — be included in an initial budget blueprint. More moderate Democrats are likely to be just as adamant that they are not. And Mr. Yarmuth appeared to tip his hand when he said that a final budget proposal would probably focus on protecting and restoring elements of the Affordable Care Act, as opposed to endorsing Medicare for all. This spring’s budget will force Democratic leadership to weigh the limitations of divided government against the desires of members who won their seats by promising to shake things up in Washington. In 2011, House Republicans — who also faced a Senate and a White House under the control of the opposing party — lost support from rank-and-file members as they muscled through an ambitious budget devised to limit federal spending. The budget produced by the Budget Committee chairman at the time, Paul D. Ryan, included deep domestic spending cuts and plans to offer voucherlike “premium support” to older Americans to buy private insurance outside Medicare. Democrats used that budget as a political cudgel. Democrats face the same prospects, and they are divided on which policies to enshrine in the blueprint. In an effort to hear a range of perspectives, Mr. Yarmuth has met with the Congressional Progressive Caucus and is scheduled to meet with the Blue Dog Coalition, a group of Democrats who preach fiscal discipline, to discuss the coming budget. Both groups have members on the Budget Committee. “So far, we haven’t run into any huge ideological obstacles to putting together a reasonable budget,” Mr. Yarmuth said. Representative Ro Khanna, a liberal Democrat from California and a member of the committee, said he planned to advocate the inclusion of Medicare for all and other facets of a progressive agenda, as well as rolling back some elements of Republican tax cuts passed under Mr. Trump and President George W. Bush. “We have to make the case for economic growth for progressive policies,” Mr. Khanna said in an interview. Including Medicare for all in the final budget provides an opportunity for Democrats to “explain to the American people that this is going to save average families and the country money.” He acknowledged that it was unlikely that there would be a complete embrace of all of the policies, particularly the Green New Deal’s sweeping plan for tackling climate change and providing jobs, but that should not deter Democrats from including some nods to the broader vision. “That pragmatic vision has to be done side by side with the aspirational one,” he said. Lawmakers also have to contend with a ballooning federal deficit and a looming deadline to address spending caps that Congress put in place under President Barack Obama. While Mr. Trump’s budget proposal technically adheres to the limitations, Mr. Yarmuth said the side were far from an ideal starting point in negotiations. “We’re so far apart in our priorities that we have to wonder if the White House is going to be a serious negotiator, and that’s disturbing,” Mr. Yarmuth said. “But, on the other hand, this is a proposal not unlike the one they submitted last year, and we ultimately came up with a spending agreement.”",The New York Times
2019,"With a New Influx of Wealth, Is San Francisco Over?","California Today Good morning. (Here’s the sign-up, if you don’t already get California Today by email.) In yesterday’s newsletter, we explored why Montebello, a solidly middle class suburb of Los Angeles, was an unexpected target for Gov. Gavin Newsom’s ire over unaffordable housing. Today, my colleague Nellie Bowles takes us to a city where the housing landscape has been the target of way more outrage — and it’s about to get worse. We’re talking about San Francisco. I’ll let her explain why: Booms usually follow busts. But not in San Francisco today. A new fleet of huge start-ups — among them Uber, Airbnb, Lyft, Slack and Pinterest — is preparing to go public, and the employees who have patiently waited for their stock options to turn to cash will finally have their day. The trouble is: The city still hasn’t quite caught its breath from the last boom, which saw clashes between protesters and tech buses. There’s still not enough housing, still jarring inequality on the streets. And now thousands of the newly cash rich are going to be looking to put their stake in the city. Familiar issues are boiling up again. So I spent a few days talking to local business owners, financial managers, real estate agents, housing activists, tech workers, ice sculptors and bike shops about what they’re expecting from the I.P.O.-palooza this year. One note: A fair number have read it and told me, “Oh this is why San Francisco is over.” I would push back on that. When I was reporting this story, and as news came that even more of Silicon Valley’s engines are moving north, the realization I kept having is that San Francisco’s financial and cultural power is only beginning. So what do you think? Is San Francisco beyond saving from the uber-wealthy? Tell us about it at CAtoday@nytimes.com. (We often link to sites that limit access for nonsubscribers.

2019,"With a Second President in Jail, Brazil’s Carwash Probe Lives on","RIO DE JANEIRO — The news coverage was breathless, political speculation was rampant and satirical Twitter memes flew after former President Michel Temer of Brazil was taken into custody on Thursday in connection .with a sweeping corruption probe known as Carwash. Mr. Temer’s arrest did not come as a surprise. The 78-year-old politician, who for decades wielded enormous influence in Brazil’s notoriously transactional political system, has long been dogged by accusations of corruption. But it was the second jailing of a former Brazilian president in as many years. And, in an unusual step some saw as overly harsh, a federal judge in Rio de Janeiro ordered Mr. Temer’s detention as a precautionary measure as the authorities investigate what they say is a pattern of kickbacks and money laundering he oversaw. The continuing Carwash scandal has tarnished much of Brazil’s political elite and could threaten the current government’s agenda. In 2014, federal police officers and prosecutors with expertise in money laundering exposed a wide-ranging scheme that came to be known as Lava Jato, or Carwash, after they stumbled onto suspicious currency transactions at gas stations in Brasília, the capital. The investigation exposed a pattern of institutionalized kickbacks at some of Brazil’s largest companies and put scores of politicians across the political spectrum in the cross hairs of Brazil’s judiciary, which operates with considerable autonomy. Carwash’s tentacles reached across borders, landing former presidents and ministers from across Latin America in jail. It also led to the largest foreign corruption settlement negotiated by the United States Justice Department. The investigation roiled Brazil’s politics last year when former President Luis Inácio Lula da Silva was detained to start serving a 12-year sentence, following his conviction in 2017 on charges of corruption and money laundering. That knocked him out of the presidential contest, in which he had been the front-runner. At the time, Brazil was led by Mr. Temer, who rose to the presidency in 2016 after the impeachment of his onetime political ally, former President Dilma Rousseff. Ms. Rousseff, who was not implicated in Carwash, became deeply unpopular as the scandal widened and Brazilians endured a brutal economic recession. Mr. Temer’s time in the presidential palace was turbulent. Just months after he took the helm of a deeply polarized Brazil, law enforcement officials leaked a transcript of a wiretap in which Mr. Temer was heard condoning a bribe. Things soon got worse: the attorney general filed two sets of corruption charges against Mr. Temer in 2017, accusing him of corruption, money laundering and obstruction of justice. Mr. Temer, a center-right politician, spent much of his political capital in office persuading members of Congress to use their authority to keep those cases from moving forward. Once he left office on Jan. 1, though, Mr. Temer lost the legal protections elected officials enjoy. Brazilian legal experts assumed it was a matter of time before the former president would be arrested in connection with one of the 10 corruption inquiries in which is a suspect. In the short term, the detention is likely to be welcome news for President Jair Bolsonaro. Widespread news coverage of Mr. Temer’s arrest diverts attention from a series of scandals involving Mr. Bolsonaro’s family and leaders of his party, which have hurt his popularity. Mr. Temer’s arrest also lends credence to the narrative that Brazil’s corruption crackdown is still going strong in the Bolsonaro era. While Mr. Temer’s arrest rattled the markets in Brazil, it could bode well for the future of the country, Waldir Soares de Olivera, the leader of Mr. Bolsonaro’s Social Liberal Party in the lower House of Congress, said in an interview. “It enhances our credibility before the international community,” he said. But Mr. Temer’s legal troubles may hinder Mr. Bolsonaro’s ability to make headway on an ambitious legislative agenda, which includes an overhaul of the pension system and a crime bill that would give law enforcement officials broader authority to go after corruption. Several key lawmakers, including the Speaker of the House, Rodrigo Maia, are targets of Carwash prosecutors. Mr. Maia’s father-in-law, Wellington Moreira Franco, was among the suspects detained on Thursday along with Mr. Temer. “These reforms take away entitlements and it’s hard for people to accept that their entitlements are being taken away by lawmakers embroiled in scandals,” said Octavio Amorim Neto, a political scientist at Fundação Getulio Vargas University in Rio de Janeiro. A small group of protesters greeted Mr. Temer with chants of “thief, thief!” as he arrived Thursday night at the police compound in Rio de Janeiro where he is being held. Few people have rallied to his defense. Even after the conviction of Mr. da Silva, a leftist lion who was president from 2003 to 2010, he remained beloved among a significant share of the population; “Free Lula” remains a rallying cry among supporters, who regard him as a political prisoner. Mr. Temer, on the other hand, left office as a widely loathed leader, the personification of the back-room dealing at the heart of Brazil’s endemic culture of graft. But even some politicians and analysts who have little sympathy for Mr. Temer think prosecutors and the judge handling the case overreached by ordering his detention before he stood trial. “I think it’s an abuse of their authority, which we see from time to time,” Sen. Tasso Jereissati said, referring to the team of crusading judges and prosecutors who handle Carwash cases. “He wasn’t a fugitive. As far as I know, his address was known.”",The New York Times
2019,"With the Playoffs Out of Sight, What’s Left for the Lakers?","On Pro Basketball LOS ANGELES — To celebrate their first home win in 25 days, the Lakers on Sunday dropped streamers that had been collecting dust from the ceiling at Staples Center. The final lineup of the night included Alex Caruso, a 25-year-old guard who spent most of the season in the N.B.A.’s developmental G League. Caruso knows things were not supposed to be this way. His mere presence — in a crunchtime situation, no less — was a vivid sign that the season had gone sideways for the Lakers, who will be watching the playoffs from various vacation destinations. Caruso also knows that the Lakers are playing fairly meaningless games, including Sunday’s 111-106 victory over the Sacramento Kings. The Lakers (32-41) have nine more of these to go, starting Tuesday against the Washington Wizards. The buzz of LeBron James’s first season as a Laker is gone. The roster will be overhauled again this summer as the franchise, which has not been to the playoffs since 2013, rummages for solutions. “But for me,” Caruso said, “these games are really meaningful.” The Lakers are searching for motivation wherever they can find it, especially as they head toward an off-season of uncertainty. Coach Luke Walton’s job status is tenuous at best, and 10 players on the current roster do not have guaranteed deals for next season. Some of them, like Caruso, are trying to showcase their skills in hopes of acquiring N.B.A. work next season. “I think this little stretch has been really good,” Caruso said, “because it’s finally allowed me to put all that work I’ve put in over the last two years and show how much I’ve evolved as a player. That I’m gaining confidence and making strides to get better and better.” In 16 appearances for the Lakers this season, Caruso has shot 44.6 percent from the field, averaging 6 points and 2.2 rebounds. Even players who figure to be a part of the franchise’s future are focusing on personal growth. A team is always a collection of individuals, but the Lakers’ late-season emphasis on “me” is particularly understandable. “I need to use these games to develop myself and play with the ball more,” the second-year forward Kyle Kuzma said recently. The Lakers were not yet mathematically eliminated from playoff contention when they lost to the Knicks at Madison Square Garden on March 17 — that would happen five days later — but Kuzma stood by his locker in a red leather jumpsuit after the game and spoke about the immediate future. “I’m just trying to use these last 13, 14 games — whatever we have — to just try to develop good habits,” he said. “Season’s pretty much over, so that’s the only thing I can really do. Everyone knows I’m a good scorer and I can do that. I’m just trying to complete my game.” Then there are the injured players who have largely disappeared from view: Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart. For them, the end of this season is about rehabbing for the next one. After all the losses, injuries and general dysfunction, Walton continues to preach the importance of team play. Same as ever. “It starts with our effort and how we play and how we compete,” he said. “And our guys have been doing a nice job of that, even though we haven’t been winning games. Whatever lineups we’ve been putting out there, they’re giving what they have. So that’s the No. 1 thing.” As for James, these are his first truly inconsequential games since his rookie season with the Cleveland Cavaliers, who finished well out of playoff contention. But even then, he could use the end of the season as an opportunity to hone his abilities and gain experience for future endeavors — such as eight consecutive trips to the N.B.A. Finals. So it is a credit to James, even as the grease fire of his first season with the Lakers smolders, that he is out there — trying. Against the Kings, he finished with his 81st career triple-double: 29 points, 11 assists, 11 rebounds. How does he sustain the motivation? “If he’s out there on the court, he’s going to give what he has,” Walton said. “That’s probably a better question for him, but I’m getting to know him, and that’s the type of person he is: He respects and loves the game. So if he’s going to play, he’s going to give what he has.” James said he appreciated the fans who continued to show up. He also said he owed it to himself to play with genuine effort. “I’ve always respected the basketball gods,” James said, “and if I’m on the floor, I got to try to play as hard as I can or do something to affect the game and not cheat the game.” Still, times have changed for the Lakers, who have not been to the playoffs since 2013. Before that, they routinely fixated on the Western Conference standings and the number of wins they would need to make the playoffs. Now, the most important number in their universe is 3 percent — as in, their odds of winning the N.B.A. draft lottery. Then again, the Lakers are not the only team that has so little at stake at this stage of the season. Look no further than the Kings, whose push for a playoff berth has deteriorated in recent weeks. Before Sunday’s game, Coach Dave Joerger held a brief news conference. No one had much to ask. “I can give you some more stuff,” he said. “I mean, it’s sunny out. It’s spring. It smells like March Madness, Lent and the N.B.A. playoffs. Get the seedings, get it done. Exciting times.” He paused again. “Nothing else?” he asked. Nothing else.",The New York Times
2019,"Opinion | Without Humans, A.I. Can Wreak Havoc","Let’s not let artificial intelligence put society on autopilot. Ms. Maher is the chief executive of the Wikimedia Foundation. The year 1989 is often remembered for events that challenged the Cold War world order, from the protests in Tiananmen Square to the fall of the Berlin Wall. It is less well remembered for what is considered the birth of the World Wide Web. In March of 1989, the British researcher Tim Berners-Lee shared the protocols, including HTML, URL and HTTP that enabled the internet to become a place of communication and collaboration across the globe. As the World Wide Web marks its 30th birthday on Tuesday, public discourse is dominated by alarm about Big Tech, data privacy and viral disinformation. Tech executives have been called to testify before Congress, a popular campaign dissuaded Amazon from opening a second headquarters in New York and the United Kingdom is going after social media companies that it calls “digital gangsters.” Implicit in this tech-lash is nostalgia for a more innocent online era. But longing for a return to the internet’s yesteryears isn’t constructive. In the early days, access to the web was expensive and exclusive, and it was not reflective or inclusive of society as a whole. What is worth revisiting is less how it felt or operated, but what the early web stood for. Those first principles of creativity, connection and collaboration are worth reconsidering today as we reflect on the past and the future promise of our digitized society. The early days of the internet were febrile with dreams about how it might transform our world, connecting the planet and democratizing access to knowledge and power. It has certainly effected great change, if not always what its founders anticipated. If a new democratic global commons didn’t quite emerge, a new demos certainly did: An internet of people who created it, shared it and reciprocated in its use. People have always been the best part of the internet, and to that end, we have good news. New data from the Pew Research Center show that more than 5 billion people now have a mobile device and more than half of those can connect to the internet. We have passed a tipping point where more people are now connected to the internet than not. In low- and middle-income countries, however, a new report shows women are 23 percent less likely than men to use the mobile internet. If we can close that gender gap it would lead to a $700 billion economic opportunity. The web’s 30th anniversary gives us a much-needed chance to examine what is working well on the internet — and what isn’t. It is clear that people are the common denominator. Indeed, many of the internet’s current problems stem from misguided efforts to take the internet away from people, or vice versa. Sometimes this happens for geopolitical reasons. Nearly two years ago, Turkey fully blocked Wikipedia, making it only the second country after China to do so. Reports suggest a Russian proposal to unplug briefly from the internet to test its cyber defenses could actually be an effort to set up a mass censorship program. And now there is news that Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India is trying to implement government controls that some worry will lead to Chinese-style censorship. But people get taken out of the equation in more opaque ways as well. When you browse social media, the content you see is curated, not by a human editor but by an algorithm that puts you in a box. Increasingly, algorithms can help decide what we read, who we date, what we buy and, more worryingly, the services, credit or even liberties for which we’re eligible. Too often, artificial intelligence is presented as an all-powerful solution to our problems, a scalable replacement for people. Companies are automating nearly every aspect of their social interfaces, from creating to moderating to personalizing content. At its worst, A.I. can put society on autopilot that may not consider our dearest values. Without humans, A.I. can wreak havoc. A glaring example was Amazon’s A.I.-driven human resources software that was supposed to surface the best job candidates, but ended up being biased against women. Built using past resumes submitted to Amazon, most of which came from men, the program concluded men were preferable to women. Rather than replacing humans, A.I. is best used to support our capacity for creativity and discernment. Wikipedia is creating A.I. that will flag potentially problematic edits — like a prankster vandalizing a celebrity’s page — to a human who can then step in. The system can also help our volunteer editors evaluate a newly created page or suggest superb pages for featuring. In short, A.I. that is deployed by and for humans can improve the experience of both people consuming information and those producing it. Our collective wisdom is perhaps one of humanity’s greatest accomplishments, one built collaboratively across ages, geographies and cultures. Over the long run, knowledge, like water, proves more powerful than every vessel that seeks to contain it. This is because people — no matter where they are, no matter from where they come — possess intrinsic curiosity, creative souls and inquiring minds. It is clear that the right to inquiry is universal, recognized by the United Nations as applying online as well as off. But today, censorship is only part of the challenge. Without people in the loop, we risk losing the web’s fundamental humanity. If the best part of the web is indeed people, then we must keep them at the center of every policy decision and platform design. We must defend a web that is free and unfettered, and improve connections that allow creativity and collaboration. We should leave the artificial to the machines and restore humanity to the users.

2019,Woman Accused of Murdering Kim Jong-nam Is Freed,"SHAH ALAM, Malaysia — An Indonesian woman who was on trial in the 2017 airport killing of Kim Jong-nam, the estranged half brother of the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, was freed on Monday after more than two years in custody. The defendant, Siti Aisyah, 27, will be allowed to leave Malaysia and return to Indonesia after prosecutors in the case withdrew the murder charge against her without explanation. “I am surprised and very happy,” Ms. Siti told reporters as she left the courthouse. According to Ms. Siti’s attorney, Gooi Soon Seng, Ms. Siti departed later on Monday for Jakarta, the Indonesian capital, on a private jet with Rusdi Kirana, Indonesia’s ambassador to Malaysia and a co-founder of the Indonesian budget airline Lion Air. They landed in the late afternoon. The fate of a second suspect in the case, Doan Thi Huang, 30, of Vietnam, remained uncertain. She had been scheduled to begin testifying on Monday for the first time. But after the dismissal of the case against Ms. Siti, the trial was put on hold so that the defense could seek dismissal of the charges against Ms. Doan. The court is scheduled to reconvene on Thursday. The two women were accused of killing Mr. Kim by smearing VX nerve agent on his face at Kuala Lumpur International Airport as he prepared to leave the country in February 2017. After their arrest, they said that they were duped into committing the killing and thought they were participating in a harmless prank for a reality television show. Both women potentially faced the death penalty. Kim Jong-un was widely believed to have ordered the assassination of his elder half brother. At least seven North Korean operatives accused of recruiting the women and setting up the killing left Malaysia without facing charges. The lead prosecutor, Muhammad Iskandar Ahmad, declined to say why the charge against Ms. Siti had been dropped. He told reporters that the decision had been made by Malaysia’s attorney general, Tommy Thomas. “There are many reasons, which I think are not proper for me to disclose,” the prosecutor said. The Indonesian Embassy released a statement saying that the Indonesian government had been working for many months to free Ms. Siti. President Joko Widodo raised the issue personally with Malaysia’s prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, when the two met in Indonesia in June, the statement said. “This issue was brought up at every bilateral meeting at every level from the president down to the ministerial level,” the embassy statement said. Mr. Widodo faces re-election next month and securing Ms. Siti’s release could improve his standing. Ms. Doan, surrounded by heavily armed guards and wearing a scarf pulled down over her face, was taken back to jail after the hearing. Her lawyer, Hisyam Teh, said that she was distressed by the decision to free only Ms. Siti and not her, too. “Doan is traumatized that there was no fairness shown to her,” he said. Mr. Teh said the prosecutor did not discuss the basis for the decision in court. “We don’t know why the charge was withdrawn,” he said. “No reason was advanced.” He said he would apply to Mr. Thomas to dismiss the charge against Ms. Doan on the grounds that the two women should be treated equally. “We hope the attorney general will exercise fairness,” he said. “There must not be justice just for one and not the other.” After her release, Ms. Siti appeared at a brief news conference at the Indonesian Embassy in nearby Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian capital, where she said she was surprised to have been freed. She thanked Mr. Joko and other Indonesian and Malaysian officials for her release. The embassy released an undated letter to Mr. Thomas from Indonesia’s minister of law and human rights, Yasonna H. Laoly, citing grounds for dismissing the case. He said Ms. Siti believed she was part of a reality show and had no intention to kill Mr. Kim. She was deceived and used by North Korean intelligence, he said, and did not benefit in any way from her actions. In a separate statement, Mr. Yasonna said that he had also met with Mr. Mahathir last year to plead for Ms. Siti’s freedom. “Siti Aisyah’s release reflects President Joko Widodo’s commitment to protect and help any Indonesians who face a problem abroad,” he said.",The New York Times

2019,Woman Attacks 7 People With Pepper Spray in Manhattan in What Police Say May Be a Hate Crime,"A woman attacked seven people with a substance like pepper spray in four places in Harlem and the Upper West Side on Friday, including two subway stations, in a series of attacks that were being investigated as possible hate crimes, the police said. Detective George Tsourovakas, a police spokesman, said the woman was black and the seven victims were white. He declined to elaborate on the hate crime investigation. As of Friday night, the police were still searching for the woman, who had not been identified or arrested. The attacks occurred between 11:50 a.m. and 1 p.m. on Friday, Detective Tsourovakas said. He said the first victim, a man, was on the southbound platform at the 125th and Lenox subway station. The woman walked up to him and sprayed him in the face without either of them exchanging words, he said. The detective said the woman then left the station and pepper-sprayed a 47-year-old man and a 48-year-old woman as they were walking near 125th Street and Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard. She then sprayed another man and a 38-year-old woman near 125th Street and Frederick Douglass Boulevard.

2019,"Woman Kept Dozens of Immigrants in Home, Forcing Some to Work, U.S. Says","An Illinois woman is facing federal charges of forced labor after the F.B.I. raided her home and discovered 33 Guatemalan immigrants, some of whom were made to work and pay thousands of dollars as a debt for helping them stay in the United States, the authorities said this week. The F.B.I. searched the home of the woman, Concepcion Malinek, in Cicero, Ill., a Chicago suburb, on Tuesday morning after interviewing immigrants who described an abusive living situation in which Ms. Malinek exerted control over their every move, according to a criminal complaint. The authorities said they found 19 adults and 14 children, as well as documents apparently outlining the immigrants’ debts to Ms. Malinek, 49. The immigrants who spoke with the F.B.I. said that Ms. Malinek, who is a dual citizen of the United States and Guatemala, either helped pay for their plane ticket to Chicago or allowed them to tell immigration authorities that they would be staying at her house after they crossed the United States-Mexico border, according to the complaint. When the immigrants arrived to Ms. Malinek’s home, it said, she told them that they owed her thousands of dollars for her assistance. Some of the immigrants, who were not named in the complaint, told the F.B.I. that Ms. Malinek charged them for rent, child care and transportation to a factory where she arranged for them to work, according to the complaint. One man said he slept in the basement of Ms. Malinek’s home and that she did not allow them to leave the basement unless they received her permission. The man and his 15-year-old daughter, who lived on the ground floor, were allowed to see each other only for limited periods of time, the complaint said. The authorities also found fraudulent permanent resident cards for the father and daughter in the house, the complaint said. The 15-year-old daughter, who worked at the factory with the other immigrants, had a fake permanent resident card that said she was in her late 20s The authorities said they learned of the alleged forced-labor scheme through a tip from someone who worked with the immigrants at the factory in Romeoville, Ill., about 25 miles southwest of Cicero. The immigrants told the authorities that Ms. Malinek often threatened them with deportation if they told anyone about their living situation. According to the complaint, one of the immigrants said that Ms. Malinek had told them, “Immigration knows how many people live in this house,” and that “you guys are poor and I have all the money.” Ms. Malinek was charged with two counts of forced labor in reference to two immigrants who say she forced them to work under the threat of serious harm. Each count carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. On Thursday, United States Magistrate Judge Jeffrey Cole ordered that Ms. Malinek be held without bail, according to court documents. A lawyer for Ms. Malinek did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Friday night. A spokesman for the United States Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Illinois said Ms. Malinek’s husband, who is a Transportation Security Administration agent, is also being investigated. The spokesman would not specify where the 33 Guatemalan immigrants were living after they were recovered from the home but said that some were in protective custody. According to the complaint, one of the immigrants told the authorities that Ms. Malinek called them upstairs from the basement each Thursday to meet with “immigration officials.” The Justice Department spokesman declined to comment on whether these were actual immigration officials. A prosecutor told The Chicago Sun-Times that the immigrants were being held in squalor, with mold, cockroaches and leaking sewage in the house. In court on Thursday, The Chicago Sun-Times reported, Ms. Malinek’s defense lawyer, Raymond Pijon, told the judge that Ms. Malinek believed she was helping the immigrants — some of them her family members — flee Guatemala. “There was a lot of good heart behind that,” Pijon said, according to The Sun-Times, “because she knows what’s happening in Guatemala.” The Justice Department spokesman would not comment on whether the immigrants were in the country illegally or not, but in the complaint, one of the immigrants told the F.B.I. that some people living in the house were seeking political asylum.",The New York Times
2019,"Woman Sentenced to 15 Years for Attacking Man, 92, With a Brick in California","A woman in Los Angeles was sentenced to 15 years in prison this past week for what the authorities said was an unprovoked attack on an elderly man last year. The woman, Laquisha Jones, 30, was accused of beating the man with a brick and telling him to “go back to your country,” the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s office said. Ms. Jones was sentenced Thursday after pleading no contest to an elder abuse charge, as part of a plea agreement in December. She had previously been charged with attempted murder and elder abuse, including a “hate crime allegation,” a spokesman for the district attorney’s office said Friday. The plea agreement did not include the hate crime component, the spokesman said. The case drew widespread attention after the man, Rodolfo Rodriguez, now 92, was left bloodied, bruised and bewildered on the sidewalk in Willowbrook, an unincorporated area of the county about 15 miles south of downtown Los Angeles, while going for a walk on the evening of July 4. He told CNN last year that he had passed a woman and a child on his walk, and without warning, the woman began hitting him with a concrete brick. He also said a group of men came over and began kicking him on the ground after the woman told them that he had tried to take away her daughter. Prosecutors said Ms. Jones attacked Mr. Rodriguez “without provocation,” and that she acknowledged using a brick to injure the man. Mr. Rodriguez sustained a broken jaw, broken cheekbones, two broken ribs and bruises on his face, back and abdomen, his grandson Erik Mendoza, told CNN last year. He said Mr. Rodriguez traveled from Michoacán, Mexico, to visit family in California about twice a year and walked through the neighborhood every day. A witness, Misbel Borjas, posted a video of the aftermath and told CNN then that she had heard a female attacker saying, “Go back to your country. Go back to Mexico.” (She gave similar accounts to The Los Angeles Times and other news organizations.) In the video, Mr. Rodriguez can be seen sitting on the ground next to a red-stained sidewalk, his face covered in blood. Ms. Jones was being held in a county jail, records show. A lawyer representing her did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday. On Thursday evening, Mr. Rodriguez, who had given interviews from bed after the attack, walked outside to greet reporters from KCAL9, a Los Angeles television station. Speaking in Spanish, he told them that he was “good and happy, thanks to God.” He said he would have been satisfied if Ms. Jones had gotten a lesser sentence of only a few years in prison. “Everyone makes mistakes,” he said through an interpreter. “We have to forgive each other because God forgives us.”",The New York Times
2019,"Woman and Homeless Man Plead Guilty in $400,000 GoFundMe Scam","A woman and a homeless man who fabricated a heartwarming story of compassion that drew more than $400,000 in donations on GoFundMe pleaded guilty to federal conspiracy charges on Wednesday. Johnny Bobbitt, 36, pleaded guilty in federal court in Camden, N.J., to one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering, while Katelyn McClure, 28, pleaded guilty to a count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Sentencing for Ms. McClure is scheduled for June 19; she faces up to 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. Mr. Bobbitt faces up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. His sentencing date has not been set. The two also face state charges in New Jersey, as does Mark D’Amico, who was Ms. McClure’s boyfriend when the crimes were committed. In 2017, the authorities say, the three wove an irresistible yarn. Posting to GoFundMe, a crowdfunding site, Ms. McClure and Mr. D’Amico said that she had run out of gas while driving home in the Philadelphia area, and that Mr. Bobbitt, a homeless veteran, had spent his last $20 to buy gasoline for her. The couple said they wanted to raise $10,000 to thank him and get him off the streets. GoFundMe allows anyone to suggest a cause worthy of donations, whether it’s classroom supplies, life-or-death medical care or a border wall. With thousands of causes competing for attention, users often rely on emotional appeals to stand out. This time, it worked. Buoyed by social media and coverage from the international news media, 14,347 people donated $402,706 to the campaign within three weeks. From there, the story became much less inspiring. Federal prosecutors say Ms. McClure and Mr. D’Amico rapidly spent most of the money on the likes of gambling, vacations, a luxury car, clothing and expensive handbags, much of which was later seized. The authorities said the couple set up a bank account for Mr. Bobbitt in December 2017 and deposited just $25,000; the couple later justified that as a way to keep him from spending it all at once. Mr. Bobbitt sued the couple in August, saying that he had ultimately received just $75,000, including the value of a camper he temporarily lived in, and that they had spent the rest. GoFundMe announced in September that it would help cover the costs to make sure Mr. Bobbitt got all of the money he was due. But the lucrative narrative would soon fall apart as well. The federal authorities read more than 60,000 text messages sent by Ms. McClure and Mr. D’Amico, including one Ms. McClure sent to a friend an hour after the GoFundMe campaign began. “OK, so wait, the gas part is completely made up but the guy isn’t,” Ms. McClure said in the text message. “I had to make something up so people will feel bad.” After GoFundMe fees, they had netted $367,108. In March, Ms. McClure sent a text message to Mr. D’Amico saying they had less than $10,000 of the donated money left, the authorities said. GoFundMe said in November that it would refund all donations for Mr. Bobbitt, calling the misbehavior on the platform “extremely rare” and “unacceptable.” Ms. McClure’s lawyer, James Gerrow, told reporters on Wednesday that her intentions were genuine. “In my view, this was benign as she just wanted to help get him off the streets,” the lawyer said, according to The Philadelphia Inquirer. Mark Davis, Mr. D’Amico’s lawyer, told The Associated Press that Mr. D’Amico had not been charged by the federal authorities and denied any wrongdoing.",The New York Times
2019,R. Kelly Accuser Gives Her Account Publicly for First Time,"When R. Kelly was arrested on child pornography charges in 2002, Lanita Carter, his hairdresser, was one of his staunchest defenders. She told people that he was a perfect gentleman, that they should pray for him, that he was “nothing like what they say.” Ms. Carter’s vision of Mr. Kelly was destroyed one day in February 2003, when Carter, then 24, said she was summoned to braid the singer’s hair. Once they were alone, she said, Mr. Kelly asked for a head massage. She told him she did not do massages. But then, she said, the singer pulled her head down by her braid, and demanded oral sex. She refused, and said he began masturbating and spitting on her face. She remembered vividly how much he spat. “Six times,” Ms. Carter said, during an emotional interview that aired Thursday on “CBS This Morning.” Mr. Kelly only stopped, she said, when someone knocked on the door. “Fix your face,” she said he hissed at her, twice. The interview marked the first time Ms. Carter has spoken publicly about her accusation against Mr. Kelly, who faces 10 counts of felony aggravated sexual abuse involving four women, including Ms. Carter. She said she called the police the day it happened, and that they took the Tommy Hilfiger shirt she had been wearing as evidence, because it had Mr. Kelly’s semen on it. But no charges were filed at the time, and Ms. Carter later reached two settlements with Mr. Kelly — one for $650,000, the other for $100,000 — in which the singer admitted to no wrongdoing. The second settlement was made after Mr. Kelly released a song about having sex with a woman who braided his hair. Under the settlement’s terms, he agreed to never perform it or include it on future albums. The settlements came with nondisclosure terms, but according to Jericka Duncan, the CBS reporter who interviewed her, Ms. Carter came forward after Chicago’s top prosecutor urged victims to contact her office earlier this year. Mr. Kelly, 52, whose full name is Robert Kelly, has pleaded not guilty to the charges and is free on bail. His lawyer, Steve Greenberg, said on Thursday that the police had done an extensive investigation of Ms. Carter’s complaint in 2003 and that prosecutors declined to file charges then. “I think that speaks volumes about the strength of the case,” he said. The Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office has declined to discuss that decision. Mr. Kelly was charged in February after a Lifetime documentary series, “Surviving R. Kelly,” chronicled years of allegations that Mr. Kelly had sex with underage girls, and kept women in a “sex cult” in which he controlled their every move, including when they could eat and go to the bathroom. Of the four women in Mr. Kelly’s criminal case, Ms. Carter, who is identified as L.C. in court documents, was the only one who was an adult at the times he is accused of abusing them. Two were 16, under the age of consent in Illinois. One of them, Jerhonda Pace, was one of the first women to go public with her accusations. The other has not been publicly identified. Prosecutors said the fourth woman was just 14 at the time and that they have a videotape showing Mr. Kelly having sex with her. They said she is the same girl he was accused of having sex with in a different videotape, which led to his child pornography trial. The girl refused to testify then, and he was acquitted; there is no indication that she will testify if the current case goes to trial. Earlier this month, Mr. Kelly sat down for an interview with Gayle King of “CBS This Morning,” professing his innocence and at one point growing so emotional that he jumped out of his seat, cried out that he was “fighting for his life,” and had to be calmed. “I didn’t do this stuff!” he said. “This is not me!” Ms. Carter said that Mr. Kelly’s interview had emboldened her to speak publicly about what he had done to her. Right after it happened, she said, she rushed to the bathroom. She remembered steadying herself against the wall for support, reaching for a rose-colored towel, and staring at herself in the mirror in disbelief. “I didn’t perceive myself to be nothing more than just his hair braider,” she said. “I was thinking to myself, ‘Why did this happen to me?’”",The New York Times

2019,Women Becoming Marines: ‘I’ Will No Longer Be in Your Vocabulary,"Women make up 8 percent of U.S. Marines. The military base at Parris Island, S.C., is where these women train. CreditCreditLynsey Addario for The New York Times They descended from unmarked white school buses, many of them disoriented from hourslong journeys across the country, into a barrage of screams. “Pick your heads up!” yelled a drill instructor. “Scream, ‘Aye, Ma’am!’ No! Scream louder than that!” The women had come from places like Louisville, Ky., and Columbus, Ohio, in street clothes and sneakers, which they would soon shed for military fatigues. For the next 11 weeks, they would speak only in the third person, calling themselves “this recruit” instead of “I” to absolve all individuality. They are recruits to Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island, S.C. — the only place in the country where women become enlisted Marines. [Read more: Separate is not equal in the Marine Corps] Women have been training to become Marines for decades, but only since 2016 have they been able to serve in combat roles alongside men — a requirement, when it was announced by the Department of Defense, that the Marine Corps petitioned. (They cited a 2015 study they had conducted, in which they determined that female Marines could not perform physically demanding tasks at the same level as their male counterparts; the Pentagon rejected that request.) Today, women make up 8 percent of the United States Marine force, the lowest percentage of any military branch. Their challenges have been well-documented. [Read more: 40 Stories from Women About Life in the Military] I followed a handful of these women as they went through basic training — rappelling from a tower, learning rope climbing, martial arts, and completing courses in military history and Marine Corps values (honor, courage, and commitment). The following are snapshots from their journey. Their stay began with a phone call home — in which the women were ordered to yell the following script into the phone to their family or next of kin: 1. This is recruit (Last name) 2. I have arrived safely at Parris Island 3. Please do not send any food or bulky items to me in the mail 4. I will contact you in seven to nine days by letter with my new address 5. Thank you for your support, goodbye for now The women would not speak to their families again until the day before graduation. During their time on Parris Island, recruits are permitted one phone call in case of an emergency or an exceptional circumstance. They have no email access. In 2018, the United States Marine Corps celebrated its centennial of women being able to serve. But it wasn’t until 1949 that the Marines set up a battalion specifically tasked with training women, according to Lt. Col. Misty J. Posey, who commands the female recruits at Parris Island. Today, platoons at Parris Island remain segregated by gender, though men and women partake in some activities together, such as classroom courses. The exception to this rule is the India Company, a recently integrated battalion. The Marine Corps has said the integration was for the purpose of “training efficiency” during a class cycle with fewer female recruits. All recruits at Parris Island are required to take an initial physical fitness test — and those who don’t meet the requirements are placed into a special training program. The requirements are: Men: 34 push-ups or 3 pull-ups 44 crunches 1.5-Mile Run in 13:30 or under Women: 15 push-ups or 1 pull-up 44 crunches 1.5-Mile Run in 15:00 or under At any given time on Parris Island there are approximately 750 to 1,000 women in various stages of recruit training, compared to roughly 2,850 men, according to the Marine Corps. “We made a conscious decision to try and increase that number of young women, because in many instances it’s not what they’d naturally think about doing,” said Brig. Gen. James F. Glynn. The Marine Corps remains the only military service that still separates men and women during basic training. Most of the women at Parris Island have women as their drill instructors. They live on a female floor in the barracks. Their training, said Colonel Posey, is identical to the men’s — though they are graded differently on the physical fitness test. “When I say identical, males get haircuts that we don’t get … Females get a pregnancy test when they get here. That’s it,” Colonel Posey said. “ … We hike the same miles with the same weight in our pack, we have one physical training playbook, our chow halls serve the same food.” A typical day at Parris Island consists of a 4 a.m. wake-up, physical fitness, academic classes and group meals. Teamwork is central to everything the recruits do. All of this is in preparation for “the Crucible” — a 54-hour marathon of physical and emotional endurance that will test what they have learned. “The Crucible is actually seeing everything that has been taught to them come to life,” said Staff Sgt. Jasmine Rodgers, a 26-year-old drill instructor from Philadelphia. “It shows the best and the worst from them, and by the end of it, they are better for it.” Their challenges during the Crucible include long hikes during the day and night, climbing ropes, deciphering how to get the very last person of a group over a plywood wall, and crawling through thick mud while pushing heavy boxes of ammunition under barbed wire as battle soundtracks are blasted into the course to simulate moving while under fire. One of the most grueling exercises is called “Noonan’s evacuation,” a mock casualty rescue based on a real battle and evacuation that took place in Vietnam. During that exercise, the recruits had to tend to and evacuate their wounded and dead while receiving simulated rounds and sniper fire. The recruits average four hours of sleep per night during the Crucible. They sleep in wooden huts. “It’s a lot of teamwork, especially working with so many other females,” said Jasmine Dickson, 26, a recruit from Atlanta, who has a bachelor’s degree in opera music and also sings R&B. “Everybody has different personalities coming from different places, and working together.” Eventually, on almost no sleep and with hungry stomachs, sore and exhausted limbs and blistered feet, the women receive their Eagle, Globe and Anchor insignia. They are told they can begin using the word “I” again, as they are no longer recruits: They have officially become Marines. Lynsey Addario is an award-winning photographer who has documented conflicts in Afghanistan, Iraq, Darfur, South Sudan, Libya, Syria, Lebanon, Yemen and the Democratic Republic of Congo. She is the author of The New York Times best-seller “It’s What I Do” and recently published her first book of photography, “Of Love and War.” An earlier version of the article referred incorrectly to the Parris Island recruit training facility. While it is the only site where women can become enlisted Marines, there are other training sites that offer paths for women to become officers in the Marine Corps.",The New York Times
2019,Women Finally Get Their Own World Cup Soccer Style,"For decades, women’s uniforms were just derivations of men’s. Now, taking specific design cues, like ponytail-friendly necklines, comes the good stuff. The United States women’s soccer team has been fighting for gender parity not just in the courts — suing the United States Soccer Federation last week for discrimination — but also in their uniforms, known as kits. And at least when it comes to the clothes and the Women’s World Cup, they have won. On Monday, at a global event in Paris, Nike revealed the new home and away uniforms for 14 out of 24 competing teams, and for the first time since the brand began working with the WWC tournament in 1995, each one of them was made specifically for the women’s teams, not as derivations or extensions of kits made for men. Three days before, to coincide with International Women’s Day, Adidas released its new designs for four WWC teams. In the larger picture of gender issues and sports, this may not seem like a big deal. But the clothes athletes wear speak loudly about identity and allegiance, and have the power to help instill confidence. Clothes are also the easiest way for fans to assert their own allegiance, aspiration and personal connection. They are, above all, symbols. And now they are finally symbols of parity. “We are shifting more resources to women,” said Amy Montagne, the vice president for global categories at Nike — and not just because this is the largest number of teams the company has worked with. (It outfitted 11 clubs for the 2015 Women’s World Cup.) But because, Mark Parker, the chief executive, said, “We believe this summer can be another turning point for the growth of women’s football.” Certainly, given Nike’s current emphasis on women’s sports — the Dream Crazier campaign, a series of new initiatives designed to support women’s coaching and engage more girls — as well as its own experience with Serena Williams and the current focus on female dress in the competitive arena, it would have been fairly hypocritical for the company to treat its women’s soccer kit as in any way secondary to men’s. (Especially given Nike’s own somewhat uncomfortable internal history with gender issues.) Yet it wasn’t until 2015 that Nike began making women’s soccer jerseys in men’s sizes so that more male fans could buy them. And it wasn’t until the players really spoke up that things began to change. “Three years ago they said, ‘We want our own thing,’” Cassie Looker, the senior apparel product manager for global football, said in a call from France. “Their own thing” refers to both fit and to the design of the uniforms, which Nike refers to as the “storytelling.” According to Ms. Looker, the fit took three years and multiple four-dimensional body mapping sessions of professional athletes to adjust. “They are shaped differently than the standard body type,” she said. “They generate most of their power from their lower body.” While male soccer players like a slimmer fit — “It makes them feel more powerful, like superheroes,” Ms. Looker said — women are more interested in comfort and “looking professional.” This meant a lot of focus on the length of the sleeve (the athletes did not want to expose too much of their upper arms) and the neckline, which ended up halfway between a V-neck and a crew neck, with enough give to be easily pulled over a ponytail. “They want zero distractions,” she said. Most of this may be lost on the armchair soccer fan, though the storytelling implicit in the design will not. (In any case, the kits are available in two fits: athlete and “stadium,” or looser, for the weekend fan.) Though the kits rely on the color palettes of national flags, the difference is often in the pixelated details. “Chile, France, U.S.A. — they are all red, white and blue,” Ms. Looker said, which can make them hard to distinguish. “We bring it up all the time internally.” What to expect? The United States jerseys have a throwback patriotism with (in the home kit) direct references to the jerseys worn by the 1999 team that transformed the profile of women’s soccer in America: white, with red and blue stripes on the sleeves. The names of the 50 states are printed in gray on the back, and three stars over the crest nod to the three championships the United States has won. The away kit has tonal abstractions of stars and stripes on red (though they read a little blotchy from afar). Also tonal are the roses and assorted other florals on the four burgundy-red quadrants of the England jerseys, which is why France’s hexagonal blue polka dots on white stand out, as does the Norwegian snowflake pattern that fades from red to blue, giving their home jersey an Empire-waist effect and uniting the shorts and top. By athlete request Chile, Nigeria, South Africa and Korea have the same pattern that the men’s teams wore in the 2018 World Cup, though the fit has been customized for the women. (At least in Nigeria’s case, the look was so successful that you can kind of understand why they didn’t want to mess with a good thing.) And then there’s Australia. Of all 14 Nike team looks, this will likely be the most controversial; a canvas of forest green, mustardy gold and white slashes and splotches that looks sort of like animal print meets modern art landscape painting. Together with the Sweden kit, by Adidas, which features the faces of female role models chosen by the players embedded in the numbers on the back of each jersey, it makes a statement that, on the pitch or the street, will be impossible to miss.",The New York Times
2019,Women With Axes: Looking Back at World War II ‘Lumberjills’,"Past Tense Meet Rosie the Riveter’s British cousins. A unit of lumberjills starting off for a day’s work in the woods. Circa 1942.CreditCreditThe New York Times At 7 a.m. on any given day in 1942, as R.A.F. pilots sped back from skirmishes over the English Channel and shopkeepers doubling as Home Guard militia were hanging their tin hats up after the night’s watch, a truck would swing down a British country lane to pick up a crew of women and ferry them deep into the forest. The women piling into the truck sported berets, bright green sweaters, belted corduroy breeches and coveted badges emblazoned with a fir tree or two crossed axes to indicate they were an elite part of England’s civilian defense efforts: the Women’s Timber Corps, playfully called “lumberjills.” Coordinated by the Home Grown Timber Production Department, lumberjills were Rosie the Riveter’s counterparts across the Atlantic. Seen here in photographs from The New York Times archives, they harvested timber for telegraph poles, rails for D-Day splashdowns and the pit props that bulwarked vital British coal mines. While it was the first time that many of the women had hauled logs or stripped branches, it was often not the first time that they had held jobs. Of the 6,000 workers who toiled in the lumber fields at the peak of the corps’ staffing, a good number were “city bred” — former shop assistants, dressmakers and factory workers. The New York Times assured readers, “It has been found more often than not that the girl whose previous knowledge of tree life was often limited to the telegraph post can swing an axe just as efficiently as a farmer’s daughter.” In fact, in her thorough account of the Women’s Timber Corps, “The Forgotten Army of the Woods,” the historian Emma Vickers noted: “In terms of physicality, there is little evidence to suggest that women were recruited on the basis of their stature or physical strength. Enthusiasm, resilience and good humour were deemed to be more important.” The lumberjills were part of the Women’s Land Army, which numbered some 80,000 at the height of World War II. As early as the First World War, the W.L.A. had fanned out across the island to decrease its dependency on imports, lending a hand at dairy farms, shearing sheep, and plowing fields to open new land for farming. The organization was called back into action in the summer of 1939, roughly three months before Britain declared war against Germany. Though, as Lady Gertrude Denman, the honorary director of the W.L.A., told recruits, “The Land Army has had to encounter much prejudice against the employment of women’s labour.” The first members of the Women’s Land Army were volunteers; it wasn’t until the last male farmers were called to the front that conscription began, in 1941. Because the male sawyers and fellers who had been reserved to maintain the valuable timber industry were some of the last to be drafted, the lumberjills were not formed until 1942. Touting the idea that joining the corps was a chance to take a country vacation, the press cheered the image of the bare-armed and betrousered woodswoman, flourishing in the sunshine. “Perhaps the happy communal life in some of Britain’s loveliest forests adds glamour to the work, or maybe their invariable improvement in health and good looks makes them appreciate woodcraft and fresh air,” mused The Times reporter Muriel Laurence. This idyllic description, however, overlooked the discomforts of working outdoors during dark winters, fingers lost to squealing circular saws, bronchitis caused by sawdust inhalation, and the women who were killed when a rogue tree fell in the wrong direction. Lumberjills earned, on average, significantly more than a typical Land Girl. And once they joined the corps, they were prohibited from withdrawing from the vital timber industry. They were not the only workers who couldn’t leave. In addition to the 6,000 lumberjills, the British had thousands of prisoners of war working in timber. At one point, the P.O.W.s received a new order of Wellington boots before the female workers were outfitted. By 1942, the Land Army’s potato crops reportedly spread to cover 70 percent more land than they had in 1939, and England went from importing two-thirds of its food supply to less than half. But the Land Girls did not rest on their legumes. Even after the war, the organization continued to tackle food shortages, until 1950. The lumberjills, however, were disbanded in 1946. The Land Girls as a whole were not recognized as an equal branch of civilian service so, unlike other branches, they did not get postwar placement support or payouts to smooth the transition back to civilian life. When even the women’s request to keep their uniforms as the only mementos of their services was denied — among other indignities — Lady Gertrude Denman, who had led the Women’s Land Army through two world wars, resigned in disgust. “Blow, blow, thou winter wind,” wrote contributors to Land Girl Magazine, “thou art not so unkind as man’s ingratitude.” Over the course of the war, the number of women working in British industry shot up by roughly a third, from 5.5 million to 7.35 million. By 1951, the numbers had nearly returned to their prewar level.",The New York Times
2019,Women With a Twin Brother Are More Likely to Face Penalties at School and Work,"Research shows they might act more like boys when they’re young, struggling in school, but then face sexism when they’re grown. Women with a twin brother do worse in school and make less money than those with a twin sister, a large new study has found. In their 30s, the women wound up earning 9 percent less. They were also less likely to graduate from school, marry and have children. The researchers said the effects were because the women were naturally exposed to their brothers’ testosterone in the womb. The study, which was published Monday, included all births in Norway for 11 years. The findings might also help explain a paradox — over all, girls are doing better than boys in school, but men are doing better than women in the work force. There are other potential explanations involving cultural expectations. Girls seem to be encouraged to be competent, while boys are encouraged to be confident, research shows, and school today requires a lot of self-control, which most boys develop later. Once people start working, women face sexism and a host of other inequalities (many related to motherhood). Testosterone, which all females are exposed to in utero, might be another contributor. The hormone is associated with certain behaviors — including aggression, competition and risk taking — that might contribute to boys’ underperformance in school, but that are often rewarded in the workplace. Females exposed to an elevated level of testosterone might act more like boys when they’re young, but then face sexism at work when they’re older. Women are penalized, research shows, when they show many of the same behaviors that benefit men in the workplace. The new study was focused on studying twins and did not analyze these other issues. Also, the findings are specific to people born in Norway several decades ago. But it suggests broader effects, said David Figlio, an economist and dean of the School of Education and Social Policy at Northwestern, who wrote the paper with colleagues at Northwestern and the Norwegian School of Economics. “Women exposed to testosterone have some of the educational challenges more frequently associated with men,” Mr. Figlio said. “However, to the extent to which labor market discrimination exists in society, they don’t have the discriminatory benefits that men enjoy.” The study, published in PNAS, was of 728,842 people, including 13,800 twins — everyone born in Norway from 1967 to 1978 — in addition to records about their family, education and work. Women with a male twin were 15 percent less likely to graduate from high school than women with a female twin, and those who went to college were 4 percent less likely to finish it. They had a 12 percent lower probability of being married, and a 6 percent lower probability of having children. Notably, the research did not show an effect on the careers people pursued. Among those who graduated from college, women with a male twin were no more likely to pursue degrees in traditionally male-dominated fields like science, engineering, math and economics. The study did not find that men had long-term effects from having a female twin. Pranjal Mehta, an experimental psychologist at University College London who studies the effects of hormones on behavior, cautioned against drawing simplistic conclusions from the results. “Testosterone might not have direct effects on behaviors,” he said. “It depends on context, but it also depends on other characteristics of the person.” Men and women have varying levels of testosterone, and it affects people in different ways; everyone sits somewhere along a spectrum, scientists say. Much depends on culture and environment, and on individual factors like stress levels and self-perception. Also, it’s a responsive hormone, meaning its levels change based on what happens to a person. Testosterone levels rise when men watch their sports team win, for instance, and decrease when they become fathers. But the new study suggests that, on average, there are consequences when females are exposed before birth to higher-than-usual levels of testosterone. “The evidence here is there likely are biological effects of prenatal testosterone, but how they actually manifest is a product of a particular society,” said Chris Kuzawa, a co-author of the paper and a professor of anthropology at Northwestern. “What behaviors are considered problematic or encouraged is a cultural phenomenon.” Scientists do not measure prenatal levels of testosterone or manipulate the levels for the purpose of an experiment, so they cannot prove direct effects. But other research has suggested similar effects when females are exposed to male sex hormones in utero. Studies have found that the girls behaved more like typical boys. This has also been observed in mice and other animals born in litters that are predominantly male. Other studies of opposite-sex twins have also found effects of testosterone on females, in behaviors like aggression and rule breaking. But it had been impossible to show that they were for biological reasons, as opposed to a result of being raised with a brother. By also studying females whose male twins died early in life, the Norway research was able to show that the differences were mainly because of testosterone exposure. Socialization also plays a role. A new study published this month shows that in the United States, women with a younger brother earned around 7 percent less in adulthood, in part because their parents had lower academic expectations for them and they took on more traditional gender roles. In the Norway study, the effects on girls’ educational achievement — perhaps because of more disruptive behavior and less focus in the classroom — probably drove the long-term economic effects, the researchers said. Roughly half of their decreased earnings could be explained by their lower rates of graduation from high school and college. One potential explanation for the women’s lower rates of marriage is that testosterone could indirectly influence their behavior in relationships. Their decreased fertility was not because of marrying less often — it was true among women who married and those who didn’t. Exposure to excess testosterone in utero has been found to decrease fertility in the females of multiple species, including sheep and mice. In the last four decades, the rate of twins has nearly doubled in many countries, largely because women are having babies later and using in vitro fertilization more often, both of which increase the chance of twins. In the United States, 1.1 percent of newborn girls have male twins, up from 0.6 percent in 1971, the researchers estimated. The findings could inform parents, doctors and teachers about ways to support these children, the scientists said. They also noted that the findings were based on national averages, and do not predict the result of any individual fertility decision. Not all girls with twin brothers are affected, or affected in the same way, and the researchers did not study other parts of life in which females with male twins might excel. Also, a person’s biology alone does not determine a life course. Family, environment and personality shape it, too. “There are always interactions between biology and culture and the environment,” said Bernard Crespi, an evolutionary biologist at Simon Fraser University in Canada who peer-reviewed the paper. “You can always change the cultural and social environment. Humans are plastic.”",The New York Times
2019,Women at Breast Implant Hearing Call for Disclosure of Safety Risks,"SILVER SPRING, Md. — Women with illnesses linked to breast implants challenged plastic surgeons, regulators and implant makers at an emotionally charged meeting on Monday at the Food and Drug Administration, demanding more information about the risks of the implants and calling for a ban on one that is associated with an unusual type of cancer. They asked implant makers to disclose the materials used in the devices and also called for a “black box” warning — a label that the F.D.A. can require, noting heightened problems with a drug or device. The implants that some patients and advocates want removed from the market have a textured or slightly roughened surface and have been associated with anaplastic large cell lymphoma, a cancer of the immune system. Dozens of other countries have already banned one type of textured implants, made by Allergan. Industry representatives defended implants, as did plastic surgeons, including several female surgeons who said they had implants themselves and had many patients who were pleased with implants and had no health problems. The F.D.A.’s general and plastic surgery devices panel is holding the two-day public forum to hear from researchers, advocates, patients and the industry about the implants, which have been available for decades. While the panel took no formal votes, its members were to consider further steps for the agency to take in exploring the growing scientific evidence about both breast implant-associated lymphoma and a constellation of debilitating symptoms generally referred to as breast implant illness. The panel’s experts repeatedly expressed frustration and astonishment at the dearth of good data on implants and the failure of breast implant makers to complete promised studies or follow patients for long enough to collect meaningful data. “We have a surprisingly limited amount of clear and consistent data given the number of years and the number of women involved,” said Natalie Compagni Portis, a patient representative on the panel. “I feel like we failed women with regard to implants,” Ms. Portis said. “We failed to inform, we failed to follow and we failed to listen.” At the meeting, one woman after another who said she became ill from the implants testified that plastic surgeons had reassured the women the implants were safe, and had described only the routine risks associated with any surgery. Some said they did not receive informational pamphlets from manufacturers that gave a more detailed accounting of the risks. “We do not feel we have been effectively and appropriately informed,” said Holly Davis, of Charleston, S.C., who got implants after a mastectomy. She said she developed memory problems and asked to be tested for Alzheimer’s disease. Now that the implants have been removed, her memory is coming back. “The pamphlets manufacturers are giving to plastic surgeons are not making it to us,” she said. “Don’t ignore us,” Ms. Davis pleaded with the panel. “We are real.” Christina Avila, of San Jose, Calif., got implants for reconstruction after a mastectomy six years ago when she was 38. She said she felt pushed into doing so during “a time of intense shock and vulnerability,” and did not realize that complications from the surgery could require repeat operations and interfere with her cancer treatment. “Women like me who would rather be alive than have something that looks like boobs need to have this information,” she said. But another breast cancer patient, Marie Jobson, 50, of San Jose, Calif., said reconstruction was an integral part of her recovery after a double mastectomy in 2013, and she implored the committee to make sure the option of implants would be available to future patients. “This medical device has allowed me to live in the present moment, in the now, whether it’s wearing a bikini or having intimacy with my husband,” Ms. Jobson said. Though silicone has long been regarded as inert, that idea was disputed by Dr. Jan Willem Cohen Tervaert, from the University of Alberta. He said silicone affects the immune system, and can set off a series of reactions that can lead to the pain and fatigue that many women have reported. Silicone can leak out of implants, even ones that have not ruptured, and he described two patients in whom silicone had been found in other parts of the body, including the brain. He said women with allergies or a personal or family history of autoimmune diseases seemed to have an increased risk of becoming ill from breast implants, and should be warned about it if they were considering the surgery. Other speakers suggested that lymphoma, and possibly other problems associated with implants, might occur in some patients as a result of a chronic infection caused by bacterial contamination of the implant at the time of surgery. Some researchers suspect textured implants, with more crevices and surface area, can foster the growth of bacteria. The expert panelists debated whether to restrict the use of textured implants, which have been more closely linked to the risk of lymphoma than smooth implants, but which also offer certain surgical advantages. But only a minority of the panelists seemed to favor banning them. The panel expressed interest in identifying what specific personal and family medical histories may make women more vulnerable to becoming ill after receiving implants. Many of the patients at the meeting wore two ribbons pinned to their lapels, one with pink and green stripes to express solidarity with those who have implant-associated lymphoma, and a second black-and-white ribbon for those suffering from less clearly defined implant illnesses. Last week, the F.D.A. issued warnings to two manufacturers in the United States, criticizing them for not conducting adequate follow-up studies of women who had undergone surgery to have breast implants. Two national registries, recently created, may fill in some of the gaps. One will follow patients with implant-related lymphoma, and the other will capture as much information as possible about all patients receiving breast implants. Panel members discussed what data the comprehensive registry needed, and settled on details about the patients’ health and risk factors before receiving implants, how they fared later and what type of implants they received. About 400,000 women in the United States get breast implants every year, including 300,000 for cosmetic reasons and 100,000 for reconstruction after mastectomies performed to treat or prevent breast cancer. Worldwide, about 10 million women have breast implants. An earlier version of this article misspelled the name of a woman who testified at the hearing on breast implants.

2019,Women in Economics Report Rampant Sexual Assault and Bias,"Nearly 100 female economists say a peer or a colleague has sexually assaulted them. Nearly 200 say they were the victim of an attempted assault. And hundreds say they were stalked or touched inappropriately, according to a far-reaching survey of the field. The results, compiled by the American Economic Association, also reveal deep evidence of gender and racial discrimination within the field. Half of the women who responded to the survey said they had been treated unfairly because of their sex, compared with 3 percent of men. Nearly half of women said they had avoided speaking at a conference or a seminar to guard against possible harassment or “disrespectful treatment.” Seven in 10 women said they felt their colleagues’ work was taken more seriously than their own. More than 9,000 current and past members of the association, both men and women, took part in the survey. And the results have jolted the group’s leaders, who announced several measures on Monday to combat harassment and discrimination. The moves include the appointment of an ombudsman empowered to investigate complaints of misbehavior by economists, and the threat of professional sanction — including the potential loss of prestigious awards — for economists who are found to violate a new anti-harassment code. Ben S. Bernanke, the former Federal Reserve chairman who now heads the economic association, said he was “concerned and disturbed” over what the survey revealed. “It’s bad for economics,” Mr. Bernanke said. “It’s very unfair to those who are suffering that discrimination, because economics is a fascinating and interesting and lucrative field, and we don’t want to be excluding people for no good reason. We appear to be dissuading talented people from entering the field.” The alienation is not limited to women. Among black economists surveyed, only 14 percent agreed with the statement that “people of my race/ethnicity are respected within the field.” Gay and lesbian economists — and others who do not identify as heterosexual — were far more likely to report discrimination and disrespect in the field than heterosexual economists. Only 25 percent agreed that “people of my sexual orientation are respected within the field.” Twenty percent said they had been discriminated against on the basis of sexual orientation. Janet L. Yellen, the former Federal Reserve chief who will take over as president of the association next year, said the raw numbers made the extent of the profession’s problems clear. Some 85 women reported having been physically assaulted by another economist, in many cases by a direct supervisor. More than one in five women said they had been subjected to an unwanted sexual advance. “The numbers are very troubling,” Ms. Yellen said. “What you see in this survey is just an unacceptable culture.” The profession is grappling with mounting evidence of its problems with issues of race and gender. Economics remains dominated by white men, even as women have made substantial gains in other science and engineering fields. And a growing body of research finds that women in economics face discrimination when it comes to hiring, publication and promotion. Those complaints grew louder late last year after revelations that a Harvard University investigation had found that Roland G. Fryer Jr., one of the field’s brightest young stars, had sexually harassed employees and created a hostile work environment. Shortly after accusations against Mr. Fryer became public, he was elected to the A.E.A.’s executive committee; he later resigned, but the association faced criticism for not acting earlier or more aggressively. Harvard administrators are reviewing the investigation’s findings, and Mr. Fryer has denied the accusations. The association’s actions on Monday are in part a response to the Fryer case, Mr. Bernanke said. The executive committee is proposing to allow it to remove officers or even expel members for violations of its code of conduct. That provision will require a vote of the membership. Other changes will take effect immediately. The committee adopted a new policy on harassment and discrimination to supplement a code of conduct adopted last year. Members will have to certify compliance to be considered for leadership positions or awards. The newly created ombudsman position is an attempt to address a structural challenge: Instances of harassment and abuse often cross institutional lines. In an open letter to the economic association’s leaders last year, a group of graduate students and research assistants called for a “discipline-wide reporting system” to document abuse. Jennifer Doleac, a Texas A&M economist, said students and other young economists deserved credit for pushing for change. Alice Wu, an undergraduate at the University of California, Berkeley, helped bring attention to the profession’s toxic culture in 2017 with a thesis that documented misogynistic comments on an online message board. Heather Sarsons, then a Harvard graduate student, later that year published a paper showing that women get less credit for work they do with male co-authors. “There’s tremendous talent there that we still have a chance to keep in the profession,” Ms. Doleac said. “I’m glad that they’re speaking up and giving us a chance to do something.” The 47-question survey was sent late last year to more than 45,000 current and former members of the association. The 9,000 who completed it, including more than a quarter of current members, represented a high rate for a voluntary survey. About a third of the respondents were women, about a fifth were nonwhite, and about 4 percent identified themselves as gay or lesbian. Economists cautioned that people could have been more likely to respond if they felt they had faced discrimination or harassment, and that as a result the survey might not be representative of the profession as a whole. But Marianne Bertrand, a University of Chicago economist who oversaw the survey as the head of a special committee on the professional climate in economics, called the results distressing. “The responses are sort of a mandate” for the association and economics departments to act, she said. If anything, the survey probably understates the problems. Despite efforts to reach former members, it left out many people who left the profession after facing discrimination or harassment, or who decided against becoming economists at all. “We’re certainly surveying the winners,” said Lisa D. Cook, a Michigan State University economist who is one of the field’s most prominent black women. Ms. Cook said women, and particularly black women, had long felt that their ideas were being dismissed or that they were not being given the same opportunities as their white male colleagues. But she said she and her peers often pushed those suspicions to the side. “I’m just going to keep being nice and one day people will believe me,” she said she remembered thinking earlier in her career. “I’m going to keep being smart, and one day people will believe me. I’m going to keep sending out these papers, and one day people will believe me.” Indeed, the survey results also showed how harassment and discrimination ripple through the profession. A third of black economists said they had “not applied for or taken a particular employment position” to avoid harassment or discrimination. Nearly half of women said they had not presented an idea or asked a question at a conference or at their school for the same reason. Martha Bailey, a University of Michigan economist and a member of the A.E.A.’s executive committee, said she was one of them. She said the survey — and a broader reckoning within economics in recent years — had forced many women to confront the possible impact that sexism had had on them and their careers. “There’s this part of me that regrets those decisions, and there was a sadness when I took the survey,” Ms. Bailey said. Women said the results were not, on one level, a surprise, confirming what many have experienced. But they said there was value in having numbers that show how widespread the problems are. “We’re economists,” Ms. Bailey said. “Numbers are important.”",The New York Times

2019,"Women’s History Myths, Debunked","in her words Almost everything we know about women’s history is wrong. This week, a few of the biggest myths get busted. It’s Women’s History Month! You’re reading In Her Words, where women rule the headlines. Sign up here to get it delivered to your inbox. Let me know what you think at dearmaya@nytimes.com. “History isn’t what happened. It’s who tells the story.” — Sally Roesch Wagner, a women's studies scholar and author In her new book, “The Women’s Suffrage Movement,” the historian Sally Roesch Wagner aims to finally give a voice to the women history forgot. “History isn’t what happened,” she told me this week. “It’s who tells the story.” Dr. Wagner, one of the first Americans to receive a doctorate in women’s studies, has spent decades studying these untold stories across cultures. On the first day of Women’s History Month, I asked her to help me debunk some of the persistent myths. Here’s what I learned. ______ MYTH: American women’s rights began with the right to vote, granted in 1920. REALITY: Native American women have had political power for 1,000 years. It’s easy to view American women’s history through the lens of the suffragists, who fought for the right to vote. But the truth is, Native American women had their own political systems long before — systems that still exist. “The idea that we’re so progressive because we got the vote 100 years ago — Native women look at that like, ‘Hm, well,’” said Wagner, who wrote the book “Sisters in Spirit,” about Iroquois women’s influence on early American feminists. In fact, in some Native American nations, like the six Iroquois, the elder matriarch is responsible for appointing the chief, holding him to certain standards and removing him if he fails to measure up, Wagner said. ______ MYTH: Contraception is a modern convention. REALITY: Condoms, diaphragms and the sponge have been around since the 1800s. The birth control pill may have not come on the market until 1960, but a variety of effective contraception methods were available to both women and men in the United States well before 1850, Wagner said. It was the Comstock Act, passed in 1873, that changed everything — allowing Anthony Comstock, a conservative Christian who proposed the legislation, to determine what was considered “obscene” in the country. “He decided that anything to do with sex or reproduction was obscene,” Wagner said. As a result, hundreds of people were arrested and imprisoned under the Comstock Act for distributing or possessing contraception, or publishing information about it. The activist Ida Craddock was among them, arrested for distributing such information. She took her own life shortly before her sentencing, which she believed would be life imprisonment. In her suicide note, she wrote: “I earnestly hope that the American public will awaken to a sense of the danger which threatens it from Comstockism.” ______ MYTH: Feminists burned bras. REALITY: No bras were burned! Seriously. The myth emerged on a hot summer day in 1969, when feminists gathered on the boardwalk of the Miss America Pageant in Atlantic City, N.J., to protest the competition. They had planned to burn their bras, but they couldn’t get the permits — so instead they threw their bras, girdles, curling irons and other “instruments of female torture,” into a giant trash can labeled “freedom.” Ahead of the protest, The New York Post reported that bras were to be burned. (Read more about that protest here.) Ultimately, the myth has been used to vilify and pigeonhole feminists ever since, Wagner said. Want to hear more from Dr. Wagner? She’ll be in conversation with Gloria Steinem, the Mohawk Bear clan mother Louise Herne and the New York Times gender editor Jessica Bennett in New York on International Women’s Day, March 8. Tickets are still available. ______ 0.5 percent That’s how much of 3,500 years of recorded history is devoted to women, according to the historian and author Bettany Hughes. “There are so many women that should be household names but just aren’t,” she has said.

Known by some newspapers as “America’s most celebrated pedestrian,” Emma Gatewood was the first woman to hike the Appalachian Trail by herself in one season — as a great-grandmother, at the age of 67. By the time Gatewood died at the age of 85, in 1973, she had hiked the length of the trail three times — the third time in sections — and was the first person, man or woman, to conquer it more than once. What the public did not know was equally remarkable. Grandma Gatewood, as she was called, had survived 30 years of severe beatings and sexual abuse by her husband. She often escaped from him by running into the woods, and she came to view the wilderness as protective and restorative. Read more about her here.

2019,Opinion | Woodrow Wilson and ‘the Ugliest of Treacheries’,"After World War I, America was supposed to lead the fight against colonialism. What happened? Mr. Manela is a professor of history at Harvard. In November 1918, when news of the armistice in Europe arrived in Cairo, Muhammad Husayn Haykal, a prominent Egyptian intellectual, was approached by a friend. “This is it!” Haykal’s friend exclaimed. “We have the right to self-determination, and therefore the English will leave Egypt.” The United States, the friend explained when asked about this outburst, “is the one who won the war. She is not an imperialist country.” Therefore,” he reasoned, “she will enforce the right to self-determination and enforce the withdrawal.” The end of the First World War was a time of great expectations, and the American president, Woodrow Wilson, stood at its center. For a brief span of time, Wilson appeared to millions worldwide as the herald of an emerging world in which all peoples would be granted the right to determine their own future. I have called this period, stretching roughly from Wilson’s Fourteen Points Address in January 1918 to the conclusion of the Versailles Peace Treaty in June 1919, the “Wilsonian Moment” — because he, more than anyone, came to symbolize its promise. In Egypt, the Wilsonian moment was especially poignant. When World War I began in 1914, Britain declared that Egypt, hitherto an Ottoman possession, was now a protectorate of the British Empire. This formalized British de facto dominance in Egypt, in place since the early 1880s, but it was presented as a temporary wartime measure, a fact that Egyptian nationalists would later emphasize. But the protectorate did nothing to protect Egyptians from the hardships of war; Egypt became an enormous military base and thousands of Allied troops congregated on its soil. Wartime inflation, requisitions and conscription made life hard. At the same time, the United States and its president emerged as a champion of new ideas about the sort of international order that might follow an Allied victory. Wilson’s wartime rhetoric, and especially his increasingly strong promotion of the principle of “self-determination,” convinced many in Egypt and elsewhere that the rules of the game were about to change. Even before the United States joined the war in April 1917, Wilson declared that the peace must “accept the principle that governments derive all their just powers from the consent of the governed.” After the American entry, Wilson was even more emphatic. The United States and its allies, he said in May 1917, were “fighting for the liberty, the self-government, and the undictated development of all peoples.” On Jan. 8, 1918, Wilson addressed Congress to outline America’s vision for the postwar world, a speech that quickly became known worldwide as the “Fourteen Points.” Though this speech did not explicitly include the term “self-determination,” Wilson did use that term the next month, when he called it an “imperative principle of action” and intoned that “every territorial settlement involved in this war must be made in the interest and for the benefit of the populations concerned.” [All this year, The New York Times is highlighting the tumultuous events of 1919 and how they shaped the modern era. Read more articles here.] It is no surprise, then, that when the war ended in November 1918, Egyptians expected the postwar order to reflect Wilson’s wartime rhetoric or that they moved quickly to take part in the emerging new order. On Nov. 13, only two days after the conclusion of the armistice, a group of Egyptian leaders called on the British high commissioner, Sir Reginald Wingate, to declare their desire for political independence. They also demanded permission to travel to Paris to present Egypt’s case for self-determination before the peace conference gathering there. The group that approached Wingate was led by Saad Zaghlul, who would become known in Egypt as the “Father of the Nation.” Zaghlul was a career public servant, and had served as a government minister between 1906 and 1913. A liberal, he came to resent British support for the autocratic Egyptian monarchy and resigned his cabinet post in protest. Elected to the Legislative Assembly, by 1918 he had become the leader of the opposition. Playing for time, Wingate asked his visitors to be patient, as “His Majesty’s Government” was occupied with more pressing things. The British had long considered Egypt, and particularly the Suez Canal, a strategic lifeline for their empire. Determined to retain power, the last thing they wanted was for Egyptian demands to become a negotiating point at the Versailles peace conference. So, soon after, London denied Zaghlul and his delegation permission to travel. In response, Zaghlul and his allies moved to mobilize public support, convening rallies, circulating petitions, and starting a press campaign. At the same time, they appealed to Wilson directly. In a dramatic telegram, Zaghlul assured Wilson that Egyptians “felt strongly the joyous emotion of the birth of a new era which, thanks to your virile action, is soon going to impose itself upon the universe.” This new era, he added, would “no longer be troubled by the ambitions of hypocrisy or the old-fashioned policy of hegemony and furthering selfish national interests.” Egyptians must be allowed their day in Paris. This was no more than their “natural and sacred right.” As the peace conference got underway in January 1919 and Egyptians rallied behind Zaghlul, the British authorities, increasingly anxious, decided to move against him. Under the rules of martial law, which had remained in effect since the war, Zaghlul and several of his supporters were arrested and, on March 9, 1919,sent to be interned on the Mediterranean island of Malta. According to Zaghlul’s biographer, one item found on his person when he was arrested was a newspaper clipping that listed Wilson’s fourteen points. The arrest sparked a wave of strikes and demonstrations across Egypt and launched a period of violent clashes known in Egyptian history as the “1919 Revolution.” Egyptians from all walks of life took part in the upheaval: students, workers, professionals, peasants. Leaders of the country’s Christian and Jewish communities expressed support for the movement. Women took to the streets in an unprecedented display. The British forces countered with a strict enforcement of martial law. Over the next several months, some 800 Egyptians were killed and many more wounded, along with 60 British soldiers and civilians. As the 1919 Revolution unfolded in the streets, a stream of telegrams, letters and petitions poured into the American consulate in Cairo, professing faith in President Wilson and calling on the United States to support “the cause of right and liberty” in Egypt. One message, signed “The Ladies of Egypt,” complained that the British employed “brute force even toward women.” A pamphlet, documenting British brutality, displayed photographs of Egyptian men with whip marks on their exposed torsos. The name and social standing of each man — peasant, student, religious scholar, notable — were noted below each photograph. Egyptians of all stripes, the message was, supported the uprising. The State Department, however, remained unmoved. Allen Dulles, then a young diplomat at the Division of Near Eastern Affairs and later the head of the Central Intelligence Agency, opined that the Egyptian appeals “should not even be acknowledged,” and others agreed. When the British foreign secretary, Arthur Balfour, wrote in April that “extreme nationalists” in Egypt, whom he implausibly described as “paid agents of the revolutionary party in Turkey and Bolshevists,” were using Wilson’s words to “stir up a Holy War against the Infidels,” Wilson quickly agreed to recognize British control over Egypt. The news of Wilson’s decision to recognize the protectorate broke just as Zaghlul and his delegation, having been released from Malta, were crossing the Mediterranean on their way to Paris. Learning of the decision as they docked in Marseilles, the Egyptians were shocked. Muhammad Haykal later recalled that the decision hit “like a bolt of lightning.” How could Wilson deny Egyptians their right to self-determination even before they had arrived in Paris? This was, he wrote, “the ugliest of treacheries,” “the most profound repudiation of principles.” Zaghlul remained in Paris for several months trying to make headway for his cause, sending Wilson a series of emphatic messages and requesting repeatedly an audience with the president. In reply, all he got were terse notes from Wilson’s secretary, acknowledging receipt of his messages but citing the president’s preoccupation with other matters. Still, the stream of Egyptian petitions continued for some months, many marked by a conviction that Wilson could not have willingly betrayed the Egyptian cause and must therefore have been duped by the wily British. One message, from a group of Egyptian students, sought to correct the president’s misapprehensions and assured him that the Egyptian movement was “neither religious, nor xenophobe” and “far from being Bolshevist in any sense.” By the summer of 1919 Zaghlul, unable to get a hearing with Wilson, hoped to find some support in the American Congress instead. In June, he told the Egyptian press that the Senate’s Committee on Foreign Relations had found that Egypt was neither under Turkish nor British authority, but rather was “self-governed.” This finding ignited a furor of discussion in the Egyptian news media — but nothing else. In November 1919, Zaghlul, still in Europe, sent Wilson yet another telegram imploring him to support Egyptian demands. But the same message also revealed his growing disappointment. The Egyptian people, he wrote the president, hailed him “as the Chief of a new doctrine which was to have assured peace and prosperity to the world.” Now, “for having had faith in your principles,” they were “suffering under the most barbarous treatment” at the hands of the British. Despite the failure to gain American support, by the end of the year nationalist leaders, backed by Egyptian public opinion, had become firmly committed to resisting British control. Rejecting London’s efforts to negotiate Egyptian acquiescence, Zaghlul wrote to Secretary Balfour that the new “spirit of the age” demanded that “every people shall have the right to self-determination,” revealing a conviction that, despite Wilson’s betrayal, a radical transformation had nevertheless come about in world affairs and it rendered obsolete old justifications for colonialism. The Egyptian experience in the Wilsonian moment, moreover, was not unique. As the peace conference convened, nationalist claimants from many parts of the world — Chinese and Koreans, Arabs and Jews, Armenians and Kurds, and many others — rushed, invited or otherwise, to stake their claims in the emerging world order. To these representatives of national aspirations, President Wilson often served as a symbol of the coming era of self-determination for all. They adopted his rhetoric in formulating and justifying their goals and they counted on the president’s support in attaining them. Most of these aspirations, however, were met with disappointment. As the 1919 Revolution engulfed Egypt, similar mass protest movements broke out in China, India and Korea. In Paris, Nguyen Tat Thanh, a young man from the French colonial territory of Indochina, submitted a petition demanding more freedom for his homeland. He hoped to meet with Wilson to present the petition to him, but the meeting never materialized, and the petition was roundly ignored. Soon after Nguyen, who would later adopt the nom-de-guerre Ho Chi Minh, would turn to communism as the path to liberate his people. In Egypt, the square in downtown Cairo that was at the heart of the protests in 1919 came to be known as Tahrir Square — Liberation Square, in Arabic. Nearly a century later, in 2011, Tahrir Square again became the focal point of mass protests, this time against the homegrown oppression of the regime of President Hosni Mubarak. The events of the 1919 Revolution could not but echo loudly in what quickly became known as the Egyptian Revolution of 2011. Much had changed in Egypt, and in the world, in the intervening decades. The desire for real self-determination, one that is based on the consent of the governed, remained the same.

2019,Work Songs of the Cowboy Poets,"the look Ranchers and seekers of the “mythic West” travel each year to a small Nevada city to practice a tradition born of labor and regional identity. ELKO, Nev. — It’s bright in Elko. The light is raw Nevada light. It pierces the eyes: Here, wide-brimmed hats are as much practical attire as they are fashion statements. The sun is a fact. The surrounding hills are grass beige and winter sagebrush gray-green, with pale white drifts of snow in the lee of ridges. The austere reds, pinks and grays of coyote willow line the banks of the Humboldt River. Along Idaho Street, the combination of fine Great Basin dust and winter’s road salt collects on the sidewalk. It’s a still day — the storm comes in tonight — so the dust and salt gather in pockets along the curb instead of whirling around in middle of the street. The roadside grass is tawny and damp, pocked with cottonwood leaves and little pools of snowmelt. There’s the steady rumble of truck traffic, both commercial and private. Some trucks bear the logos of Major Percussive and American Drilling Corp. It’s one of those occasional windless days in this desert city, a hub of mining and ranching (and gambling and prostitution) in northeastern Nevada. In the moments when the traffic subsides, it’s quiet, in that all-encompassing way the Great Basin is quiet. The air moves over ravens’ wings. The grackles chirp and warble in the bare trees overhead. Keep reading Sights & sounds The National Cowboy Poetry Gathering, now in its 35th year, draws thousands of ranch workers and Western enthusiasts to this small city. Their home base is the Pioneer Saloon, on the ground floor of the old Pioneer Hotel, which today stands as the Western Folklife Center. The bar is full of Wranglers, Stetsons, handlebar mustaches, wool, silver-work and leather. Some cowboys wear the weather on their faces. Everyone has silk wild rags tied around their necks. A few younger men and women wearing new boots and clean ponchos wander in with guitars and cases in hand, smiling, looking a bit tentative. Most of the people here appear to be in their 60s and 70s. Most are white. Everybody’s drinking something; a few are drinking water. The poets have come not only to practice a tradition born of work and regional identity, but to expand the idea of this ever-changing place. As the historian Richard White once wrote, “The mythic West imagined by Americans has shaped the West of history just as the West of history has helped create the West Americans have imagined.” It’s a chance to adapt an old story. At the Elko Convention Center, a painted tarp frames the stage: a cloudless blue sky and the dun prow of a mesa jutting skyward. The performers are introduced by name, hometown and occupation, the last of which often involves manual labor. Here, the ballad tradition is strong. The rhythms of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and Robert Service, plus classic cowboy poems like Buck Ramsey’s “Anthem,” thump through the performances. There are odes to tools, references to John Wayne, laments about bad weather. Dan Thurston, from Elko, in a short-sleeve plaid shirt and a bolo tie, recites a poem called “Fire.” His story of being caught in a brush fire with only a watering hose evinces a connection to landscape, community and the changing fire ecology of the Intermountain West that can be hard to see from far away, even from Reno. Many of the poets have been here before. Amy Hale Auker, who writes both poems and essays, first came to Elko in 2003, when her son was invited to perform. “The cowboy poetry and music world became my family of heart,” Ms. Auker says, “as well as a window for me into what other people living a rural life were creating.” She began performing later, around 2010. Gail Steiger, her husband and a singer-songwriter, has come to Elko since 1988, when the Western Folklife Center dedicated that year’s gathering to his grandfather, Gail I. Gardner. “I shot a video of him singing his best-known song,” Mr. Steiger says, “‘Tying Knots in the Devil’s Tail.’ We screened it during the keynote address. I’d heard him sing the song thousands of times growing up but was shocked to see many people in the audience singing along with the video. I had no idea the song had gotten around as far as it apparently had.” This makes Mr. Steiger a veteran of the weeklong event, which began, officially, in 1984, and unofficially, much earlier. There’s dispute about this in Elko. The couple are ranchers near Prescott, Ariz. Physical labor inflects and informs their written work. In the poem “Sweetly Singing,” Ms. Auker writes, “Ours is a work song— / a song of doing, with hands and hearts,” words to sing even when there’s no one around to hear them except the cows and the ravens. Ms. Auker and Mr. Steiger are in the Centre Motel, across the street from the Commercial Hotel and Casino (home of the White King — “the world’s largest dead polar bear”), preparing for the night’s performances. She lays out a new Western shirt, a gift from a friend in the cowboy poetry community. It’s pale coral pink with hand embroidered paw prints along the piping and flame-orange paintbrush flowers on the lapels. “I am fashion unconscious,” Ms. Auker says. Mr. Steiger speaks in reverential tones of the poet Mary Oliver, her awe at the natural world’s grandeur. He recites a poem written by his grandmother, Delia Gist Gardner, who homesteaded in Skull Valley, Ariz., in the early 1900s. “When she died, we found this poem in the top drawer of her desk,” Mr. Steiger says. “She left it for us.” The poem, titled “Hail and Farewell,” begins: Think not on my brittle bones mingling with dust, for These Are but a handful added To those gone before. Think, rather, that on this borrowed hill top One lived joyously, and died content. The West is changing. There’s the climate, of course, but the way that Westerners negotiate the myth of the West is in flux too. Work has shifted in the rural West, as have the people who perform it. Yet we don’t often hear from Peruvian shepherds who tend the herds of the Great Basin, or Mixtec fieldworkers who tend lettuce and pick apples. Olivia Romo, a poet and water rights activist from Santa Fe, spoke about the need to hear more of those of these rural voices. “I think the only way we can engage more writers of color who have authentic connections to the land and a rich tradition in the West is creating opportunities for them to share their work and stories. Going to them! Listen to the indigenous land-based people in the West who are resilient, reclaiming their languages and songs, but most importantly ready to share and be brought to the table.” She mentioned Geno Delafose, Henry Real Bird, Tish Hinojosa and Ofelia Zepeda as some of the poets and musicians who have been embraced in Elko. Ms. Romo first attended the gathering in 2017 to screen her poem-film about the acequias, the traditional community water resources of New Mexico, for the Moving Rural Verse Project. In one of the afternoon readings she read poems that speak to a hybrid mythology of the West. One invokes Tlaloc, the Aztec rain god; another creates a new myth in which the roadrunner is a prophet. “The drought has been my entire lifetime,” Ms. Romo says. She uses the rhythms and speech patterns of spoken word poetry in a strong mixture of Spanish and English, to speak of familial ties and heritage. “Chaquegüe,” a poem named for the blue corn mush that is central to New Mexican cuisine, makes food a metaphor for tradition, linking her father’s corn harvest with the traditions of New Mexican Chicano culture, highlighting water fights between rural communities and big western cities. These fights are everywhere and will only increase as climate change and population growth collide. After the bountiful blessing of corn he had harvested that season he cleansed and toasted it until it became el oro del barrio. Panning kernels of our history — native, sweet, and resilient! Can survive any drought climate change adapt but never assimilate! My gente are the semilla y vamos a sobrevivir pero también necesitamos a vivir en harmonia, paz, y en la tradición Speak in our language so the spirits can shh shhhh shhhh the ancestors are listening. Poems like Ms. Romo’s point to new myths, just as capacious and fragile as the actual West, despite its tortured history. After all, real cowboys are not always boys, and the resilience that Ms. Romo addresses, through the figure of corn, is something everyone in the West can acknowledge, because when you live here it’s obvious, once you notice. It’s dusk now, and Henry Real Bird, a rancher and the former poet laureate of Montana, is walking in the bare snags of coyote willow on the banks of the Humboldt River three blocks south of downtown. It’s getting cold out; Mr. Real Bird’s wool coat slides from his shoulders as he puts his hands in his pockets. How much longer do you want to be in the wind? his poem begins. A plane overhead interrupts his reading, and he stops, clearing his throat. I reached in the roar of the water for a feeling in the wind … He continues, as the air fills with the roar of an airplane. He stops. “We can do that again, as soon as he leaves …” The plane flies out of earshot. Mr. Real Bird begins again: How much longer do you want to be in the wind? The poem, “Indecision,” is a tour de force of absolute presence. As he speaks, the vowels crash together, and the words change speeds, echoing the jazz inflections of beat poetry and evoking synesthesia. “You can hear the stars in the wind,” he says. The words swoop over and under one another. “I reached in the roar of the water for a feeling in the wind.” The word “water” has been on everyone’s lips, and here it is, some of that precious desert water, heading toward the Humboldt Sink, 200 miles west of here. Mr. Real Bird ends his recitation. “That’s how that one goes,” he says, and the dusk goes pink all around. Aubrey Trinnaman is an artist living in Northern California.

2019,Workplace Kudos,"DAILY CROSSWORD COLUMN Greg Johnson brings us a crossword to finish, frame, and hang in our cubicles. SATURDAY PUZZLE — Last weekend was the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament. You all know I’m a cogitator rather than a speed solver: I’m as impressed as anyone when some of you bust out your sub-10-minute times in the comments on these weekend puzzles, but I don’t often think about my pace. It’s about as relevant to me as a 3-minute mile when I clomp around my neighborhood in jogging shoes looking for changes in the landscape. This is all to say that I took ages to solve Greg Johnson’s grid today, but encountered very little frustration (mainly regarding those little bits and bobs of romance languages that weren’t in my limited vocabulary.) There were a lot of amusing touches and interesting snippets of information, some of them quite timely, a few of them nostalgic. O.K. THEN! There were several “conversational” entries, including one of the spans, that I found manageable with a few crosses as help, and ID BET most of you had the same experience. (Yes? OH GOOD. GREAT JOB!) I did have “horse” for OTTER (after entering STEED elsewhere) and “Midas” for MICAH, which was silly — otherwise things knitted together pretty smoothly. 1A: On finishing this grid it was a little odd to see it book-ended by this term, GHOST GUNS, and a reference to deer hunting, which could have been Christmassy instead (right? TREE STANDS?). There’s a movie in my distant memory that traced one of these weapons as it was trafficked through the United States, and I learned the term at that point but I can’t remember what the film was called. 17A: Everyone loves a juicy piece of Mars news, and lots of people seemingly harbor the urge to see the red planet in person (I’m not on line yet, but I get claustrophobic on long flights). In this case it was the discovery of ORGANIC MATERIAL, which is supposed to make you think “compost?!” but really refers to any molecules with carbon and hydrogen — not necessarily indicators of life. Hey, we do anthropomorphize the heck out of those Mars rovers, if that counts. 23A: I was stumped by this clue, then got a kick out of it, but I’ve inherited the trait of catching on to things a little slowly. Wink! “Peabrain” isn’t intended as an insult in this original hint for MENDEL, the early genetic researcher who crossed those plump and wrinkly peas and mapped dominant and recessive traits. He was also clued a couple of years ago as “Pea nut,” another winner. 33A: I wish I could say that this puzzle inspired me to do things like read historical perspectives on, say, Martin Luther and HERESY, but it really got me thinking quite deeply about the joy of DOG TOYS, which by definition aren’t supposed to be eaten. I have two rescue dogs that I believe were never taught to play with toys as puppies — they frolic with each other, but squeakers are scary and rolling toys in the house mean nothing to them after ages of trying, and it’s frankly a little poignant. So teach your puppies about toys! 23D: There is a cartoon aardvark named “Arthur” that I plunked right in here, unthinking. This is an original part of Disneyland, MR TOAD’S Wild Ride, although the ride has been altered since its 1955 debut. 28D: The entry here might not roll off the tongue but you have to admit this is, like, a super sweet pun. To “totally screw up” would mean to tally poorly, or MISADD. 44D: I’m not sure how specific the terminology of “beta” is when it comes to checking programs for bugs, and the normal context includes the entry — when something is “put into” beta it’s being beta TESTED, being released to certain users “in the wild” to kick the tires and try all the bells and whistles. If your IT GUY offers you this option, then he or she probably thinks you’ve got a lot of patience. Subscribers can take a peek at the answer key. Trying to get back to the puzzle page? Right here.

2019,"Wow Air, an Icelandic Budget Airline, Suspends Service","Efforts to raise money had failed, prompting the company to cease all flights on Thursday morning. Wow Air, an Icelandic budget airline that has been scrambling for money, ceased operations on Thursday after talks over financing fell apart. Wow canceled all flights on Thursday morning and advised passengers to check for alternatives with other airlines. Gudjon Helgason, a spokesman for Keflavik Airport near Reykjavik, Iceland, said no large groups were stranded at the airport because the airline had sent messages to passengers telling them that the flights would be canceled. “There’s no chaos or anything like that,” Mr. Helgason said. The airline, which in 2018 flew 3.5 million passengers to places like New York and Toronto, had been desperately trying to shore up its finances. After raising money through bonds in September, the airline wrote to bondholders two months later to say it was seeking additional financing. Skuli Mogensen, the founder and chief executive, blamed several factors for the collapse: “bad publicity”; a difficult environment that was exacerbated by the collapse of another budget airline, Primera; and “stricter payment terms” that put pressure on the company’s cash flow. In its results for the first nine months of 2018, the company said an increase in fuel prices had added to financial pressures, contributing to a loss of $33.7 million for the first three quarters. Discussions about a potential acquisition of Wow by Icelandair Group also fell apart in November. The airline reached a preliminary agreement in November for an investment by Indigo Partners, a private equity firm in Phoenix. But those talks were canceled last week. Wow also tried unsuccessfully to restart discussions with Icelandair. Wow’s bondholders agreed this week to convert the debt into equity, and the company had been in discussions about restructuring until Thursday’s announcement that it would cease operations altogether. Wow Air’s financial struggles had been a source of concern in Iceland. The finance minister said contingency plans were in place if the airline collapsed, including assistance for stranded passengers, but added that the government would not rescue the airline, according to local news reports. The airline’s issues also prompted the Iceland Pilots’ Union to write to Iceland’s press society asking for an inquiry into the critical reporting of Wow’s finances, to see whether the journalists had received benefits from competitors. The press association responded by saying that trying to trace the company’s problems to journalists would be like going “to a goat house to look for wool.” During Wow’s discussions over potential financing, the airline reduced its fleet of 20 aircraft to 11 by selling four airplanes and negotiating the return of some aircraft to leasing companies. Wow Air’s demise followed a series of airline shutdowns in Europe, where the aviation industry has expanded at a furious pace, offering passengers longer trips at cheaper prices. But many of these airlines, already grappling with narrow profit margins, have faced fluctuating oil prices and bills piling up after summer holiday periods. Primera, another low-cost airline offering trans-Atlantic flights, collapsed in October. The company, based in Latvia and Denmark, filed for bankruptcy after struggling with higher fuel costs and issues with its aircraft. Around the same time, airlines based in Switzerland, Belgium and Germany also folded. Flybmi, a British regional airline, and Germania, a budget airline based in Berlin, filed for bankruptcy in February. Flybe, another British airline, was bought out in January by a consortium that includes Virgin Atlantic.",The New York Times
2019,X Y Jet Takes Another Shot at the Dubai Golden Shaheen,"After three operations on his left front knee and a near- retirement, the resilient 7-year-old gelding X Y Jet has again journeyed from his home base in Florida to Meydan Racecourse in a quest to avenge two agonizing defeats in the Dubai Golden Shaheen on Saturday. X Y Jet broke sharply and surged to an early lead in the 1,200-meter race in2016, only to succumb in the final strides to intense pressure from Muarrab. X J Jet was found to have a knee chip that required surgery after the race, sidelining him for six months. He took a second shot at the Golden Shaheen last March and, on a dirt surface that favored horses with high early cruising speed, appeared to be in a commanding position when he sat just off the pace-setting Jordan Sport. Mind Your Biscuits, the defending champion and running last, then launched a breathtaking rally. In the winner’s circle, X J Jet’s trainer, Jorge Navarro, who ran afoul of racing authorities in Florida and New Jersey a few years ago, stood beside his wife, Jennifer, as they watched the drama unfold on the video board. “Where is the wire? Where is the wire?” Jennifer shouted as Mind Your Biscuits bore down on their horse. Navarro remembers being filled with confidence when his horse forged a two-length advantage for Emisael Jaramillo, X Y Jet’s jockey, with 200 meters left. Then Navarro remembers nothing of the furious finish. “I was fighting my body not to pass out,” he said in a phone interview from Dubai. “All I remember is looking at the big screen and saying, ‘Oh, my God, I’m going to win this race,’ and I went blank. A couple of seconds after the race, that’s when my body came back, and I was standing on my tiptoes looking at the screen, asking myself if I won the race or not.” He had not. At the last instant, Mind Your Biscuits prevailed by a head in 1:10.12, a track record. The Navarros, with family members in tears, retreated to their suite in silence. Although X Y Jet has won 11 of 24 starts with seven runner-up finishes and two third-place efforts for earnings of $1,595,513 for his owners Rockingham Ranch and Gelfenstein Farm, he has been plagued by injuries throughout his career. He made only one start last year following the Golden Shaheen, when he won the Grade 3 Smile Sprint Handicap on June 30 at Gulfstream Park. X Y Jet was sent to Gelfenstein Farm in Ocala, Fla., in November amid thoughts of retiring him. Many horses are never the same after one knee operation, let alone three. His age suggested he should be well past his prime. But he did not adapt to the slower pace of the farm. His high-strung behavior suggested he had more running to do. “He has the drive. He wants to race,” said Brian Trump, operations manager for Rockingham Ranch. “He gets antsy when he’s sitting in the barn. He wants to get out on the track.” X Y Jet started his comeback when he ran fourth in the Sunshine Millions Sprint on Jan. 19 at Gulfstream Park before dominating an optional claiming-allowance race there by 7¾ lengths on Feb. 13. Navarro, 44, started as a hot walker before taking out his trainer’s license in 2008. He seeks redemption as much as his horse does and is eager to demonstrate on a grand international stage that his success with his stables, which have about 125 horses, is based on horsemanship alone. X J Jet, who has passed drug tests after each of his wins, has not been caught up in his trainer’s past troubles. In 2013, Navarro served a 60-day suspension in Florida after a number of his horses tested positive for anti-inflammatory medication. Some were found to be 300 times above the permitted threshold, prompting Tampa Bay Downs to ban him from its 2013-2014 meet. He captured his sixth consecutive training title at Monmouth Park in Oceanport, N.J., last year, and his horses won 85 of 190 starts. Navarro was cited again in 2017 when he and the owner Randal Gindi, then a client of his, were caught on video in New Jersey talking about the use of “juice.” Both men were fined, but Navarro denies wrongdoing. Brian Trump, operations manager for Rockingham Ranch, says he knows his horse is clean and he has confidence in Navarro. “Jorge is an outstanding horseman,” Trump said. “He’s a class act. He loves this horse more than anything in the world. He’s slept in the barn with the horse. I have no problems with anything.” Navarro said he was seeking to put behind him the agonizing defeats and stinging accusations by winning the elusive Golden Shaheen. “The meaning of the race, the meaning of X Y Jet in my life,” he said, “I want to get it done for the horse.”",The New York Times
2019,"Xi Dines With Macron in France, and Pays a Visit to Monaco’s Prince","MONACO — President Xi Jinping of China has found one country in Europe that isn’t worried about his country’s growing global clout or its ambitions to dominate the future of technology: Monaco. Mr. Xi visited the tiny Mediterranean principality on Sunday as part of a European tour that is clouded by mixed feelings about how to engage with China and benefit from its trade — while setting limits on its appetite for greater economic and diplomatic influence. The president’s appearance alongside Prince Albert II of Monaco represented the first state visit here by a Chinese president. The palace said Monaco was interested in increased trade and economic cooperation with China and “boosting China’s image in the principality.” Monaco clinched a deal last year with the Chinese tech company Huawei to develop its 5G telecommunications network — a thorny issue for several European countries. The United States government says Huawei’s 5G network could give Chinese security services a back door to spy on consumers, and has pressed European partners to shun it. Huawei says the fear is unfounded. Monaco imposed exceptional security for Mr. Xi’s visit. “It’s the first time I’ve seen this … ” Marc Bonafede, the owner of a restaurant in Monaco, said, trailing off. “Stores closed, windows shuttered, no one in the street.” Monaco banned all flights in its airspace during Mr. Xi’s brief visit and any sailing in its waters. The nearby French city of Nice, where Mr. Xi is spending the night, was similarly cordoned off. The Promenade des Anglais — the beachside avenue that is Nice’s premier attraction — was closed to traffic all weekend. The promenade was targeted by a deadly terrorist attack in 2016. Outside the French resort town of Beaulieu-sur-Mer, where Mr. Xi was dining Sunday night with President Emmanuel Macron of France, a police boat patrolled throughout the day. Mr. Xi is expected to sign energy and other contracts with Mr. Macron on Monday, then meet in Paris on Tuesday with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker. The trip to France comes after Mr. Xi’s visit in Italy, which just endorsed China’s vast global transportation infrastructure project, the Belt and Road Initiative. Mr. Macron criticized Italy’s move, calling for a concerted European approach to China instead. France has not decided yet whether to let Huawei build its 5G networks, but it is likely to be a subject of discussions during the Chinese leader’s visit.",The New York Times
2019,Yankees Add Insurance to Rotation by Signing Gio Gonzalez,"TAMPA, Fla. — Hoping to bolster the depth of their rotation, the Yankees have agreed to a minor league deal with Gio Gonzalez, a veteran left-handed pitcher who, like many other players this off-season, languished in a slow free agent market. The Yankees’ starting staff will begin the season without two of their starters: C.C. Sabathia, who is a few weeks behind his fellow starting pitchers because of off-season operations on his heart and his right knee, and Luis Severino, who is recovering from a shoulder injury sustained in spring training. Sabathia is expected to return sometime in April; Severino will be out until May. The Yankees have expressed confidence in their alternatives — Luis Cessa, Domingo German and Jonathan Loaisiga — even though those pitchers are largely unproven in the major leagues. While Gonzalez, 33, has declined recently, he has been an All-Star twice and is known for his durability. Because he has missed most of spring training, it is unclear how quickly Gonzalez can be ready to pitch. The Yankees open the season on March 28, and have a month to determine whether they are confident in Gonzalez’s conditioning. His deal includes an April 20 opt-out, which would allow him to leave if the Yankees have not added him to the major league roster by then. Gonzalez would earn $3 million if he is in the major leagues and the deal also includes performance incentives. Gonzalez is from Miami, and he has been working out a training facility there run by his agent, Scott Boras. In a recent workout, Gonzalez faced hitters and threw 88 pitches. Gonzalez’s performance has slipped gradually over the years. He went 10-11 with a 4.21 earned run average over 171 innings last season, when he was with the Washington Nationals and the Milwaukee Brewers. He was an All-Star in 2011 and 2012. Although his strikeout and walk rates have trended in opposite directions in recent seasons, Gonzalez has not been on the injured list since 2014, and he has averaged 187 innings a season over the past nine years.",The New York Times
2019,Yankees’ Luis Severino Is Out Until May; Aaron Hicks Could Miss Opening Day,"TAMPA, Fla. — Two key Yankees may be out longer than originally expected to start the 2019 season. While pitcher Luis Severino had already been scratched from his opening-day start on March 28 because of a shoulder injury, General Manager Brian Cashman gave a clearer estimate on Friday, saying Severino would be out until the beginning of May “at the very earliest.” “I can’t tell you past that,” he added. “If it needs to be more, we need to make sure we don’t have a problem with it.” Aaron Hicks, who has been dealing with a back injury, may not be available for opening day, either. Cashman said the Yankees had yet to determine whether the center fielder would be available for their first game, against the Baltimore Orioles, but he acknowledged that the team had begun considering how to juggle the roster if Hicks was not ready. When Hicks’s back stiffness first emerged two weeks ago, the Yankees believed it would be resolved in a few days. The discomfort persisted, however, to the point that Hicks received a cortisone shot in his back on Monday. Cashman said Hicks, 29, could see a stint, if needed, on the 10-day injured list. “We’re running out of time,” Cashman said. “We’re going to do what’s right for us in the long haul.” Hicks said on Friday that his back felt “great” but that he was doing only conditioning exercises and had not yet resumed hitting. “If I keep staying pretty stable, I’m not too worried about it,” he said. Hicks said that whenever his back is ready for hitting, it would not take him long — 15 to 20 at-bats, he estimated — to regain his timing for the season. Hicks, who received a seven-year, $70 million contract extension last month, made it clear that he wanted to be on the field against the Orioles on the 28th. “You want to feel that rush of opening day, and you want to be introduced with your team,” he said. If Hicks is on the injured list to start the season, the Yankees will use Brett Gardner in center field, with Giancarlo Stanton and Aaron Judge on either side. The ripple effects on the rest of the roster are also yet to be determined: Who would be the fourth outfielder? Would the team carry both Luke Voit and Greg Bird at first base? Severino, 25, who signed a four-year, $40 million contract extension last month, received a cortisone shot for his inflamed right rotator cuff and still has several days remaining in his 14-day shutdown from throwing. He will start playing catch next week, and if he encounters no issues it will still take at least a month to rebuild his arm strength and stamina to the point where he can return to a major league game. Severino, who will be replaced by Masahiro Tanaka for the start on opening day, said he understood the reasoning for his being held out for all of April. “I just want to be healthy and help my team,” he said. Cashman said the Yankees expected starting pitcher C. C. Sabathia, whose spring training has been hampered by off-season operations on his heart and his right knee, to be ready “at some point in April.” Sabathia, who may appear in his first spring training game next week, also must serve a five-game suspension to start the season stemming from an incident in which he threw at Tampa Bay’s Jesus Sucre in a game last fall. Cashman insisted he was pleased with the team’s internal candidates — Luis Cessa, Domingo German and Jonathan Loaisiga — to fill the rotation spots until Severino and Sabathia are back. But he wouldn’t rule out other options. “Doesn’t mean we’re not opposed to outside opportunities,” he added, “if those opportunities match up with our interest level.”",The New York Times
2019,"Yankees’ Luis Severino Scratched, Raising Doubts About Opening Day","The Yankees’ tenuous rotation depth took a significant hit Tuesday when the right-hander Luis Severino was found to have rotator cuff inflammation in his throwing shoulder, almost certainly ruling him out as the team’s opening day starter on March 28. Yankees Manager Aaron Boone told reporters that Severino, who had been scheduled to make his first spring training start Tuesday, felt some discomfort and underwent a magnetic resonance imaging examination, which found nothing beyond the rotator cuff problem. Severino will be treated with an injection and anti-inflammatories, and will take two weeks of rest. The time off will make him “highly unlikely” to be ready for the start of the season, Boone said. Severino said he felt the discomfort while warming up for his start in Tampa, Fla. He was scratched and replaced by the prospect Stephen Tarpley. As a result, the Yankees, with an unproven staff of starters beyond the top five arms in their rotation, are likely to begin the season without two of their best pitchers, Severino and C.C. Sabathia. Sabathia is coming back from off-season operations on his heart and knee, and also faces a five-game suspension to start the season from an incident in which he threw at Tampa Bay’s Jesus Sucre in a game last fall. Boone told reporters that Domingo German, 26, and Jonathan Loaisiga, 24, were candidates to take Severino’s spot to start the season. German had a 5.57 earned run average in 85⅔ innings last season, while Loaisiga posted a 5.11 E.R.A. in 24⅔ innings. Luis Cessa, 26, also capable of starting, is a candidate to make the season-opening bullpen. Severino, 25, is the Yankees’ top starter and was one of the best pitchers in the American League last season, with a 3.39 E.R.A. that led all of the team’s regular starting pitchers. He was rewarded with a four-year, $40 million contract extension last month. Although two weeks is a small amount of time relative to the six-month regular season, any injury involving a pitcher’s elbow or shoulder is concerning. Severino’s ailment could push the Yankees to redouble their efforts to add another starter from the few remaining veteran free agents who wouldn’t break the bank, a group that includes players like Gio Gonzalez and Edwin Jackson. The injury is a worrying omen for a rotation that seemed to be improved entering spring training. The Yankees had re-signed Sabathia and J.A. Happ, who was acquired in a midseason trade last season, and added James Paxton. But injuries are all but inevitable with pitchers: Paxton is a talented hard-thrower but has recorded more than 140 innings in a season only once in his career. Happ has averaged 170 innings a season over the past five years, but he turned 36 in October. Sabathia is 38, entering his final season and is weeks behind his colleagues this spring because of his off-season operations. Masahiro Tanaka, 30, who has pitched with a partially torn ligament in his throwing elbow, has averaged 165 innings a year since the start of the 2014 season. Depending on the length on Severino’s absence, the Yankees’ off-season restraint in reinforcing their rotation may come into question. While they did trade prospects to acquire Paxton, they failed to reach a deal with Patrick Corbin, the top free-agent starting pitcher this off-season. Corbin passed on the Yankees’ five-year, $100 million offer to join the Washington Nationals, who gave him a six-year, $140 million contract. Severino also is not the only key Yankee already dealing with an injury. Center fielder Aaron Hicks, who signed a contract extension last month, has not played since Friday because of discomfort in his lower back. Hicks told reporters that it would be several more days before he resumed batting practice or appeared in a game.",The New York Times
2019,"Yankees’ Miguel Andujar Wants His Defense to Have Fans Talking, Not Groaning","TAMPA, Fla. — During the idle time of spring training, Miguel Andujar pulls out his cellphone and calls up a video. He has seen this footage already, but if he wants to fulfill his dream of becoming one of baseball’s elite third basemen, he needs to keep watching and emulating. Andujar, who turned 24 on Saturday, wants to field like Nolan Arenado, Alex Bregman and Manny Machado. And more than anything, he wants to be like his hero, Adrian Beltre, another third baseman, who recently retired after a distinguished 21-year career that included five Gold Gloves and four All-Star appearances. “I love the way he throws the ball and positions himself on defense,” Andujar said in Spanish after a recent afternoon at the Yankees’ spring training site. “And how he prepares before a pitch, in the ready position and with a little hop.” There are several reasons the Yankees did not seriously pursue Machado during his high-profile free agency. They wanted to spread money around on various improvements, rather than spending in a single chunk, and Machado’s 10-year $300 million contract with the San Diego Padres proved to be the second-largest free-agent deal in North American sports history. Beyond money, there was also the fact that the team already possessed a talented young third baseman in Andujar, who finished second in the American League rookie of the year voting last season despite his defensive warts. “We recognize there are players playing all around the game that might be better than what we have here, but that’s fine too,” Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman said recently. “You can’t have them all.” He added later: “The product is a strong one. And we want it to be the best it possibly can be. If it’s not good enough, judge me on my recommendations to ownership.” And long before the Yankees decided not to formally make an offer to Machado, they were already working to improve Andujar’s defense. Andujar’s talent, particularly at the plate, is undeniable — and was so even as early as 2011, when he signed with the Yankees at 16 out of his native Dominican Republic. Last season, the Yankees had planned to have Brandon Drury at third base, but Andujar took over the job through a combination of injuries to others and his own performance. In 149 games, Andujar posted an .855 on-base-plus-slugging percentage and hit .297, topped only by the Washington Nationals star Anthony Rendon among major league third baseman. Andujar’s 27 homers and 92 runs batted in trailed only Giancarlo Stanton on the Yankees. But in the field, Andujar was shaky. While he committed 15 errors — and last year’s A.L. Gold Glove winner at the position, Oakland’s Matt Chapman, was charged with 20 — Andujar struggled in other regards. Advanced defensive metrics rated him the worst fielding third baseman among those with at least 900 innings last season. In the do-or-die Game 4 of the A.L. divisional series against the Boston Red Sox, Yankees Manager Aaron Boone opted for Neil Walker at third base instead of Andujar. “He exceeded his developmental projections, on defense especially,” Cashman said of Andujar. “We just have to give him time and be patient and give him the chance to close those gaps. The old adage of ‘Where there’s a will, there’s a way,’ and he has a lot of will.” So to enact all the desired changes for this season, the Yankees and Andujar recognized that he needed extra instruction over the winter. A month after the Yankees were knocked out of the playoffs by the Red Sox in October, Andujar spent a few days with Boone and the Yankees’ infield instructor, Carlos Mendoza, both former infielders, at the Yankees’ complex in Tampa. Afterward, Andujar returned to the Dominican Republic and continued his off-season training with private trainers to improve his agility. In January, Mendoza and Boone, on a trip to see several Yankees players, worked with Andujar at the Yankees’ academy and checked on his progress. The Yankees zeroed in on two areas for Andujar: how he throws the ball and how he uses his feet. They saw that Andujar had a tendency to throw sidearm. That is fine when charging a chopping ground ball or throwing from an awkward angle. But on routine plays, the Yankees believed it was affecting his accuracy. Sidearm throws can sail to the side as they approach first base. So the Yankees have continually reminded Andujar to set his feet properly and throw the more traditional overhand way on routine plays, which he did with ease during pregame fielding drills even last year. “It’s about comfort level for him,” Mendoza said. “So when the game started, he got away from it. But now, we want that work that he’s doing before games to show in games this year.” In terms of refining Andujar’s footwork, the Yankees taught him not only to get into an athletic position at third base — bent at the knees and hands out, ready to field — but to make a slight hop on the balls of his feet before each pitch is delivered. Mendoza likened it to a tennis player waiting to receive a serve. “We talk about guys’ hands all the time, but really, the great fielders have great feet and are able to keep athletic and create hops” for themselves, Boone said. Even something as small as a little bounce can be significant. “It’ll help the accuracy of his first step,” Mendoza said. “Last year, he was a step too late. A tick of a second. In the big leagues, that’s the difference between an out and a double past you.” Willie Randolph, a longtime Yankees second baseman and coach who serves as a guest spring training instructor, said young players sometimes had mental lapses in which they forgot to be in an athletic fielding position on every single pitch and were caught flat-footed when the ball was hit their way. After a recent workout in spring training, Randolph commended Andujar’s progress. “The difference I see from this year to last year: He’s starting to dance now,” he said. “He’s starting to feel the rhythm of the position.” Much as Cashman and Mendoza did, Randolph advocated patience with Andujar. He pointed to the Yankees’ 100 wins last season despite Andujar’s defensive lapses and said that the total might improve as his fielding did. How much, if at all, will be a question hovering over the 2019 season. “I always have trusted in my work, and I thank the team for believing in me and my talent, although I haven’t been here long,” Andujar said. “I’m thankful to be here and to show them every day that I can do it.” Perhaps more than anyone, Andujar wants the narrative about him to change. The skepticism hovering over his defense has persisted so much since last season that he occasionally looks a tad annoyed answering more questions about it this spring. He answers them nonetheless. Yet the day after Arenado, who could have been a Yankees free-agent target next winter, agreed to an eight-year, $260 million extension with the Colorado Rockies, Andujar smiled when asked for his opinion. Although his English is improving, Andujar usually uses an Spanish interpreter when speaking with reporters. This time, he blurted out an answer in English about one of the fielders he admires. “Good for him,” Andujar said. “I want to be like that one day.”",The New York Times
2019,Yankees’ Offense Wakes Up Too Late in Loss to Orioles,"Orioles 5, Yankees 3 After another playoff appearance that did not end with a World Series title, the Yankees pinpointed their pitching staff as an area for improvement. They threw money at relief pitchers Adam Ottavino and Zack Britton, and at C.C. Sabathia and J.A. Happ, two veteran starting pitchers. Their biggest pitching addition, however, was James Paxton, a talented but oft-injured left-hander whom the Yankees acquired from the Seattle Mariners in November in exchange for a package that included their top prospect, Justus Sheffield. Paxton’s pinstripes debut ended with a 5-3 loss to the lowly Baltimore Orioles on Saturday afternoon, the second game of the season, because of a few mistakes, including by catcher Gary Sanchez, and an offense that was dormant until late in the game. “He went out there and dominated, but we just weren’t able to come up in the big situation with those runs he needed,” Yankees right fielder Aaron Judge said. “We got that one for him, but against any major league team, one isn’t enough. Plus, a couple costly errors. You make errors in the major leagues, they come back to bite you.” Paxton, known as the Big Maple for his 6-foot-4 frame and Canadian origins, flashed his medley of speeds, from mid- to high-90s fastballs to slower cutters to even slower curveballs. Because of injuries, Paxton’s body of work is limited. The most he has thrown in any season is 160 innings, which he did last season. But he has trended up over the years; he threw a no-hitter last season and notched a career-best 208 strikeouts. “Going out there the first inning, I was pretty excited and nervous, but I felt good about it and let it energize me,” Paxton said. But with little margin for error on Saturday, the few blunders cost Paxton, who struck out five and allowed two runs — one earned — over five and two-thirds innings. His unraveling began in the sixth inning. Jesus Sucre singled and Richie Martin blooped a hit down the first-base line. Two batters later, Paxton’s fastball down the middle of the plate to Dwight Smith resulted in a game-tying single. The inning worsened when the Orioles attempted a double steal and Sanchez’s throw to second base sailed into center field. Martin scored to give the Orioles a 2-1 lead. “If I throw it well, it would’ve been an out,” Sanchez said. “But one isn’t perfect. My bad.” Soon thereafter, Paxton exited the game, acknowledging the Yankee Stadium crowd as he walked toward the dugout. An inning later, Sucre smacked a run-scoring single off relief pitcher Chad Green. With Jonathan Holder pitching in the ninth, a throwing error by third baseman D.J. LeMahieu helped extended the Orioles’ lead. The Yankees’ only run for eight innings came in the fourth thanks to LeMahieu. The Yankees signed him to a two-year, $24 million contract this winter because of his Gold Glove Award-winning defense and high-contact bat. Although a longtime second baseman, LeMahieu was willing to play all over the infield. Starting at third base instead of Miguel Andujar, who was the designated hitter, LeMahieu made a few standout plays to end Orioles’ threats. At the plate in the fourth inning, his single up the middle scored Gleyber Torres for a 1-0 Yankees lead. Although the Orioles posted the worst record in baseball last season and are rebuilding this season, their pitchers vexed the Yankees’ bats. The Yankees squandered a bases-loaded opportunity in the first inning, when Andujar grounded into a double play. They couldn’t push across base runners in later opportunities until a ninth-inning rally, led by Troy Tulowitzki’s solo blast, fell short with strikeouts by Giancarlo Stanton and Andujar. “We just couldn’t cash in enough,” Yankees Manager Aaron Boone said.",The New York Times
2019,Yellow Vest Protests Prompt France to Ban Some Demonstrations,"PARIS — French officials said on Tuesday that they would ban potentially violent protests in key areas like the Champs-Élysées in Paris, following a surge of violence during Yellow Vest demonstrations over the weekend that led to intense criticism of the government’s handling of security around tourist neighborhoods and wealthier areas. Prime Minister Édouard Philippe said in a televised statement from Paris that after “intolerable” events over the weekend, the government had decided to ban any future Yellow Vest demonstrations “in the areas that have been most targeted,” if authorities became aware of “extremist elements” that intended to vandalize. Mr. Philippe said one of those areas would be the Champs-Élysées, a major avenue in western Paris with luxury stores and tourist attractions that has become a focal point for the protests. On Saturday, “breakers,” or casseurs, smashed an upscale restaurant, looted 27 stores and set kiosks and a bank on fire, forcing firefighters to evacuate a mother and her baby who were trapped on the building’s second floor. The government said 10,000 Yellow Vest protesters had marched in Paris, including 1,500 “ultraviolent” activists. Such a surge in violence also caught by surprise the managers of the dozens of boutiques dotting the Champs-Élysées, who had dropped their guard after recent weekends when violence had decreased. On Monday, many shops were still boarded, while glass windows were being replaced in others. But critics argued that it was the government that had dropped its guard, lashing out at Interior Minister Christophe Castaner for skimping on security resources. “We should be able to handle a situation like the one we’ve experienced,” said Paris’s left-wing mayor, Anne Hidalgo. “I’m expecting explanations from the government,” she added. In a sign of the government’s effort to address the criticism, Mr. Philippe said that the head of the Paris police, Michel Delpuech, who has been under fire, would be replaced this week. Although the main Yellow Vest demonstration was dwarfed by other “marches for climate and social justice” that gathered 36,000 protesters in Paris and more than 145,000 throughout France on the same day, the damage in Paris still dominated Monday’s news cycle. Mr. Philippe argued that those who committed violence were not protesters but rioters, whose unique intention was to “loot, set on fire, destroy and hurt.” Mr. Philippe acknowledged that a new law-enforcement strategy put into place after the first violent protests had not been “correctly executed,” with “dysfunctions” in several areas. In December, after weeks of increasingly violent demonstrations, security forces adopted a more flexible strategy, to try to quickly stop and apprehend rioters. On Saturday, the police arrested 237 protesters and took 144 of them into custody, compared with 1,100 arrests on Dec. 8, on the first weekend the new strategy was used. The controversy over the use of rubber bullet launchers, nonlethal weapons that have caused dozens of facial injuries, forced police forces to reduce their use, Mr. Philippe said, hinting that the police would be allowed to adopt tougher measures. He announced that the police would use drones, special products to mark rioters and video surveillance to arrest them. In addition to Paris, Mr. Philippe also mentioned squares in Bordeaux and Toulouse where protests might be banned. A contentious law passed this past week by senators, which allows administrative rather than judiciary authorities throughout France to ban protests, will not go into effect until a review by the country’s constitutional council. Mr. Philippe said the law would help prevent masked rioters from gaining access to demonstration areas. The Yellow Vest protests had tapered off in recent weeks, and several key figures announced that they would stop demonstrating. But the movement has maintained a continuous presence for 18 consecutive Saturdays, with violence seen by many as the only way to make sure their voices are heard. President Emmanuel Macron has tried to stanch the protesters’ anger through what was known as the “Great National Debate,” 11 meetings throughout France that ended last week. But a majority of Yellow Vests have spurned the initiative. On Monday, Mr. Macron received more than 60 intellectuals to discuss what would come after the “Great National Debate.” The government is expected by April to announce the first measures to emerge from that debate. After a trip to East Africa last week, Mr. Macron went to the Pyrénées for a weekend ski holiday, which he shortened to address the violence. Many protesters complained that even a brief ski trip was an unseemly show of economic privilege in a time of popular hardship.",The New York Times
2019,Yemen Asks U.S. for Help to Curb Smuggling of Looted Ancient Artifacts,"Yemen’s deputy culture minister, Abdulhadi al-Azazi, remembers standing two years ago amid the rubble of a national museum in his war-torn hometown, Taiz. Objects he had admired as a youngster — ancient limestone carvings, gilded Torah scrolls, bejeweled Islamic daggers, a spindly 2,500-year-old mummy — were missing amid the charred debris and shattered display cases. “The museum was wrecked and everything was stolen,” he said in a telephone interview. “Everywhere in our country we see the same thing happening now.” Some four years into a civil war in which members of a Northern Yemeni faction known as Houthis have fought Saudi-backed Yemeni forces to a stalemate, the extent of the human suffering has drawn global attention. Less noticed have been the cultural institutions and archaeological relics lost or ravaged during the conflict, including thousands of antiquities taken from Yemen’s museums. [Read more about the humanitarian crisis in Yemen.] In an effort to recover some of the items, Yemeni officials visited Washington and New York in recent days to ask the Trump administration and the United Nations to help them forestall the scattering of a heritage that stretches back nearly 4,000 years. Their central request is that the United States issue an emergency order that would bar the import of Yemeni artifacts that did not carry special documentation. Typically, antiquities from abroad cannot enter the country without documentation mandated in one-on-one agreements between the nation of origin and the United States. Because Yemen is not party to any such agreement, its artifacts simply need to be declared at customs in a routine way. The Saudi-backed Yemeni government hopes the United States will impose new rules requiring importers to show proof that the objects had been legally obtained. That proof could be in the form of a government authorization or documents proving that the items had a well-established provenance trail dating from before the civil war. “Yemen was a cradle to many civilizations and a home to multiple faiths, particularly Judaism, Christianity and Islam, which all thrived here,” Yemen’s culture minister, Marwan Dammaj, said in New York on Wednesday. He denounced the pillaging as “a gross affront to humanity at large.” Restrictions on antiquity imports are usually painstakingly negotiated and require a petitioning nation to show proof of ongoing thefts, illegal excavations and illicit exports. Care is taken not to disrupt any legal trade in a country’s cultural heritage objects, or to interfere with museum loans and educational exchanges. Nations seeking the curbs must show they are working to crack down on black markets and safeguard their relics. Nonetheless, the United States has in recent years issued emergency orders on behalf of Iraq, Syria, Libya and Mali. In the case of Syria, for example, Congress voted to impose the restrictions in 2016 after terrorist groups were found to be profiteering from the country’s antiquities to pay for weapons and recruitment. The Yemenis say they have strong evidence that their artifacts are being sold off by Houthi fighters and by terrorist groups like Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and the Islamic State, which infiltrated the country during its current turmoil. To bolster those claims, Mr. Dammaj circulated a 290-page report in Arabic and English that details the looting at the Aden National Museum, the Taiz National Museum and the National Museum of Zinjibar. Accompanying it is a catalog of 1,631 objects missing from the museums. The list includes items that stretch back into the depths of civilization in a region known as a vital early trading crossroads, including ivory figurines from the ancient Kingdom of Saba (the mythic realm of the Queen of Sheba); Roman-era golden coins and marble statuettes; and brass finials and Hebrew manuscripts from the many centuries when Jews populated what is now southern Arabia. “It is clear that violent extremists are plundering our treasures and smuggling them overseas,” said Mr. Dammaj, who met with State and Treasury Department officials, American law enforcement authorities and United Nations representatives. State Department officials said the agency is studying the request. “It is important that we take steps now to prevent the further degradation of invaluable cultural property and heritage sites in Yemen,” the department said in a statement. “We want to help prevent malign actors from profiting from the looting, theft and sale of conflict antiquities.” Mr. Dammaj said Houthis have been arrested several times in the act of smuggling antiquities and have been seen ransacking cultural sites. Although it is impossible to corroborate every allegation, independent groups that follow Yemen’s plight have also cited a Houthi role in the sacking of some cultural sites. Mwatana, an independent Yemeni human rights group, has cited those forces in the looting of several museums, though it has also accused Saudi air forces of bombing cultural sites where they believed Houthi combatants had taken shelter. Last month, the Malaysia-based Islamic Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization assailed the Houthis for plundering manuscripts, historical texts and Islamic relics from the library of Zabid, Yemen’s capital during the 13th and 15th centuries. Deborah Lehr, the chairwoman of the Antiquities Coalition, a Washington group that combats cultural racketeering and helped Yemen assemble and publish the English-language version of its report, said her group had been in contact with foreign archaeologists on the ground in Yemen who reported evidence of looting by the Houthi faction.",The New York Times
2019,"Opinion | Yes, We Need a Green New Deal. Just Not the One Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Is Offering.","There is a better way to reduce harmful emissions. Mr. Rattner served as counselor to the Treasury secretary in the Obama administration. Yes, of course, we need a Green New Deal to address the world’s most urgent crisis, global warming. Just, please, not the one that a flotilla of liberal politicians, including seven of the top Democratic presidential hopefuls currently in the Senate, are signing up for in droves, like children following the pied piper in the old legend. Our modern-day pied piper, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, is trying to lure us into a set of policies that might help save the planet but at the cost of severely damaging the global economy. To be sure, by the time the resolution was introduced into Congress, some of its most ludicrous provisions (like the deadline of 2030 for a full transition to renewable energy and the immediate halt to any investment in fossil fuels) had been eliminated or watered down. But as important as continuing to prune the absurd or damaging provisions would be to add what is the most effective way to attack climate change: using taxes and market forces rather than government controls to reduce harmful emissions. That has been a problem for decades, at least since Washington got seriously into the business of improving the environment, back in 1970 with the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency — under President Richard Nixon! Politicians prefer that approach because using regulation hides the costs of reducing emissions. The decision, for example, to force improvements in automobile mileage by requiring each manufacturer to improve overall fleet efficiency has added thousands of dollars to the cost of cars. Higher car prices have the countervailing impact of encouraging Americans to hang onto their older, less fuel-efficient cars for a longer time, offsetting at least some of the gains from newer cars. Nor have the regulations, with their many escape hatches, kept consumers from buying even more sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks as gas prices have remained historically low. Fortunately, there is a better way to address the climate problem at far lower cost to the economy: a tax on greenhouse gas emissions. That can be imposed in any number of ways. The 18.4 cent federal gasoline tax, for example, hasn’t been increased since 1993 even as most other developed countries impose far higher levies. A particularly thoughtful proposal has come from the Climate Leadership Council, a bipartisan organization that counts more than 3,300 economists among its signatories. Elegant in its simplicity, the key provision would be the imposition of an escalating tax on carbon. At an initial rate of $43 per ton, the levy would be roughly equivalent to 38.2 cents per gallon of gasoline. To prevent polluters from fleeing overseas, the tax would be imposed on imports from countries lacking a similar provision while exports to those countries would not be taxed. While difficult to implement, that component is important to work out. The entire proceeds from the tax would be rebated to consumers. The council suggests an equal amount for each American; my view would be to exclude the wealthy (who hardly need the estimated $2,000 a year in payments) and disproportionately favor those closer to the bottom. Why are so many economists, even conservative ones, in favor of a massive new tax? Because markets do not always price in “externalities” like pollution. In addition to cutting consumption, raising the price of carbon would arguably do more to encourage development of alternative power sources than all the massive new government spending programs that advocates of the Green New Deal envision. Some technical problems would need to be addressed, such as how the higher prices would filter through inflation calculations and create unintended cost of living adjustments to wages and Social Security payments. But those are details; the key point is that a carbon tax has been judged by climate hawks like Resources for the Future to be far more effective in reaching the goals of the Paris agreement than the well-intended regulations put in place by President Barack Obama and his predecessors. That’s at least part of why the plan enjoys support from an armada of organizations not often on the same page, like Exxon Mobil and Conservation International. Historically, the politics of even small increases in the gasoline tax have been tough. A 2017 proposal in the House to increase tax by just one penny went nowhere. But recent polls suggest that perhaps sentiment is changing; a survey by the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago found that 44 percent of Americans favor a carbon tax while only 29 percent oppose one. Given how late we are to the climate battle, maintaining some sensible regulation will also be necessary. But a hefty carbon tax would go a long way toward winning the war.

2019,"Yes, You Can Play With Your Clothes","Fidget spinners are so 2017; in 2019, fidget fashion is on the rise Eighteen months ago, Alexandra Connell, who has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, introduced the online marketplace Patti & Ricky, which bills itself as “fashion for people of all abilities.” Among the products is a line of “discreet” sliding bead fidget jewelry from Love Dawne aimed at those with A.D.H.D. and anxiety who need a beautiful, socially acceptable way to fidget. The jewelry’s aesthetic becomes the focus of attention, rather than the behavior. “My fidget jewelry helps with my own A.D.H.D. and anxiety, and people who compliment it are always surprised to hear it was designed to serve a purpose,” said Ms. Connell, 31, who has a master’s degree in disability studies from Columbia University Teachers College and lives in Denver. “Then they want to buy one for themselves, because who isn’t anxious these days? Society is moving toward understanding that fidgets can inspire concentration, focus and brainstorming — but you can’t pull out a fidget spinner in a board meeting.” Amy Serwer, who lives in Manhattan and has two children, recognizes what Ms. Connell is talking about. She has two Jennifer Meyer gold-and-diamond initial charm necklaces dedicated to her 10- and 12-year-old daughters, and she wears them together every day. “I’m always fidgeting with these necklaces,” Ms. Serwer said. “They help me focus when I’m stressed out, plus they make me feel closer to my kids.” Retail therapy has a new, more literal, meaning. Fidget spinners may be so 2017, but their explosive sales revealed, in part, our compulsive need for something (anything) to occupy our hands, calm our nerves and focus our thoughts. Especially when we can’t grab our phones. Enter Fidget Fashion: the dangling fringe, reversible sequins, jingly charms and sliding jewelry that is suddenly ubiquitous at brands including Paco Rabanne, Altuzarra, Gucci and Loewe. The pieces are the equivalent of “modern-day worry beads to take your mind off the moment and mentally unwind,” said Ken Downing, the senior vice president and fashion director of Neiman Marcus, who traces the genesis of fidget fashion to the popularity of handbag charms a few years ago. According to Ingrid Wright, a psychotherapist, “fidgets help reduce anxiety, and can almost be compared to a child’s baby blanket.” Johnson Hartig, the founder and designer of Libertine, a label that sells many embellished pieces, said: “With fashion being so fast and images instantly available there is something to say about a tactile interactive garment — it’s comforting somehow.” On the artisanal side, craftier styles with a D.I.Y. bent are on the rise for spring, with designers putting a high-end spin on 1970s-style macramé fringe and rope accessories, all ready-made for fingers to absent-mindedly braid or knot. Philosophy di Lorenzo Serafini, a fashion house in Milan, even added sliding wooden beads on its multistrand rope belts. Leslie J. Ghize, the executive vice president of Tobe, a consumer culture and creative think tank, believes this ratcheting up of fidgety, tactile design serves as a reality check or antidote to the fakeness of the virtual realm. “Even seeing texture and dimension makes people feel closer to the real world,” she said. Yet, one of the results of the boom in fidget fashion and accessories meant to calm our social-media-frenzied minds has been a surge in Boomerang posts and slow-motion videos of people twirling in super-swingy fringe skirts or brushing reverse sequin fabrics and down. A Michael Kors Instagram post of a model spinning in a black sequined dress with sparkly beaded fringe flaring out, for example, has over 175,000 views and 110 comments. “The more interactive, the better pictures they make,” said Roopal Patel, the fashion director of Saks Fifth Avenue. The perfect accessory to wear while watching? One of Cynthia Gale New York’s sterling silver Spinner Rings with rotating band-in-a-band construction. “We often term them ‘meditation rings,’” said Cynthia Gale, the founder and designer of the label. “We live in stressful times, and I really believe they help people with their mental fitness. They are consistently our best-selling category.”",The New York Times
2019,Yo-Yo Ma and Wu Man: A Concerto Conjures a Chinese Golden Age,"“A Happy Excursion,” a double concerto that has its American premiere on Wednesday with the New York Philharmonic, takes its title from an ancient Taoist text. But it could just as easily describe the joyous performance of its soloists, Yo-Yo Ma and Wu Man. They were at the top of their fields when they met in the 1990s: Mr. Ma, a superstar cellist; Ms. Wu, the world’s leading pipa player and a tireless ambassador for that lutelike Chinese instrument. Living in the same small Boston suburb, they became quick friends and colleagues; they’ve played together at the White House and with Mr. Ma’s Silkroad Ensemble. [How Yo-Yo Ma wants Bach to save the world.] Among their collaborators has been Zhao Lin, who wrote “A Happy Excursion” and, in the spirit of Silkroad, has already blended traditionally Eastern and Western instruments in another double concerto: “Duo” (2013), for cello and sheng, a Chinese reed instrument. His latest concerto — a lush and cinematic work in three movements — pairs the cello and the pipa, which dates back more than 2,000 years. (Compare that with the relatively young cello, created around the 16th century.) In an interview this week, Mr. Ma and Ms. Wu discussed the piece’s meaning, and what their instruments sound like together. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation. How would you describe the character of this concerto? YO-YO MA Zhao Lin comes from a very literary and artistic family. He has a sense of old and new, and really knows poetic traditions. In the second movement, Wu Man plays this theme — it’s a melody that goes back to around the year 700 A.D. But he picked that and said, “I’m going to actually do something with this movement that shows something from that era,” the Tang dynasty. WU MAN In the Tang dynasty, music is very different from modern Chinese music. MA Zhao Lin also comes from Xi’an, which around the Tang dynasty had easily a population of over a million people. They had mosques, Buddhist temples and Christian churches. It was really open; they called it one of the golden ages. It was such a rich and open and multicultural society. So there is a kind of beauty to that movement, going back to this golden period. The title, “A Happy Excursion,” is a little misleading. What do you mean? WU In Chinese, everyone understands it. A better translation is that you’re more a kind of scholar. It’s the ideal life. With imagination, you can go everywhere you want to go. MA You can go everywhere. And he takes us through time travel. The first movement is all about the beginning of things, different forces that come together and become China. We have that second movement, the golden period. And then we have the last movement, the present. It’s in seven — it’s a very contemporary rhythmic sound — but it has elements of the golden period in it. So the question is, how are we, in our present moment, going to evolve ourselves? [Plan ahead with The New York Times’s Culture Calendar.] The timbres of your two instruments are so different. Does that pose a challenge? WU I still remember the first time we played together. In the first rehearsal, I felt really bad and awkward because I didn’t know how I could play with the cello. They do sound different. We changed how we produce sound on the instrument. [Speaking to Mr. Ma] You changed your bowing. But over 20 years we kind of got used to it, so the combination of pipa and cello is not strange to us anymore. The pipa has a history as a court and solo instrument. But they can be produced for a bigger hall now, with steel strings instead of silk. We also use amplification. MA Can I say something about Wu Man? Whether it’s science, journalism or anything, you want people to take the profession further, setting the tone for what’s desirable and what can advance. Today, the pipa and Wu Man are kind of synonymous, and the instrument is normal. But it’s because in 29 years she’s gone from something that’s exotic to absolutely accepted. She plays in cafes, stadiums, concert halls, museums. She’s commissioned everybody: Lou Harrison, Philip Glass, Zhao Lin. The repertory was very small, but she has expanded it by several hundred thousand percent. What does it mean that this piece — and this instrument — is represented onstage with the New York Philharmonic? MA What I love about New York is that it’s a world city. Depending on whom you ask, either that’s a terrible thing or it’s the most normal thing. You look at the New York Phil, and look at the number of Asians — what we need, actually, is much more African-American and Latin-American representation, because those are our two largest minorities. I don’t think either Wu Man or I feel odd being what we are. It feels normal to us. I’m not proud; I’m just glad. WU It’s music. Enjoy it.",The New York Times
2019,Yoga for Incontinence? Evidence Is Lacking,"Yoga exercises are often recommended to help control urinary incontinence in women, but there is no solid scientific evidence that they work. Yoga exercises are often recommended to help control urinary incontinence in women, but there is no solid scientific evidence to show yoga works. Incontinence affects up to 15 percent of middle-aged and older women, and although there are medications and surgeries to treat it, the first approach is usually bladder training and exercise. Some find an appealing treatment in the relaxation, bodily postures and breath control of yoga. An analysis published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews found only two studies testing yoga as an incontinence treatment. The first, a six-week experiment, divided 18 women into two groups, one doing yoga and the other put on a waiting list. The study did not report the number of women who were cured of incontinence, and the differences between the two groups in reducing the number of incontinence episodes was insignificant. The second included 30 women, half doing mindfulness-based stress reduction exercises and the rest taking yoga classes as a control. The number of women cured was not reported, the study was not blinded, many dropped out and the quality of the evidence reported was poor. “Some think yoga is helpful, but we just don’t know yet,” said the lead author, Susan Wieland, an assistant professor at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. “I hope that this review will point to the fact that we need more evidence, and that there will be further trials.”",The New York Times
2019,You Deserve More Succulent Chicken,"City Kitchen There’s no secret to tender chicken breasts, worthy of raves. There’s just one rule: Don’t overcook it. Ah, the ever-troublesome chicken breast. Many shun it for being dry, tasteless and boring. Others choose the breast (preferably without skin or bone) and disdain the darker meat of the leg and thigh. To be truthful, I’m in the dark meat camp for the most part, but I also welcome properly cooked, flavorful white meat on my plate. And therein lies the problem: A chicken breast like that is hard to come by. Overcooked chicken breast has become standard fare. In restaurants, a certain type of diner chooses a plain chicken breast as the option least likely to offend or raise dietary fears. With no fat, no sauce and very little, if any, seasoning, the chicken breast supplies a guilt-free, bland protein; adding a few slices to a dressing-on-the-side salad feels virtuous. It doesn’t have to be that way! I’m here to proclaim that it’s possible — and not difficult — to produce a tender chicken breast that gets raves. I do it all the time, and friends always ask for the secret. There’s no secret, but there is one rule: Don’t overcook it. One way to achieve the ideal chicken breast is to make it the same thickness end-to-end (in its natural state, it is tapered). To do so, you can pound the breast into a paillard, which is the French term for a thin slice of meat that can be quickly cooked. Season each paillard on both sides with salt and pepper, and sprinkle with a little chopped thyme. Drizzle on a little olive oil, and let it marinate with a few thyme sprigs and some strips of lemon zest. Pounded so thin (I prefer a 3/8- to 1/2-inch thickness), the paillards will take just a few minutes on the stovetop to cook, followed by a few minutes in the oven. Letting the cooked meat rest for five minutes ensures that the breasts will be fully done, but not dry. For a simple but attractive plate, place some lightly dressed arugula leaves near the chicken. Add some shaved Parmesan if you wish. Give the breasts a smear of black olive tapenade (the tapenade is a cinch to make and keeps for weeks in the fridge), and a lemon wedge on the side. This is my chicken paillard, one with flavor, and, most important, succulence.

2019,You Don’t Need to Be Fast to Be a Sponsored Runner,"The democratization of running has deepened the pool of talent considered for sponsorships. Welcome to the Running newsletter! Every Saturday morning, we email runners with news, advice and some motivation to help you get up and running. Sign up here to get it in your inbox. For this week’s Sports section, I wrote about runners who won’t necessarily be winning a major race anytime soon, but are still sponsored by major running brands. I’ve long been interested in how the sponsorship world works. Since I started writing about running in 2010, I’ve watched as the pool of talent considered for those sponsorships has deepened. That’s because running has become more democratized. Instead of it being a sport only for very fit, very fast, skinny white dudes, it’s for almost everyone. Just go to a race, whether it’s your local 5K or a major city marathon, and you’ll see a range of ages, shapes and sizes that are much more representative of what the population actually looks like than if you did the same thing in 1990, or even 2000. That is starting to be reflected in the sponsorship world, and who the brands pay with real money — and not just free swag — so that they can make running their job. That is not to say that running is totally democratized. At the recreational level, it’s still overwhelmingly white. It’s also about that time of year when I’ll start being lectured about how charity runners have ruined the Boston Marathon because they didn’t “really” qualify. And maybe it’s a stretch to expect people to be inspired by running brands using the stories of non-elite runners for marketing purposes. But I bet even skeptics would agree that the efforts of some of the sponsored runners I wrote about are pretty inspiring — for example, Justin Gallegos is lobbying for a change in Paralympic rules to accommodate runners with cerebral palsy and Mina Guli is aiming to run 100 marathons in 100 days to raise awareness of global water issues. So this week I want to know: Who inspires you? I’m still spending my weekends not running because of an injury, so I have a little extra time on Twitter @byjenamiller. I’ll start by sharing mine, along with a bit of news. I’ve mentioned Mary Miller, my mother, around here before. She was always a good athlete, but her high school didn’t allow girls to be on the track team and she didn’t get into running until 2013. She has since done everything from 5Ks to a half marathon — and triathlons, too. We both entered the drawing to run the New York City Marathon, and we both got in. As long as our health holds up and neither one of us gets hurt, we’ll be running it together, side by side, on Nov. 3. That’s my inspiration.

2019,You Never Know When a Recession Will Sneak Up on You,"Economic View President Trump’s new budget calls for less spending on Medicare and food stamps and more on defense and on a wall on the southern border. Democrats condemned the proposal, and the dispute raises the prospect of another government shutdown this year. That might seem to be a dicey proposition for the economy, but the administration doesn’t seem worried about a slowdown any time soon. The president has described the current moment as “the greatest economy in the history of our country,” and the official forecast is rosy: around 3 percent growth in gross domestic product every year for the next decade, and even more in 2019 and 2020. Yet some serious people remain nervous. Job growth last month came in wildly below expectations. G.D.P. growth, which hit an annualized rate in excess of 4 percent in the second quarter of last year, has been fading ever since. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s GDPNow forecast suggests that the current quarter’s annual growth rate might even be below 1 percent. Faced with data like this, the Federal Reserve has backed off from its plan to aggressively raise interest rates and shrink its balance sheet. It is worth asking: If a trade war with China or another government shutdown remains possible, are we one wrong turn away from a recession? The Trump administration says these potential problems just aren’t big enough to derail a $20 trillion economy. But the last several decades of American economic history provide a sobering reminder that recessions don’t come only from large, foreseeable events. Modest, unpredictable incidents can cause economic downturns if they lead businesses or consumers to freak out. And trade wars and government shutdowns have caused some glaring panics in the past. Still, it is easy to understand the administration’s perspective. First, officials remain confident that they can strike a deal that will avert a major trade war entirely. Second, even if there is a trade war, it might not damage the United States that much. After all, exports account for only 12 percent of the nation’s economy, while China is less than a tenth of that. Those numbers imply that even a full-blown trade war that cut commerce between the United States and China in half would have a direct impact of less than 1 percent of G.D.P. The same basic math can be applied to government shutdowns. The administration estimated that the last one, which ended in January, cut only about 0.1 percentage point from the annualized economic growth rate per week. The 800,000 affected federal workers were fewer than one half of 1 percent of the nation’s total work force, so even when government contractors are added, the shutdown affected just a sliver of the country’s G.D.P. No worries there. But that analysis is far too simple. Seemingly small events can cause enormous problems. Think back to 2001 and the last recession of a “normal” size. (The recession that started in December 2007 was, by far, the deepest and longest since the Great Depression — about as far from normal as a recession can be.) The 2001 recession developed when the internet bubble popped, or at least that’s how we tend to remember it. But go back and check the numbers. The internet accounted for, at most, about 2 percent of the economy then. If we use the logic we’ve been applying to trade wars and government shutdowns, it would seem that popping the internet bubble shouldn’t have been enough to cause a recession. But it did. The reason it did was that the pop freaked out people outside just the internet sector. Consumer confidence plunged, and businesses stopped investing. The recession spread far beyond its origin. In this sense, virtually every recession in the last 40 years coincided with a signal of fear, like a significant drop in consumer confidence. Sometimes confidence fell and didn’t spiral into recession, but all recessions have started with a confidence spiral. The very biggest drops in confidence in the last 40 years came from major events like the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 and the popping of the internet bubble, which led to recessions, but close on their heels were episodes of government dysfunction, which did not necessarily culminate in recessions. These include the debt ceiling crisis of 2011 and the government shutdown of 2013. The most recent shutdown seems no different in this respect. In the last survey before the government reopened, consumer confidence fell the most it had in almost three years, and confidence among chief executives dropped to the lowest level in seven years. The shutdown doesn’t seem to have caused a recession, but it would be unwise to celebrate. Another government shutdown could spiral into something far more damaging than the small decline in workers’ share of the economy that the simple math suggests. An escalating trade war with China could ignite a recession, even if the numbers show that trade isn’t a large share of the United States economy. These events just need to spook consumers or businesses into putting off spending, and then more dire consequences can start to snowball. So let us all hope for excellent jobs numbers in the months to come, along with a rebound of G.D.P. growth. That may well happen, but it would be a mistake to be overconfident and assume that the economy will automatically weather a major policy blunder. If something scares people enough, it can start a recession, and you probably won’t know until it’s too late. That’s because recessions are hard to recognize at the start. Looking back, for example, we know that a recession officially began in April 2001, yet scarcely anyone understood that then. In June 2001, only 7 percent of economists in the monthly Blue Chip survey believed a recession was underway. In the months before that 2001 recession began, only 16 percent of economists expected that a recession would start within the next year. Now, 25 percent of economists in a Wall Street Journal survey say they expect a recession within the next year, and anxiety seems to be growing. The great pitcher Satchel Paige once advised: “Don’t look back. Something might be gaining on you.” Had he been an economist, he might have added, “And don’t start a trade war, either.”",The New York Times
2019,YouTube’s Product Chief on Online Radicalization and Algorithmic Rabbit Holes,"Neal Mohan discusses the streaming site’s recommendation engine, which has become a growing liability amid accusations that it steers users to increasingly extreme content. It’s been called “one of the most powerful radicalizing instruments of the 21st century,” “a petri dish of divisive, conspiratorial and sometimes hateful content,” and a tool that “drives people to the internet’s darkest corners.” I’m talking, of course, about YouTube — and, specifically, the recommendation algorithm that determines which videos the site plays after the one you’re watching. That algorithm is YouTube’s beating heart, keeping users hooked to the platform for hours on end. (The company has said recommendations are responsible for about 70 percent of the total time users spend on the site.) The recommendation engine is also a growing liability for YouTube, which has been accused of steering users toward increasingly extreme content. After the recent mass shooting in Christchurch, New Zealand — the work of a gunman who showed signs of having been radicalized online — critics asked whether YouTube and other platforms were not just allowing hateful and violent content to exist but actively promoting it to their users. YouTube’s biggest competitor, Facebook, said last week that it would ban white nationalism and white separatism on its platforms. I recently spoke with Neal Mohan, YouTube’s chief product officer, about criticism of the company’s algorithms and what it is doing to address radicalization and violent extremism on the platform. We spoke about the things YouTube has already done to rein in extreme content — hiring additional reviewers, introducing a “breaking news shelf” that kicks in after major news events, altering the recommendation algorithm to reduce the distribution of conspiracy theories and other “borderline content” — and about the company’s plans for the future. The conversation was edited for length and clarity. I’m wondering what you think about the conversation happening around radicalization on YouTube. I think some of it has to do with the fact that, as you know and as you’ve written about, YouTube was started as, and remains, an open platform for content and voices and opinions and thoughts. Many of them being, you know, really across the entire spectrum, many of which you or I or others may or may not agree with. I wouldn’t be at YouTube, working on what I work on, if I didn’t believe in the power of diversity of voices and opinions. Having said that, we do take this notion of dissemination of harmful misinformation, hate-filled content, content that in some cases is inciting violence, extremely seriously. I hear a lot about the “rabbit hole” effect, where you start watching one video and you get nudged with recommendations toward a slightly more sort of extreme video, and so on, and all of a sudden you’re watching something really extreme. Is that a real phenomenon? Yeah, so I’ve heard this before, and I think that there are some myths that go into that description that I think it would be useful for me to debunk. The first is this notion that it’s somehow in our interests for the recommendations to shift people in this direction because it boosts watch time or what have you. I can say categorically that’s not the way that our recommendation systems are designed. Watch time is one signal that they use, but they use a number of other engagement and satisfaction signals from the user. It is not the case that “extreme” content drives a higher version of engagement or watch time than content of other types. I can also say that it’s not in our business interest to promote any of this sort of content. It’s not something that has a disproportionate effect in terms of watch time. Just as importantly, the watch time that it does generate doesn’t monetize, because advertisers many times don’t want to be associated with this sort of content. And so the idea that it has anything to do with our business interests, I think it’s just purely a myth. So, why do people talk about this rabbit hole effect — you know, I went to watch one video about President Trump and now I’m just getting a stream of recommendations of increasingly more partisan content. Why do you think there’s this perception that this is what happens on YouTube? This is one of the things that we looked at closely as we were developing the technology that went into that recommendation change that I described to you from a few weeks back. We really looked at this to see what was happening on those “watch next” panels, in terms of the videos that were being recommended. And the first thing that I should say is that when we make recommendations after a video has been consumed, we don’t take into account any notion of whether that’s less or more extreme. So when we looked at the data, we saw that a lot of the videos that were being recommended, as you would expect, had to do with the context of the video that was being consumed. That’s obviously no surprise, but the videos that you saw on the panel, there were videos that you might consider to be maybe a little bit more extreme than what you had just consumed. But you’ll also see videos that were less extreme, or that you could call more toward the quote-unquote mainstream. It’s equally — depending on a user’s behavior — likely that you could have started on a more extreme video and actually moved in the other direction. That’s what our research showed when we were looking at this more closely. Now, that doesn’t mean that we don’t want to address what we talked about, which is just — Sorry, can I just interrupt you there for a second? Just let me be clear: You’re saying that there is no rabbit hole effect on YouTube? What I’m saying is that when a video is watched, you will see a number of videos that are then recommended. Some of those videos might have the perception of skewing in one direction or, you know, call it more extreme. There are other videos that skew in the opposite direction. And again, our systems are not doing this, because that’s not a signal that feeds into the recommendations. That’s just the observation that you see in the panel. I’m not saying that a user couldn’t click on one of those videos that are quote-unquote more extreme, consume that and then get another set of recommendations and sort of keep moving in one path or the other. All I’m saying is that it’s not inevitable. In the case of breaking news, you guys made a decision that showing authoritative information to people who were looking for it was important enough to radically shift the way recommendations and search results work, by moving to an approved or “authoritative sources” model rather than using the regular recommendation algorithm. Why not do that for everything? Let me say a few things about that. The first is that using a combination of those tools of authoritative content and promoting authoritative content is something that can apply to other information verticals, not just breaking news. Having said that, as you continue to broaden the application of something like that, it’s quite a blunt hammer. And so it does come with trade-offs. For example, how do you define something authoritative across the broad swath of YouTube when many of the use cases, as you know, are outside of the information-seeking realm? They’re entertainment, they’re oftentimes driven by people’s personal tastes, like music and comedy and the like. Right, but you could do it just for politics, hypothetically, and say that for any political video, we’re going to move to this “authoritative sources” model. I think that even when you go to something that broad, it comes with real trade-offs. And I’m just raising the fact that there are considerations there, which is that you are then limiting political discourse to a set of preordained voices and outlets and publications. And I think that especially when it comes to something as charged and societally impactful as politics, there needs to be room for new voices to be heard. Since the New Zealand shooting, we’ve heard this question about “Well, the platforms worked together to take down ISIS content. Why haven’t they done the same for white supremacy or violent right-wing extremism?” What’s the answer there? The first thing that I would say, just as a matter of fact, is that there were two sets of challenges when it came to the New Zealand shooting. One was everything that we just talked about in terms of surfacing authoritative, high-quality information — not showing, you know, conspiracies or harmful misinformation. That was one bucket. The other bucket had to do with the velocity at which re-uploads were coming to these various platforms, and that is an area where we collaborated. We worked closely with other platforms in terms of making sure we had fingerprints of these videos, just like they did, and we shared those. The other thing I would say, just more generally, in the case of violent extremism and limiting those videos on the platform, the reason it’s different than what we’re talking about here is that those [ISIS] videos took on a particular form. They were often designed for propaganda purposes and recruitment purposes. So they had things like branding and logos, both visually and in terms of the music they might use. Those formed a set of finite clues we could use to bring that content down. And, of course, we collaborated with other platforms to do that. In the case of something like this, the challenges are harder because the line, as you can imagine, is sometimes blurry between what clearly might be hate speech versus what might be political speech that we might find distasteful and disagree with, but nonetheless is coming from, you know, candidates that are in elections and the like. So much of what YouTube has become over the years is this kind of alternative form of media. People don’t go to YouTube because they want the same stuff they would see on TV. They go because they’ve built relationships with creators that they trust, and when Logan Paul puts out a flat-earth documentary or Shane Dawson questions whether 9/11 happened, there’s a sense that YouTube is the place where these “real” explanations are being offered, and maybe that makes this all very hard to undo. There’s nearly two billion people that come to our platform every month. Every one of them is coming for some unique reason, whether it’s the latest and greatest music video or a YouTube original, or their favorite creators. I think when people come to YouTube looking for information, it has resulted in a shift in the way that we think about the responsibility of our platform. As a result of that shift, our product teams here are thinking of all of these solutions, many of which we’ve talked about here, as a means of addressing that responsibility for making sure that when users are looking for information, YouTube is putting its best foot forward in terms of serving that information to them. But YouTube is also still keeping users in power, in terms of their intent and the information that they’re looking for. It’s an ongoing effort. I think we’ve made great strides here. But clearly there’s more work to be done.",The New York Times
2019,"Young Adulthood in America: Children Are Grown, but Parenting Doesn’t Stop","Dad shows up at your job interview. Mom makes your medical appointments. A recent college bribery scandal is an extreme example of a broader pattern. Bribing SAT proctors. Fabricating students’ athletic credentials. Paying off college officials. The actions that some wealthy parents were charged with Tuesday — to secure their children a spot at elite colleges — are illegal and scandalous. But they’re part of a broader pattern, albeit on the extreme end of the continuum: parents’ willingness to do anything it takes to help their grown children succeed. As college has become more competitive and young adults’ economic prospects less assured, parents have begun spending much more time and money on their children — including well after they turn 18. Modern parenting typically remains hands-on, and gets more expensive, when children become young adults, according to a new survey by Morning Consult for The New York Times. A significant share of parents, across income levels, say they’re involved in their adult children’s daily lives. That includes making doctor’s appointments, reminding them of school and other deadlines, and offering advice on romantic life, found the survey, which was of a nationally representative sample of 1,508 people ages 18 to 28 and 1,136 parents of people that age. More than half of parents give their adult children some form of monthly financial assistance. Colleges now routinely have offices of parent relations. Companies including LinkedIn, Amazon and Google have hosted bring-your-parents-to-work days. Parents have applied to jobs on behalf of their children; lobbied their employers for a raise; and attended job interviews with them. They have called their children’s roommates to resolve disagreements or to check on their children’s whereabouts. For certain members of the superrich, the tactics have been extraordinary — nobody would equate accusations of bribery with helping a college-aged child with homework or a job application. The factors driving most parents, researchers say, are widening inequality, the growing importance of a college degree, and the fact that for the first time, children of this generation are as likely as not to be less prosperous than their parents. “It’s the same thing but on a much different level,” said Laura Hamilton, author of “Parenting to a Degree: How Family Matters for College and Beyond” and a sociologist at the University of California, Merced. “It’s really hard for parents to understand why you wouldn’t do anything you could do to assist your children. If you have the influence, the connections and the money, it’s not surprising to me that the parents made these choices.” Even more typical parental involvement can backfire, many experts say, by leaving young adults ill-prepared for independent adult life, and unable to succeed at the schools and jobs their parents helped them get to. “When one is hand-held through life, they don’t develop a sense of self-efficacy and life skills,” said Julie Lythcott-Haims, the author of “How to Raise an Adult: Break Free of the Overparenting Trap and Prepare Your Kid for Success” and a former dean of freshmen at Stanford. “This sense among parents that I’ve got to get my kid to the right future is overlooking the fact that your kid has to get themselves there.” It’s a continuation of the kind of intensive parenting that has become the norm in the United States. Today’s parents, especially mothers, are spending more time and money on their children than any previous generation — on things like lessons, tutors and test prep. Many parents’ anxiety only intensifies after 18, when children start the education and jobs they’ve been preparing for. “Professional helicopter parents are really focused on using education to get their children into a professional career,” Ms. Hamilton said. “Their goal is basically to prevent their children from ever making a mistake.” This kind of behavior is most prevalent among privileged parents, those with collegiate experience and wealth. In places with the biggest gaps between the rich and the poor, rich parents spend an even larger share of their incomes on their children, a recent paper found. The bribery scandal shows how far some parents will go — in one example, parents were accused of paying $1.2 million to help get their child into an Ivy League college. More commonly, financial help comes in the form of tuition or rent payments. Parents used to spend the most money on their children during high school, according to Consumer Expenditure Survey data analyzed by the sociologists Sabino Kornrich and Frank Furstenberg. But now they spend the most before age 6 and after age 18 and into children’s 20s. The increases in later years are because so many more children are going to college, which has become much more expensive, Mr. Kornrich said. Also, about a third of children this age still live at home. In the new survey by Morning Consult and The Times, about two-thirds of those who lived with their parents said it was because they could not afford to live on their own or were still in school. One in three parents said they gave their 18-and-over children $100 or more a month, and 44 percent of those with children in college made tuition or loan payments for them. When asked at what age people should be financially independent from their parents, the largest share of young people said 25 to 28. Recent research shows that even parents who can’t afford to give their grown children money increasingly provide them with significant support of other kinds. In the survey, wealthier parents were more likely to report giving their children money than less affluent ones were, but many nonfinancial measures of parental support remained consistent across income and education levels. For example, three-quarters of parents with children ages 18 to 28 said they had reminded their children of school and other deadlines they needed to meet — whether the parents reported a low or high income. Four in ten parents, across income and education levels, said they offered romantic advice to their children. Parents gave their children less money, professional advice and job application help as they got older. Romantic advice, however, did not taper off. Parents reported a more engaged relationship with their grown children than they once had with their own parents. They said they spent more time with their children, communicated with them more often and gave more advice than their parents had when they were the same age. Eight in ten said they were “always” or “often” in text message communication with their adult children. This period of life has become so established that researchers have given it a name: emerging adulthood. In some ways, it has become harder to be an adult. Wages have stagnated, while the cost of college, homes, health care and child care have climbed. This generation has record student loan debt and low homeownership rates. “There’s no room for risk,” Ms. Hamilton said. “It’s not like in 1970 when you could screw around a little because every extra year of college didn’t cost you an arm and a leg and not graduating wasn’t incredibly risky.” Cultural changes play a role, too. White, native-born American families previously had an expectation that adult children should separate from their families, said Karen Fingerman, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin who studies the relationships between young adults and their parents. But that’s changing as families are remaining closer throughout their lives, with more intergenerational support. Technology has made it possible for parents and grown children to stay in constant contact. Young people are marrying less and later, and parents are having fewer children, so they have more attention and money to devote to each one. There are many benefits to parents’ increased involvement in their grown children’s lives. Ideally, she said, the relationship goes both ways, with adult children providing support and assistance to their parents, too. About a quarter of people 25 to 28 who lived at home said it was because their parents needed help. “There’s more mutual companionship,” Ms. Fingerman said. “This is the most important relationship in their lives on both ends.” But experts say there’s a line between supporting young adults and stifling their growth. Ms. Lythcott-Haims compares it to teaching children to drive — the parent starts in the driver’s seat, but the goal is to end up in the back seat. “You can’t just arrive them at the future you want for them,” she said. “They have to do the work to build the skills.” Research has shown that children of hyper-involved parents are often more successful at navigating college and finding good jobs — but that they are less self-reliant and more likely to face anxiety or depression.",The New York Times
2019,Your Ancestors Were Slaves. Who Owns the Photos of Them?,"The haunting daguerreotypes of seven enslaved men and women taken in South Carolina in 1850 have long been an awkward matter at Harvard. Made in a portrait studio at the request of Louis Agassiz, a renowned Harvard biologist out to prove the inferiority of people of African descent, the images have been the subject of scholarly exposes and intellectual property skirmishes since they resurfaced in 1976 in the attic of the university’s anthropology museum. Now they are the subject of a lawsuit brought by a Connecticut woman who says she is a descendant of two of the enslaved people in the photographs, and wants what she sees as stolen family property back. The lawsuit involves charges of profiteering and exploitation, calling the images “spoils of theft” and Harvard’s “dominion” over them itself the equivalent of slavery. But to scholars, it also raises broader moral questions. Who owns African-American history: the generally white-dominated institutions that house many of its traces, or the descendants of the enslaved? And who, if anyone, should control — and profit from — it? [A family sues Harvard over the rights to slave photos.] The lawsuit, which demands that Harvard relinquish the daguerreotypes and pay unspecified punitive and emotional damages, faces an uphill battle. Kevin Mattei, a lawyer on Long Island who represents auction houses, said that “slavery was a travesty, but the law is crystal clear.” “The person who hits the shutter button and takes the photograph is the one who owns the copyright on the image,” Mr. Mattei said. “That’s 100 percent the law, and it’s been the law forever.” As for the question of who owns the physical daguerreotypes, Mr. Mattei said that the only way the plaintiff could claim ownership is by proving that the photographer had given them to the enslaved people who sat for them, Renty and Delia, rather than to Agassiz. But to some scholars of slavery, legal arguments are not really the point. The lawsuit, they say, needs to be understood not just in the context of law, but in the broader history of African-American dispossession. “The only thing enslaved people owned was their souls,” said Daina Ramey Berry, a historian at the University of Texas and the author of “The Price for Their Pound of Flesh,” a study of the monetary value of enslaved people’s bodies through their life cycle, including after death, when their corpses were sometimes sold. “They might be traded, gifted, deeded, sold or mortgaged,” Dr. Berry said. “But you could not touch their souls.” Barbara Krauthamer, the co-author of “Envisioning Emancipation,” a 2013 photographic history of the transition from enslavement to freedom that begins with reproductions of the portraits of Renty and Delia, said she was conflicted about the lawsuit. “The scholar in me wants to make sure history is preserved so we can teach it and share it,” Dr. Krauthamer said. “At the same time, I understand feeling like your family history has been torn away from you. That’s the legacy of the African-American experience. Your personal history is owned by someone else.” American archives are full of material relating to enslaved people, which has become increasingly important as more scholars focus on the perspective of the enslaved, not the enslavers. Even records made by whites for racist purposes, like the Agassiz photos or advertisements offering bounties for runaway slaves, can be mined for clues to how the enslaved thought of themselves. Some of the material held by institutions was created or collected with the permission of the enslaved, but most was not. “We cannot go back and change the circumstances under which all of this data was gathered,” Martha A. Sandweiss, a historian at Princeton who has written both about 19th-century photography and about universities’ entanglements with slavery, said in an email. “But we can work to ensure that the story of how this information was collected becomes a part of our archives too.” Photographs, like the famous 1863 image of the lash-scarred back of an enslaved man named Gordon that was widely circulated by antislavery activists, may provide some of the most haunting documentation of slavery. They are also rare. Early photography equipment was cumbersome, and portraits usually required a visit to a studio. Slaveholders also had little reason to want to photograph the people they enslaved. But photographs of enslaved people may not be quite as rare as previously thought. Dr. Krauthamer, the dean of the graduate school at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, said that when she began researching “Envisioning Emancipation,” she was surprised by how many previously unknown images emerged from archives and private collections. She was also surprised by how many collectors, particularly white collectors, contacted her and her co-author, Deborah Willis, about photographs they owned, but did not want reproduced or even described. “That felt very awkward,” Dr. Krauthamer said. “They were basically saying, ‘I want to show you this photo of a black person I own, but I don’t want you to tell anyone I own it.’” Harvard’s policies over the Agassiz images, which show their subjects stripped to the waist, seem to have evolved in response to shifting sensitivities. After they surfaced, they were shown at a number of art museums, including the Amon Carter Museum of Art in Fort Worth and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Since 2002, the original daguerreotypes have not been lent out. But Renty’s image did appear on the cover of a pamphlet for a 2017 conference at Harvard about universities and slavery, where the plaintiff, Tamara Lanier, says she was offended to see it also projected on a giant screen. And in recent years, Harvard has quietly abandoned the copyright claims on the Agassiz images that it used to aggressively enforce. In 1996, the university threatened legal action against the African-American artist Carrie Mae Weems, who had used them in a series exploring the dehumanization of the sitters. (Harvard ultimately agreed to accept a fee for each work sold, which it used to buy part of the series for its art museum.) Molly Rogers, the author of “Delia’s Tears,” a 2010 book about the making of the photographs, said via email that she got permission to reproduce them only after a long process that involved submitting a sample chapter. And in 2012, Harvard denied curators of a Swiss exhibition about Agassiz and racism permission to reproduce the photographs, citing their “sensitive” nature. Today, however, Harvard asserts no copyright, and charges only a $15 fee for a high-resolution scan, which it provides for “academic, documentary film and museum exhibition purposes,” according to Rachael Dane, a spokeswoman for Harvard. The Agassiz daguerreotypes “are all in the public domain,” Ms. Dane said. (The university has declined to comment on the lawsuit.) While the images may now be freely available, scholars wrestle with the ethics of using them. In her recent book “In the Wake,” a study of visual and literary representations of blackness, the scholar Christina Sharpe reproduces only a thin band of the portraits of Delia and another enslaved woman, Drana, showing just their eyes. Dr. Berry said that she thought the daguerreotypes taken for Agassiz belonged in an archive. But if the conversation is limited to questions of ownership, she said, “we’re missing the point, which is how the enslaved thought about their enslavement.” If Renty, Delia and the other people photographed for Agassiz had been given a say, Dr. Berry said, “what would they have wanted?” To her, the answer is obvious. “They would have covered up and not taken those pictures,” she said. “If you look at their eyes, they look totally humiliated.” An earlier version of this article described incorrectly the daguerreotype technology around 1850. Exposure times did not require that subjects sit still for as much as an hour.",The New York Times

2019,Opinion | Your Dog Feels as Guilty as She Looks,"Animals are no less emotional than we are. Dr. de Waal is a primatologist who studies chimps and their relations. Uniquely human emotions don’t exist. More and more, I believe that we share all emotions with other species in the same way that we share virtually every organ in our bodies with them. No exceptions. Like organs, the emotions evolved over millions of years to serve essential functions. Their usefulness has been tested again and again, giving them the wisdom of ages. They nudge us to do what is best for us. Some emotions may be more developed in humans, or apply to a wider range of circumstances, but none is fundamentally new. This is not the prevailing view in science, though. The most popular theory proposes only six “primary” or “basic” emotions, which are universally recognized by their facial expressions, like anger (frowning stare), happiness (laugh and smile), and fear (eyes wide open, lips stretched horizontally). All other emotions are “secondary,” which means that they are cultural constructs that make us human. But does anyone truly believe that just because an emotion lacks a specific face, we can claim it for ourselves? Open your front door and tell your dog that you are going out for a walk, then close the door and return to your seat. Your dog, who had been barking and wriggling with excitement, now slinks back to his basket and puts his head down on his paws. You have just witnessed both hope and disappointment in another species, even though neither counts as a basic emotion. You may say that it is impossible to know what a dog feels. True, yet his behavior clearly reflects an abrupt change in his emotional state. Expressed in the body, these states are perfectly observable and measurable even if the associated private experiences are not. In fact, the possibility of animal hope was experimented upon nearly a century ago by the psychologist Otto Tinklepaugh. He first let a monkey watch a banana being hidden under a cup, then allowed her into the room where this had been done. If she found the banana, everything proceeded smoothly. But if the experimenter had surreptitiously replaced the banana with a piece of lettuce, the monkey would frantically look around, lifting up the cup, while shrieking at the experimenter. Her expectations had been violated, for which she rightly blamed the sneaky experimenter. We share so many so-called secondary emotions with other species that the whole concept is questionable. There is one exception, though, which keeps being proposed as definitely cultural: guilt. This is despite the many dog owners who seem to recognize it in their pets when they hide under the table after a transgression. One expert in animal cognition at Barnard, Alexandra Horowitz, tested this out by having dogs meet an angry owner both when they had not broken any rules and when they had; she also had them meet a relaxed owner in the same two situations. Dr. Horowitz concluded that whether dogs take on a guilty look — lowered gaze, ears pressed back, tail rapidly beating between the legs — is unrelated to whether or not they followed orders. If the owner scolds them, they look extremely guilty. If the owner doesn’t, they still sometimes look like this, but less often. One problem, however, is that our rules are of our own making, such as “Don’t jump on that couch!” or “Keep your nails off my leather chair!” It must be as tough for our pets to grasp these prohibitions as it was for me to understand why I couldn’t chew gum in Singapore. It would be better to test behavior that is wrong by almost any standard, including that of their own species. The Austrian ethologist Konrad Lorenz gave one of my favorite examples, about his dog, Bully, who broke the fundamental rule never to bite your superior. Humans don’t need to teach this rule, and indeed Bully had never been punished for it. The dog bit his master’s hand when Dr. Lorenz tried to break up a dogfight. Even though Dr. Lorenz petted him right away, Bully suffered a complete nervous breakdown. For days, he was virtually paralyzed and ignored his food. He would lie on the rug breathing shallowly, occasionally interrupted by a deep sigh. He had violated a natural taboo, which among ancestral canines could have had the worst imaginable consequences, such as expulsion from the pack. Among the primates, the most suggestive cases of remorse concern bonobos. These apes are as close to us as chimpanzees, but far more peaceful and gentle, which means that they almost never hurt one another. Whereas in most primates reconciliation after a fight is typically sought by the subordinate party, in bonobos it is the dominant animal that seeks to make amends, especially if he has inflicted an injury. He may return to his victim and unerringly reach for the exact same toe that he has bitten and carefully inspect the damage. He obviously knows precisely what he has done and where. Then he spends half an hour or more licking and cleaning the wound that he himself inflicted. Another human emotion that has been elevated to a special status is disgust. In his book “Human: The Science Behind What Makes Us Unique,” the neuroscientist Michael Gazzaniga views disgust as one of the five emotional modules that set us apart from all other animals. Here, too, dogs are a prime example, given that they eat feces and lick their testicles. This is taken as proof that dogs must lack disgust. But give your dog a cut lemon (not recommended) and you will see a full-blown yuck! response with curled-up lips, drooling and withdrawal from the sour smell. Disgust is an incredibly adaptive response. Every organism needs to avoid parasites and prevent the ingestion of harmful foods (citrus fruits can be poisonous to canines). Ignoring this mundane origin, however, psychologists have fallen in love with the moral connotations of this emotion. We are disgusted, for example, by someone who fakes a racist attack on himself to gain positive media attention. We “turn up our noses” at such people, showing our typical disgust face with wrinkled nose and narrowed eyes. But even if moral disgust is special, it is no accident that our facial expression also blocks wafts of foul air from getting into our eyes and nostrils. This hints at the emotion’s origin. Chimpanzees show the same expression when it rains, something they hate. As soon as a downpour starts, young and old pull an ugly face known as the “rain face,” in which they bring their upper lip close to their nose and stick out their lower lip. Having grown up in the Netherlands, I know this expression firsthand from watching the throngs of cyclists in Dutch cities. Whenever it pours, they show rain faces inside their plastic ponchos, evidence of their dismay over the prospect of wet clothes for the rest of the day. Disgust is in fact so predictable in apes that an adolescent chimp I saw regularly at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center, in Georgia, turned it into a game. The chimp, Tara, would occasionally find a dead rat in the outdoor enclosure and carry it around by its tail, careful to keep it away from her own body, then stealthily lay it on the back or head of a sleeping group mate. Her victim would startle as soon as she felt (or smelled) the dead animal, loudly screaming and wildly shaking her body to get this foul thing off her. She might even rub the spot on her body with a fistful of grass, to make sure the smell was gone. Tara, for her part, would simply pick up the rat and move on to her next target. Apart from the question of why she considered this game fun, and why we humans immediately see its humor value, it would obviously never have worked in a species that lacked disgust. But that is not all. We also have experimental studies, such as those by the primatologists Cécile Sarabian and Andrew MacIntosh at Kyoto University, who explore the yuck! factor in wild macaques on a Japanese beach. They place small food items, like grains or peanuts, on top of a variety of objects. Some of these objects are piles of plastic made to look like feces; some are actual piles of fresh feces. Most of the monkeys are disgusted enough by the latter to forgo the food. And if they do pick up food from the feces, they frantically rub their hands afterward. Tested in the same way, bonobos refuse to touch banana slices contaminated by feces. Given how much apes love bananas, this attests to their deep revulsion. For the longest time, science has depicted animals as stimulus-response machines while declaring their inner lives barren. This has helped us sustain our customary “anthropodenial”: the denial that we are animals. We like to see ourselves as special, but whatever the difference between humans and animals may be, it is unlikely to be found in the emotional domain. Frans de Waal, a primatologist and professor of psychology at Emory University, is the author, most recently, of “Mama’s Last Hug: Animal Emotions and What They Tell Us About Ourselves,” from which this essay is adapted.

2019,Your Environment Is Cleaner. Your Immune System Has Never Been So Unprepared.,"A century ago, British scientists suggested a link between increased hygiene and allergic conditions — the first hint that our immune systems are becoming improperly “trained.” CreditCreditMike McQuade Excerpted from “An Elegant Defense: The Extraordinary New Science of the Immune System,” published on Tuesday by William Morrow. Should you pick your nose? Don’t laugh. Scientifically, it’s an interesting question. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] Should your children pick their noses? Should your children eat dirt? Maybe: Your body needs to know what immune challenges lurk in the immediate environment. Should you use antibacterial soap or hand sanitizers? No. Are we taking too many antibiotics? Yes. “I tell people, when they drop food on the floor, please pick it up and eat it,” said Dr. Meg Lemon, a dermatologist in Denver who treats people with allergies and autoimmune disorders. “Get rid of the antibacterial soap. Immunize! If a new vaccine comes out, run and get it. I immunized the living hell out of my children. And it’s O.K. if they eat dirt.” Dr. Lemon’s prescription for a better immune system doesn’t end there. “You should not only pick your nose, you should eat it,” she said. She’s referring, with a facetious touch, to the fact our immune system can become disrupted if it doesn’t have regular interactions with the natural world. “Our immune system needs a job,” Dr. Lemon said. “We evolved over millions of years to have our immune systems under constant assault. Now they don’t have anything to do.” She isn’t alone. Leading physicians and immunologists are reconsidering the antiseptic, at times hysterical, ways in which we interact with our environment. Why? Let us turn to 19th-century London. The British Journal of Homeopathy, volume 29, published in 1872, included a startlingly prescient observation: “Hay fever is said to be an aristocratic disease, and there can be no doubt that, if it is not almost wholly confined to the upper classes of society, it is rarely, if ever, met with but among the educated.” Hay fever is a catchall term for seasonal allergies to pollen and other airborne irritants. With this idea that hay fever was an aristocratic disease, British scientists were on to something. More than a century later, in November 1989, another highly influential paper was published on the subject of hay fever. The paper was short, less than two pages, in BMJ, titled “Hay Fever, Hygiene, and Household Size.” The author looked at the prevalence of hay fever among 17,414 children born in March 1958. Of 16 variables the scientist explored, he described as “most striking” an association between the likelihood that a child would get hay fever allergy and the number of his or her siblings. It was an inverse relationship, meaning the more siblings the child had, the less likely it was that he or she would get the allergy. Not just that, but the children least likely to get allergies were ones who had older siblings. The paper hypothesized that “allergic diseases were prevented by infection in early childhood, transmitted by unhygienic contact with older siblings, or acquired prenatally from a mother infected by contact with her older children. “Over the past century declining family size, improvements in household amenities, and higher standards of personal cleanliness have reduced the opportunity for cross infection in young families,” the paper continued. “This may have resulted in more widespread clinical expression of atopic disease, emerging in wealthier people, as seems to have occurred for hay fever.” This is the birth of the hygiene hypothesis. The ideas behind it have since evolved and expanded, but it provides profound insight into a challenge that human beings face in our relationship with the modern world. Our ancestors evolved over millions of years to survive in their environments. For most of human existence, that environment was characterized by extreme challenges, like scarcity of food, or food that could carry disease, as well as unsanitary conditions and unclean water, withering weather, and so on. It was a dangerous environment, a heck of a thing to survive. At the center of our defenses was our immune system, our most elegant defense. The system is the product of centuries of evolution, as a river stone is shaped by water rushing over it and the tumbles it experiences on its journey downstream. Late in the process, humans learned to take steps to bolster our defenses, developing all manner of customs and habits to support our survival. In this way, think of the brain — the organ that helps us develop habits and customs — as another facet of the immune system. We used our collective brains to figure out effective behaviors. We started washing our hands and took care to avoid certain foods that experience showed could be dangerous or deadly. In some cultures, people came to avoid pork, which we now know is highly susceptible to trichinosis; in others, people banned meats, which we later learned may carry toxic loads of E. coli and other bacteria. Ritual washing is mentioned in Exodus, one of the earliest books in the Bible: “So they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they die not.” Our ideas evolved, but for the most part, the immune system did not. This is not to say that it didn’t change. The immune system responds to our environment. When we encounter various threats, our defenses learn and then are much more able to deal with that threat in the future. In that way, we adapt to our environment. We survived over tens of thousands of years. Eventually, we washed our hands, swept our floors, cooked our food, avoided certain foods altogether. We improved the hygiene of the animals we raised and slaughtered for food. Particularly in the wealthier areas of the world, we purified our water, and developed plumbing and waste treatment plants; we isolated and killed bacteria and other germs. The immune system’s enemies list was attenuated, largely for the good. Now, though, our bodies are proving that they cannot keep up with this change. We have created a mismatch between the immune system — one of the longest surviving and most refined balancing acts in the world — and our environment. Thanks to all the powerful learning we’ve done as a species, we have minimized the regular interaction not just with parasites but even with friendly bacteria and parasites that helped to teach and hone the immune system — that “trained” it. It doesn’t encounter as many bugs when we are babies. This is not just because our homes are cleaner, but also because our families are smaller (fewer older children are bringing home the germs), our foods and water cleaner, our milk sterilized. Some refer to the lack of interaction with all kinds of microbes we used to meet in nature as the “old friends mechanism.” What does the immune system do when it’s not properly trained? It can overreact. It becomes aggrieved by things like dust mites or pollen. It develops what we called allergies, chronic immune system attacks — inflammation — in a way that is counterproductive, irritating, even dangerous. The percentage of children in the United States with a food allergy rose 50 percent between 1997–1999 and 2009–2011, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The jump in skin allergies was 69 percent during that period, leaving 12.5 percent of American children with eczema and other irritations. Food and respiratory allergies rose in tandem with income level. More money, which typically correlates with higher education, has meant more risk of allergy. This may reflect differences in who reports such allergies, but it also springs from differences in environment. These trends are seen internationally, too. Skin allergies “doubled or tripled in industrialized countries during the past three decades, affecting 15–30 percent of children and 2–10 percent of adults,” according to a paper citing research from the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. By 2011, one in four children in Europe had an allergy, and the figure was on the rise, according to a report by the World Allergy Organization. Reinforcing the hygiene hypothesis, the paper noted that migration studies have shown that children born overseas have lower levels of some types of both allergy and autoimmunity than migrants whose children are born in the United States. There are related trends in inflammatory bowel disease, lupus, rheumatic conditions and, in particular, celiac disease. The last results from the immune’s system overreacting to gluten, a protein in wheat, rye and barley. This attack, in turn, damages the walls of the small intestine. This might sound like a food allergy, but it is different in part because of the symptoms. In the case of an autoimmune disorder like this one, the immune system attacks the protein and associated regions. Allergies can generate a more generalized response. A peanut allergy, for instance, can lead to inflammation in the windpipe, known as anaphylaxis, which can cause strangulation. In the case of both allergy and autoimmune disorders, though, the immune system reacts more strongly than it otherwise might, or than is healthy for the host (yeah, I’m talking about you). This is not to say that all of these increases are due to better hygiene, a drop in childhood infection, and its association with wealth and education. There have been many changes to our environment, including new pollutants. There are absolutely genetic factors as well. But the hygiene hypothesis — and when it comes to allergy, the inverse relationship between industrialized processes and health — has held up remarkably well. As our bodies strive for balance, Madison Avenue has made a full-court press for greater hygiene, sometimes to our detriment. We’re fed a steady diet of a hygiene-related marketing that began in the late 1800s, according to a novel study published in 2001 by the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology. Scientists at Columbia University who did the research were trying to understand how we became so enamored of soap products. Some highlights: The Sears catalog in the early 1900s heavily advertised “ammonia, Borax, and laundry and toilet soap.” “During the early to mid-1900s, soap manufacturing in the United States increased by 44 percent,” coinciding with “major improvements in water supply, refuse disposal and sewage systems.” The marketing trailed off in the 1960s and 1970s as antibiotics and vaccines were understood to be the answer to infectious agents, with less emphasis on “personal responsibility.” But then, starting in the late 1980s, the market for such hygiene products — home and personal — surged 81 percent. The authors cite a “return of public concern for protection against infectious disease,” and it’s hard not to think of AIDS as part of that attention. If you’re in marketing, never waste a crisis, and the messages had an impact. The study cites a Gallup poll from 1998 that found that 66 percent of adults worried about virus and bacteria, and 40 percent “believed these microorganisms were becoming more widespread.” Gallup also reported that 33 percent of adults “expressed the need for antibacterial cleansers to protect the home environment,” and 26 percent believed they were needed to protect the body and skin. They were wrong. And even doctors have been wrong. They have vastly overprescribed antibiotics. These may be a huge boon to an immune system faced with an otherwise deadly infection. But when used without good reason, the drugs can wipe out healthy microbes in our gut and cause bacteria to develop defenses that make them even more lethal. A scientist who led efforts at the World Health Organization to develop global policy to limit use of antibiotics told me that, philosophically, this is a lesson that runs counter to a century of marketing: We’re not safer when we try to eliminate every risk from our environment. “We have to get away from the idea of annihilating these things in our local environment. It just plays upon a certain fear,” said the scientist, Dr. Keiji Fukuda. Has much of our hygiene been practical, valuable, life-preserving? Yes. Have we overcorrected? At times. Should you pick your nose? Or put another way: Might that urge to pick be part of a primitive strategy to inform your immune system about the range of microbes in your environment, give this vigilant force activity, and train your most elegant defense? Yes. Perhaps. In short, from a cultural standpoint, you still probably shouldn’t pick — not in public. But it is a surprisingly fair scientific question.",The New York Times

2019,"Your New Favorite Couple, Kathy and Stu, Sets the Record Straight","“Good lord, imagine getting owned this hard in the NYT comments section by your OWN SPOUSE.” New York Times readers leave thousands of comments on our site each day. Usually these comments don’t go viral. But on rare occasions, they get shared widely, charming a wider portion of the internet beyond the digital walls of The Times. On Thursday, two of our readers, Kathy Watson and her husband, Stu, of Hood River, Ore., joined that unofficial hall of fame. Stu, a retired newspaper editor and writer, left a comment on Mike Isaac’s story about how Mark Zuckerberg plans to change Facebook and other social platforms so that people have more private conversations with smaller groups: Kathy, also a former journalist and a semiretired chef, had a different perspective: A Times comment moderator spotted the exchange and highlighted both responses as “Times Picks,” making them more visible to other readers of the comments. Then one of our technology columnists, Kevin Roose, tweeted the exchange, adding his own commentary: “Good lord, imagine getting owned this hard in the NYT comments section by your OWN SPOUSE.” More than 10,000 people on Twitter liked or retweeted his tweet, and many others weighed in — either siding with Kathy or Stu, admitting that they could relate, or hypothesizing about the state of the couple’s marriage. “Oh my god these are friends of mine, and this is so on brand!” replied Melissa Tokstad. We spoke to Stu and Kathy by phone (at the same time) on Friday, to find out how they felt about their sudden Twitter fame and if they were even aware of it. They didn’t know they had been “causing a sensation” until we showed them the tweets, but they each good-naturedly described the situation as “funny.” (And they confirmed that Ms. Tokstad is indeed a friend.) Had Stu been aware of Kathy’s reply to his comment? Yes. “She loves to tell me about all the things she does to smack me down.” Is this the first time Kathy has replied to one of Stu’s comments? Yes. (Their shared New York Times account is under her email address, so she received a notification when his comment was posted.) “I saw his comment and thought, well that’s something,” she said and laughed (she used a different word than “something”). Does Kathy ever feel like Stu owes her a debt for keeping him up-to-date on Facebook happenings, as some implied on Twitter? No. They agreed that the flow of information goes both ways. “The truth is I’m an introvert, and he’s an extrovert,” Kathy said. “There’s a lot of give and take of information, and what’s important to us is staying connected.” Want more hall-of-fame comments?

2019,Opinion | Your Public Lands Are Killing You,"We are squandering millions of acres of our children’s inheritance and using it to destroy the planet. Contributing Opinion Writer Out in the way beyond, the open land on the far side of the Mueller report and cable news obsessives, is a vast kingdom now being used to hasten the demise of the planet. You may know this area, more than 500 million acres of empty vales and thick forests, high plains and diamond-cut peaks, as something you saw on a screen saver, or marked as a distant bucket list destination. It’s your American public land endowment, your birthright at citizenship. What you may not know is that while you were sleeping through the white noise from the White House, your public servants were put under the control of the oil and gas industry. They have been busy giving away drilling rights on your land for next to nothing. More precisely — per acre, for even less than the cost of a Bacon McDouble, which of course you should eat only in moderation. And they’re doing this in the face of considerable evidence that the rush into industrial plunder of these lands is a huge source of planet-convulsing carbon emissions. But behold: A history-making lawsuit on behalf of children who will inherit this mess could put an end to the Trump administration plan to drill till we drop. Although the courts have never recognized a constitutional right to a livable environment, the lawsuit, Juliana v. United States, has been given a green light to pursue just that. “This is no ordinary lawsuit,” wrote federal judge Ann Aiken of Oregon in allowing the case to proceed. “I have no doubt that the right to a climate system capable of sustaining human life is fundamental to a free and ordered society.” If that judicial statement was a stunner, what happened this month in another case was equally extraordinary. For the first time, a federal judge temporarily halted drilling on federal land because the government did not take into account the climate change impact of that drilling. Forget about the unworkable Green New Deal, which Republicans are using as a prop to show how silly both parties are. Cow flatulence! No air travel! The end of “hamberders!” It’s been a gift to right-wing demagogues, looking to further dumb down a Republican base that doesn’t believe anything a wounded earth is trying to tell them. The real action is unfolding now, on federal land. Prior administrations allowed for considerable oil and gas drilling in swaths of the public domain in the West. But President Trump is holding a fire sale for his fellow fossil fools. The amount of federal land offered for drilling is three times what it was under President Barack Obama. It would be one thing if we needed this oil. We don’t. The world is awash in cheap crude. And it would be another if these lands weren’t being used for something that poses an existential threat. They are. Almost 25 percent of American earth-warming emissions originate from industrial action involving public land or offshore leases. The United States is the biggest carbon polluter in history, and now ranks behind only China in greenhouse gas emissions. As well, we’re now the largest crude oil producer in the world. And we’ve become a leading exporter of that oil, just to show how bad of a global citizen we can be. If you force the Trump administration to stop bingeing on public land, you can make an immediate impact on the amount of earth-warming carbon the United States spits into the atmosphere. Such an injunction is what the children represented by a trust in the Juliana lawsuit are trying to do. And it was that sort of injunction, acknowledging the role of drilling on public land in harming us all, that temporarily shut down new leasing on 300,000 acres in Wyoming this month. Another big step is to prevent David Bernhardt, a former oil and gas lobbyist, from becoming interior secretary. A stooge for his former clients, this Trump nominee was the deputy secretary, while the top job was held by a strange man, Ryan Zinke, who paraded around on a horse named Tonto. It was Bernhardt who tried to block release of a federal analysis showing that two widely used pesticides were so toxic that they “jeopardize the continued existence” of more than 1,200 species of birds, fish and other life-forms without lobbyists, as my colleague Eric Lipton reported this week. You can see who Bernhardt is working for: It’s not all the living things under the domain of the emperor of the outdoors. Nor is he looking out for the interests of children, who will have to live with the consequences of action taken by adults in service to carbon pollution. About those kids: Senator Mike Lee of Utah recently took to the floor of his chamber to say that the best response to the mounting chaos of epic floods, searing wildfires and other symptoms of a sick earth is to get married and have children. What he didn’t say was that we hold our public land in trust for the Americans of tomorrow. The least we can do is stop using it to imperil their world.

2019,Your Top Rival Can Be Your Biggest Ally,"Friendly competition can expand the “win” pie and enhance your performance. A few years ago, an entrepreneur named Wade Eyerly dreamed up an airline that would allow California commuters to fly over heavy traffic. After putting down $1 million in nonrefundable deposits on a fleet of airplanes for his start-up, SurfAir, he was struggling to raise enough money to follow through on the purchase. Mr. Eyerly had been warned that the airline industry was cutthroat and his background prepared him to be especially wary of his adversaries — he was a former spy who had deployed to Iraq as part of the Department of Defense. But his back was against the wall. In an act of desperation, he cold-called a board member at a rival company, JetSuite. We all have rivals in our work lives. They’re our closest competitors; the individuals or groups we’re highly motivated to defeat. Although we often see them as enemies, our rivals can be our greatest allies. You can see this at the extreme in sports. A 2018 study of N.C.A.A. basketball teams found that the better a team’s biggest rival did in March Madness one year, the more games the team won the next year. So, for example, if you’re a U.N.C. fan and the Tar Heels get knocked out of the tournament, the best way to support your team is to (gasp) root for Duke. The same is true in professional baseball and the N.F.L., N.H.L., and N.B.A.: Teams had the best odds in the playoffs the year after their rival won the championship. As Magic Johnson said in the heat of the Lakers-Celtics rivalry: “When the new schedule would come out each year, I’d grab it and circle the Boston games. To me, it was ‘The Two’ and the other 80.” It’s true for individuals, too. Research shows that long-distance runners are about 5 seconds per kilometer faster when one of their top rivals is in the race. Competing against a rival fires up your motivation. If you build a supportive relationship with that rival, it can elevate your performance further. The 2017 New York City Marathon champion Shalane Flanagan doesn’t just train with her rivals. She actually helps them in competition. In the 2016 Olympic trials, Ms. Flanagan slowed down to help her rival and training partner, Amy Cragg. “Shalane helped me every step of the way to give me the best possible chance of making that team,” Ms. Cragg explained on my podcast, WorkLife. “The goal was to make that Olympic team together.” The Norwegian Alpine skiing team takes it even further. At the Olympics, the skiers who race first share a course report by radio with their teammates, giving them tips on how to handle the slopes and turns. [Like what you’re reading?

They’re individual sports: success is zero-sum. If I want to win, I should do everything in my power to make sure they lose. But these elite athletes understand something that’s true in every walk of life: Friendly competition can expand the overall “win” pie and enhance your performance. Supportive rivalries are more likely to develop when you share a group identity with your competitors. Mr. Eyerly, the entrepreneur, recognized that when he was trying to bail out his start-up, SurfAir. He knew JetSuite, his biggest rival, was a fellow scrappy innovator in a bureaucratic industry. “That meant we were kindred spirits, and if I could take risks he couldn’t — we’d both learn from it,” he said. Mr. Eyerly’s cold call to the board led him to a member of JetSuite’s founding team, Alex Wilcox. Within a week, Mr. Wilcox had helped him secure the financing he needed. “Imagine McDonald’s bailing Wendy’s out of a jam by helping them raise money — from their own investors!” Mr. Eyerly said. “Sometimes the only people who understand what you’re building are your ‘competitors.’ If you expect everyone is looking to put a knife in your back, you’ll miss the folks looking to put their arm around you and encourage you on your way.” Adam Grant, an organizational psychologist at Wharton, is the author of “Originals.” For more on becoming friends with your rivals, listen to WorkLife With Adam Grant, a TED original podcast on the science of making work not suck.

2019,You’re the ‘Money Person’ in Your Relationship? That’s Problematic,"Retiring When Adrian Ward and his fiancée, Maren McLaughlin-Klotz, started house-hunting in Austin, Tex., they decided to overhaul how they talked about, and handled, money. They shared their credit histories. They read and discussed the book “1,001 Questions to Ask Before You Get Married.” They began weekly budget chats and established a joint wedding fund. They even started meeting with Dr. Ward’s adviser to review their retirement accounts and made plans to return every year. Dr. Ward, 32 and a marketing professor, had recently collaborated on research that showed what could happen when one partner in a couple is “pegged as the money person,” as he was. He was shocked to realize that his own research showed he and Ms. McLaughlin-Klotz, 31, were going about it all wrong. Ms. McLaughlin-Klotz shared his concerns. “I know a lot of marriages have problems because of finances, and I would not want to set us up for failure,” she said. The findings showed that what can begin as a practical solution — to have one person handle everything — can come at a cost to the uninvolved partner’s skills. The cost is especially steep when couples figure in the need for retirement planning, or even when one partner finds themselves alone, after a death or divorce. The research, by Dr. Ward, of the McCombs School of Business at the University of Texas at Austin, and John G. Lynch, of the Leeds School of Business at the University of Colorado in Boulder, have found that people who took on more of the financial tasks acquired greater knowledge over time than their uninvolved partner, as measured by a 13-question financial literacy quiz. “If you’re paying attention, you get better over time,” Dr. Lynch said. One part of the research included a study of 86 participants, in which the researchers first assessed each person’s individual aptitude for financial and health care topics, then assigned partners and asked participants to read and remember as much information as they could during a five-minute period spent on the topics of finance (stocks, vehicle financing, life insurance and credit cards) and health care (heart health, the endocrine system, cancer and mental illness), according to the study. After giving participants a three-minute break, the researchers measured each partner’s ability to remember details they had learned from their reading by completing as many partial statements as possible in five minutes. The results showed a tendency for partners to divide tasks according to who they believed had greater skills, and even those who started out with less knowledge acquired more when assigned the role of the “money person.” “They’re totally missing that really they started in the same place, but by accepting these roles, you’re determining who has financial literacy,” Dr. Ward said. A study sponsored by Fidelity Investments conducted in April tracked partners’ confidence in handling financial tasks when they were more involved and less involved — finding that couples who worked together had greater confidence about their financial future. The company surveyed 1,662 couples across the country, with an average age of 52, who were either married or in a long-term committed relationship and living together. The respondents had either an annual household income of $75,000 or a minimum of $100,000 in assets to invest. When they were asked about their ability to assume full responsibility for their retirement finances and strategy, almost all — 93 percent of those who said they had primary responsibility and 87 percent with joint responsibility, said they felt confident in doing so. By contrast, only 52 percent of the less involved partners expressed confidence in taking over the financial role. Notably, those who were not participating showed more unease when asked about “not being prepared financially if my significant other passes away first,” with 41 percent of the less involved respondents saying they were concerned, versus only 10 percent of those who said they had primary financial responsibility and 18 percent who said they handled tasks jointly. Even a well-intentioned spouse can leave a partner feeling uncertain about her ability to make good choices alone — but worried and fearful at worst, especially if one is left in potential financial jeopardy. Kathleen M. Rehl is a financial adviser and researcher in St. Petersburg, Fla., and the author of “Moving Forward on Your Own: A Financial Guidebook for Widows.” She recalled a newly widowed client who had gladly ceded the financial decision-making to her husband for years. The client was following a gut instinct in hiring her, Ms. Rehl said, and expressed it this way: “I never really understood that stuff that Jim did, but my tummy tells me it might be wrong.” When Ms. Rehl looked at her client’s portfolio, she found 90 percent of the holdings were in international stocks — an aggressive risk profile for any investor, let alone a retiree in her 70s. Together, they developed a more balanced portfolio, composed of a blend of stock and bond index funds designed to weather market volatility. Even when they agreed to rejigger the investments, it proved hard for Ms. Rehl’s client to make such a big decision alone, even though she eventually followed through. “She said, ‘Stop, I can’t do it,’” Ms. Rehl said. “She said, ‘It’s like I’m slapping Jim in the face.’” Facing major choices alone can be disorienting — even when a couple have prepared for it together. When Liz Hobert, of Mount Dora, Fla., 68, and her husband, Bruce, were in their 50s, they wanted to make sure they both had a clear view of their finances — so they enrolled in a financial course held at a local community college. “We came out not any better than we had been before,” Ms. Hobert said, describing a “mess” of six insurance policies and a collection of pensions and stock and bond accounts handled by different advisers. “We had all these pieces but we really didn’t know what we would have in retirement and wondered, ‘Are we ever going to be able to retire?’” Working with Ms. Rehl, they consolidated accounts, started saving more aggressively, and set a goal of retiring in their 60s. When Mr. Hobert died five years ago, Ms. Hobert said she felt reassured when Ms. Rehl urged her not to worry about money or making any big decisions for six months based on the planning they had completed. Even though Ms. McLaughlin-Klotz and Dr. Ward are years away from retirement, they have already started talking about the long term. Now, he said, “There’s complete transparency” about their finances. “It would be easier for me to do everything, but the easiest thing isn’t necessarily the best thing.” Ms. McLaughlin-Klotz said she was glad they are working on it, though she has also found it challenging. “It’s a really uncomfortable topic, but we talk about it all the time. I want to make sure I’m contributing so it was important for me that we had those conversations so I don’t feel left out.” Sheryl Garrett, a certified financial planner in Eureka Springs, Ark., has tips for couples: How can couples talk about money without fighting about it? To begin, don’t start by talking dollars and cents. Instead, try to create a clear picture of long-term wishes. Each person can start by making a list of 30 goals, dividing them into three categories, called “I would love to,” “like to” and “it’s not that important.” They could range from the practical, such as saving for retirement or starting a family, to desires such as living overseas or studying a new language. (One of Ms. Garrett’s personal goals is to master conversational Mandarin — a skill she is still working on.) Next, swap lists and begin talking about how to create a plan together to make those ideas happen. What concrete steps should we take every year? Take stock of your financial situation annually by looking at each person’s net worth separately and the couple’s net worth together, Ms. Garrett said. Compare where you were a year ago and start thinking about what changes you want to make in the year ahead. What ground rules should couples follow to help stay on track? Set aside time — no more than 30 minutes — to talk about money at least once a month. Try to find a low-stress time, perhaps a weekend night, and involve everyone in the household — including children. Consider modeling how to work through the kinds of financial trade-offs you need to make as a family. For instance, would you rather have a lavish trip or go camping, allowing a lasting purchase like a trampoline, which everyone could enjoy on a regular basis? Commit to talking together with “no blame and no shame,” Ms. Garrett said.",The New York Times
2019,"Zack Greinke Finds His Old Home, Dodger Stadium, Unwelcoming Again","Opinion is divided on the Arizona Diamondbacks’ chances this year — they are talking about contending, though they are 30-1 to win their division. Arizona also traded its slugging first baseman, Paul Goldschmidt, to the Cardinals in the off season. Still, no matter what, the Diamondbacks can always count on their ace, Zack Greinke. But the optimists were shaken on Thursday. Greinke didn’t look so good against the defending National League champion Dodgers on opening day, continuing a pattern of poor performances at Dodger Stadium since he left the team as a free agent after the 2015 season. Greinke gave up seven runs in three and two-thirds innings, including four home runs. In all, the Dodgers had eight homers, breaking the opening-day record of six set by the 1988 Mets (Darryl Strawberry and Kevin McReynolds had two each that day) and tied by the White Sox last year. The homers also set a Dodger Stadium record. Only two teams, the 1987 Blue Jays and 1999 Reds, have ever hit more homers in a game. The fourth inning was particularly ugly. The Dodgers, already ahead by 3-0, got back-to-back home runs by Enrique Hernandez and Austin Barnes, then a two-out blast by Corey Seager that finally chased Greinke. The final score was 12-5. Greinke got taken deep off his faster pitches (Seager and Barnes) and his slower stuff (Hernandez and Joc Pederson). “Off-speed wasn’t real sharp,” the laconic Greinke told reporters. “It was bad. Not really much to build off.” Greinke, who faced boos from the home fans on Thursday, then cheers when he was bounced from the game, has struggled in Dodger Stadium since leaving there. His record there with the Diamondbacks stands at 1-4, with a 7.41 E.R.A. a particularly poor figure considering that the stadium has always been a pitcher’s park. Though he has been an All-Star four of the last five seasons, Greinke is 35. If his poor performance in Los Angeles extends around the league, it could be a long year for the Diamondbacks.",The New York Times
2019,"Zhores Alferov, 88, Dies; Nobel Winner Paved Way for Laser Technology","Zhores I. Alferov, a Russian physicist who won a Nobel Prize for research that underpinned an array of inventions integral to modern life, from solar cells to DVD players to cellphones, died Friday night in St. Petersburg. He was 88. The death, at a hospital, was announced by Gennady Zyuganov, the leader of the Russian Communist Party, according to Tass, the Russian state news agency. Dr. Alferov shared the 2000 Nobel Prize in Physics with two American physicists, Herbert Kroemer and Jack S. Kilby, “for basic work on information and communication technology.” Son of a Stalinist industrial apparatchik, Dr. Alferov maintained an ambiguous relationship with the United States throughout his life. He worked closely with American colleagues but rejected market reforms in post-Soviet Russia and served in its parliament as a Communist Party deputy. He did his research at the Ioffe Institute in Leningrad (today St. Petersburg), whose weightier projects included helping to build the Soviet hydrogen bomb and nuclear submarine fleet. The three scientists who shared the 2000 prize, working separately, pioneered the development of the so-called heterostructure semiconductor. Scientists had studied semiconductors — materials that conduct a relatively weak and controllable pulse of electricity — since the 1930s, famously focusing on silicon as the most useful. But the transit of electrons through a silicon wafer, known as a homostructure because it consists of one material, proved ineffective at releasing photons, whose energy can be converted to light in the form of a laser beam. Dr. Alferov discovered that a “sandwich” of different materials, or heterostructure, could yield a continuous stream of photons without adding so much electrical current that it would heat the materials to extreme temperatures. He hit upon the optimal combination of gallium arsenide with aluminum, and in 1968 made his first visit to the United States to deliver a paper summarizing his results. The presentation “produced the impression of an exploded bomb,” Dr. Alferov would recall without undue modesty in his Nobel acceptance speech 32 years later. His research also gave him entree to American colleagues at Bell Labs and IBM, and set off a small-scale laser race that combined comradeship and sharing between individual scientists with dead-serious Cold War rivalry. Dr. Alferov would recall with pride that in the race to build a prototype of a laser that worked at room temperature, he and his team in Leningrad beat Bell Labs in New Jersey by a month. Subsequent perfection of heterostructure lasers and heterotransistors based on combined materials made possible today’s world of LED screens, optically read disks and the fiber-optic technology behind cellphones. Zhores Ivanovich Alferov was born on March 15, 1930, in Vitebsk, in what is now Belarus, the painter Marc Chagall’s hometown. His father, Ivan Karpovich Alferov, was a former dockworker who joined the Bolsheviks in 1917 and later regaled his two sons with reminiscences of meeting Lenin and Trotsky. His mother, Anna Vladimirovna Alferov, headed a public organization of housewives, worked as a librarian “and always remained our close friend while bringing us up without discouraging words,” Dr. Alferov wrote in his Nobel autobiographical essay. Communism lifted his father to the role of itinerant industrial manager, and he moved the family across the Soviet Union as he helped carry out Stalin’s five-year plans for rapid industrialization and collectivization of agriculture. He named his eldest son, Marx, after Karl Marx; Zhores was named after the assassinated French Socialist leader Jean Jaurès. Marx was 20 when he died at the front during World War II, to be remembered by his younger brother a half-century later at the Nobel ceremony in Stockholm. Zhores moved to Leningrad to study physics after the war. He joined the research institute there, founded by the father of the Soviet semiconductor field, Abram Ioffe, in 1953, the year Stalin died. The times were turbulent but fertile for science, as both the United States and the Soviet Union poured money into research that each hoped would keep it ahead of the other in a superpower competition for supremacy. “The sensation I felt then could not be compared to anything,” Dr. Alferov wrote of his early work at Ioffe. He stuck with the institute all his life, winning the Lenin Prize, Soviet science’s highest honor, in 1972; becoming director of Ioffe in 1987; and heading the Leningrad-St. Petersburg branch of the Academy of Sciences in 1989. In the mid-1990s, he was obliged to accept support from his old rivals in America. The United States Strategic Defense Initiative, better known as “Star Wars,” helped finance Ioffe and a half dozen other Russian research centers for several years. “You could tell it was hard for him to be in this position,” said Michael Stroscio, a University of Illinois professor of electrical and computer engineering who visited Ioffe to help oversee the Pentagon grant. “He was very professional, but kept his distance.” Among his survivors is his wife, Tamara Darskaya; their daughter, Olga; and their son, Ivan. A first marriage had produced another daughter, but Dr. Alferov rarely spoke of the union. Dr. Alferov had entered politics reluctantly, he told interviewers, his purpose being to revive domestic financing for science. He joined Russia’s parliament, the State Duma, in 1995 as a member of the party supporting the westernizing policies of President Boris Yeltsin, but he switched to the opposition Communists in the 1999 parliamentary elections, convinced that Mr. Yeltsin’s “young reformers” had brought Russia to the brink of economic ruin. (Mr. Yeltsin stunned the world when he resigned less than two weeks later, turning over the presidency to the prime minister, Vladimir V. Putin.) Dr. Alferov served as a Communist deputy, but seldom attended Duma sessions and maintained his focus on bills affecting science and technology. “He probably lost a bit of prestige among the intelligentsia for joining the Communists,” said Yuri Korgonyuk, a commentator at the Moscow political think tank Indem. “But everyone could see he wasn’t really a politician.” Faith in science and its universal benefits remained Dr. Alferov’s true credo. “All that was made by human beings, in principle, was made due to science,” he said after accepting the Nobel Prize. An earlier version of this obituary referred incorrectly to Michael Stroscio. He is a University of Illinois professor of electrical and computer engineering, not physics.",The New York Times
2019,"Zion Williamson Caps Stunning Return, Leading Duke to A.C.C. Title","Zion Williamson had 21 points, capping a dominating three-game show at the Atlantic Coast Conference tournament and helping fifth-ranked Duke beat No. 12 Florida State, 73-63, on Saturday night in the championship game in Charlotte, N.C. R. J. Barrett added 17 points and 9 rebounds, and the Blue Devils (29-5) took control after halftime, adding a 21st tournament title to their conference-record total. Point guard Tre Jones had his own strong outing, part of a Duke closing act that showed that the Blue Devils — with Williamson healthy after missing nearly six full games with a knee sprain — are ready for an N.C.A.A. Tournament push. Williamson was named the tournament’s most valuable player, becoming only the sixth freshman to win the award and the first in a dozen years. “For people who said I shouldn’t return,” Williamson said, “I couldn’t abandon my brothers and coaches like that.” Duke shot 58 percent after the break, turning a 36-all score into a 14-point lead by midway through the half and then holding on. Mfiondu Kabengele scored 14 points for the Seminoles (27-7). BIG EAST Villanova (25-9) became the first team to win three consecutive Big East tournaments, beating Seton Hall (20-13), 74-72, at Madison Square Garden behind the seniors Eric Paschall and Phil Booth and key contributions from the freshman Saddiq Bey. Myles Powell scored 25 points for Seton Hall. Paschall had 17 points and 8 rebounds for Villanova, and Booth scored 16 points and was selected most outstanding player of the tournament. Bey had 16 points and 10 rebounds. BIG 12 Fifth-seeded Iowa State (23-11) raced to a big early lead against No. 17 Kansas (25-9), then leaned on some balanced scoring and enough stops down the stretch to beat the Jayhawks, 78-66, in Kansas City, Mo., remaining unbeaten in five championship game appearances. Lindell Wigginton had 17 points for the Cyclones, Marial Shayok had 15, and Michael Jacobson 14.

2019,"Zion Williamson Returns in Style, Leading Duke to Victory Over Syracuse","CHARLOTTE, N.C. — For the first time since his left sneaker split open 30 seconds after tipoff of a game last month, the Duke superstar Zion Williamson took the court on Thursday night, helping his team to an 84-72 victory over Syracuse in the quarterfinals of the Atlantic Coast Conference tournament. Showing no signs of the knee injury sustained when his shoe exploded, Williamson dominated the game, scoring 29 points as he made all 13 of his shots from the field. He also had 14 rebounds, five steals and a block. “I come ready to kill every game,” Williamson told ESPN after the game. He continued with this theme later in a news conference and dismissed suggestions, which arose after the injury, that he might not return to the Duke lineup and would instead rehabilitate his knee and just prepare for the N.B.A. draft in June. “Everybody has their right to their own opinion,” he said, “but I knew I was coming back the whole time.” Duke (27-5), which struggled in Williamson’s absence, will meet its archrivals, the North Carolina Tar Heels (27-5), in a Friday semifinal. The third-ranked Tar Heels have won this season’s two previous matchups against the No. 5 Blue Devils, though Williamson missed most of the first showdown — when his Nike sneaker came apart — and all of the second. Williamson won the opening tip-off and scored the Blue Devils’ first points on an inside layup. Barely two minutes had gone by when he brought Duke fans in attendance to their feet, intercepting a Syracuse pass and taking it all the way to the other end for a thunderous dunk. Later there was another steal-and-dunk. And nine rebounds. And five steals. And that was just in the first half, when Williamson led all players with 21 points on 9-for-9 shooting. As Syracuse kept the game close in the second half, Williamson kept refusing to miss, while showing essential energy on defense. And if you were wondering: Williamson wore Nikes on Thursday, a model named for the Boston Celtics star Kyrie Irving, who played one season at Duke. The sneaker that split was a Paul George signature Nike. “The shoes were incredible this game,” Williamson said afterward. Williamson’s wardrobe malfunction — and the related knee sprain — had kicked off a round of soul-searching about the influence of shoe companies in college sports and the N.C.A.A.’s amateurism rules. It also presented a more immediate problem for Duke: A national title contender, the Blue Devils were suddenly without their best player, the freshman who is expected to be the No. 1 overall pick in the N.B.A. draft. Before Williamson’s injury, the Blue Devils were 23-2 and ranked No. 1 in the country. In the three weeks between then and tipoff against Syracuse, they dropped to No. 5 while going 3-3, including the loss to the Tar Heels on the night of the sneaker disaster. Duke announced hours before Thursday’s game that Williamson would return against Syracuse (now 20-13), which had beaten Duke in Durham, N.C., at a time when the Blue Devils’ star was healthy. With Williamson at full strength or even close to it, Duke should be a favorite to win the national championship, which would be its first since 2015 and the sixth of Coach Mike Krzyzewski’s career. Duke is also nearly a lock to be no lower than a No. 2 seed in the national tournament bracket, though by the time the field is announced on Sunday, the selection committee might have extrapolated Duke’s power with a healthy Williamson forward and slotted it as a top seed.",The New York Times
2019,Zion Williamson Wills Duke to an Opening Win,"N.C.A.A. Tournament: Day 2 It should not be possible for a human being listed at 6 feet 7 inches and 285 pounds to outrun a guard while chasing down a loose ball, to fool him with a behind-the-back dribble and then to glide in for a layup, but Zion Williamson warps logic and good sense every time his size-15 feet step onto a basketball court. The final score of Duke’s victory against North Dakota State does not suggest as much, but there was a juncture in the teams’ East Region game Friday night when the outcome was theoretically in doubt. The No. 1 over all seed Blue Devils led by — gasp — only 4 points at halftime. Duke ended up trampling the No. 16 Bison by 85-62, after leading by as many as 31, because of a sequence early in the second half in which Williamson unleashed the breadth of his singular repertory: he made a shot while being fouled; missed the free throw but grabbed the ball and dunked it; rebounded a wayward North Dakota shot and started a possession that ended in a Duke 3-pointer; and then stole the ball, ran it down and dropped it in the basket. All within 58 seconds. It was 40-27 then, and it was over because Williamson, the Blue Devils’ bulldozing ballet dancer, had decreed it was. Williamson finished with 25 points on 12-of-16 shooting, and another Duke freshman, R.J. Barrett, added 26. “Before that even happened, my teammates were in my ear,” said Williamson, who relished playing in Columbia, S.C., about 95 miles from his hometown, Spartanburg. “They were just like, ‘be me,’ like, ‘be myself.’ When they’re constantly telling you to be yourself, it just gives you energy, and I just try to bring energy for my team. I think in those situations I just happened to be in the right spot.” By showcasing its powers of devastation, Duke — though it wobbled early, like the other two top seeds who played Friday, Virginia and North Carolina, and a No. 2, Tennessee — evaded the upsets that pervaded what was a more appealing second day of the tournament. The minor surprises — in the South, No. 10 Iowa beat No. 7 Cincinnati, 79-72, and No. 9 Oklahoma bludgeoned No. 8 Mississippi, 95-72, while No. 9 Washington whipped No. 8 Utah State, 78-61, in the Midwest — paled against the wins that had the capacity to upend the bracket. In dispatching No. 4 Kansas State by 70-64 in the South, No. 13 University of California, Irvine preceded victories by No. 12 Oregon, which walloped No. 5 Wisconsin by 72-54 in the same region, and by No. 12 Liberty, which stunned No. 5 Mississippi State by 80-76 in the East. For a spell Friday, North Dakota State envisioned joining them, too. “It just never felt like you were going to get beat until they really got going,” Coach David Richman said. And by they, he was referencing Williamson, who has few, if any, peers around the nation, let alone in the Bison’s Summit League. Asked about the difficulties in preparing for a player like Williamson, and with all of two days’ notice, Richman interrupted the reporter: “Is there any guys like him besides him?” For the uninitiated, the best nickname in the N.C.A.A. tournament hails from U.C. Irvine: the Anteaters — though apparently the cognoscenti prefer an abridged moniker. “We usually like to take off the ‘Ant’ and just say ‘Eaters,’” guard Evan Leonard said. “So I feel like Eater Nation, stuff like that, is pretty cool.” Also pretty cool: claiming the first significant upset of the tournament. The Anteaters — Eaters, excuse us — ousted Kansas State to capture the program’s first N.C.A.A. tournament victory. Indeed Irvine had only one previous appearance — losing to Louisville in 2015 — and its recent lineage is littered with strong regular seasons followed by flameouts in the Big West Conference tournament. But in a dreadful season for California’s men’s teams, one in which standard-bearers like Stanford, U.C.L.A. and U.S.C. didn’t even qualify for the National Invitation Tournament, the Anteaters have represented the Golden State with distinction, going 31-5 with 17 straight wins. “We have visions of potentially growing into something greater — you know, every player dreams of that, every program sort of dreams of that,” Coach Russell Turner said. “This was a big step toward that tonight. You know, U.C. Irvine, folks, I don’t know, live in the shadow, live like little brothers to U.C.L.A. and S.C. and maybe some others: Cal, Stanford, San Diego State. Maybe like little brothers. Well, little brother has been in the weight room, getting better, getting ready for a chance like this.” U.C. Irvine had not lost since Jan. 16, and to extend that streak, the Anteaters summoned critical 3-pointers from two juniors, Leonard and Max Hazzard. Leonard made his shots on consecutive possessions to put U.C. Irvine ahead to stay for the final nine minutes, and Hazzard drilled a shot from the corner with about 90 seconds remaining to push its lead to 66-61. Kansas State, which won a share of the Big 12 title, missed its all-Big 12 forward Dean Wade (injured foot). “I mean, if you studied or watched us, obviously it’s a huge difference,” Coach Bruce Weber said. “But no excuses.” Virginia spent the last year waiting for its chance to atone for its unprecedented early exit from the 2018 N.C.A.A. tournament, when it became the first No. 1 seed to lose to a No. 16. When that chance arrived, the Cavaliers sleepwalked through the first half against Gardner-Webb and found themselves confronting potential embarrassment again. “That will always be part of our story,” Coach Tony Bennett said. “I understand that. I’m sure a lot of people thought it was going to be part of our story the second year in a row.” Virginia persisted, though, rolling to a 71-56 victory after outscoring the Bulldogs by 21 points in the second half. De’Andre Hunter — who missed that dispiriting tournament loss to Maryland-Baltimore County last year with a hand injury — scored 23 points to lead the Cavaliers, who recognize their place in infamy but, at Bennett’s urging, have regrouped from it. Together, they watched a video of a TED Talk given in Charlottesville, Va., of all places, in which the speaker, discussing his personal grief, said, according to Bennett, that “if you learn to use it right, it can buy you a ticket to a place that you couldn’t have gone any other way.” The junior guard Kyle Guy, who had 8 points Friday, still keeps an image of U.M.B.C.’s celebration as the screen saver on his phone and in his Twitter profile. He said an author, Joshua Medcalf, had talked to the team last year, telling the Cavaliers, “Be where your feet are.” Even as Virginia sputtered in the first half, trailing by as many as 14, Guy said he focused on positive reinforcement. Bennett said the mood at halftime was upbeat, and he asked his assistant coaches to “uplift” players and not “panic.” “Yes, we made some adjustments that I think helped the guys out there,” Bennett said, “but it was, you know, don’t you dare leave anything in this locker room.” The second day of the tournament began with Iowa extending the Big Ten’s stretch of dominance, as the Hawkeyes pulled away late from Cincinnati to win, 79-72. Iowa’s victory improved the Big Ten’s record to 6-0, which was marred later when No. 5 Wisconsin lost to Oregon. “We’ve been saying all year long that it’s the most competitive league in the country top to bottom,” Iowa Coach Fran McCaffery said. “And you sort of expect Big Ten coaches to make those kinds of statements. But the reality is we actually believe that. And so I think it’s proving it.” The Big Ten this season lacked the elite status of the Atlantic Coast Conference, which has three No. 1 seeds in Duke, Virginia and North Carolina, and though the conference has sent seven teams to the national championship game since 2002, it hasn’t won since Michigan State claimed the title in 2000. But its depth has been manifest so far, with two No. 10 seeds, Iowa and Minnesota, scoring minor upsets to join two imposing No. 2s, Michigan and Michigan State, and Maryland and Purdue in the second round.",The New York Times
2019,Ziwe Fumudoh Uses Humor to Push Racial Buttons,"Up Next The young sarcastic comedian is a writer on “Desus and Mero,” the new Showtime late-night show. Ziwe Fumudoh Age: 27 Hometown: Lawrence, Mass. Now lives: In a three-bedroom apartment in the Bushwick neighborhood of Brooklyn, with a roommate. Claim to fame: Ms. Fumudoh is a saucy and sarcastic comedian known for her barbed satire of race, politics and the pitfalls of young adulthood. (Forbes recently said she possessed “the confidence of an old comedy pro.”) Examples of her elastic oeuvre include “Ponderosa With Omarosa,” a hip-hop jam about Omarosa Manigault Newman (sample lyric: “Drinking dark and Stormy Daniels, watching Oval Office scandals”), and “Baited With Ziwe,” a YouTube series in which she tricks her white friends into blurting out racial faux pas. “I’m a little bit of an antagonist who likes to push people’s buttons,” Ms. Fumudoh said. “I like to laugh at things that are really sad because it makes me feel better.” Big break: Before contributing jokes to The Onion and “The Rundown With Robin Thede”(a short-lived comedy show on BET), she got recognized for her comedic timing as an intern at Comedy Central in 2013. During her second week on the job, she wrote a joke (“gay, set, match”) that was used on “The Colbert Report” during a segment on same-sex marriage legislation. “Fun fact: I did this internship because I had learned Donald Glover had done it a couple years before me,” Ms. Fumudoh said. Latest project: She is currently a writer on “Desus and Mero,” a weekly late-night talk show hosted by Daniel Baker and Joel Martinez that had its premiere last month on Showtime. “I’ve been following them for years, so it’s really cool to finally connect with them,” she said. Next thing: A music video for her latest comedic bop, “From Melania to Sri Lanka,” will be released this month. “Pop Show,” a showcase of her dichotomous artistic persona Ziwé (note the accent), takes place monthly at Union Hall in Brooklyn. “It feels like a Beyoncé concert on mushrooms — without the budget,” she said. Reading is fundamental: Ms. Fumudoh said studying poetry and taking African-American studies courses at Northwestern University prepared her well for her career lampooning social norms. “I’ve always had this real inclination toward reading, literature and critique,” she said. “I say things so horrendously offensive with a nod and wink, so people can see the commentary behind it.”",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | Zuckerberg’s So-Called Shift Toward Privacy,"Facebook is happy to protect user data when doing so decreases the company’s civic responsibilities — but not when it threatens advertising revenue. Dr. Tufekci is a professor of information science who specializes in the social effects of technology. I was tempted to roll my eyes on Wednesday when Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, posted a manifesto outlining his plan to make social networking more “privacy-focused” and less about the public disclosure of information. Why take seriously someone who has repeatedly promised — but seldom delivered — improvements to Facebook’s privacy practices? This is a company, after all, that signed a consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission agreeing to improve how it handles the personal information of its users, after federal regulators filed charges against it for deceiving consumers about their privacy. That was about seven years ago, and it has been one scandal after another since. But I don’t believe in cynicism: Things can get better if we want them to — through regulatory oversight and political pressure. That said, I also don’t believe in being a sucker. So I read Mr. Zuckerberg’s plan with a keen eye on distinguishing meaningful changes from mere platitudes and evasions. The platitudes were there, as I expected, but the evasions were worse than I anticipated: The plan, in effect, is to entrench Facebook’s interests while sidestepping all the important issues. Here are four pressing questions about privacy that Mr. Zuckerberg conspicuously did not address: Will Facebook stop collecting data about people’s browsing behavior, which it does extensively? Will it stop purchasing information from data brokers who collect or “scrape” vast amounts of data about billions of people, often including information related to our health and finances? Will it stop creating “shadow profiles” — collections of data about people who aren’t even on Facebook? And most important: Will it change its fundamental business model, which is based on charging advertisers to take advantage of this widespread surveillance to “micro-target” consumers? Until Mr. Zuckerberg gives us satisfying answers to those questions, any effort to make Facebook truly “privacy-focused” is sure to disappoint. Most of Mr. Zuckerberg’s post was devoted to acknowledging familiar realities about social media and citing familiar solutions. He noted that Facebook’s users don’t want to be pushed to be so public; they mostly want to keep in touch with people close to them, often using several of the company’s other services: Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger. He also noted that users are hungry for less permanent communication features devised by other companies. So Facebook will continue to emulate Snapchat’s ephemeral messaging. To be fair, there were some genuinely new announcements. For instance, Mr. Zuckerberg said that the company would expand end-to-end encryption of messaging, which prevents Facebook — or anyone other than the participants in a conversation — from seeing the content of messages. I’m certainly in favor of messaging privacy: It is a cornerstone of the effort to push back against the cloud of surveillance that has descended over the globe. But what we really need — and it is not clear what Facebook has in mind — is privacy for true person-to-person messaging apps, not messaging apps that also allow for secure mass messaging. At the moment, critics can (and have) held Facebook accountable for its failure to adequately moderate the content it disseminates — allowing for hate speech, vaccine misinformation, fake news and so on. Once end-to-end encryption is put in place, Facebook can wash its hands of the content. We don’t want to end up with all the same problems we now have with viral content online — only with less visibility and nobody to hold responsible for it. It’s also worth noting that encrypted messaging, in addition to releasing Facebook from the obligation to moderate content, wouldn’t interfere with the surveillance that Facebook conducts for the benefit of advertisers. As Mr. Zuckerberg admitted in an interview after he posted his plan, Facebook isn’t “really using the content of messages to target ads today anyway.” In other words, he is happy to bolster privacy when doing so would decrease Facebook’s responsibilities, but not when doing so would decrease its advertising revenue. Another point that Mr. Zuckerberg emphasized in his post was his intention to make Facebook’s messaging platforms, Messenger, WhatsApp and Instagram, “interoperable.” He described this decision as part of his “privacy-focused vision,” though it is not clear how doing so — which would presumably involve sharing user data — would serve privacy interests. Merging those apps just might, however, serve Facebook’s interest in avoiding antitrust remedies. Just as regulators are realizing that allowing Facebook to gobble up all its competitors (including WhatsApp and Instagram) may have been a mistake, Mr. Zuckerberg decides to scramble the eggs to make them harder to separate into independent entities. What a coincidence. In short, the few genuinely new steps that Mr. Zuckerberg announced on Wednesday seem all too conveniently aligned with Facebook’s needs, whether they concern government regulation, public scandal or profitability. This supposed shift toward a “privacy-focused vision” looks more to me like shrewd competitive positioning, dressed up in privacy rhetoric. Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s chief operating officer, likes to say that the company’s problem is that it has been “way too idealistic.” I think the problem is the invasive way it makes its money and its lack of meaningful oversight. Until those things change, I don’t expect any shift by the company toward privacy to matter much.

2019,Zuni Café at 40: Still a Home for the Eclectic,"City Kitchen The San Francisco establishment made great under Judy Rodgers’s leadership remains a hip destination all these years later. Ask anyone in San Francisco for a restaurant recommendation, and chances are Zuni Café will be near the top of the list. Zuni isn’t the trendiest place with the splashiest fare, but the Market Street restaurant, celebrating its 40th anniversary, has been a hip destination since it opened in 1979. Housed in a quirky triangular brick building, with tall, tall windows that let in the brilliant Pacific light on clear days and misty, gray light on cloudy ones, it has always attracted an eclectic crowd: near-penniless students and opera divas, lawyers and socialites, artists and performers, first-daters and anniversary-celebrators, youngsters and oldsters, locals and travelers, politicians and free spirits, serious foodies and serious tipplers. In the beginning, when it was little more than a storefront with a minimal kitchen, Zuni veered Mexican. Billy West, the founding chef, served a stellar guacamole, prepared table-side in molcajetes, the volcanic stone mortars. The place was packed. A shop next door, Red Desert, sold giant potted cactuses. When the restaurant expanded, doubling in size, it was time to hire a real chef. The kitchen was taken over and transformed by Judy Rodgers, a talented young cook with the perfect résumé for a somewhat-oddball restaurant like Zuni. She had spent a year as an exchange student living with the Troisgros family, the owners of a highly regarded restaurant in Roanne, France, and the experience opened her eyes to French cuisine. A subsequent apprenticeship in rural France and extensive travel in Italy convinced her of two things: She loved pure rustic seasonal cooking, and she was enamored of the French and Italian ways to produce it. Ms. Rodgers wisely developed a menu with some dependable items and options for every budget. A Caesar salad stayed on the menu. A first-rate mixed green salad was another essential. An $8 bowl of creamy polenta with Parmesan, for patrons with smaller budgets (and polenta lovers, in general) remains a way to keep the restaurant inclusive and its clientele diverse. Other signature dishes, like the house-cured anchovies with celery and Parmesan, the ethereal ricotta gnocchi, the chocolate Gâteau Victoire and the espresso granita would become permanent favorites. Ms. Rodgers’s roast chicken, still on the menu after 30 years, is roasted to order in a wood-burning oven and takes an hour to prepare. The restaurant takes great care with all its dishes. In “The Zuni Café Cookbook,” a 500-page tome published in 2002, Ms. Rodgers goes to great lengths to explicate every recipe, sharing her knowledge and passion. Rare is the recipe that fits on one page: The hamburger alone is three pages. It gets the same respect and attention as, say, the duck confit, and even burger aficionados agree it is among the most sublime. To make it, the kitchen salts grass-fed beef and grinds it in small batches with 18 percent fat, guaranteeing succulence. You can get a burger for lunch, in the afternoon or after 10 in the evening. (Some customers make late dinner reservations just to have one.) The bun is, and has always been, a square of warm house-baked rosemary focaccia, smeared with a dab of handmade aioli, made with just four ingredients. Vermilion red onion pickles and turmeric-tinged zucchini pickles are served on the side. Make one at home — a fun project — and you’ll realize the Zuni burger is a labor of love. Gilbert Pilgram, a longtime friend and Zuni customer, became Ms. Rodgers’s business partner in 2006, and they managed the restaurant jointly until her untimely death in 2013. His expert palate and commitment to quality made them an ideal team. Now the executive chef and owner, he is supported by Nathan Norris, the chef de cuisine; Annie Callan, the pastry chef; and a loyal staff of cooks and waiters, some of whom have worked at Zuni for decades. Mr. Pilgram is a gracious, and some would say infectiously vivacious host, intent on keeping the restaurant’s community alive. He makes it his duty to ensure the Zuni margarita, a nod to his Mexican heritage, is top notch, made with fresh lime juice, squeezed to order. (He will gladly give you the recipe, and isn’t shy about instructing bartenders on producing a proper one.) For the restaurant’s 40th anniversary party last month, he managed to squeeze 600 devoted regulars into the restaurant for standing-room-only drinks and snacks. When a band of red-garbed mariachis began their midnight serenade, the crowd went wild.

2019,Zuzana Caputova Is Elected Slovakia’s First Female President,"In a stunning rebuke of Slovakia’s populist governing party, Zuzana Caputova — a 45-year-old lawyer, activist and political newcomer — was elected Saturday as the nation’s first female president. Riding a wave of popular discontent over widespread corruption but refusing to engage in personal attacks on her opponents, she vowed to return a sense of decency to Slovakia’s often toxic political climate. Her sweeping victory in a runoff election gave hope to opposition parties across the region that the tide might be turning against the ethnic nationalist and populist movements that have swept to power in recent years. “Maybe we thought that justice and fairness in politics were signs of weakness,” she told a crowd of supporters around midnight. “Today, we see that they are actually our strengths. We thought that the barrier between conservative and liberal is unbreakable, but we managed to do it.” The country’s official statistics office said that with 100 percent of the vote counted, she led with 58 percent over 42 percent for Maros Sefcovic, a career diplomat who had the backing of the country’s governing party, SMER-SD. “I’m sending her a bouquet of flowers because I think the first Slovak female president deserves one,” Mr. Sefcovic said as he conceded defeat. Ms. Caputova had never run for office and said in a recent interview that she had not given the idea any serious consideration until last year. But said she could no longer sit on the sidelines after a young Slovak journalist, Jan Kuciak, and his fiancée, Martina Kusnirova, were shot and killed by a hit man hired to stop Mr. Kuciak’s investigations of corruption at the top levels of government. She joined the tens of thousands of Slovaks who took part in street demonstrations in the weeks after the killings, the largest protests since the Velvet Revolution three decades ago helped Czechoslovakia, now the Czech Republic and Slovakia, break free from Communist rule. For many who protested last year, the populism of the governing party — with its unrelenting attacks on migrants and the European Union — had become little more than cover for corruption. The organizers of the movement, however, deliberately excluded opposition politicians, wary of being tied to any political party. Ms. Caputova decided to join Progressive Slovakia, a new liberal party with no representation in Parliament, and champion a few simple ideas: civility in public life and transparency in government. Ms. Caputova said she would give up her party membership if elected, a clear signal to voters that she did not want to lead a new political machine. “I don’t remember a situation when skilled politicians have been confronted by anyone who would speak as openly, directly and normally as Zuzana Caputova,” wrote Matus Kostolny, editor in chief of the Slovak daily Dennik N. He called Ms. Caputova an “error in the system, a change that we haven’t seen for 30 years.” Ms. Caputova, a divorced mother of two teenage daughters, lives in Pezinok, a small town near Bratislava. Before her political rise, the town was known for two things: wine and the Pezinok landfill, a toxic dump. In 1999, Ms. Caputova joined the fight to hold those responsible for polluting the town to account. For the next 14 years, she waged a war that she eventually won. It was that battle that led some to call her the Erin Brockovich of Slovakia. She said the case had given her insight into how institutions work and how they can be abused. It also prepared her for the kind of personal attacks she would endure throughout the campaign. Above all, it showed that things can get better. “I am an optimist,” she said. “Someone who believes and hopes that change is possible.” In 2016, when she went to San Francisco to accept the Goldman Environmental Prize for her activism, she said the Pezinok case had been “a lesson in bravery.” “The case was an intense experience with the arrogance and vulgarity of political and economical power,” she said. “It was an experience with evil.” She used the same message in the presidential race. “Let’s fight evil together” was her campaign slogan. In an interview, she explained that “evil” referred not to individuals but to their actions. One of the campaign’s first commercials showed Ms. Caputova facing an intimidating man in a cafe. He asked: “So, do we have a deal?” To which Ms. Caputova answered a resolute “no.” She was then asked if she was afraid. Again, she replied no, adding that she was not alone. The commercial was given added power because the man bore an unmistakable resemblance to Marian Kocner, a businessman who is now charged with ordering the murder of Mr. Kuciak, as well as several financial crimes. He was also connected to the Pezinok landfill through his ties to a shell company responsible for the site. Ms. Caputova has managed to express outrage without rage, calmly calling for transparency, decency and fairness in politics and in public life. Her opponents — in both the general election and the runoff on Saturday — reached for issues that have worked well in the past to draw out their most ardent supporters. Migrants were called rapists. Gay men and lesbians were portrayed as a threat to traditional families. Vast conspiracies, often playing into anti-Semitic tropes, were thrown into the toxic stew of rhetoric in a country that has seen a marked rise in extremist groups in recent years. The final results were a victory for a different brand of politics. But the support enjoyed by Ms. Caputova’s most extreme challengers, including Marian Kotleba, an avowed proto-fascist, and Stefan Harabin, an anti-NATO Supreme Court judge — who together won more than 25 percent of the vote in the general election — was a reminder that the country remains deeply divided. For her part, Ms. Caputova never shied from her more controversial liberal views, including support for gay rights. Marian Lesko, a political analyst, said much work needed to be done to restore trust in public institutions but that he was hopeful. “I don’t remember the last time anyone with this kind of agenda has won,” he said.",The New York Times
2019,‘10 Things I Hate About You’: When Heath Ledger Was Just Breaking Through,"In a sea of late-90s rom-com takes on classic literature, “10 Things I Hate About You” stood out for remaining faithful to its Shakespearean roots. Based on “The Taming of the Shrew,” the film centered on the Stratford girls, whose strict father won’t allow Bianca (Larisa Oleynik) to date until her older sister, Kat (Julia Stiles), does. The problem: Kat has no use for boys; she’s got her sights set on college. Hoping to go out with Bianca, new student Cameron James (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) hatches a convoluted plan to get Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger) to date the prickly Kat. Of course, drama, romance and a lot of awkward moments ensue. What stands out 20 years later is the movie’s continued relevance — its Seattle teenagers debate sexual politics — as well as its status as a beloved teen comedy. Made for $11.2 million, “10 Things I Hate About You” was released on March 31, 1999, and made instant stars out of Stiles, Gordon-Levitt and Ledger. But things could have turned out differently because several actors you know could have ended up as the leads. I recently spoke with the stars (including Gabrielle Union and David Krumholtz), the director Gil Junger and others about casting near-misses, face-drawing and their memories of Ledger, who died of an accidental prescription-drug overdose in 2008. Here are edited excerpts from the conversations. Kirsten Smith and Karen McCullah wrote the script at a time when teen rom-coms based on the classics were trending in Hollywood. KIRSTEN SMITH There was such a big teen movie explosion at the time. We were young writers who had never sold a script before, and it was very unusual you would get your first script made, let alone greenlit six months after it was optioned. It had this feeling all around of firsts. JULIA STILES I remember thinking [the screenplay] was so cool and I just loved the heart of Kat so much. I was dying to get the role. I had been reading “The Taming of the Shrew” in school, and it was the first time I had read a romantic comedy [script] that captured teenage angst in such a clever way. LARISA OLEYNIK I remember being pretty smitten with it right away. The script was unabashedly feminist and really of the riot grrrl era of the Pacific Northwest. Katie Holmes and Kate Hudson were among several performers up for leading roles. Even some of the final cast members originally wanted different parts. MARCIA ROSS (casting director) We screen-tested Josh Hartnett, Eliza Dushku, Heath and Julia. But Julia and Heath just had the best chemistry together. I loved Katie Holmes. She was about to get “Dawson’s Creek,” and we had to make a decision really fast. The other person I loved was Kate Hudson. But her mom [Goldie Hawn] didn’t like the script for her, so she passed. JOSEPH GORDON-LEVITT If I’m really honest, I didn’t want to do a high school romantic comedy. I wanted to do Sundance movies. I’m very lucky that five years later, I got to do that. The truth is, I was a naïve or stuck-up 17-year-old. OLEYNIK I auditioned for both Kat and Bianca pretty much up until the very end, and I really wanted Kat. I think I was so obsessed with wanting to prove to them that that’s who I was, that by the time I’d get to the Bianca stuff, I’d be like, “Oh, yeah, sure, whatever.” And I’m sure that’s why it worked, because I was super-relaxed about it. DAVID KRUMHOLTZ (who played Michael, Cameron’s neurotic best friend) I wanted to play Cameron, but I had worked with Gil on a couple of TV projects, and he knew I could do Michael in my sleep, in the sense that you play a neurotic Jewish kid. I know that Joe wanted to play Michael. GORDON-LEVITT I auditioned both for Krumholtz’s part and my part, because I thought [Krumholtz’s part] was funny. Then [Gil] wanted me to play Cameron. GABRIELLE UNION (Chastity, Bianca’s pal) I was over 10 years older than my younger cast members, some of whom were still in high school. So, it was kind of like, how close is this to my high school years? Do I look crazy playing a 15-year-old? Don’t mention Earth Wind & Fire or give away your age. Heath Ledger thought he bombed his audition, but his star power was undeniable to everyone. SMITH [On] his audition tape, he wore a white suit with a black button-down shirt. He was really dressed up, very John Travolta “Saturday Night Fever.” It was a look that was rumpled and rock, but way more dressed up than anyone else was, which was badass because he could pull that off. GIL JUNGER Heath walked in, and I thought to myself, if this guy can read, I’m going to cast him. There was an energy to him, a sexuality that was palpable. When Heath was done, literally, with the first page, I said, “O.K., you can put down the script. You’re doing great. I want to do a little improv with you.” I just wanted to see how fast his mind would adapt, comedically. After 35 seconds, I said, “O.K. Fantastic.” But I could tell he was nervous that he blew it, because the audition was so quick, and I said, “No, no. you’re a very talented guy, and I really appreciate you coming in.” The instant the door closed, I turned to the women in the room and said, “Ladies, I have never wanted to sleep with a man, but if I had to sleep with a man, that would be the man. Please cast him immediately.” Ledger took creative control of the scene in which he woos Kat by singing “Can’t Take My Eyes Off You” from the bleachers at her soccer practice. McCULLAH The first song we had in the script was “I Think I Love You.” Then we decided on “I Touch Myself,” and I think Heath decided that that wasn’t romantic enough, so he chose the Frankie Valli song, which was a much better call. JUNGER I said to Heath, “Just run around the steps when the guards start to chase you.” Right after the first take, the nurse on set ran up to one of the guards. They were fearful he might have pushed himself almost to a heart attack. Heath was running with such joy that it physically exhausted the guards. Kat’s drunk table-dancing in a party scene would have career ramifications for Stiles. STILES I hadn’t ever really been drunk before in real life. I mean, I was 17, so I remember Heath — because he was older — giving me tips on what being drunk looks and feels like. JUNGER I was good friends with Paula Abdul, and I mentioned to Julia that I was going to have a big choreographer work with her and Julia said, “That’s fine, but I can dance.” I went against my normal instincts and trusted her. STILES I would never have the guts to do that now. I’m glad somebody got that on film. I mean I love dancing, but sort of provocatively on the table? I was pretty guileless at that point. I also have heard that that is what got me the part in “Save the Last Dance.” The director said to me that he had seen that scene, then realized that I could do hip-hop, not just ballet. Andrew Keegan, who played the wealthy bully, needed help for a scene involving an obscene drawing. MCCULLAH That scene came from a friend of mine from college. He passed out and his roommates drew a [penis] on his face, and then he got up and walked across the street to a 7-Eleven without knowing. ANDREW KEEGAN Quite frankly, I did not know how to draw [a penis] on someone’s face, and I believe David was the one that helped creatively with that. KRUMHOLTZ I had to teach Andrew. I sat him down and we rehearsed. In a way, I kind of conducted my own penis-drawing on my face. KEEGAN I have heard about that scene for my whole adult life, so I think I did a pretty good job. During the most heartfelt scene in the movie, in which Kat reads the titular poem to Patrick, Stiles went off-script and cried. STILES It had been such an emotional role and such a wonderful experience that I was overjoyed, and probably sad it was coming to an end, but I also was just in a very raw place. JUNGER Basically, the whole speech was one shot. STILES I remember Heath, when they turned around to do his reaction shot, he said something like, “I don’t need to do anything because this isn’t about me.” A lot of times you get one actor crying in a scene and the other actor feels like they have to cry, and he knew to be sort of restrained. I thought that was really cool. JUNGER I did everything I could to cover my mouth and nose because I was crying so hard. It was such an amazing performance. That take [in the film] is the first take. I think I jumped up and just hugged her for the longest time. In the final scene, Letters to Cleo performs on the rooftop of Padua High School, but the crew didn’t have permission to shoot there. JUNGER Disney said they loved the work I was doing but couldn’t justify spending that much money for one shot. And then when the line producer said to me, “What did they say?” I don’t know what the hell it was, but some instinct in me said, “They said yes. Shoot it.” ANDREW LAZAR (producer) It was so complicated, and we had a helicopter. JUNGER I was flying in the helicopter, and I said to the pilot, “Charge ’em.” And he flew right over [Letters to Cleo]. KAY HANLEY (Letters to Cleo lead singer) We’re all arranged on top of this postage-stamp-sized roof with chicken wire the only thing protecting us from toppling to our deaths into the Puget Sound. The music starts playing [and] we start pretending we’re in a music video. We hear the whir of a chopper right above us, and then it dive-bombs us. We did two takes, and it was pretty much assumed that this shot wasn’t going to work, and Gil would never work in Hollywood again because he had just blown through half a million dollars doing this shot he was forbidden to do. And it ended up being a pretty iconic scene. JUNGER Kay was [exhilarated]. She said, “Do you have any idea how scared I was?” The cast recalls the shoot as one of the best times of their lives, but they wish Ledger was here to celebrate the anniversary. OLEYNIK It’s projecting a fantasy of a high school experience, but it’s also grounded in what most 17-year-olds are still feeling, what I’m still feeling as a 37-year-old. GORDON-LEVITT I feel like the sheer closeness that we all had that summer is a big part of why people like that movie, because it wasn’t fake. I spent all summer laughing at [Krumholtz] and slowly starting to talk like him. By the end of that summer, everybody talked like an old Jewish man from Queens because of Krumholtz. KRUMHOLTZ You know, people still say, “I have a [penis] on my face, don’t I?” And I have to be like hey, you got me. It’s haunted me for the rest of my life. It’s wonderful. STILES It was a really fun summer. There wasn’t a mean person in the bunch. I remember [Heath] played the didgeridoo, which was the first time I had even been introduced to that. KRUMHOLTZ It always makes me swallow hard when I know that something I say about Heath is going to be put out there. My clique was Heath and his lovely assistant and best friend, Trevor [DiCarlo]. I loved Heath. As I get older, and as the movie takes on greater relevance with new audiences, it’s harder to wrap my head around the idea that Heath passed on the way he did. I would’ve very much loved him to be part of this article, to feel appreciated for his work in the film, because he worked really hard on “10 Things I Hate About You.” UNION Heath had the ability to look at you, and [make] you feel like Princess Diana. In a very crowded Hollywood landscape, he could make you feel special and seen. That’s a pretty special gift, and I don’t think it’s talked about enough. KRUMHOLTZ Toward the end of his life I reunited with him, at a time when we were both quite vulnerable and trying to recover from some stuff that was haunting us. I had an opportunity to tell Heath how much I loved him and to sort of try to help Heath. He had become so famous, and his life had become so crazy, that in the moment when I could’ve said something, I didn’t, even though I thought it. It’s a big regret I have. To fans, he’s a movie star that died. To me, he was flesh and bone, soulful, sweet, and I know for a fact he was in recovery prior to his death. He was trying to get healthy. I just want people to know there was a suffering individual there, who couldn’t have been a lovelier human being. I prefer to remember Heath as a 20-year-old kid doing his first American lead with a big giant Cheshire grin smile on his face, taking charge as the leader of the group like any good ensemble leader should. An earlier version of this article misstated the cost of making “10 Things I Hate About You.” It was $11.2 million, not $16 million. An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misspelled the name of one of the actors. It is Andrew Keegan, not Andrew Keegen.",The New York Times
2019,"‘3 Faces’ Review: On the Road in Iran (and Off It, Too)","Critic’s Pick When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. A road movie that opens into a political allegory, “3 Faces” is filled with unexpected turns. It is the latest from the Iranian filmmaker Jafar Panahi, a master of narrative diversion, who again has taken the twinned roles of director and driver, as he did in the documentary “Taxi” (2015). Here, playing himself, or a version of the filmmaker Jafar Panahi, he spends a large part of the movie behind the wheel of an S.U.V., motoring through the Iranian countryside to help an actress find a missing, possibly dead woman. They succeed but also find other women, including one who’s a ghost in a haunted world. The story is streamlined, simple and elegant, but the plot is thickly layered. The actress, Behnaz Jafari, has received a video of a distraught young woman, Marziyeh Rezaei, who seems to have committed suicide on camera. (The main performers share their names with their characters.) The shaken Behnaz has walked away from her latest role mid-production and enlisted Jafar to help her search for Marziyeh. Their quest takes them to northwest Iran, where he speaks Turkish to Azeri villagers. He and Behnaz easily track down the missing woman, a discovery that enriches and complicates the inevitable gender divide that runs through this movie like a volatile fault line. Panahi’s storytelling is direct, even obvious, and his visual approach looks similarly straightforward to the point of being utilitarian. But little is as it first appears in “3 Faces,” including the short, alarming video of Marziyeh killing herself that dominates the movie’s opening scenes. A teary, visibly shaken Behnaz repeatedly watches the video as Jafar drives, offering a running commentary on it. She’s flooded with despair, anger, confusion and guilt, but can’t stop watching it, perhaps especially because Marziyeh makes an on-camera appeal to Behnaz for help that now feels like an accusation. In becoming the video’s audience, the actress has become inescapably complicit. That’s true of every audience, of course, including the one for “3 Faces,” simply because to watch a movie is to engage in a social act, whether in a theater or at home. Here, though, the suggestion of complicity doesn’t feel like an accusation, the way it can with directors who toss Brechtian brickbats. A humanist in a theocracy, Panahi has long explored social and political issues — poverty, women’s rights, authoritarianism — yet without the tiresome art-house wagging fingers and grandstanding. One characteristic of his work is its anguished tenderness, including in movies that play with hard-boiled genre (“Crimson Gold,” “The Circle”), a generosity of spirit that is itself political. Behnaz’s doubts about Marziyeh’s video foreshadow the subjects teased out in the main story, including the sometimes convenient divide between fiction and documentary, performance and what we call real life. Panahi has long explored the protean space between these modes, testing their boundaries. In “3 Faces,” he is at once playing a role in a fiction and himself: a dissident filmmaker with a privileged, sympathetic view of women, which strengthens the movie’s autobiographical underpinning. Panahi was arrested in Iran in 2009 and again in 2010. Accused of making anti-regime propaganda, he was forbidden to leave and barred from making movies for 20 years; this is the fourth feature he’s made since. [Read about how Jafar Panahi continues working.] The result is an immersive, pleasurably intelligent movie, one that weds documentary naturalism and melodramatic excess with formalist rigor. The intimate claustrophobia of the S.U.V. is an emblem of the larger interior-exterior divide faced by all the characters, particularly the women. When Behnaz exits the vehicle, she isn’t just a restless passenger; she is also an autonomous Iranian woman. Jafar’s presence — or rather Panahi’s — is similarly meaningful, given that he’s forbidden to leave Iran. So, he drives and makes movies, and throughout this one he uses the S.U.V.’s windshield and windows to throw a frame around the world, an insistent reminder of his identity, his art, his vision. After miles of dusty road, phone calls and character-revealing bickering, Behnaz and Jafar reach a village that becomes the backdrop for much of the story. There, they meet assorted gentle eccentrics, each further enhancing the nubby realism. There’s an old woman (very much alive) nestled in her dug grave, and an old man who makes a present of a foreskin. Behnaz and Jafar also solve the mystery created by Marziyeh, whose family is in an uproar over her desire to become an actress. The question of a woman’s proper role — onscreen and off — becomes a steady refrain, particularly with the introduction of Shahrzad, a legendary actress and the movie’s third, most elusive face. A village pariah, Shahrzad lives alone in a modest, isolated house and appears as a fugitive pretense: a silhouette in a window, a disembodied voice, a distant figure. But her presence fills the movie, partly because she serves as an affecting reminder of Iran’s past, much as the willful Marziyeh is an emissary of its future. Shahrzad also emerges as a kind of twin figure for Panahi, who has continued to make his art despite government censure. Working with modest means and astonishing determination, he makes movies that are at once acts of aesthetic will and of political resistance, as well as assertions of the existential sovereignty that here is etched in every last face.

2019,"‘7 Rings’ Is a Hit for Ariana Grande, and a Knockout for Rodgers and Hammerstein","This week, Ariana Grande’s “7 Rings” hit No. 1 on Billboard’s singles chart for the sixth time, the latest victory for a song that broke records when it was released in January and has since been streamed more than a billion times around the world. But when it comes to royalties for “7 Rings,” the biggest winner may be two songwriters who died decades ago: Rodgers and Hammerstein. Ms. Grande’s song is an extended reinterpretation of “My Favorite Things” from “The Sound of Music,” with Ms. Grande changing the original’s lyrics about innocent joys — “raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens” — to an anthem of empowerment through conspicuous consumption. “Breakfast at Tiffany’s and bottles of bubbles,” she sings, over a bass-heavy beat. “Buy myself all of my favorite things.” The song is credited to a total of 10 writers. But two of them — Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II — control 90 percent of the songwriting royalties, a remarkable split that reflects the value of evergreen song catalogs, and of the negotiating leverage their owners have when pop stars come seeking permission. In an especially speedy turnaround, the deal for “7 Rings” was decided a few weeks before the song’s release in January, when representatives for Ms. Grande and her label, Republic, brought the completed song to Concord, the music company that has owned the Rodgers and Hammerstein catalog since 2017. Concord requested 90 percent of Ms. Grande’s song, and her representatives accepted without further negotiation. Ms. Grande’s song “wouldn’t exist in its current form were it not for ‘My Favorite Things,’” Jake Wisely, Concord’s chief publishing executive, said in an interview. The deal means that Concord stands to make millions of dollars from the song, while Ms. Grande and her seven co-writers will each get just a fraction of what Concord makes. (The songwriting royalties are separate from the earnings Ms. Grande will make as the recording artist. Through her label, she declined to comment.) Theodore S. Chapin, the executive who has managed Rodgers and Hammerstein’s copyrights for decades, said he was initially taken aback by Ms. Grande’s song. But he quickly saw its value as a reinterpretation, and as a way of keeping the original’s legacy alive among Ms. Grande’s young fans. He also thought that Mary Rodgers, Richard Rodgers’s composer daughter, who died in 2014, “would have thought this is pretty kick-ass.” Although it has long had a conservative reputation for protecting its copyrights, the Rodgers and Hammerstein Organization has a distinct history of making commercial deals. Rodgers, who died in 1979, even approved a Clairol ad that changed a famous lyric from “South Pacific”: “I’m gonna wash that gray right outa my hair.” “The fact that Rodgers had agreed to that in his lifetime,” Mr. Chapin said, “gave all of us a little license to feel that we should keep an open mind on these kinds of things.” Yet the license for “7 Rings” is especially favorable to Rodgers and Hammerstein. When Gwen Stefani used some of the yodeling “Lonely Goatherd” (also from “The Sound of Music”) for a 2006 song, “Wind It Up,” Rodgers and Hammerstein received only 50 percent of the royalties. The difference between the two deals could reflect Concord’s greater negotiating power. Or, according to Lisa Alter, a lawyer who specializes in music copyright, it could just be that “My Favorite Things” is a more precious property. “It probably implies that more of the song is being used, or how iconic the original song is,” said Ms. Alter, who was not involved with the “7 Rings” deal. And what might Rodgers and Hammerstein themselves have thought of Ms. Grande’s song? Todd S. Purdum, the author of “Something Wonderful: Rodgers and Hammerstein’s Broadway Revolution,” said the masters of musical theater enjoyed being in the thick of popular culture. But most important, he said, they were never ashamed of commercial success. “They would love the ka-ching of it,” Mr. Purdum said.",The New York Times
2019,‘A State of Emergency’: Native Americans Stranded for Days by Flooding,"On the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota, extreme weather and bad roads have left some residents stranded for nearly two weeks with limited food and water. David Gibbons, left, and Shane Mesteth ride down a muddy road to the highway to gather food, water and medical supplies for residents on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota.CreditCreditKristina Barker for The New York Times PINE RIDGE, S.D. — Ella Red Cloud-Yellow Horse, marooned for days by a blizzard and then a flood, needed to get out. Supplies at her house were running low. She had come down with pneumonia. She had a chemotherapy appointment to keep. But her long driveway was blocked by mountains of mud — impassable even for an ambulance or a tractor. So Ms. Red Cloud-Yellow Horse, 59, set off toward the road on foot. She fell repeatedly, almost got swept away in the current of a creek, and became stuck in the mud. Finally, more than an hour later, she made it the half-mile to the highway where she was picked up. “I couldn’t breathe,” she said, “but I knew I needed to get to the hospital.” Such stories are startlingly common these days on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota — a stunning stretch of land larger than Delaware — as an overwhelming bout of snow and flooding has set off a humanitarian disaster that seems unlikely to abate soon. With some residents approaching two weeks stranded in their homes, and with emergency rations able to reach parts of the back country only by horse, boat and helicopter, Pine Ridge remains in a state of shock and triage. Officials with the Oglala Sioux Tribe, which administers the reservation, say they lack the training, manpower and equipment needed to deal with such a large-scale crisis. And there’s a pervasive sense on Pine Ridge, a place of long-strained relations with the state and federal governments, that help has been woefully slow to arrive, and that few people beyond the reservation know or care much about its plight. “This is a state of emergency right now,” said Henry Red Cloud, whose family’s losses in the flooding include five homes, a forklift, a truck, a van and the building where his solar energy business was based. Mr. Red Cloud now rides a flat-bottomed boat each night to the one home on his family’s property that is not a total loss. “What we need to be doing is building sandbag walls — not a southern border wall,” he said. Pine Ridge was far from alone in being hit with damaging quantities of snow and water this month. Huge portions of the Midwest were swallowed by rivers in the last 10 days, with devastating consequences for farms, roads and small riverfront towns. So far, at least three people are confirmed to have died, and the affected states have estimated that they have suffered more than a billion dollars in damage and economic harm. But while conversations about recovery were already underway in the hardest-hit portions of Nebraska and Iowa, where most roads have reopened and many rivers have started to recede, Pine Ridge, with a population of about 20,000, remained in a state of hour-to-hour chaos. Some of the tribe’s scarce heavy equipment was lost in the mud. Jail inmates were enlisted to fill sandbags. New parents worried as they ran low on infant formula. Unlike in Nebraska, where the National Guard rescued 111 people, including some by helicopter and boat, outside help for Pine Ridge was conspicuously scarce at first. South Dakota’s governor, Kristi Noem, has been seen by many Pine Ridge officials and residents as slow to respond. But Ms. Noem, who visited the reservation on Saturday, said that the tribe had only made formal requests for help in recent days, which she quickly approved. Since then, Ms. Noem said, the state had sent ATVs, a boat rescue team and a small group of National Guard soldiers to distribute drinking water. “When we became aware is when we responded,” Ms. Noem said in an interview after her visit. The reservation, in the southwestern part of the state, is among the most scenic places in the Great Plains states. Pine-crested buttes punctuate the skyline, open prairie stretches for miles, and creeks wind through pastures and yards. But the vast distances, scattered population and relatively untamed terrain can make it difficult to reach people in blizzards or floods. The tribal-led relief effort on Pine Ridge has been mired in challenges. Though employees pulled marathon shifts and slept in their work vehicles, there were simply not enough people or equipment to reach everyone needing help, residents said. Julian Bear Runner, the Oglala Sioux Tribe’s newly elected president, said many had voiced frustration with the tribal government’s response. “People are getting angry,” Mr. Bear Runner said, “and that’s understandable.” But he added, “We’re doing the best we can with what little we have.” He said resources had been stretched so thin that he had slept on his office floor most nights since the storm, and had driven his own pickup truck to respond to calls for help because there were too few tribal workers. “If we would have had state-of-the-art equipment, if we would have had adequate manpower, we could have gotten a lot done,” said Mr. Bear Runner, who said the state assistance, though late to arrive, was greatly appreciated. Tribal officials said the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs had also provided equipment and manpower to help. The crisis on Pine Ridge is a collision of nature, poverty and inadequate infrastructure. No sooner were Pine Ridge’s highways mostly cleared of snow than temperatures shot up, and the rush of newly melted water overflowed from creeks and rivers. The flooding — the worst in at least a generation, several residents said — turned the rugged dirt roads that many people live along into a liquefied mud soup. Adding to the urgency, late last week about 8,000 residents lost drinking water. “It’s gotten worse,” Mr. Bear Runner, the tribal president, said on Friday. Pine Ridge is a place accustomed to struggle, and its people have had well-publicized battles with alcoholism and teen suicide. Half the reservation’s residents live in poverty, according to the Census Bureau, and the unemployment rate is 20 percent, compared with about 3 percent for South Dakota as a whole. Many people on Pine Ridge live in aging houses a mile or more from a highway, and some depend on wood-burning stoves to keep warm. “The lack of resources, the lack of water, lack of transportation and the lack of facilities — this really compounds all of the issues,” said Valentina Merdanian, a tribal council member who on Friday was fielding calls from stranded constituents and trying to organize rescue crews. In the few quiet moments, some people expressed worry that the treacherous conditions could become a new normal. “With climate change, it’s getting worse and worse,” said Robert Pille, who had to leave his home because of the floods. “This is going to be a regular thing.” Mr. Bear Runner said there had been no time to tally up how many buildings were destroyed, how many rescues had been made or how many people remained unreached. “We didn’t have the proper training for the E.M.S.; we didn’t know what to do,” said Garfield Steele, the president of the reservation’s Wounded Knee District, the site of the 1890 massacre of Native Americans by United States soldiers and the 1973 siege by members of the American Indian Movement. Governor Noem, who took office in January, has a strained relationship with her state’s Native American nations, some of which requested that their tribal flags not be displayed at the State Capitol after she introduced and lawmakers passed a set of bills this month that would restrict protests. Mapping the severity of the region’s flooding, which has killed three people. Despite those tensions, several people on the reservation said they would have liked to see a more robust National Guard and state government presence during the storm response. As members of the tribe volunteered to cook meals and unload food delivery trucks on Friday, and as people checked on older neighbors who lived far from the highway, some of the biggest needs remained unmet. “We just need the technical skills,” said Mary Tobacco, who was helping lead recovery efforts, but who became stranded herself on Friday as rising water made it impossible to leave her home on a butte. (The water was moving too fast, she said, to make it out in her kayak.) Tribal officials were still working to determine whether as many as four more deaths in the past two weeks could be attributed to the storm, including some involving patients who needed medical help and could not be reached by ambulance. The tribe’s police chief, Robert Ecoffey, said on Friday that it was not known whether those people would have survived if an ambulance had reached them. In the meantime, some on Pine Ridge were hunkering down for what could be weeks more with little or no access to the outside world. Bernadine Rowland, stranded since March 12, said Saturday that she and her grandchildren had remained in good spirits and had passed the days by watching Netflix and YouTube videos. But her pantry had started to get bare — only two bags of beans left, plus some oatmeal and rice — and an attempted food delivery by horseback had to be aborted Friday afternoon because a creek that had to be crossed was running too high. Just before sunset Friday night, the horseback riders came back, this time by canoe, carrying big plastic bags full of macaroni and cheese, toilet paper, Hamburger Helper and canned pasta. “It was a relief,” Ms. Rowland said. “We’ll have something to last us for a while.”",The New York Times
2019,‘A Vigilante’ Review: Vengeance Is Hers,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. The monsters in “A Vigilante” look deceptively ordinary. One wears an everyday business suit and tie; another is dressed in a simple T-shirt and pants, though it’s hard to make out what he’s wearing because he’s trussed up, on his knees, beaten down. Abusers, each endures the kind of ostensibly righteous retribution that tends to be visited on men by other men in exploitation flicks like “Death Wish.” On occasion, a woman steps into the vigilante role — at times, after she’s raped, as in “I Spit on Your Grave” — seeking personal payback through a violent cleansing that can widen into a feminist critique. The writer-director Sarah Daggar-Nickson shrewdly doesn’t lead with politics in “A Vigilante,” instead letting them surface as a matter of course as she fills in the satisfyingly lean, mean story. It centers on Sadie (Olivia Wilde, all in physically), who after fleeing her husband has become a lone-wolf avenger of other abuse victims. They reach her by phone, leaving the same cryptic S.O.S. — “I’m looking out the window, and the trucks won’t stop coming” — before detailing where they live and when it’s safe for Sadie to visit. “I have two children who come home at 4, and I don’t want them to get hurt,” one woman tremulously explains in her message. “He’ll hurt them if I leave.” Vigilantism is a questionable fantasy of empowerment, but Daggar-Nickson makes her movie (largely) work by keeping everything — her antihero, the registers of violence — austere and persuasively low key. By the time the story opens, Sadie appears to have been at this vengeance business for some time. She has her routines and her disguises, and a map fixed to the wall. She’s either running or on the hunt; it’s unclear. She lives in what looks like a motel or just the saddest, emptiest of homes, where she sleeps with a large knife under her pillow. Every so often, she starts hyperventilating, spiraling into panic that is eased only by a drawing that she clutches to her like a lover or a child. Daggar-Nickson pieces together the puzzle of Sadie’s life with some sly misdirection. When the camera isn’t on Sadie pummeling a boxing bag or dispatching another domestic abuser, the story shifts to some women living in what appears to be a halfway house. At first, Sadie seems to be a peripheral presence here as the emphasis remains on the other women, their tears and terrors, as well as the warm, no-nonsense counselor (Tonye Patano) whose insistent encouragement elegantly helps fill in narrative blanks. When the counselor looks at all the women — reminding them how they “grabbed that freedom and got out of there” — Sadie and her story movingly shift into sharper focus. Whether Sadie’s embrace of vengeance is a radical form of therapy, an act of extreme political activism or just a dangerous way to exorcise personal demons remains open to interpretation. Daggar-Nickson gestures in certain directions, but for the most part she avoids deeper, troubling questions about retribution and violence. Instead, she concentrates on the genre basics, as in the movie’s admirably hard-core final face-off, even as she insists that we keep our attention fixed on Sadie. There’s something galvanizing about this woman, but also something agonizing about both her loneliness and the bloody, bruised fists that she keeps throwing — again and again and again.

2019,‘Abby’s’ Takes the Sitcom Somewhere New: Outdoors,"LOS ANGELES — “We got a plane!” Sitcom showrunners have no shortage of logistical worries, but air traffic isn’t generally among them. That is, unless you happen to be shooting your sitcom in a backyard beside the Burbank airport. And so it was that Josh Malmuth, the creator of the new sitcom “Abby’s,” stared at the sky one night last fall as his production ground to a halt, girding himself for another shoot to be interrupted every 15 minutes or so by an assistant producer with word of a plane, or a helicopter, or perhaps a drone. “And so it begins,” he muttered. Such are the wages of innovation. “Abby’s,” which debuts March 28 on NBC, is a 10-episode multicamera sitcom that is shot almost entirely outside, a simple-sounding tweak that nevertheless turns one of the hoariest of television conventions into something that, as far as anyone can tell, has never really been done before. Natalie Morales (“Parks and Recreation,” “White Collar”) stars as Abby, an ex-Marine who turns her backyard into a neighborhood watering hole, where an array of quirky regulars, including Neil Flynn (“The Middle”), Nelson Franklin (“Veep”) and Jessica Chaffin (“Search Party”), pass their evenings and tee up one another’s punch lines. It’s the same basic setup that has undergirded any number of workplace shows and other comedies based on improvised families. This includes perhaps the greatest of all sitcoms, “Cheers,” which also happens to be the series against which all other bar comedies will be measured. “The ‘Cheers’ comparisons have been what everybody talks about, and listen, we’ll take it,” Morales said. “That being said, there have been a lot of medical shows, a lot of law shows, and people hang out in bars a lot. So we were like, ‘I think it’s fine to do another bar show.’” The concept was inspired by Bacchanal, a New Orleans wine bar that consists largely of a graceful courtyard (and which figured in a rainy subplot in “Treme”). Malmuth, a San Diego native, moved the concept to his hometown and convinced Michael Schur, one of the most prolific sitcom makers in show business these days, to help him develop it. At first glance, Schur would seem to be an unlikely choice for a multicamera sitcom, the classic form — generally consisting of actors performing on a contained set before multiple cameras and a studio audience — that defined TV comedy for decades, from “I Love Lucy” to “All In the Family” to “The Cosby Show” to “Seinfeld” and “Friends.” Schur’s tightly serialized, philosophically inquisitive “The Good Place” is widely acclaimed for its narrative ambition, and the earlier filmic, single-camera shows he worked on, like “The Office” and “Parks and Recreation,” were instrumental in creating the perception that the multicamera format, with its stagy setups and broadly telegraphed jokes, was a relic of a simpler TV era. Even CBS’s soon-to-depart “Big Bang Theory,” TV’s top-rated show for much of the past decade and the longest-running multicamera sitcom in history, went single-cam for its spinoff, “Young Sheldon.” But Schur was intrigued by the idea, so he and Malmuth hopped in a golf cart and drove around the Universal lot in search of an ideal spot. They found it on the former Wisteria Lane, where the stars of “Desperate Housewives” once backstabbed (and front-stabbed, and actually stabbed) their way to ratings gold. After NBC gave the go-ahead, an outdoor studio was built behind the house that once belonged to Edie (the desperate housewife played by Nicollette Sheridan). The goal was to split the difference between a conventional set — with water- and windproof lighting rigs and a smooth, level concrete slab for easy camera movement — and a backyard, with strung lights, fire pits and largely unobstructed natural elements. “There’s an episode when you see Jessica’s hair blowing a little more than it probably would, but that’s part of being outside,” said Franco Bario, the co-executive producer who oversaw construction of the set. “The more it looks like a stage, the less important it is that we’re out here.” The set includes bleachers for the just over 100 people who provide what amounts to an outdoor laugh track — each episode opens by noting, in a nod to sitcom intros of yore, that “‘Abby’s’ was filmed before a live outdoor audience.” To reinforce the notion, the cameras will occasionally pull back before and after commercial breaks to show the crowd and set. “You see the audience; you see that we’re, like, literally on the side of a cliff in Universal Studios; you see the Los Angeles city lights; and then you see us on this weird little outdoor set, acting,” Morales said later. “It’s going to feel familiar, but it’s also going to feel very novel.” Schur said, “We worried a little about breaking the fourth wall, but the very premise of a multicam is constantly breaking the fourth wall — you’re hearing humans laughing.” Though they have plenty of well-regarded sitcoms between them — Malmuth was a writer and producer for “New Girl” and “Superstore” — the theatrical setting harkens back to earlier in their careers, when Malmuth wrote for the stage and Schur for “Saturday Night Live.” But they weren’t necessarily looking to reinvent an old format, they said in a joint interview shortly before the shoot, in another house up Wisteria Lane. “The objective wasn’t, let’s set out to rejuvenate the medium,” Schur said. “The objective was let’s execute this idea as well as we can, and then this is how we’re backing into that.” “We don’t want to do it on a stage with AstroTurf, so what can we do?” Malmuth said. That said, there is a replica of the bar set on a nearby soundstage to use for rehearsals and as a weather contingency plan. (“Abby’s” made it through its first season without a rainout.) But other things, like the menagerie of critters in the surrounding hills, you just have to deal with. The night I was there, a raccoon got into the craft services tent — “That’s a first,” Malmuth said when I told him — and skunks have been known to wander onto the set. Crickets are also an issue, though sound editors have to add them as often as subtract, for continuity’s sake. During one break in the filming, a baby gopher scampered down the driveway and blindly caromed off several people’s shoes before weaving its way back into the bushes. “Occasionally packs of wild coyotes come out of the hills and just maul an actor,” Schur said. (He was joking.) The odd mauling aside, a general feeling of festivity prevails on the set, with the crowd, crickets and flickering fires coalescing into something more akin to a summer-camp talent show than a network sitcom. During yet another chopper break, music thumped as a jovial M.C. whipped up the audience, who munched boxed dinners and huddled in blankets in the crisp (for Los Angeles) November night. “Apparently these planes and helicopters don’t care that we’re trying to make a TV show!” the M.C. said, and then pointed out Schur, eating onion rings by one of the cameras, who waved at the crowd. Leonard Ouzts, who plays one of the regulars, mingled with extras as production assistants lugged an enormous tuna onto the set for a scene involving an elaborate fish tale. “There are a bunch of jokes about how we’re going to have to shoo cats away and it’s going to start to stink, and those might just be prophetic,” Schur said. “If coyotes are ever actually going to come out of the hills, it’s going to happen tonight. So buckle up.” A picture caption that ran with an earlier version of this article misidentified the title of Michael Schur. He is an executive producer for “Abby’s,” not a creator.",The New York Times
2019,‘Airbnb Tax’ in N.J. Opens New Front in Battle Over Internet Economy,"[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] The Jersey Shore, a storied summer vacation spot, has become the newest national battleground over regulating and taxing the internet economy. New Jersey is one of the first big states to adopt a surcharge on short-term rentals — a so-called Airbnb tax. It kicked in Oct. 1 and is causing vacationers to rethink their summer travels and stirring anxiety among the homeowners who rely on them. The fallout over the 11.6 percent tax has inserted New Jersey into a broader debate as states and communities grapple with the explosive growth of the online home-sharing economy. A patchwork framework of local ordinances has failed to keep pace with the rapid rise of Airbnb, the largest home-sharing site, which was valued at $31 billion two years ago and has upended the rental market around the world. Much like Uber’s dominance has caused a regulatory challenge for cities and Amazon’s ascent has prompted states to adopt internet sales taxes, the popularity of Airbnb has begun to push lawmakers to impose new rules even as they find ways to tap the enormous revenue it generates. Massachusetts also recently passed a statewide tax on short-term rentals aimed at Airbnb and other home-sharing sites; a proposal to increase the sales tax on similar rentals has been introduced in Colorado. In New York City, Airbnb and local officials have been at war over efforts to crack down on the industry. A federal judge blocked a law in January that would have required Airbnb to provide detailed information about listings and hosts, and the city recently filed a lawsuit against a group of real estate brokers, accusing them of using Airbnb to illegally rent out dozens of apartments. State and local governments that have moved to rein in Airbnb and other home-sharing sites have set off alarm bells among those whose economic survival is tied to the short-term rental market and who are angry that they are being ensnared by new taxes and regulations. In Massachusetts, critics warn that the new tax will wreak havoc on the state’s vital summer tourism season in places like Cape Cod. The same arguments are being put forth in New Jersey. Vacationers are abandoning long-held traditions and heading elsewhere. Homeowners complain they are having a hard time filling properties when they should be well on their way to being fully booked for summer. And businesses that rely on free-spending summer visitors fear that the rental tax threatens their most important time of year. Susan Hiller said she was heartbroken to be heading to Palm Beach, Fla., with her four daughters and extended family for their annual summer vacation. While the groomed white sand and glassy teal waters of the exclusive locale are a siren song for vacationers, beckoning even President Trump, Ms. Hiller said it is just not the same as the Jersey Shore. “I’ve been going to Ocean City since I was 5 years old and I’m 51,” said Ms. Hiller, who lives outside Philadelphia. “It is truly my most favorite place on earth.” George Triebenbacher, 56, grew up on Long Beach Island in New Jersey and now owns seven properties there that he’s been renting out since 2010. His weekly rates vary — three homes rent for $1,650, three go for $5,500 and a larger home fetches $10,000. In past years, by this point in March, all his homes had typically been reserved for the summer. But this year, about one-fourth of his rental weeks are still available, he said, and some people who had initially reserved are backing out. “People are actually canceling and forgoing deposits to get away from the taxes,” he said. “There’s no question that there’s all kind of upheaval being created by this tax.’’ Debbie Mozer, 60, who owns a souvenir shop in Beach Haven, said summertime sales are crucial to her bottom line. “Everything depends on our sales for the summer,” Ms. Mozer said. “This is how we make our living.” The 130-mile long New Jersey coastline is one of the state’s most prized resources. The four Jersey Shore counties accounted for more than $20 billion of the $43 billion spent in New Jersey on tourism in 2017, the most recently available data, according to state officials. When the Trump administration unveiled a plan to drill for oil off the New Jersey coast, opposition to the proposal unified politicians of all stripes, from the progressive Democratic governor, Philip D. Murphy, to a conservative Republican representative, Chris Smith. Passage of the short-term rental tax flew largely under the radar last summer, overshadowed by the battle between Mr. Murphy and Democratic legislative leaders over a different tax — on the wealthy — that nearly shut down the state’s government. But now many along the shore say the rental tax places one of the state’s main summer economic engines in its cross hairs. The 11.6 percent tax applies to all rentals fewer than 90 days, including those made on home-sharing sites or directly between a renter and an owner. The only exceptions are rentals arranged through a Realtor, which are not subject to the tax. John Brennan owns a home on Long Beach Island that he is listing on Airbnb for $2,200 a week. By late winter he said he typically has 70 percent of the season booked. But so far, nothing has been rented. “They can’t just keep taxing us,” he said. Though it has frustrated renters and homeowners, Airbnb frames the tax as official recognition of its legitimacy, putting the company on equal footing with the hotel industry. “Home sharing is bringing economic opportunity to families and businesses in every corner of the Garden State,” Josh Meltzer, who oversees public policy for Airbnb in the Northeast, said in a statement. “We are excited to be able to support core state and local services from Jersey City to the Jersey Shore.’’ The controversy over the tax underscores how New Jersey and other states are struggling to ensure that newer e-commerce companies abide by the same rules that apply to more established businesses, said Kim Rueben, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan research group based in Washington. “As person-to-person rental has become a larger part of economy, states and localities are trying to figure out, ‘How do you go about collecting the taxes that are equivalent to what hotels collect?’” Ms. Rueben said. “This is probably something that people were always supposed to pay and they just weren’t collected.” Some homeowners and others on the Jersey Shore are fighting back, forming a group, the NJ Shore Rentals Coalition, to lobby lawmakers and Mr. Murphy to exclude shore rentals from the tax. A bill that would do that has been unveiled in Trenton, though it is unclear if it has enough support to pass. “The vast majority of the Jersey Shore are homes that were rented out long before the sharing culture that’s developed with Airbnb,” said Duane Watlington, vice president of the coalition. “We believe that if the unintended tax is not corrected, there will be less money spent on vacations, further exacerbating the need for tax revenues.” The Murphy administration has signaled that it would consider revising the tax to ease the burden on the Jersey Shore. “The administration stands ready to work with the Legislature to amend the law to more closely mirror the intent of our original budget proposal,” said Jennifer Sciortino, a spokeswoman for the state Treasury Department. Much of the anger around the new tax has come from the Jersey coast, but many short-term rentals are concentrated in northern New Jersey, where visitors to New York City can find cheaper lodging. Of the $133 million earned by Airbnb hosts in the state in 2018, more than half came from the three northern counties closest to New York. The four shore counties accounted for $48 million, though the majority of rentals there are condensed around the three-month summer season. Maria Vitale, who has rented out her home in Lavallette for nearly 10 years, is charging the same weekly price, $2,400, as last year, but said many would-be renters had been turned off by the additional $280 in taxes. “New Jersey people, we’ve been taxed enough,” she said. The tax is taking hold at a time when the coast is still not fully recovered from Hurricane Sandy, Ms. Vitale noted. Still, there are signs of optimism: Her kitchen is being used less, she said, as renters seek out restaurants that have begun to reopen after the devastating 2012 storm. “Knowing what the Jersey Shore went through six-plus years ago,” she said, “I don’t think this is the opportune time to tax them even more.” An earlier version of this article misstated the types of rentals to which the 11.6 percent tax applies. It is all rentals of fewer than 90 days, not 14 days.",The New York Times

2019,"Opinion | ‘An Angel From God,’ and Border Agents Took Her","Trump’s cruel separation of immigrant families continued after he declared he was ending the practice. Opinion Columnist President Trump claimed last June to have ended the practice of separating immigrant families at the southern border. “We are going to keep the families together,” he declared from the Oval Office. Mr. President, meet Clemente and his daughter Wendy, both fleeing gang violence in Guatemala. Your administration separated them six months ago and kept them apart. These family separations, continuing but at a lower level than before, are an element of the real “emergency” at the border — the one also involving physical and sexual abuse of immigrant children in U.S. custody and systematic deception from Washington. The paradox is that Trump’s cruel policy to deter desperate immigrants appears counterproductive; apparently the furor it provoked drew attention to the possibility of migration. The result is a surge of Central American families traveling to the United States, with the number crossing the border far higher than a year earlier. [Follow Nicholas Kristof as he travels around the United States and the world, shedding light on crises and hailing unsung heroes. For a behind-the-scenes look at Nick’s gritty journalism, sign up for his newsletter.] Clemente, 34, is from a small Guatemalan village. He doesn’t want to use his last name because of all he has been through at the hands of the U.S. government. There is no way to verify parts of his story, but individuals who work with immigrants say it rings true. A gang in Guatemala murdered his cousin, and last year gangsters stabbed Clemente’s father and sent warnings to Clemente: “It’s now your turn.” Terrified, Clemente fled with his eldest daughter, Wendy, then 15, leaving his wife and five other, younger children, whom he did not believe the gang would target. He feared that the gang would abduct Wendy, an excellent student who loves books, and he could not bear that thought. They crossed Mexico without serious incident, then waded across the Rio Grande and turned themselves in to Border Patrol officers, requesting asylum. That was Aug. 20, two months after Trump said he had ended the family separation policy. But officials promptly separated Clemente and Wendy. Clemente was put in a “hielera,” or ice box, notorious detention rooms predating Trump that are kept cold. Clemente, wet from the river crossing, was soon freezing as well as hungry and weak because he had given his food to Wendy. “As a dad, the last thing you want is for your daughter to suffer,” he explained simply. “So I gave everything to her.” In this frail state, he caught pneumonia and passed out. Many hours went by before he was taken to a hospital, unconscious and gravely ill. Inadequate health care in detention centers is common, and two migrant children died in December in Border Patrol custody. “I woke up in the hospital, and I didn’t know where I was,” Clemente told me. “It was a nightmare. My first question was, ‘Where’s my daughter?’” After he was released from the hospital and later from detention, he found himself on the streets of Brownsville, Tex. “He was distraught and he was crying,” recalled Sergio Cordova, a volunteer in Brownsville who does heroic work with immigrants, funded by donations, and discovered Clemente at the bus station. “I gave him a hug and he started saying he can’t find his daughter, he doesn’t know where his daughter is.” Eventually, Clemente discovered that she was in a shelter. She was allowed to telephone him once a week, but not return to his care; his voice broke as he described her as “an angel from God.” Immigration is a complicated challenge, but ripping families apart isn’t the solution. Perhaps the best approach is to help improve security in Central America so that people like Clemente need not flee. Some anti-gang initiatives there have been very successful in reducing murder rates that drive migration. “If it were peaceful, I’d like to be back there where I grew up,” said Clemente, who received help from Immigrant Families Together in his quest to reunite with his daughter. “I’d love to be in the land where I was born.” The Texas Civil Rights Project found that at least 272 adults were separated from a child family member in the six months after Trump supposedly ended family separation. The youngest to be separated was an 8-month-old girl taken from her mother. Officials are less likely now to separate parents from children, but they continue to separate grandparents from grandchildren, siblings from siblings. The day I spoke with Cordova, the volunteer, he was helping two brothers from Honduras who had no other family left: Junior, 21, had raised Andy, 7. When gang members brutally beat up Junior for refusing to sell drugs for them, he fled with Andy to the United States — and officials separated them on arrival six months ago. So little Andy is now in a shelter, apart from the only person who has loved and protected him. “I see this all the time,” Cordova told me. “They cry with me, I cry with them.” Finally, there was a break in Clemente’s case. On Wednesday night, the authorities released Wendy to him. After six months apart, they had a teary reunion. “I thought I might never get her back again,” Clemente said. “I am very thankful.” So, yes, President Trump, you’re right that there’s an emergency at the border. It’s a humanitarian crisis of family separation that you helped create. The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

2019,"‘An Elephant Sitting Still’ Review: Bleak, Graceful Realism","Critic’s Pick When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. The much-talked-about elephant in Hu Bo’s “An Elephant Sitting Still” never appears onscreen, but it isn’t an imaginary beast. The sedentary pachyderm is rumored to live in Manzhouli, a city in the Inner Mongolia region of northern China, some distance from the gray industrial city where the film’s characters struggle and suffer. The elephant is a lure and a metaphor, a teasing reminder of a natural wonder and creaturely variety that is otherwise barely in evidence. This rigorously bleak, powerfully absorbing feature — nearly four hours long, shot in subdued colors and slow takes — posits a world from which nearly all fellow-feeling has been drained. Envy, mistrust, manipulation and blunt aggression govern human relations. Pleasure is scarce. Taking place over a single day and following the overlapping, increasingly desperate itineraries of four people, “An Elephant Sitting Still” encompasses two suicides, several beatings, a shooting and the death of a dog. If anything, this summary undersells the misery. Those periodic eruptions of violence are like bubbles breaking the surface of a steadily simmering pot. Cruelty and alienation go all the way down. Yu Cheng (Zhang Yu), a handsome, hollow-cheeked midlevel gangster, is having an affair with his best friend’s wife. The friend comes home and discovers the adulterous pair together, and jumps out the window to his death. Wei Bu (Peng Yuchang), a student at a second-rate high school, plots revenge against the bully who torments and humiliates him. (The bully happens to be Yu Cheng’s younger brother.) Their plan fails, but also succeeds in the worst possible way. Meanwhile, Wei Bu’s classmate Huang Ling (Wang Yuwen) is involved in a tawdry relationship with a school administrator. Wang Jin (Liu Congxi), a retired military officer, is being pressured to move into a retirement home by his upwardly mobile son and daughter-in-law. Their paths cross and recross, though not in the magical-thinking, we’re-all-connected style of the multistranded narratives — “Babel” and “Crash,” for instance — that were especially fashionable in world cinema in the early and mid-2000s. Even as Hu’s suspenseful, surprising story draws the characters toward one another, his somber, careful compositions emphasize their isolation and the social conditions that make solitude a protective strategy. If there is occasional tenderness — between Wang Jin and his young granddaughter, or more tentatively between Wei Bu and Huang Ling — it seems fragile and fleeting, unlikely to survive brutal Darwinian reality. Everyone is expected to be selfish, suspicious, status-obsessed and mean, and most people live up to the expectation. “An Elephant Sitting Still” shows the influence of Jia Zhangke, modern China’s cinematic laureate of disaffection and dislocation. (His new film, “Ash Is Purest White,” will open in North America soon.) But it also shows a restless and original visual sensibility. Unsparing as Hu’s anatomy of moral drift may be, there is something graceful in his sympathetic attention to lives defined almost entirely by disappointment and diminished hope. Unlike the titular elephant, the film never stops moving, and by the end, instead of feeling beaten down, the viewer is likely to feel moved as well. But such catharsis is shadowed by the knowledge that this will be Hu’s only film — the ambitious and imperfect testament to a career that ended when the 29-year-old director took his life in 2017. It is, of course, a mistake to draw too literal a connection between that awful fact and the unhappiness onscreen, but it’s also hard to avoid the impression that this persuasive portrait of a society in crisis is also a deeply personal statement. An act of solemn, disciplined and passionate protest. An earlier version of this article misstated the title of the director Jia Zhangke’s new film.

2019,‘Ash Is Purest White’ Review: Love Smolders and Crime Pays in a Changing China,"Critic’s Pick When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. Back at the turn of the millennium, in the northern Chinese industrial city of Datong, Qiao and Bin are an underworld power couple. Not quite Bonnie and Clyde — too disciplined, too businesslike — but with more than a hint of old Hollywood gangster style. In the provincial dance halls and gambling parlors where Bin holds court in the first chapter of “Ash Is Purest White,” he and Qiao carry themselves with glamour and authority. Bin (Liao Fan) gazes through a permanent haze of cigarette smoke, his handsome poker face occasionally betraying a hint of amusement or surprise. Qiao (Zhao Tao), from a more respectable background, amplifies her lover’s charisma with her own. They are the brightest stars in a constellation of hustlers, sycophants, tough guys and wannabes, whose admiration is streaked with envy and fear. Nobody is cooler. Packets of money change hands, and eventually a gun is fired, but “Ash Is Purest White,” Jia Zhangke’s enthralling new feature, isn’t really a crime drama. The aura of romantic, outlaw chic that hovers around Bin and Qiao soon dissipates, replaced by the clearer, grimmer air of reality. Jia, an essential figure in China’s “sixth generation” of filmmakers and one the most inventive and engaged directors of the 21st century, has long concerned himself with the effect of enormous social and economic forces on the intimate experiences of individuals. His movies, fictional and nonfictional alike, document the transformation of cities, landscapes and ways of life as those upheavals affect families, couples and groups of friends. Viewed from one angle — from the ground level of its plot — the scale of “Ash Is Purest White” can seem modest. It’s the story of two people whose love collapses under the weight of bad luck and betrayal but who can’t manage to quit each other. When Bin is attacked by members of a rival gang, Qiao saves his life. Rather than rat him out, she accepts a five-year prison sentence, after which she goes looking for Bin, who has left their home province, Shanxi. Earlier, he had told her about traditional criminal code of “righteousness and loyalty,” but she seems to be the only one committed to upholding it. On her way to find him — it’s now 2006 — she takes a ferry down the Yangtze River, through the area soon to be inundated by the construction of the Three Gorges Dam. Later, she will find herself on a train heading west, striking up a friendship with a man bound for the province of Xinjiang. Even without a detailed knowledge of China’s geography or its recent history, a viewer feels the dislocation and momentum of accelerating change — and something of the country’s sheer vastness and density. There is always something new. By the time “Ash Is Purest White” returns to Datong, in the present day, the city is almost unrecognizable. But Jia’s perspective is neither nostalgic nor optimistic. His movies don’t imagine a stable past to be mourned or longed for. (Since 2000, his non- or semi-documentary features, all essential, are “Platform,” “Unknown Pleasures,” “Still Life,” “The World,” “A Touch of Sin,” “24 City” and “Mountains May Depart.”) Nor do they project a happy future on the horizon. His world is in constant motion, and his refusal to hurry through it — the grace of his camera movements, the sometimes agonizing slowness of his scenes — can be understood as a kind of protest, a reminder of the ethical necessity of paying attention. The most consistent focus of Jia’s attention is Zhao Tao, who has appeared in nearly all of his works since the 2000 film “Platform.” (They have been married since 2012.) At once delicate and indomitable, down to earth and otherworldly, she has come to figure in his filmography as both an Everywoman and a quasi-mythic being, a woman whose heroism resides in her refusal to disappear. From film to film, playing a variety of characters, she moves through industrial wastes and high-rise developments, night life and factory work, love and crime, wielding her individuality as a shield and a weapon. Qiao’s resourcefulness in “Ash Is Purest White” is a source of both pathos and encouragement. She is a survivor, and perhaps because of that she endures more than her share of suffering. But the film as a whole is too rich with incident and surprise to be bleak. Jia has always had a sly sense of comedy, and an appreciation of spectacle. He lingers at drunken parties, appreciates the solemn ridiculousness of ballroom dancers performing at a funeral and revels in the full-throated emotion of a cheesy love song. The high point of Qiao and Bin’s relationship may be when they dance together to the Village People’s “Y.M.C.A.” — a pop-culture cliché that Jia embraces even as he mocks it. The strangest moment in “Ash Is Purest White” is surely the appearance of a U.F.O., an event that is all the more astonishing for being without any particular consequences. The lights streak through the night sky, and down below life keeps going. This may be a reminder of the vastness of the universe, a symbol of mysteries beyond reckoning, or a bit of mischief on the director’s part. It’s not the first time the possibility of extraterrestrial life has popped up in one of Jia’s movies, which are in every other respect the opposite of science fiction. Except, perhaps, insofar as the truest human feeling he recognizes is alienation.

2019,‘Avengers: Endgame’ Trailer: A New Face Appears,"You can be forgiven if you feel as if you’ve seen it all before when you start watching the new trailer for “Avengers: Endgame.” Disney has already released two other promotional clips for its forthcoming superhero movie, and the latest uses footage from previous films going all the way back to “Iron Man,” which officially kicked off the Marvel Cinematic Universe in 2008. As Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) himself puts it, “God, it seems like a thousand years ago, I fought my way out of that cave, became Iron Man.” Scenes from later films in the series, including “Captain America: The First Avenger” and “Thor,” follow. It all seemingly culminates with the conclusion to the cliffhanger from last year’s “Avengers: Infinity War,” in which many of the titular crime-fighters disintegrated, and the survivors vowed to, yes, avenge their apparent deaths. Finally, after the film’s title flashes on the screen, there’s a new face: Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) — fresh off her $500 million-plus opening week at the worldwide box office — appears, and Thor (Chris Hemsworth) declares, “I like this one.” Whether moviegoers have a similar feeling about “Avengers: Endgame” will be determined when the film hits theaters on April 26.",The New York Times
2019,‘Avocado Toast’ Is Now a Paint Color,"What, you thought the home décor industry was going to escape millennial disruption? Benjamin Moore offers consumers a choice of more than 3,500 paint colors. Sherwin-Williams, a competitor, sells a more limited but still substantial palette of 1,500 hues. To buy either brand, you generally have to visit a hardware store or big-box retailer like Lowe’s, select from an array of color chips and wait while the paint is mixed by an employee. You may have to buy sample cans to test the paint on your walls at home, and make a return trip to the store, before you settle on the right color. It’s not exactly a soulful task, but for decades it was a manageable one. Or perhaps it wasn’t. Because as with so many consumer categories that have been transformed over the past decade by tech entrepreneurs, from mattresses to eyewear to hailing a cab, paint is being “disrupted.” Two new brands — Clare and Backdrop — have emerged in the past eight months, selling paint through their websites. Convenience and a friction-free life, ideally one in which any desire can be fulfilled through clicking and swiping, is the millennial consumer’s utopia, and now that utopia has colors of its own, with generationally appropriate names like Clare’s “No Filter” (a “light beige with warm undertones”). Say goodbye to the hardware store, because now you choose the paint online and have it shipped to your home. Say goodbye to testing paint on your walls, because now the samples are disposable peel-away stickers. Say goodbye, too, to choice overload, because Clare and Backdrop each offer a “curated” selection of about 50 colors. That’s less than half of the 132 colors offered by Farrow & Ball, the high-end British brand that previously marketed an edited palette. (One Kings Lane, with its new direct-to-consumer paint collection, offers an even more edited 32 hues.) Brad Sherman, a designer in New York who specializes in commercial design for tech companies like Casper and Food52, said he was recently served an ad for Backdrop on Instagram and was intrigued. “I felt it was about time somebody looked at disrupting this industry,” Mr. Sherman said. “The branding, the repackaging of the paint can, the tools. Looking at chips, the color is never accurate.” It can be difficult at first to tell Clare and Backdrop apart (just as with Uber and Lyft in the ride-hailing business). Both are New York-based companies founded by young people who wax on about “storytelling” and “pain points.” Both tout their eco-friendly bona fides. Both offer a subdued selection of colors sure to look great on Instagram, and at prices comparable to most midrange paints (about $45 per gallon). And where Farrow & Ball made an art out of twee names (Elephant’s Breath, anyone?), Clare and Backdrop give it an on-trend spin: Clare’s natural green is Avocado Toast; Backdrop’s warm beige is Palo Santo. First-mover advantage, however, goes to Clare, which debuted last July, four months ahead of Backdrop. With its uncluttered design and simple navigation, Clare’s website is perhaps better at conveying the mood of domestic ease, while the brand’s colors “seem to be a little brighter, a littler clearer,” than Backdrop’s, said Annie Elliott, an interior designer and blogger in Washington, D.C., who goes by the nom de plume Bossy Color. “I’m a sucker for kits, and that adorable yellow Clare box — sign me up,” Ms. Elliott said, referring to the brand’s five-piece tool kit, which sells for $25. Clare’s founder, Nicole Gibbons, 37, is a former interior designer who appeared on the TV show “Home Made Simple,” on the OWN network. Working with clients on the show and through her interiors firm showed her how lost people were about painting without an expert guide. “Like white, for example. You would think white was just white. Easy,” Ms. Gibbons said. “But you go to any other company and there are usually a hundred or more whites to choose from. People start to get confused and doubt.” Taking a “hyper-curated” approach, Ms. Gibbons offered only three whites with Clare, and one paint finish for walls (eggshell) and one finish for trim (semigloss). She also developed a “color genius” tool that asks questions about your space and spits out a recommended hue. “The whole premise of Clare is to simplify, so by the time you’re at the end of this process, it’s joy, not hassle,” Ms. Gibbons said. “Sometimes people just want fewer, better choices.” Caleb and Natalie Ebel, the married founders of Backdrop, also espouse fewer, better, but unlike Ms. Gibbons, they celebrate the messiness of painting. Colors are represented on their site as gooey drops of wet paint, and the imagery in their ad campaign is of people ready to paint, not static, furnished rooms. The Ebels, both in their early 30s, have no background in design or color theory. Ms. Ebel worked in marketing and branding for an education nonprofit, while Mr. Ebel, who has a finance degree, touts his early experience at Warby Parker (“I worked at Warby Parker” is the new “I was at Woodstock”). With Backdrop, the Ebels have applied personal branding and style signifiers to a business “void of any emotion,” Mr. Ebel said. Thus, Backdrop’s neutral beige is named Ryokan Guesthouse because two years ago, before their daughter was born, the Ebels spent their babymoon in Japan. They are developing Spotify playlists for each color. Inspired by olive-oil canisters, they redesigned the boring round paint can; the Backdrop can is square, with a rubber stopper that gives what Mr. Ebel called “a beautiful pour.” In addition to paint and tools, the Ebels sell branded work T-shirts, drop cloths and coveralls. Indeed, they say they want to make painting appear so fun and easy that people will be inspired to change their walls every six months. Isn’t that exhausting? “Well, it’s the cheapest way to transform your space,” Ms. Ebel said. Fifty percent of Backdrop’s customers don’t bother testing samples, she added: “They’re commenting on social that they’re purchasing paint because of the names. When your backdrop is Surf Camp, you’re much more able to remember that versus just blue.” Ms. Elliott, the designer, said she is unlikely to buy paint based on a catchy name. At the moment, one go-to is Benjamin Moore’s Simply White, a shade she has used time and again. But, she admitted, “this is for a generation of folks who are probably not going to hire a designer anyway. It’s for someone who wants to spend a Saturday changing the room for not a lot of money. And for that, I see the appeal.”",The New York Times
2019,‘Babylon’ Review: A Clear View of Black Londoners When Few Films Saw Them,"Critic’s Pick When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. “Babylon” is a 39-year-old nugget of a movie about young British Jamaicans and their itinerant reggae scene built around sound systems, freestyling and parties with rich, low lighting. The film is making its American debut on Friday at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, and it’s got an episodic vividness and blanket-load of warmth, but also a harsh view of day-to-day life for black people in South London — on its streets, in its public housing, at its video arcades. If the police aren’t trying to shake down and beat up these guys, some fed-up white lady has come to their chill spot to complain (not unreasonably) that their music is too loud by telling them (unreasonably) to go back to their country and calling them “jungle bunnies.” The movie is more interested in what feels real than what seems right. What was real, when the movie opened in Britain in November 1980, was the poverty and racism its characters dealt with. Apparently, it was too real. The movie arrived with an X rating, which, in Britain, was basically like an R. But it ensured that the young black people whom “Babylon” was primarily made for wouldn’t have been let into a theater to see it. The thinking might have been that censors would have been saving young impressionable audiences from themselves. That kind of paternalism is, in some way, the force being retaliated against. The movie comprises a bunch of tangents (a minor music deal, some vandalism, an engagement ceremony). But a soulful, genial mechanic named Blue (played by Brinsley Forde, a guitarist in the British reggae outfit Aswad) provides the film’s spine: his rocky home life, love life and career prospects (he doesn’t keep his repair job for long; he dallies with a couple of thugs who lure then rob a gay white man). Blue’s close bond with a white kid named Ronnie (Karl Howman) and his love of reggae are just about all the stability he has. And once the racial stress of the neighborhood asserts itself into their group of friends, that bond seems rickety, too. Franco Rosso directed “Babylon” from a script he wrote with Martin Stellman. And you can receive it as a toothsome scrapbook of a moment in time — a future Oscar winner, Chris Menges (“The Killing Fields”), shot the film, and the reggae polymath Dennis Bovell did the music. Critics then — like, the filmmakers, white men — seemed to get the movie’s politics, immediately hailing “Babylon” as a crucial imaginative, representative step forward for a stagnant film industry, despite more than one writer feeling compelled to grapple with such an abundance of dreadlocks. Both anger and wonder course through the proceedings, and I’m not sure Rosso and Stellman knew what more to do about either than observe them, more the way an Italian neorealist director would than a psychologist might. The film’s reggae culture makes it natural kin of Jamaican jams like “Rockers” and “The Harder They Come.” But “Babylon” is a British movie about disaffected British people (disaffected British men), and, as such, seems just as seminal an entry in the English “angry young man” sweepstakes as the plays, novels and movies about alienation made in the 1960s. The final five minutes are bleakly abrupt, like being dropped off a cliff. And yet all of that observation in “Babylon” amounts to something that still feels new. You’re looking at people who, in 1980 England, were, at last, being properly, seriously seen.

2019,"‘Be Kind, Rewind’: Remembering the Golden Age of Blockbuster","With only one Blockbuster outlet soon to be left in the world, readers share memories of the chain’s glory days. A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, before Netflix and Hulu and even the World Wide Web, movies were released on VHS. And when they were, entire families would pile into a car on Friday night, drive to the local Blockbuster video store, and race to the new releases shelf hoping to find their evening’s entertainment. Sometimes they left with the last copy in the store — one that, perhaps, they fought other customers for as someone else dropped it off. Now, thanks to the rise of Netflix and, to a lesser extent, a shift in shopping preferences, there will soon be only one Blockbuster left in the world, in Bend, Ore., The Times’s Tiffany Hsu reported Wednesday. In our comments section and on social media, her article prompted an outpouring of memories from readers. Here is a selection of their comments, which have been lightly edited and condensed for clarity. What do you remember about Blockbuster? Yes, strangely enough, I also miss them. I’m not a big movie fan — but they were great on a Saturday evening. I remember returning them and watching the clerk quickly open and view the tape to see if I had rewound it. A quick dismissive glance, if I had not, would almost chill the bones. Online today you need to already know what you want to view. You locate it, purchase and view it. In the day of the rentals, you would walk along the aisles and view the titles. You would see movies you had never heard of before but interested you, or view ones that you had once enjoyed but had long forgotten. You would then carry home your small treasures. It is too bad that multiple methods cannot coexist these days. Why must it always be one method only? Surely there could be a market for both streaming and renting! Oh well, I guess not. — Billy Ford, 69, Hudson Valley, N.Y. I miss Blockbuster. My local one made me an honorary employee back in the ’90s, and even gave me a badge, because I rented so many movies. There is nothing like holding the box in your hands and reading about the movie inside. Looking at them online just doesn’t compare. — Stewart Wilber, 72, San Francisco I miss my video store. The pleasure of going to the store, reviewing the titles on the boxes and coming home with a rental is something sadly missing with today’s streaming services. When I lived in the UK, our local video store rented videos and sold wine (really!), so picking up a video and something to drink with it became a ritual. Sadly gone. — Peter Chapman, 72, Ottawa There was a girl who worked at my local store who knew her movies. She was amazing! She’d make recommendations based off what we saw and liked and we were never disappointed. I miss being able to go to someone who really knows their movies and their customer. — Andi Janas, 30, Kailua, Hawaii, via Facebook Every time I try to pick a movie on Netflix, I miss the Blockbuster employees. They really knew my preferences, indeed. — Otávio Frederico da Costa Roma, 38, Rio de Janeiro, via Facebook I worked at Blockbusters in Nanuet, N.Y. and Airmont, N.Y., on summers off from college, from 1997-1999. Best job I ever had. Still keep in touch with all my co-workers. In the Nanuet store on a Saturday night the lines were out the door. People would open the dropbox and fight for copies of “Braveheart” and “Casino.” We had to put a lock on the box inside the store so no one dumped it. I’m a movie wiz because of that job. — Michelle Howe 41, Haverstraw, N.Y., via Facebook My family didn’t have a lot of money growing up, we lived in a very small apartment and I didn’t have many friends at that young age. My dad recognized that and saved up enough money to get me a Super Nintendo for Christmas one year. It was rare for a while to own more than one or two games for it. But some of my fondest memories are of him coming home after payday with a Blockbuster case and being able to play the latest Mario game with him. It’s wild that something so simple can be so meaningful. Of course it takes about 30 years to realize and appreciate the significance and value of your parents just trying their best, but better late than never. Blockbuster is just one of those nostalgia things for a lot of people. — Jordan Geml, 34, Detroit, via Facebook Be kind, rewind. Kids today are missing out on so much. — Tara Mokren, 34, Hamilton, Ohio, via Facebook Thank you, Blockbuster! If it wasn’t for you, with the late fees, rewind fees and long lines, Netflix would never have had the room to enter the market with DVD by mail program. You rock! — Jeff Notz, 50, Manassas, Va.

2019,‘Be Weak & Die!’ Seeking Clues Behind Trump’s Weekend Twitter Barrage,"WASHINGTON — There was no golf. There were no meetings. There were no activities, other than a rare visit to church. So President Trump did what he could do: He tweeted. Since his election, Mr. Trump has averaged about 16 tweets per weekend, according to a New York Times analysis of his tweets as collected by the Trump Twitter Archive website. But last weekend proved to be an unusually active 48 hours online for Mr. Trump: From Friday morning to Sunday evening, Mr. Trump tweeted over 50 times, counting the retweets that amplified supporters who have limited public reach on their own. Ensconced in the White House, Mr. Trump saw enemies everywhere, and his tweets reflected that, stoking new tensions and nursing past grievances. He took on “Saturday Night Live,” which on March 16 aired a rerun from Christmas, and suggested that the Federal Communications Commission “look into” late-night shows and examine them for anti-Trump bias. He accused Senator John McCain, who died of brain cancer last year, of collaborating with Democrats and claimed that Mr. McCain, a former prisoner of war, was “last in his class” at the Naval Academy. (Mr. McCain actually graduated fifth from the bottom.) And he defended Tucker Carlson and Jeanine Pirro, the Fox News opinion hosts who have been under fire for making bigoted statements, encouraging Fox executives to “stay strong” in the face of criticism. Mr. Trump’s advisers have shared with him data showing that even his supporters do not like the tweet storms, and have advised him to act more “presidential” as his re-election campaign draws nearer. At rallies, even die-hard Trump fans who arrive early dressed in “MAGA” gear admit that while they are willing to overlook the president’s online musings, they would prefer seeing fewer of them. Mr. Trump often likes to buck the advice he gets, and it was clear over the weekend that he was trusting his gut again, and going his own way. “Stop working soooo hard on being politically correct, which will only bring you down, and continue to fight for our Country,” he said in a tweet on Sunday that appeared to be directed at Fox executives who had temporarily removed Ms. Pirro from her Saturday night slot after she suggested that Representative Ilhan Omar, Democrat of Minnesota and one of the first two Muslim women elected to Congress, may practice Shariah law. “The losers all want what you have, don’t give it to them. Be strong & prosper, be weak & die!” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. He also singled out two weekend Fox News anchors, Arthel Neville and Leland Vittert, who are less opinionated than the late-night hosts who double as the president’s personal friends and informal advisers, asking rhetorically whether they were “trained by CNN prior to their ratings collapse.” Later on Sunday, he shared a homemade meme from a little-known Twitter user, who goes by the handle @LonewolfnDuke, which depicted him as “an American president having to fight an American government to protect American citizens.” But it was unclear what had provoked the president’s flurry of activity, and even advisers were searching for the normal cues that set him off: White House officials performing poorly on the Sunday show circuit, or the president’s delayed distillation of negative coverage from the week before. Mr. Trump on Friday was rebuked by Senate Republicans, 12 of whom voted with Democrats against a national emergency to build a border wall. But the border barely figured into Mr. Trump’s weekend tweets, which appeared to be driven more by idle hands and an empty weekend schedule. People who spoke with Mr. Trump on the phone over the weekend said he seemed to be in good spirits. Others who communicated with him said he had spent some time railing privately against Andrew G. McCabe, the former deputy F.B.I. director. But they also said he appeared to be a little aimless, and the outpouring seemed to be more driven by a lack of structure. Mr. Trump had skipped his regular weekend trip to Mar-a-Lago, his Florida estate, because of a family commitment that kept him grounded in Washington. There was a four-hour lull in Mr. Trump’s online activity on Sunday, when he left the White House to visit St. John’s Church for St. Patrick’s Day. But for the most part, the president — bored, agitated or both — appeared to spend the weekend online. Mr. Trump shared with his 59.1 million followers a report circulating on right-wing sites that Minnesota Democrats had grown unhappy with Ms. Omar, and accused a “Democrat” union leader in Ohio of standing in the way of putting an idling General Motors plant in the state back into operation. Jack Posobiec, a Trump supporter known for advancing conspiracy theories on Twitter, including “Pizzagate,” marveled that his messages were being retweeted by the leader of the free world. The president shared two tweets initially sent by Mr. Posobiec, one a local news article about an MS-13 gang stabbing, and another criticizing CNN over a segment examining the links between Mr. Trump and white nationalism. “I realize the president’s just reading my Twitter account going through the tweets,” Mr. Posobiec said in a 13-minute video he posted analyzing the experience. “Let’s see what else he’s up to today.” As is often the case, there was a correlation between what appeared on Mr. Trump’s Twitter feed and the programming on Fox News. The weekend tour into conspiracy theories kicked off on Friday, when Mr. Trump elevated a nascent movement that calls itself “Jexodus,” the brainchild of a conservative Jewish activist that describes itself as a group of “proud Jewish millennials tired of living in bondage to leftist politics.” “The ‘Jexodus’ movement encourages Jewish people to leave the Democrat Party,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter, although there is no evidence to suggest that Jewish voters have been deserting the party. But Mr. Trump appeared to be reacting to an appearance on “Fox & Friends” by the group’s spokeswoman, Elizabeth Pipko, a former model and Trump 2016 campaign staff member. Brian Ott, who studies the effects of rhetoric at Texas Tech University and is the author of a book studying Mr. Trump’s tweets, said the president appeared to have become less concerned with the consequences of his messaging. “Not only is it already getting worse,” Dr. Ott said, “I don’t think we’ve even seen the tip of the iceberg yet. As these investigations begin to close in on him, really his only play is to stoke vitriol and violence.” Tweeting has also become a normal part of how the president circumvents the news media and his own advisers to communicate to the public what is on his mind. But the weekend whirlwind was so unusual that it created its own mini news cycle, with targets using their own platforms to respond and aides fielding questions from reporters about the president’s mental state. Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, defended him on Monday morning after her husband, George Conway, spent the weekend raising concerns about “Narcissistic Personality Disorder” and said on Twitter that Mr. Trump’s “condition is getting worse.” “No, I don’t share those concerns,” Ms. Conway told reporters outside the White House. Meghan McCain, a host of “The View” and the daughter of Mr. McCain, said the attacks — which included a presidential retweet of a woman who claimed that “Millions of Americans truly LOVE President Trump, not McCain” — only made her feel bad for Mr. Trump’s family. “I can’t imagine having a father that does this on the weekends,” Ms. McCain said.",The New York Times
2019,"‘Beat the Devil,’ the Bogart Flop That Spawned a Cult","Streaming John Huston’s “Beat the Devil,” the Humphrey Bogart vehicle once advertised as a decade ahead of its time, is now an official senior citizen, having opened in New York 65 years ago this month. One of the first Hollywood productions to be hailed as a cult film, this parodic thriller about a bumbling scheme to loot Africa’s uranium mines was an outlier in the successful Huston-Bogart collaborations. With Huston directing from a script doctored by Truman Capote, the film was initially promoted as a romantic adventure in the tradition of “Casablanca.” On its release in 1954, however, “Beat the Devil” baffled audiences, who didn’t get the in-jokes and plot twists and turns. Bogart stars as a middle-aged fixer hired by a ragtag group of crooks who become entangled with a seemingly innocent British couple (Jennifer Jones and Edward Underdown). Given the movie’s shaggy-dog quest, Huston evidently imagined “Beat the Devil” as another “Maltese Falcon,” his first film, even casting Peter Lorre, a featured player in “Maltese Falcon,” for good luck, with the portly Robert Morley standing in for Sydney Greenstreet, a seeker of the falcon. Visiting the town of Ravello on Italy’s Amalfi Coast, where “Beat the Devil” was being filmed, a New York Times reporter noted that Huston was harking back to another one of his Bogart triumphs, “The Treasure of the Sierra Madre.” The gale of laughter that ends “Beat the Devil” does recall “Sierra Madre,” but this time the joke was on Huston. “A potential treat emerged as a wet firecracker in some sixty-eight neighborhood theaters yesterday where United Artists unveiled its singularly unorthodox ‘Beat the Devil,’” the Times review said, comparing the movie unfavorably to its source, a potboiler of a novel pseudonymously written by the left-wing journalist Claud Cockburn. Huston, a friend of Cockburn’s, prodded Bogart to buy the rights and put money into the film. Vexing the Production Code censors with its relaxed take on criminal behavior and tolerance of spouse-swapping, the movie played down the novel’s anti-imperialist bent but maintained its worldly attitude — something for which Capote took credit. Jones was cast as Bogart’s dizzy adulterous love interest. Consequently, the actress’s real-life husband, the powerful producer David O. Selznick, watched over the film, bringing on Capote, who had recently worked on a Selznick production, to fix the script. Although the late scenes set in North Africa are likely Capote’s doing, his influence has been exaggerated. Many of the movie’s most memorable dialogue involving Bogart’s cutting witticisms and Jones’s contrived innocence can be found in Cockburn’s novel. “Beat the Devil” is a film whose supposed shortcomings are actually its appealing qualities. Introduced wearing a floridly patterned robe with matching ascot, Bogart is less formidable than the tough guys he played in the 1940s, marginalized by a colorful parade of character actors including the unexpectedly droll Gina Lollobrigida, appearing in her first major English-language film. Thanks to Bogart’s perplexed underplaying and the anticlimactic ending, “Beat the Devil” was misunderstood in much the way that Elaine May’s not dissimilar anti-thriller “Ishtar” would be in 1987. Overshadowed by its much-mythologized back story — Capote and Huston claimed that the movie was more-or-less made up as they went along — the project lived in infamy. “Bogie sent me a copy of an advertisement an exhibitor had taken out in a newspaper saying this was the worst picture he had ever had in his theater,” Huston would recall. “Beat the Devil” disappeared from view, a notorious flop that rarely, if ever, was shown on television. Then in February 1964, it reopened in a Greenwich Village movie house and proved so successful that it enjoyed an uptown move-over and revival showings in other cities. “The film that was ten years ahead of its time is ten years old … (It’s time!),” a newspaper ad proclaimed. Yet “Beat the Devil” was very much of its time — not just because it was a star vehicle produced by the star rather than by a studio. For one thing, the movie was released during a thaw in the Cold War, among a flurry of films that made light of international tensions. For another, it rode the wave of a growing popularity of Italian movies. Besides Lollobrigida, who was praised by Bogart as a woman who “makes Marilyn Monroe look like Shirley Temple,” the cast included Italian character actors. (Indeed, the mood anticipated Italian comedies like Mario Monicelli’s “Big Deal on Madonna Street.”) The Times’s on-set report notes the proximity of Roberto Rossellini’s current production, “Voyage to Italy.” In his account of “Beat the Devil,” Huston credits himself with Rossellini’s strategy of giving his actors their lines moments before a scene was shot. What had changed? The Bogart cult that began in Cambridge, Mass., in the late 1950s had gained traction. (Peter Bogdanovich published his report “Bogie in Excelsis” in the September 1964 issue of Esquire.) “Sick comedy” and “black humor” entered the mainstream. James Bond’s gleeful irreverence took hold; “Dr. Strangelove” opened less than a month before “Beat the Devil” was reissued. The ’60s were underway! “Camp” was a buzz word, although Susan Sontag’s “Notes on Camp,” which appeared in the fall of 1964, slagged “Beat the Devil” as a movie so desperate to be campy that it was “continually losing the beat.” In the mid-1970s, around the time the “Rocky Horror Picture Show” cult was attracting attention, Huston gave an interview maintaining that people had seen “Beat the Devil” multiple times, knew the dialogue by heart and would recite the lines along with the actors. I find that hard to imagine — but no more so than that critics and audiences in 1954 failed to appreciate “Beat the Devil” for the charming jape that is. “Beat the Devil” can be found on YouTube and streamed through Amazon Prime.",The New York Times

Sleeper, the locations manager for “Billions,” returning Sunday for its fourth season on Showtime, scouted more than 100 places that list for tens of millions of dollars, but he couldn’t find the right one. “It was impossible,” he said. The apartment wasn’t for his own use — he and his wife rent in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn. No, he had to lock down a Manhattan residence for Bobby Axelrod, the “Billions” hedge fund phenom played by Damian Lewis. The space couldn’t be comfortable or cozy. It needed to intimidate, astound, overwhelm, gut punch your breath away. “We always joke, ‘billionaire, not millionaire,’” Sleeper said on a January morning at the “Billions” production office in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, as he scrolled through a desktop folder of photos. He clicked for a moment on a $65 million triplex that hadn’t impressed him when he toured it: “You walk in there and it’s like, really?” He shrugged and scrolled on. Months after his initial deadline had passed, as he was viewing a ho-hum TriBeCa penthouse, he saw, from its terrace, another penthouse blocks away. A glass box plunked on top of an old print factory, it had a double-height living room, a wraparound terrace, 270° views of the Hudson and the East River, too. It was urban, masculine, almost stark in its poured concrete floors and severe lines — it said billionaire, not millionaire. He rented it. Shows like “Billions” and HBO’s “Succession,” a prickly drama about a Murdoch-like media dynasty that returns for its second season this summer, have to offer a convincing visual representation of the ultrawealthy, the 1 percent of the 1 percent. Jesse Armstrong, who created “Succession,” described a governing principle: “Let’s just be as truthful as we can.” Truth isn’t always flattering. Unlike the wealth-porn TV of earlier decades — “Dynasty,” “Dallas,” “Gossip Girl” — these shows address a cultural moment in which many of us are infatuated with extreme wealth and also disturbed by it. Dramas with glints of dark comedy, “Succession” and “Billions” aren’t exactly aspirational. The camera finds every under-eye circle, amplifies each impersonal office. Even that penthouse looks almost ugly from certain angles. The design of these shows implies, more and less subtly, a critique of wealth itself. Come for the private jets, stay for the inevitable dehumanization. To illustrate a billionaire lifestyle, the designers of each show researched the wealthy online and combed through magazines like “Architectural Digest” and “Vogue.” But extremely rich people don’t always want their homes photographed and they may not wear couture. “When they hit the billion and above number, they’re no longer in a place where they have to impress anybody by their outward trappings,” said David Levien, one of the creators of “Billions.” So each show retains a number of wealth consultants — some of them billionaires and some of them vendors who cater to billionaires — who advise on what uniforms household staff might wear or which artworks should adorn a corporate office. Occasionally volunteer consultants also chime in. One hedge funder emailed the “Billions” creators (who declined to identify him) to complain about Axelrod’s dinky private plane. “I wouldn’t be caught dead in that sardine can,” he wrote. (Said sardine can retails for around $40 million.) Sometimes outward trappings do matter. For the “Succession” pilot, the production team wanted to create an apartment for Logan Roy, the paterfamilias played by Brian Cox, that would suggest power, not magazine cover ostentation. Kevin Thompson, the pilot’s production designer, borrowed two floors of the Council on Foreign Relations, dressing it as a penthouse duplex. When the show was ordered to series, that space was re-created on a small Queens soundstage. To walk into that apartment — assuming you aren’t a billionaire — is to feel overawed and even a little giddy at its reckless proportions. But the furnishings, though extremely tasteful, are subdued, the palette dull. “You can hear the money, but it’s not screaming at you,” Thompson said. Still, the various design departments have to put across billionaire style on a thousandaire budget. (O.K., tens or hundreds of thousands, but still.) On each set calculations are made as to what to pay top dollar for and what to beg, borrow or fake. In Logan Roy’s apartment, the furniture is real as are a few of the antiques. But the paintings are scanned copies or pastiche — even HBO money doesn’t run to real Gauguins — and the tapestries are not exactly priceless. “The audience will never know,” Stephen Carter, the current production designer, said as he walked through the soundstage on a February afternoon. On another “Succession” soundstage, workers were building a private jet. On television it would look luxurious and the oversized seats were authentic, donated by the aerospace company Embraer. But the opulent interior? Contact paper pasted to plywood. “Expensive Japanese contact paper,” Carter clarified. “But essentially it’s a sticker.” One department where you can’t really fake it: Wardrobe. On the same day I met Sleeper, Eric Daman, the “Billions” costume designer, walked me through the labyrinth of clothes. He stopped in front of Bobby Axelrod’s rack, mostly jeans, T-shirts and hoodies. Several of the hoodies come from Loro Piana, an Italian ready-to-wear brand, and retail for around $2,000. But they are cashmere, and anyone acquainted with babies’ bottoms can confirm that these absurdly priced hoodies are, in fact, softer. (The Los Angeles-based designer Vince is another hoodie go-to.) Somehow the camera notices. Yet there are limits. A few weeks before, Daman had ordered an $1,800 cashmere T-shirt from The Row. He’d felt a little nauseous about it, but “I thought it was going to be something special,” he said. It wasn’t, so he sent it back. “I’m glad we could all experience it and then [expletive] about it,” he said. Some of the more expensive items have been gifted or lent to the production. Daman pointed to a wall of what he described as “promo bags,” accessories sent from Stella McCartney and Phillip Lim that the show might use. Michelle Matland, the costume designer on “Succession,” also receives promotional items and isn’t above shopping on resale sites like The Real Real to save money. “I’m very popular at the outlet malls,” she said. Cost aside, one way these shows suggest wealth is less about the items themselves than how the characters react to them. In the second season of “Billions,” Bobby and Lara Axelrod board his-and-her private jets with no more fanfare than a quick goodbye kiss. The characters aren’t awed, so the camera isn’t either. “Succession” mostly steers clear of beauty shots. Armstrong told his team, “Let’s never try to persuade anyone or sell anyone on an element of this lifestyle.” The characters tend to treat wealth casually, even disdainfully, regifting a Patek-Philippe, stepping into a Sikorsky helicopter as if it’s one more town car. “Part of the fun of the way our audience experiences this wealth is by feeling how unimportant it is to these people,” Carter said. But is that fun? Much of what made shows like “Dynasty” and “Dallas” so successful was how they fetishized the externals of wealth. The “Dynasty” reboot on CW continues that tradition, letting the camera linger on the shoes (the shoes!), the jewels, the fountains. Sallie Patrick, the “Dynasty” showrunner, said that she felt an obligation to continue the extravagance of the original. But even a network guilty pleasure like “Dynasty” resists offering what she called “true pure wish fulfillment.” “It’s a little more satirical, it’s a little more tongue in cheek and we’re commenting on how ludicrous it is,” she said. There’s a running joke about $1,000 fanny packs. When even “Dynasty” unleashes a socioeconomic critique, it suggests suspicion of the very rich, an anxiety that they may not be like the rest of us. That anxiety might have merit. The 1980s — the era of the first “Dynasty” — and the present are periods associated with huge increases in wealth inequality. “Rich people have become so different from the average person,” said Shamus Khan, a Columbia University sociology professor who researches the political influence of economic elites. “They’re of interest in the way that a zoo animal is of interest.” These shows may even provide a perverse comfort to the rest of us, reflecting how great wealth can often produce feelings of alienation, a phenomenon Khan has studied. “People imagine that it’s going to bring some meaning to them or satisfy some need,” he said. However, “rich people often describe themselves as feeling dead inside.” The wealthy characters in these shows often choose money over family, community or moral integrity. The design — luxurious, but sometimes cold and unbeautiful — reflects that. Still, alienation, on the billionaire scale, may have its upsides. On an afternoon in early March, Sleeper walked me through the Bobby Axelrod penthouse. Wood gleamed, metal shone, the winter sun flamed through the living room’s 18-foot windows and Manhattan arrayed itself below. Sleeper stepped out onto the terrace. “I know I will never have this, and that’s something that doesn’t bother me,” he said. “But at same time, could I imagine, like, would it be amazing to live in this space?” he added. “Absolutely.”",The New York Times
2019,‘Billions’ Season 4 Premiere Recap: American Oligarch,"Billions “You win some, lose some, it’s all the same to me,” howls Lemmy Kilmister, the raspy singer-bassist of the heavy metal band Motörhead in their signature song, “Ace of Spades.” As he explains over warp-speed riffing, when it comes to gambling, “the pleasure is to play.” The metal fandom of the hedge-fund billionaire Bobby Axelrod (Damian Lewis) has been a key trait of that character from the start. It is equal parts enjoyment and self-aggrandizing, bad-boy image-making. But rarely had it been deployed as astutely as when he made his first onscreen appearance this week, in the Season 4 premiere of Showtime’s ruthlessly entertaining financial thriller, “Billions.” As “Ace of Spades” powers the soundtrack, we’re reminded that no matter what game they’re playing, men like Axe aren’t happy unless they go all-in on every hand. For Axe, the game is getting dangerous. He and Chuck Rhoades (Paul Giamatti), the former United States Attorney and Bobby’s former enemy, achieved détente at the end of Season 3, having colluded to avoid bringing Bobby to trial in a case that would have ruined him and his in-house performance coach, Wendy Rhoades (Maggie Siff) — who is also Chuck’s wife. But now Axe is facing an even more implacable foe in Grigor Andolov (John Malkovich), a rich and vicious Russian. Andolov is backing the breakaway firm founded by Axelrod’s brilliant young ex-employee Taylor Mason (Asia Kate Dillon). Axe being Axe, he’s intent on making Taylor pay for this act of rebellion; Grigor being Grigor, he’s not about to let anyone interfere with his new investment. In an elaborate scheme first teased in a flash-forward, Andolov arranges to have Mike Wagner (David Costabile), Axe’s impish right-hand man, better known as Wags, imprisoned within the embassy of a Middle Eastern nation whose investment Axe had been courting. Axe, who knows Taylor has been gunning for the country’s cash, too — in shockingly effective femme fatale drag, no less — is desperate to get his man back for business reasons as well as personal ones. Only when he manages to procure an embassy audience himself does he uncover the true architect of the crime. Chuck’s story line, meanwhile, is redolent of the machinations that made middle-season “Game of Thrones” episodes so much fun to watch. (And if there’s a single character in this series who hasn’t watched every single episode of that sword-and-skulduggery show, I will personally wax Wags’s mustache.) Like a tristate Tyrion Lannister, Rhoades spends the episode using the interests of one New York power player against the next. It’s like the nursery rhyme about the old lady who swallowed a fly, each new and preposterous step dictated by the last. Fired from his job as a United States attorney by the vindictive right-wing attorney general Jock Jeffcoat (Clancy Brown), Rhoades is not content with life in the private sector. To prove he still has political clout, Chuck needs to procure a concealed-carry permit for a local bigwig — a tall order, given New York’s tough gun-control laws. (The episode was written and filmed before the revelation that Donald Trump and Michael Cohen secured such permits under dubious circumstances.) Pulling it off requires the support of Commissioner Richie Sansome (Michael Rispoli of “The Sopranos” and “The Deuce”), who feels Chuck’s reign as the region’s top prosecutor never did the department any favors. If he does the commish a favor, however … With a mixture of desperation and deftness, Chuck constructs an elaborate Rube Goldberg device of quid pro quo exchanges among the city’s most privileged and powerful. Nearly all of the palm-greasing and back-scratching is ridiculously petty. At one point in the chain, the real-life advertising executive Donny Deutsch demands primo ski lodge passes in exchange for seats at the children’s Hanukkah service in a major Manhattan congregation — apparently the hottest tickets in town. The endgame involves creating a fake birth certificate for the star pitcher on the commissioner’s Police Athletic League baseball team so that the too-old immigrant teenager can keep on winning. The whole absurd sequence is “Billions” at its best, using detail-driven plot mechanics to paint a larger picture of how power operates. Chuck and the commissioner wind up celebrating their shared victory by drinking themselves stupid at Sparks Steak House, the site where John Gotti murdered of the Gambino family boss Paul Castellano. (Needless to say, this too was written into the show long before the apparent execution last week of Francesco Cali, who was alleged to be that family’s most recent boss.) Rhoades winds up paraphrasing Oscar Wilde as he and Sansome lie in the gutter and look up at the stars, but the self-made comparison to organized crime is much more revealing than the pretensions to literary grandeur. It’s all quintessential “Billions,” in large part because of how inessential the action is for either Chuck or Bobby. No one is forcing Axe to spy on, undercut and otherwise mess with his former protégé Taylor and thus risk Andolov’s wrath. And as domineering as Chuck’s father (Jeffrey DeMunn) might be — “I would slap your face and tell you to act like a man, if I didn’t think it would turn you on,” he tells his son — the younger Rhoades is under no obligation to get back in the political ring. But everything for Chuck comes down to what Charles Sr. says to him about getting that permit: “The very difficulty of it is why you must.” And to borrow a sobriquet from Wags (who delivers it in his usual obscene fashion), an “American oligarch” like Axe can’t back down from a fight either. To do so would be for either man to betray their natures. As Motörhead would put it, gambling’s for fools, but that’s the way they like it, baby.",The New York Times
2019,"‘Billions’ Season 4, Episode 2: You Win Some, They Lose Some","Billions Zugzwang is a delightful word for a dispiriting concept. In chess, zugzwang occurs when it’s your move, but your opponent has cannily set you up to dig yourself deeper into defeat. It’s a useful concept for anyone who needs to outmaneuver an enemy without staging a frontal assault. And as Taylor Mason’s ruthless new right-hand woman, Sara Hammon (Samantha Mathis), realizes in this week’s episode of “Billions,” zugzwang is the name of the game for every player on the board right now. Thank Grigor Andolov for that. As he has threatened many times, and proved last week by orchestrating the abduction of Wags, that menacing Russian will stop at nothing to protect his investment in Taylor’s company. This means that Bobby’s best play is to cut off his former protégé’s supply of cash by cutting sweetheart deals with banks that are in a bad way. They’ll owe him a favor and take their business elsewhere, with minimal exposure on his end. For Axe, there is an ancillary bonus. Scoping out a bank that has made a bad investment in robots that can barely walk without tripping, he makes the acquaintance of Rebecca Cantu (Nina Arianda), a fellow billionaire who made her fortune by recognizing the best products to sell on a home shopping network and thus sees right through the robot manufacturer’s song and dance. It’s a match made in heaven’s V.I.P. lounge. The two go into business by splitting her share of an industrial cleaning company, then have sex to celebrate. They get in a shouting match when Rebecca realizes Axe was responsible for an immigration sting that sunk the company’s competition, making him money she could have had for herself. They make up when he agrees to give half of her shares back, plus the profits on them, in exchange for her promise not to float Taylor any money herself. “You hungry?” he asks, smiling. “I could eat,” she replies, smiling back. Seconds earlier they’d been talking about the 4,200 industrial-cleaning workers suddenly looking for jobs. For those people it’s a crisis. For these billionaires it’s foreplay. But it’s tough to out-zugzwang a genius like Taylor. When the banks close their coffers, along comes Grigor, literally singing, “Here I come to save the day!” (If you’ve ever wanted to hear John Malkovich sing the “Mighty Mouse” theme song with a Russian accent, this is the show for you.) He presents Mason with a pair of gangster acquaintances named the Kozlov Brothers. Their blood money could keep the company afloat, yes. But they’re even more dangerous than Grigor, and since Grigor controls them anyway, he would have a bigger share of the company than all the other investors combined. So Taylor uses Axe to do the dirty work. Calling one of the banks that rejected Taylor Mason Capital for a loan — the same bank Bobby bailed out on the bad robot deal — Mason implies that the Kozlovs have bought in when in fact the deal has not yet been done. This gets back to Axe, who instructs the bank to pull all its cash from the Kozlovs, leaving them with no money to loan even if Taylor wanted them to. Taylor then turns to Grigor, saying that the bad news is that the Kozlovs have no money. But the good news is, well, the Kozlovs have no money, and Grigor can eat up their empire wholesale … so long as he uses his clout to open the banks back up to Mason Cap. It’s a near-identical play to the one Chuck makes when his new ally, Police Commissioner Sansone, asks him to look into shady doings in the police pension fund — particularly those involving its administrator, Raul Gomez (Ruben Santiago-Hudson), an old rival from their academy days. Chuck quickly learns that Raul is Bobby’s guy, and that Bobby is running the pension fund behind the scenes, using a surrogate hedge-funder named Michael Panay (Hari Dhillon) as a cat’s paw. So Chuck advises Sansone to go after Panay rather than Gomez, then to cozy up to Panay’s successor — drumroll, please — Bobby Axelrod, who has been cleared of wrongdoing and can get back into business with the cops. All Chuck asks for in return is Sansone’s endorsement of his candidacy for New York State Attorney General, which he delivers at the San Gennaro festival in Little Italy. Another scheme, another fall guy, another way for top dogs like Chuck, Bobby and Taylor to manipulate frenemies into doing their bidding. Strong B-plots complement the main action, presenting other characters with their own moral dilemmas. Taylor’s trusted underling Mafee (Dan Soder), the genial man-child who quit Axe Cap last season when he realized he’d been manipulated by Axe and Wendy, refuses to extend a similar lifeline to his buddy Rudy (Chris Carfizzi), whom Axe fired last week for fraternizing with the enemy — namely, Mafee. It’s cold, but Rudy isn’t a great trader. In Mafee’s view, taking him on would be more trouble than he’s worth. Wendy is faced with an even more personal dilemma. During a frank after-hours conversation about sex at a party with her co-workers, she crows that her and Chuck’s bedroom policy is “Action whenever either of us [expletive] wants it.” But when she asks for warm, intimate, face-to-face sex, Chuck insists on breaking out the whips and chains — going so far as to beg after she tells him she’d rather not. That’s precisely the kind of behavior she ridiculed as the province of “sexual panhandlers” at the party, as prompted by Bonnie (an excellent Sarah Stiles), the big-haired, bawdy trader who manspreads during her therapy sessions and insists that no woman wants a whiner. But as Wendy learns from their former dominatrix Troy (Clara Wong), submitting to sexual power is Chuck’s “arousal template,” and it’s unshakable. Still, there’s a sense that the real power plays have yet to come. Insofar as this is only the second in a 12-episode season, that’s to be expected. But the various schemes and shenanigans that Chuck, Bobby and Taylor have been running feel minor, even so. The characters scratch a few backs, grease a few palms, hamstring a few second-stringers, fiddle around the margins and avoid direct attacks — zugzwang instead of checkmate. On this show, it’s an odd sensation. But checkmate remains the ultimate goal, even when they’re merely moving pawns around the board. Chuck wants to become attorney general, giving him the political clout he needs to fight back against his rivals Jock Jeffcoat and Bryan Connerty. Bobby wants to eliminate Grigor and destroy Taylor. And both men are addicted to power, plain and simple — it’s their arousal template. The big questions, for both the characters and the show, are when will the payoffs come, and will they be worth the buy-in when they do?",The New York Times
2019,"‘Billions’: Brian Koppelman and David Levien on Money, Power and American Gods","Ask a Showrunner From Wall Street to Washington, the world of “Billions” is a world at war. According to David Levien, one of the creators and showrunners for the series, that’s by design. “If you look at kings and Caesars and emperors throughout history and literature, there’s not a lot of guys who sat through a very peaceful, enjoyable reign,” he said. “Gods and kings: That’s what these people think they are.” “They need people to battle against,” added Brian Koppelman, who is also a creator and showrunner for the show. (Andrew Ross Sorkin, a New York Times financial columnist, is the third creator.) As “Billions” returns to Showtime on Sunday for Season 4, its two central combatants face a remade version of that world, newly allied with enemies to spare. The hedge fund billionaire Bobby Axelrod (Damian Lewis) is primed for vengeance against his former protégé Taylor Mason (Asia Kate Dillon). Meanwhile, the former United States attorney Chuck Rhoades (Paul Giamatti) must contend with investigations into his past conduct by the Trump era attorney general Jock Jeffcoat (Clancy Brown). If these people be gods and kings, Koppelman and Levien have become something like prophets. The season premiere features story lines about an embassy kidnapping and a quid pro quo involving gun permits that feel as ripped from the headlines as any episode of “Law & Order” but were written and filmed months before the real-world events they mirror. In a phone call last week, Koppelman and Levien offered a glimpse into the thinking behind the new season — a crystal ball for our strange new Gilded Age. These are edited excerpts from that conversation. “Billions” is a show about abuse of power in government and finance. Here in the real world, it seems those things have metastasized to a truly bizarre degree. Do you ever have a hard time keeping up? DAVID LEVIEN Yeah, the show started back in the prosaic Obama era. That’s not really an answer. That was just a quip. BRIAN KOPPELMAN It was a good quip, though! But we don’t really think in those terms. What’s been wild to us is how often the questions that we’re interested in exploring on the show end up surfacing in the world in short time. The embassy stuff in the first episode was written and shot five months before [the death of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi]. So we don’t find the world’s bizarreness difficult to keep up with. The central question to us from the beginning is why, in America now, does it seem as if characteristics like verbal acuity, power, great wealth, charm and charisma stand in for real qualities of character, like kindness and selflessness and empathy? Why are we as a culture — all of us — guilty of holding people who have that first batch of characteristics up as heroes? When you set a show up playing with these ideas, you’re going to end up getting into some strange waters. The fact that the world has also gotten into these strange waters, we think, has only made the show more resonant. During the show’s early going, I was rooting for Chuck, because for all his faults he still represented the law. But I’m not sure where my sympathies lie anymore. Are you? LEVIEN From the beginning, we wanted to play with the audience’s sympathies and rooting interest. When they got leaning one way, we’d do a switch-up and get them going back the other way. On Chuck’s side, he has the burden of being held to a higher standard, one that he’s set for himself and lives by and dines out on. And then [Axe], there are no expectations. When he does something particularly interesting or kind, it’s surprising and it wins people over, just as when Chuck does something bankrupt, people are extra disappointed. KOPPELMAN We did notice that a bunch of people in prosecutorial positions were using those positions for career advancement. The expectation that we all grew up with about who was the good guy has been put into question. We felt like it was fair for the show to do that, too. LEVIEN Axe and Chuck have a shared pool of qualities like ambition and pridefulness and undying belief in their own power. In a lot of ways they’re similar, and that confuses the rooting interest. To us, that’s the stuff that makes it interesting as we hit the fourth year and started looking beyond. As you watch “Billions” over the years, you notice how episodes or runs are dominated by particular schemes and goals. You start to wonder what happens when characters get what they want. Well, then what? KOPPELMAN We’re constantly trying to tease out for ourselves what makes these people into these perpetual motion machines, and why satisfaction is so hard to come by. But twinned with that is our interest in the stories these people tell themselves about why each sacrifice is worth it for what they think they need or want in a given moment. Lip service to resisting temptation, but inevitably giving in to it, is something we watch happening all the time in the real world. We wanted to have characters who have the capability to be other things, but who can’t stop themselves from being what they are. [Read about ‘Billions,’ ‘Succession’ and the making of wealth porn.] As much freedom as they have, they’re constantly coming back to the thing they were already doing. When this season starts, Chuck has been forced out of his government job. He could kick back in the private sector, but he doesn’t. He can’t. LEVIEN One thing that you’ve got to realize about these guys is they love what they do. It’s not like they want to get to some number or some elevation, and once they’ve hit that plateau, they’re going to go and sit on a beach somewhere. That would be torture to them. They love the action. They love it when they’re down, and they love it slightly more when they’re up. In the game that these guys have taken up, it’s either capture new territory and win new victories or be diminished by not battling. Axe says in Season 2 that in the grand sweep of time, we’re all already dead. These kinds of guys — and it’s not just the guys, it’s Wendy [Axe’s adviser and Chuck’s wife, played by Maggie Siff] and Taylor also — their choice is either to give it all up and go become a monk and contemplate death, or to try to keep moving and beating and convincing themselves that they’re not going to die. That’s the work of gods and kings, and in the world as we order it now, that’s what these people are. Want exclusive “Thrones” interviews and news, as well as the internet’s best articles on that week’s episode? Sign up for our Season 8 newsletter here. And they enjoy the privileges of gods and kings, which seems like a double-edged sword. Part of you thinks it’s awesome to watch people drive a Mercedes that costs $150,000 at 100 miles an hour, then buy two of them on a whim. But another part of you is sharpening the guillotines. LEVIEN We don’t come at it like, “Well, this is wrong, there’s some inequity here and it’s our job to put it on trial.” It’s more just like, “We have to do as fair a showing of this world, interior and exterior, as we can.” These are the lives these characters are leading, and we’re inside of it. We leave it to the audience to decide if they have judgments on it. KOPPELMAN And we have never once looked at each other and said, “We have to show some signs of wealth because it’ll dazzle the audience.” But we do find the question pretty compelling. Do those sports cars make them happy? Would they make you, the audience member, happy? How long do you think that would make you happy for? That’s definitely something we’re exploring: desire, need and the lies we tell ourselves about what we need to make ourselves feel alive.",The New York Times
2019,‘Black Mother’ Review: Exploring the Roots of Life Itself,"Critic’s Pick When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. There’s a good deal of water imagery in “Black Mother,” the new film by Khalik Allah. A shot of a waterfall feeding a stream, verdant trees and plants crowding its banks intermittently repeats. Overhead footage shows a foamy tide coming in and going out. Water is life, and “Black Mother” announces itself as an evocation, invocation and chronicle of birth and life. “First trimester,” a female voice says, as Allah holds on a full-frame view of a naked woman, the vivid life of her skin contrasting with the gray wall behind her. Allah’s previous film, the staggering “Field Niggas” (2015), was shot in Manhattan, homing in on bedraggled drug addicts and mentally ill people on the streets of East Harlem. “Black Mother” was shot in Jamaica (his mother’s native country, where he has spent time over the years), and in its early scenes depicts deprivation and desperation not dissimilar to what his earlier film showed in such disconcerting focus. Here, Allah’s camera is more mobile than before, following streetwalking prostitutes while we hear the sounds of male voices negotiating with them over prices for specific sexual acts. But the camera soon widens its travels, mixing film and video formats. In transferring the 8-millimeter and 16-millimeter footage, some of which he shot as a teenager, Allah makes it appear as if these visuals are being projected slightly out of frame, with sprockets and the bottom frame line visible. There are also snippets of family life (Allah’s own, we can infer, but the film never explicitly says as much), with a long section devoted to prayer at a memorial service. Another scene shows a pregnant woman getting an ultrasound, and in the section of the film announced as “Birth,” a childbirth is indeed seen. In its poetic, elliptical, concise way, this film makes a grand statement: The black mother is the mother of life itself. And the gaze directed at the black faces and bodies in “Black Mother” is not a male gaze, or a documentarian’s gaze. It is a gaze of love. You’ll increasingly find this perspective in works like RaMell Ross’s “Hale County This Morning, This Evening,” an Oscar-nominated documentary about two young black men in Hale County, Ala. And it’s something today’s cinema could use a lot more of. When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.",The New York Times
2019,‘Bohemian Rhapsody’ With No Gay Scenes? Censored Film Angers Chinese Viewers,"HONG KONG — “Bohemian Rhapsody,” the Queen biopic, has been faulted by some Western audiences and critics for soft-pedaling Freddie Mercury’s relationships with men. But in screenings of the film in China, references to the singer’s sexuality have been removed altogether. These holes in the plot incensed a generation of young movie buffs, who are largely more progressive than the country’s censors. A censored version of the film, released in China last weekend, is only around three minutes shorter than the original. But it omits a crucial scene in which Freddie tells his fiancée that he is not straight, and the scene in which his lover, Jim Hutton, is introduced. A celebratory scene in which the band members perform in women’s clothing was also cut from the Chinese release. These changes were not lost on the Chinese audience, many of whom sensed while watching the film in theaters that something was amiss. Sun Jing, a 26-year-old office worker who saw the film with friends in Shanghai on Saturday, said she had quickly immersed herself in the music and the plot, but noticed that certain points in the story were left unresolved, and spotted several instances where the subtitles didn’t quite match the dialogue. The censorship was most stark, she said, when the Queen singer told others that he had AIDS. The dialogue was abruptly silenced at that point in the censored film, and no subtitles appeared. “Since I’m watching a biopic, I want to see an authentic person,” Ms. Sun said. “Contents of his life should not be so inexplicably removed.” Lu Zhan, a 22-year-old in Beijing who had hoped the film would introduce a Chinese audience to the power of live music, said she found the omissions misleading and disrespectful to the band. “On the topic of L.G.B.T. issues, they’ve completely misled the public,” she said of the censors, adding that she worried that the decision to screen a sanitized version of the film would discourage gay people in China. Rami Malek, the actor who plays Freddie Mercury in the film, was also censored on a Chinese streaming platform in his remarks after winning the Academy Award for best actor last month. When he said in his acceptance speech, “We made a film about a gay man, an immigrant, who lived his life just unapologetically himself,” the platform Mango TV replaced “gay man” with “special group” in subtitles. Asked why the gay content had been removed from the China release of “Bohemian Rhapsody,” a spokesman for 20th Century Fox, which produced the film, said in an email that the studio had no comment. Those wanting to find out what they were missing have turned to the internet, where compilations of uncensored clips are drawing further attention to the scenes that censors sought to suppress. And the screening of the censored film comes at a time when gay rights activism is gaining prominence in China. “I think a lot of people are used to avoiding certain topics, especially if it doesn’t affect their own lives,” said Yang Zhiyuan, 22, a digital media arts student in Beijing. “But when these things become topics of conversation, people will be compelled to think about them.” Yet some Chinese filmgoers said they would not watch an altered version of the film. “On principle, I refuse to watch this type of crudely censored film,” said Li Yang, 24, a fashion writer in Beijing, who decided to avoid “Bohemian Rhapsody” after friends told him it was a choppy viewing experience. Ms. Sun, who said she was unfamiliar with the band Queen until watching the film, added that she had hoped to understand Freddie Mercury as a full character. “As a young person with independent thinking,” she said, “I do not need anyone to control which scenes I can see and which I cannot see.”",The New York Times
2019,‘Bohemian Rhapsody’ With No Gay Scenes? Censored Film Angers Chinese Viewers,"HONG KONG — “Bohemian Rhapsody,” the Queen biopic, has been faulted by some Western audiences and critics for soft-pedaling Freddie Mercury’s relationships with men. But in screenings of the film in China, references to the singer’s sexuality have been removed altogether. These holes in the plot incensed a generation of young movie buffs, who are largely more progressive than the country’s censors. A censored version of the film, released in China last weekend, is only around three minutes shorter than the original. But it omits a crucial scene in which Freddie tells his fiancée that he is not straight, and the scene in which his lover, Jim Hutton, is introduced. A celebratory scene in which the band members perform in women’s clothing was also cut from the Chinese release. These changes were not lost on the Chinese audience, many of whom sensed while watching the film in theaters that something was amiss. Sun Jing, a 26-year-old office worker who saw the film with friends in Shanghai on Saturday, said she had quickly immersed herself in the music and the plot, but noticed that certain points in the story were left unresolved, and spotted several instances where the subtitles didn’t quite match the dialogue.

2019,"‘Breaches Everywhere’: Flooding Bursts Midwest Levees, and Tough Questions Follow","Hundreds of miles of levees in the Midwest have been overwhelmed by the floods, leaving “Swiss cheese” infrastructure and reigniting a flood control debate. A levee breached by the Missouri River near Fortescue, Mo.CreditCredit CORNING, Mo. — The widespread, severe flooding in the Midwest over the last month has exposed the vulnerabilities in a levee system that is now so full of holes that many here ruefully describe it as “Swiss cheese.” With dozens of costly breaks across Nebraska, Iowa, Missouri and nearby states, the surging waters have left large areas without even cursory flood protection. “Breaches everywhere: multiple, multiple breaches,” said Tom Bullock, the top elected official in Holt County, Mo., where crews were rushing last week to patch a leaking levee that, if it failed completely, would flood the small town of Fortescue. And with the fear of more floods in the coming years — and perhaps even the coming weeks — many people said living and farming near the water might not be viable much longer without major changes. “We can’t keep this up and make a living,” Michael Peters, who grows corn and soybeans on fertile bottomland in northwest Missouri, said last week after trying to find a path to his submerged farm in a motorboat. On the river-specked Midwestern prairie, the thousands of miles of levees are an insurance policy against nature’s whims that, at their best, keep cropland and towns dry, floodwaters at bay and the agriculture-driven economy churning. But the levees are aging, subject to uneven regulation and, in many cases, never designed to withstand the river levels seen in the last decade. The recent flooding — which has devastated farms, roads and Native American reservations — has pushed to the foreground a debate that has raged quietly for generations. It boils down to this: How should the rivers be controlled, who should make those decisions and how much protection should be given to those most vulnerable? Many of the levees, usually earthen and topped with grass, were built by farmers decades ago and are now managed by a patchwork of local government agencies known as levee districts that often do not coordinate or even follow the same rules. With increased flooding in the past few years, the levees are being tested more frequently than ever before, straining the finances and expertise of some of those districts. The levee situation has become so grave that the American Society of Civil Engineers gave the country’s levee system a D grade in 2017, suggesting $80 billion in investment over 10 years. “When the next one comes along bigger, they either fail or are overtopped again,” said Nicholas Pinter, an expert on rivers and flooding at the University of California, Davis. According to the United States Army Corps of Engineers, which oversees infrastructure on the Missouri River and some of its tributaries, at least 62 levees had been breached or overtopped in the Midwest in March, and hundreds of miles of levees had sustained damage. “When they run water over the top of them, there’s not anything you can do,” said Pat Sheldon, the president of a rural levee district in southwest Iowa that was still paying off repairs from the 2011 flood. This time, Mr. Sheldon said, the damage to the levees was much worse, perhaps in the hundreds of millions of dollars. “It’s terrible,” said Mr. Sheldon, whose farm was also cut off by the water. In Missouri, Mr. Bullock pointed out a levee that last week had been split open and consumed by the river. A large log swirled in the water near where the earthen berm should have been. “I don’t know what we’re going to do this time,” he said. The Army Corps of Engineers, which helps determine water levels by operating a series of dams on the Missouri River, tries to balance the needs of many who use the rivers it manages, including farmers, barge shippers, endangered animal species and people who use the water for recreation. Those interests are sometimes at odds, and have been the subject of decades of litigation. Corps officials say they are not allowed to change the congressionally authorized purposes of the reservoirs, though they had been most focused on limiting floods for the past year. “The Corps’s No. 1 priority in its operations is life safety,” said Maj. Gen. Scott A. Spellmon, the Corps’s deputy commanding general for civil and emergency operations, in a statement. “Our current focus is to protect life, mitigate risks to flooding events and repair damages due to the recent events in the basin.” In places like Holt County, where the floods keep coming and the levees keep breaking, there is little patience for the Corps’s approach. Last year, landowners from four Midwestern states won a lawsuit against the agency that claimed the repeated floods amounted to a seizure of their property. “We’re ground zero: We get the full shot,” said Roger Ideker, whose family owns farmland in Holt County along the banks of the Missouri River and was the lead plaintiff in that lawsuit. This week, the closest Mr. Ideker could get to his land was a two-lane road a few miles away that was now functioning as a boat ramp. Buildings in the small town of Corning were visible half-submerged in the distance. “Our levees are big and they’re good,” Mr. Ideker said, but they were no match for this new normal. “Every event seems like it’s higher. It’s higher water. You build the levee higher. And the next time you build it higher. You can’t keep up with it.” The situation has been exacerbated by wetter rainstorms, which are expected to worsen over time and have been attributed to climate change. “There are layers that come together when big events like this happen — it’s never just one thing,” said Barbara Mayes Boustead, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service who contributed to a 2018 federal report on climate change. Tom Waters, the chairman of the Missouri Levee and Drainage District Association, which advocates for landowners and others along the rivers, called for easing federal regulations and building bigger flood protection in rural areas. “We’re seeing more water in the river, but we haven’t improved the infrastructure,” said Mr. Waters, who farms along the Missouri River east of Kansas City, Mo. “Basically, when it comes to levees and flood control protection, we’re still driving on gravel roads and we’re trying to handle interstate traffic.” But building ever-higher levees is not a panacea: Keeping water out of one area only means it will go somewhere else. In the early 20th century, the Army Corps of Engineers and towns along the Mississippi River followed a “levees only” policy that meant building higher and higher walls, leaving the river no way to release its power. That strategy failed spectacularly in the Great Flood of 1927, which inundated 27,000 square miles and displaced one million people. In the aftermath, officials built a more complex Mississippi River system that included a network of spillways and flood ways, as well as other tools, along with the levees. In the areas hardest hit this past month, where levees are shredded and livelihoods shattered, many blame the Corps. In recent weeks, politicians from some of the flooded states have become vocal critics of the river management plan and called for the prioritization of flood control. Senator Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, said in a statement that the Corps was “hamstrung” by “radical environmentalist lobbyists that are forcing the agency to prioritize wildlife over farmers.” Senator Chuck Grassley, Republican of Iowa, cited the town of Hamburg in his state, which staved off the river in 2011 by bolstering its levee but flooded this year after trying and failing to keep its increased protection. “The No. 1 priority of the Corps should be flood control — flood control, period,” Mr. Grassley said on the Senate floor. The devastation to the levees has left much of the Midwest with nothing to hold back the waters from even a relatively minor flood, which forecasters have warned is possible in the weeks ahead. “If we have a wet spring,” Gov. Mike Parson of Missouri said in an interview, “this problem is going to get worse, and in that process we’re not going to have time probably to repair these levees.” As water recedes, at least for the moment, and the conversation shifts to recovery, many in the river bottom said they planned to stay and rebuild, hopeful that policies might change. Others said these levee breaks were probably their last. “It’s not that I don’t want to be here,” said Rhonda Hunziger, the mayor of Craig, Mo., population 230, where residents piled sandbags through the night in a spirited but futile attempt to save their town from the Missouri River after surrounding levees burst. Depending on what the insurance company decided, Ms. Hunziger said this could be the flood that forced her to higher ground. “I have lived with floods my whole life,” she said while staring out at the brown-hued water covering her nearly empty town. “And I am about ready to get off the bottom.” Mitch Smith reported from Corning, and John Schwartz from New York.",The New York Times
2019,‘Buddy’ Review: Who’s a Good Pup? This Pack of Lifesavers,"Critic’s Pick When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. The Dutch documentary director Heddy Honigmann is a humanist. She listens to the ignored, sympathizes with the lonely and can ask questions so leading that when her subjects give her a skeptical look before trying to answer, she has to laugh, almost out of embarrassment. This is to say that she’s also human. And she’s been that way for most of her long, indicting career, which is now in its fourth decade. The indictments tend to be aimed at oppressive systems, in Europe and South America (she was born in Peru), that excel at squeezing the humanity out of citizens and refugees alike. But the only squeezing being done in “Buddy,” her newest movie — opening Wednesday at Film Forum — involves service dogs and the people they serve. The movie follows six people in the Netherlands who have come to rely on the professionalism and unconditional loyalty of their dogs. The animals help them cope with mood swings and depression, blindness and post-traumatic stress. One dog opens and closes kitchen drawers and can fetch paper from the printer. The movie is warm, observant, mildly philosophical and deeply curious about the daily and inner lives of both the people and their four-legged assistants. Another director might have made something more explanatory: Here is how the service industry works. Another director might have attempted a rant about what doesn’t constitute qualification for canine service. Another director might have just given you 86 minutes of licks and snouts. But Honigmann gets right down to the matter of emotional connection in just a shot or two. She wants to understand the symbiosis between, say, young Zeb and his labradoodle, Utah. She asks him what Utah does for his autism, and he actually shuts off the computer game he’s been playing to do some ruminating on how his dog reroutes him away from anger. The most compelling stories here are the two that occupy a majority of the film. One belongs to Trevor, a veteran injured on a tour of duty in Afghanistan. He witnessed horrors he can’t forget and now moves through the world in physical and psychological discomfort. But Trevor’s wife, Patricia, says his dog, a striking, powerfully alert sentinel named Mister, has been the glue that’s helped keep their family intact. Mister stands watch whenever they’re out together and, we’re told, can sense when Trevor’s on the verge of a flashback. The camera lingers longer on Trevor’s faraway looks than on any particular dog. The other is that of a fit, 80-something woman named Edith, who for many years rode horses and lives with her dog, Makker. Edith lost her sight as a girl in an explosion in Germany, and some of the fascination she stirs arises from how independent she seems. (Friends, she says, have kept their distance because her life appears so ordinary.) But there’s also something about her resolve (and her energy). In one of the opening shots, she’s running on a wooded trail alongside Makker, like he might be walking her. Honigmann asks questions both earnest and absurd yet doesn’t cut them, presumably because she knows, at this point, how to ask the right absurd question. Here, her inquiries yield good answers about love and devotion and dog heaven. And Zeb’s mother confesses to something that felt profound to me about what Utah can do for her son that she just can’t as a human being. The dog has more patience than she does. I’m using “service dog” here. But we sometimes call these creatures guides, too. And Honigmann certainly shows them patiently guiding people to doctor visits and through crowds at a heavy metal festival, guiding them onto trams. But without a millimeter of overreach, her movie convinces you that the dogs have kept these people away from overwhelming bleakness by also guiding them into the light.

2019,‘Captain Marvel’ Climbs the List of Superhero Hits,"As “Captain Marvel” swooped into its second weekend in theaters on Friday, the question wasn’t really whether it would top domestic ticket sales, but by how much. Disney-Marvel can breathe easy. Their latest superhero origin story, the first film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe dedicated to a female superhero, sold an estimated $69.3 million in tickets nationwide this weekend, bringing its North American total to around $266.2 million. That’s a higher figure than the lifetime domestic gross of “Captain America: The Winter Soldier” ($259.8 million), and already makes “Captain Marvel” the 13th-best-selling film in the current 21-movie Marvel series — with room to grow. “Captain Marvel” has done well internationally, too, with $120 million in overseas sales this weekend, according to the studio, for a global total of $760 million. While the figures aren’t earth-shattering, they indicate a solid success for Disney-Marvel. [Read our critic’s review of “Captain Marvel.”] That success came despite attempts by trolls to derail “Captain Marvel.” Ahead of its release, the film was the target of efforts at online sabotage by users apparently lashing out against its star, Brie Larson, who has been outspoken in her support of more diverse representation in Hollywood movies. The campaign prompted the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes to make major changes to its longstanding rules, including the elimination of audience reviews for movies that have not yet been released. Free from any targeted online attack was Paramount’s “Wonder Park,” an animated family movie about a young girl who dreams up plans for an amusement park and sees them colorfully brought to life. That movie sold $16 million in tickets domestically this weekend, according to Comscore, which compiles box-office data. While a far cry from “Captain Marvel,” the figure was more than enough to land “Wonder Park” in second place. The only other newcomer in the top five was Lionsgate and CBS Films’s “Five Feet Apart,” in third. The movie, about a couple whose shared genetic disorder forces them to maintain physical distance from each other despite their growing romance, sold $13.2 million in tickets. An earlier version of this article omitted the name of a distributor of “Five Feet Apart.” The movie is distributed by Lionsgate and CBS Films, not just Lionsgate.",The New York Times
2019,‘Captain Marvel’ Has the Year’s Best Opening Weekend at the Box Office,"If movie studios needed another reminder that audiences are craving for new kinds of superpowered heroes, they got it this weekend. Disney’s “Captain Marvel” rode a wave of enthusiasm for more diverse superheroes, a hunger for blockbusters at a quiet time of year and a large helping of ’90s nostalgia to sell $153 million in tickets in U.S. theaters over the weekend. It was easily the best stateside debut weekend of any movie this year as it breezily outperformed expectations and brought the domestic box office a much-needed boost. The Brie Larson-led movie’s opening weekend was the seventh best of any in the 21-film Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise, behind the $174.1 million brought in by “Iron Man 3” and just ahead of “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,” which made $146.5 million during its first weekend. (Topping that list: “Avengers: Infinity War,” which took in $257.7 million when it debuted.) “Captain Marvel” is the first film in the franchise dedicated to the story of a female superhero. DC-Warner Bros. and their Gal Gadot-led “Wonder Woman” broke a comic book glass ceiling in 2017, but “Captain Marvel” had an even stronger opening, bringing in over $50 million more than “Wonder Woman,” which sold around $100.5 million in tickets during its opening weekend. While DC-Warner Bros. hired a single woman — Patty Jenkins — to direct “Wonder Woman,” Disney-Marvel’s movie split directing duties between Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck, who wrote the script with Geneva Robertson-Dworet. An origin story whose soundtrack trades in the likes of Salt-N-Pepa and Nirvana, “Captain Marvel” is set principally in 1990s California, where Larson’s hero crash-lands and eventually teams up with Nicholas Fury, a government agent familiar to Marvel fans and here played by a younger-looking, digitally rejuvenated Samuel L. Jackson. Ben Mendelsohn, Jude Law, Annette Bening and Lashana Lynch play other major roles. [Read our critic’s review of “Captain Marvel.”] “Captain Marvel” received fairly positive reviews — it currently holds an 80% “fresh” rating on Rotten Tomatoes — but its critical reception hasn’t been as strong as some other high-grossing Disney-Marvel entries (by comparison, “The Avengers” holds a 92% “fresh” rating; “Captain America: Civil War” holds 91%). Whether the critics’ responses affect the new movie’s staying power remains to be seen, but its strong start is good news for Disney. The studio is also using “Captain Marvel” to drive up interest in “Avengers: Endgame,” the next entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe that’s slated for release next month. That film will count Brie Larson’s newly-minted character among its ensemble of heroes, alongside Chris Evans’s Captain America, Robert Downey Jr.’s Iron Man, Mark Ruffalo’s Hulk, Chadwick Boseman’s Black Panther and others in what is essentially the popcorn movie equivalent of a musical supergroup. Moviegoers who didn’t see “Captain Marvel” this weekend mostly picked between two other films. Universal’s “How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World,” now in its third weekend, brought in about $14.7 million. And Lionsgate’s “A Madea Family Funeral,” the swan song of Tyler Perry’s long-running title character, sold $12.1 million in tickets according to Comscore, which compiles box office data. Other than “Captain Marvel,” there were no first-week movies in the top ten.",The New York Times
2019,‘Captain Marvel’ Review: Brie Larson Takes a Trip to the ’90s,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. One thing we learn in “Captain Marvel” is that it’s pronounced MarVELL, like the English poet — or at least it used to be, on distant planets and right here on Earth, a windy rock also known as C-53. That was back in 1995, when most of this movie takes place and when the world as we know it had not yet been colonized by the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Yes, of course, Marvel Comics had been around for decades, but when the heroine crashes through the roof of the Blockbuster Video store, landing in between the “Family” and “Drama” sections, there are no Avengers or Iron-Man titles on the shelves. Instead, she picks up a VHS box of “The Right Stuff,” which earns a mild chuckle, since while we know that she’s a space alien named Vers (rhymes with “cheers”), we also have reason to suspect that this young woman is connected with the United States Air Force, and maybe the space program, too, like the guys in that film. Also known as Carol Danvers, and played by Brie Larson, she has some of their bravado, and also — since she’s on the way to intergalactic superheroism — a righteous sense of mission and a burgeoning identity crisis. [Captain Marvel has had many, many identities in the comics.] The last and least surprising thing we learn about her is that “Captain Marvel will return in ‘Avengers: Endgame,’” a scrappy little picture that will be released in seven weeks, if you can stand to wait that long. Directed by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck from a script they wrote with Geneva Robertson-Dworet, “Captain Marvel” is an origin story, which is to say a résumé check for the newest member of popular culture’s biggest, most heavily capitalized corporate team. As such, it’s pretty good fun, and could almost be described without sarcasm as a scrappy little picture, like most of Boden and Fleck’s other work. (Their résumé includes “Half Nelson,"" “Sugar” and “It’s Kind of a Funny Story”). It’s not too long, not too self-important, and benefits from the craft and talent of a cast that includes Annette Bening, Jude Law and Ben Mendelsohn. And of course Samuel L. Jackson, who plays a young, two-eyed S.H.I.E.L.D. agent named Nicholas Fury. How Fury lost one of those eyes is the big spoiler to avoid here, and the character’s extended presence, after so many agitated cameos over the years, is a big part of the movie’s appeal. To watch the digitally rejuvenated Jackson riding around mid-90s Los Angeles, sort of like he did in “Pulp Fiction,” is to indulge in a bit of Gen-X nostalgia, a mood augmented by period-appropriate musical cues from Salt-N-Pepa, TLC and Nirvana. [Can ‘Captain Marvel’ fix Marvel’s woman problem?] There are pay phones and pagers, too, and boxy government cars and all kinds of stuff that kids these days just don’t appreciate. Even the science-fiction elements have a mildly retro, “Star Trek: The Next Generation” feel. And the overall vibe, for all the fireballs and fisticuffs, is decidedly friendly. In addition to the Vers/Fury buddy-movie pairing, there is a best friend for Carol (a fellow pilot named Maria Rambeau, played by Lashana Lynch) and a succession of frenemies. Best of all, there is an orange cat. I will never hate a movie with an orange cat. The plot of “Captain Marvel,” for some reason, is another secret I’m supposed to keep. Which is fine. In spite of what some unhinged fans on social media might say, I was not paid by Disney to explain anything. Boden and Fleck were, and they do a perfectly adequate job. There’s a big war going on between the Kree — Vers’s people, at least as far as she knows — and the Skrull, green-skinned, pointy-eared beings who have the unnerving skill of turning into doppelgängers of anyone they see. Annette Bening is involved. We first see her as a manifestation of Supreme Intelligence, which seems accurate enough. I’ll say no more. The twists in the story reveal a slyly anti-imperialist politics, which is both in keeping with the pluralist ethic of the Avengers cycle and just a bit subversive of the Disney-Marvel agenda of universal domination. The most sympathetic group of characters wants nothing more than to go somewhere else, to escape from the annihilating attention of their would-be conquerors. They might represent various oppressed and dispossessed earthly populations. They might also stand in for that portion of the movie audience that feels the cinematic universe shrinking around them. Not that anyone can stop the Marvel Cinematic Universe from expanding. By now the contradictions of this gigantic enterprise are obvious enough. It’s inclusive and monopolistic, predatory and empowering. Every episode is unique — every hero is a complex individual with a singular back story — within an overall structure of sameness. Filmmakers like Boden and Fleck, Ryan Coogler and Taika Waititi can put their own spin on a given story or hero, but at some point bolts or waves of orange or blue light will come shooting out of someone’s hands and someone else will be thrown backward and bounce off a wall. The protagonist’s costume will become a character in its own right. That protagonist — a tough and charming woman, in this case, determined to fight gender clichés at least to a draw — will be ready for a career of franchise clock-punching, along with the rest of us. You will stay through the very last credits in the hope of collecting every last Easter egg, and you’ll shuffle out of the theater feeling both satisfied and empty.

2019,"‘Cherokee America’ Blends Family Saga, History and Melodrama","Fiction When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. CHEROKEE AMERICA By Margaret Verble It’s 1875, and Check Singer is a Cherokee Nation matriarch with five sons, the wife to a dying husband and the manager of her family’s successful potato farm. Although she is wealthy, influential and respected in the Nation, there are times when Check wishes she could “unclasp the confines of the feminine role like she unclasped her corset at night.” Margaret Verble’s “Cherokee America” — a prequel to her debut, “Maud’s Line,” which was a Pulitzer finalist — is packed with subplots: a quest for hidden gold, a murder in a bawdy house, the threat of the new federal judge in the Western District of Arkansas, a missing girl, an ambitious politician and a long-term romance. It’s a lot, but the novel is about more than individual events; it’s about life in the Nation when it was a sovereign land with a government of its own. It’s also about the Cherokee culture and its rules, spoken and unspoken, that have been passed down for generations. That culture is both ancient and forward-thinking: In the late 19th century, women in the Cherokee Nation have more rights than women in the States, but those rights only extend so far. Even a smart, gutsy woman like Check is usually thwarted, kept in the dark by men who decide what she should and should not know. The author’s desire to keep to cultural accuracy is understandable. Still, readers may wish Verble, herself a member of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma, had used authorial discretion and given Check enough agency to drive the plot rather than sideline her as a frustrated observer. But Verble’s decision to stay true to Cherokee history ultimately pays off. Viewed as a cultural and character study, “Cherokee America” sings. Though the omniscient viewpoint dilutes Check’s story, that sacrifice is in service to understanding the variety of people in the Nation, where the designation of “full blood” is determined by whether someone lives according to the old ways, not by who their parents and grandparents were. A non-Cherokee man might be married to a native woman, but he will still retain the prejudices of his birth culture; African-Americans are treated better in the Nation than outside, but they have their own unique set of challenges. “Cherokee America” is an essential corrective to the racially tinged myths created to justify the annihilation of indigenous cultures and the theft of native lands. The pacing of the novel mimics the rhythm of a Cherokee neighborly visit: conversation about the weather, crops, family and gossip before getting around to the real point of the call. No matter what was discussed, no matter what was resolved (or not resolved), there was joy and satisfaction in spending time with friends and family. That’s how you will feel about Check and the other characters by the end of the novel. You’re invested in them, their culture, their life. Verble has given historical fiction lovers a real gift: “Cherokee America” is an excellent illustration of how diverse books enrich literature, and the minds of those who read them. The headline with an earlier version of this review misstated the book’s title. It is “Cherokee America,” not “Cherokee Nation.” OpinionMelinda Miller",The New York Times
2019,‘Combat Obscura’ Review: Afghanistan Uncensored,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. “Combat Obscura” opens with multiple disclaimers stating that nothing onscreen reflects official policy or has Defense Department endorsement. Given that the next moment the screen shows an explosion — and someone shouts “that’s the wrong building!” — the reason for the warnings is immediately apparent. As a United States Marine in Afghanistan, Miles Lagoze, the director, worked as a videographer, documenting scenes of war for official release. (We see a clip of such material on CNN midway through the film.) Somehow, Lagoze kept his hands on unreleased footage he and others shot in Afghanistan in 2011 and 2012, and made it the basis for this film. He presents these outtakes with minimal orientation. One through line is the mutual incomprehension between Americans and Afghans. Early on, a Marine believes an Afghan child has warned him about a bomb. He radios a translator, who listens to the boy and says he was simply trying to bum a cigarette. The Marines round up men at a gathering but ultimately release them. One American thinks it “looked like a Taliban meeting,” though the movie suggests reasons to doubt that. Later, the Marines examine a body, and one asks aloud whether they have just killed a shopkeeper. (“This is no good for people to see,” another says.) In these scenes, the decision to forgo context is powerful and troubling. The film also shows the Marines, none formally identified, during lulls, goofing off and getting high. (“Luckily for us, Afghanistan’s a hash farm,” one says.) There is optimism — a soccer game with Afghan children — and quick work tending the wounded. Leaning in to the style its patchwork of source material requires, “Combat Obscura,” is an eye-opening dispatch from a conflict mired in confusion.

2019,‘Company’ and ‘Come From Away’ Lead Olivier Award Nominations,"LONDON — A gender-swapping version of Stephen Sondheim’s “Company” and the feel-good 9/11 musical “Come From Away” dominate the nominations for this year’s Olivier Awards — the British equivalent of the Tony Awards — which were announced on Tuesday. “Company,” which got nine nominations including best musical revival, was expected to lead the way. The production has been one of the most acclaimed in London in the last year. The Times’s theater critic Ben Brantley wrote that the “Company” revival, which replaces the musical’s male lead with a woman, “has emotional coherence and clout that it never possessed in my previous experiences of the show.” “Come From Away,” which opened at the Phoenix Theater in January, is about the residents of a Canadian town who accommodated 6,700 travelers whose planes were diverted there after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. It also received nine nominations, including one for best new musical, despite receiving less positive reviews in London than it did when it opened on Broadway in 2017. “It is musically vigorous and excellently staged,” wrote Michael Billington, the theater critic for The Guardian. He added: “I found something bludgeoning about its relentless celebration of civic virtue.” In nonmusical categories, “The Inheritance,” a two-part, six-and-a-half hour play about the legacy of AIDS, received eight nominations. The play had rave reviews and is expected to transfer to Broadway. Dominic Cavendish, writing in The Daily Telegraph, called it “a theatrical marathon that instantly looks like a modern classic,” adding that it was “perhaps the most important American play of the century so far.” It will compete for best new play against “The Lehman Trilogy,” a family saga, directed by Sam Mendes, about founders of the financial firm bearing their name (It opens at the Park Avenue Armory on March 22); “Sweat,” Lynn Nottage’s Pulitzer Prize-winning play set in working class Pennsylvania; and “Misty,” a one-man-show about a black artist trying to make it in a white world. Other notable nominees in the awards, organized by the Society of London Theater, include Gillian Anderson for best actress for her role in Ivo van Hove’s adaptation of “All About Eve,” at the Noël Coward Theater. Also nominated in that category is Sophie Okonedo, for her role as Cleopatra in the National Theater’s ""Antony and Cleopatra.” Ian McKellen received a best actor nomination for “King Lear” at the Duke of York’s Theater. He is up against all three actors starring in “The Lehman Trilogy”: Adam Godley, Ben Miles and Simon Russell Beale. Winners of the Olivier Awards will be announced April 7 at a ceremony at the Royal Albert Hall in London. The best director award will be called the Sir Peter Hall Award for the first time, after the founder of the Royal Shakespeare Company, who died in 2017. The change was announced last April, after the director was omitted from an in memoriam segment at the 2018 awards. An earlier version of this article misidentified the location where “The Lehman Trilogy” will run in New York. It will open at the Park Avenue Armory on March 22, not on Broadway.",The New York Times
2019,"‘Diane’ Review: A Vibrant Tale of Love, Sisterhood and Decline","Critic’s Pick When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. Buoyed by a movie lover’s wish list of warmly familiar female faces, “Diane,” the remarkable new film from the writer and director Kent Jones, is in part a meditation on dying that feels wondrously alive. Set in rural Massachusetts (and filmed in New York), the story opens in a hospital where Diane (an astonishing Mary Kay Place) is visiting her terminally ill cousin, Donna (Deirdre O’Connell). Later, she’ll check in on a convalescing neighbor, schlep clean laundry to her adult son, Brian (Jake Lacy, excellent), and, over a meal, respond sympathetically to the familiar gripes of her longtime friend Bobbie (Andrea Martin). By the time we see her volunteer at a soup kitchen, we feel we already know who this woman is. In a series of carefully constructed scenes, Jones lays out a life of selfless service, of days defined by casseroles and concern. Yet Diane seems to derive little happiness from these ceaseless activities, her weary features suggesting a private hurt eased only by constant motion. It’s there when she flinches before Brian’s anger at her intervention in his latest tumble down the 12 steps; when she’s gripped, momentarily, by the sight of an old man saying grace in the soup kitchen; and when she listens to Donna’s mother (the great Estelle Parsons) talk briskly about loss and regret. Past indiscretions haunt Diane, and this movie, and the glory of Place’s performance — and that of her co-stars — is how barely these need to be verbalized. Emotions play across faces weathered by age and bonded by long experience, and the wonder is that a story this threaded with sickness and decline is neither tedious nor depressing. Each scene has its own specific energy and tone, conjured by a happy congruence of skillfully vivid acting, naturalistic conversations and a cinematographer, Wyatt Garfield, with a clear grasp of mood. Whether lingering on the candlelit faces of diners during a blackout, or watching calmly as Diane dances, drunkenly, alone in a bar, his camera feels completely in tune with his director’s intent. Filled with wintry roads and sensible clothing, “Diane” plays out at bedsides and in kitchens where women cheer one another with stories and memories. This is Jones’s first narrative film, and he explains in the press notes that his aim was to make a picture about his great-aunts, a feisty, close-knit group who dominated family gatherings. It makes sense, then, that Brian is the only male character who really registers: other men mostly come and go in the background. In the context of the modern multiplex, “Diane” amounts to an act of cinematic bravery, not just in its choice of tough-sell material, but in the patience with which Jones tends it. Parts of his story don’t quite work (especially Brian’s extreme spiritual awakening); but by examining a life from the angle of its final destination, the movie offers a rich and tender study of a woman hollowed out by remorse. For Diane, the past, far from being a foreign country, is where she has lived for a very long time.

2019,‘Do You Pull the Parchment?’: Students Caught Up in College Admissions Scandal Now Face a Reckoning,"The many students enmeshed in the college admissions scandal that was unveiled last week now face a reckoning as universities seek to determine whether they were innocent victims who should keep working toward their degrees or unethical schemers worthy of discipline. The University of Southern California said it had identified six current applicants associated with the case and would reject them. The school informed an additional number of enrolled students who were linked to the scandal that they could not register for classes until administrators had determined their level of culpability. Yale, another university implicated in the fraud, reminded students last week of a longstanding policy to rescind the admission of students who falsify applications. A statement from Stanford said that inaccurate information on a college application was grounds for being “disenrolled” from the university or having an offer of admission rescinded, “as has happened regretfully in the past.” The 33 wealthy parents charged with paying large sums to get their children into leading universities are the targets of criminal complaints. But it is the schools themselves that must grapple with how to mete out justice to students who gained admissions through fraudulent means. The scope of the scandal has left many college administrators in uncharted ethical territory. “A college is not in a great position to investigate,” said Theodore O’Neill, who was dean of admissions at the University of Chicago for two decades. “The admissions process is held together by a tissue of trust.” [Here’s what you need to know about the college cheating scandal.] Colleges have policies for addressing cheating by enrolled students. But now they must evaluate allegations of cheating that occurred before students ever set foot on campus — acts that some may not have known was being done on their behalf. Moreover, some students who gained admissions to universities through fraudulent means may have already graduated, raising the question of whether they ought to be stripped of their diplomas. The schools, many of which say they are victims, are eager to show they are taking steps to deter flagrant admissions fraud. But the conclusion of the criminal cases could take months, and perhaps exonerate some of those involved. A former federal prosecutor, Berit Berger, said that it could be tricky for universities to conduct internal investigations during a possibly protracted criminal proceeding. College disciplinary systems do not necessarily operate on a standard of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. But if a school expelled a student, and a trial then exonerated the family, “that’s not a good look,” said Ms. Berger, now director of the Center for the Advancement of Public Integrity at Columbia Law School. Ms. Berger also wondered what universities might do if students implicated in the scandal had already graduated. “Do you pull the parchment?” she said. At least one school, Wake Forest, has said that a student implicated in the case will remain enrolled. “At this time, we do not plan to take any action against her when there is no evidence she had any knowledge of the alleged financial transaction,” said Katie Neal, a Wake Forest spokeswoman. It is not just the nationwide college admissions scandal, which the authorities labeled “Operation Varsity Blues,” that is prompting review. In the wake of revelations about the fraud and abuse that were rampant at T.M. Landry High School in Louisiana — which was the subject of a scandal of its own — students who had enrolled in college faced scrutiny from their administrators and peers. The bribery scheme has also torn through the world of elite Los Angeles area prep schools. Harvard-Westlake School received subpoenas from federal investigators before the case was publicly announced. Two parents named in the case resigned from the board of trustees of Sage Hill, a private school in Newport Coast, Calif. transcript “We condemn the alleged actions of those implicated in this scandal as they clearly do not reflect our school’s mission, values and vision,” Sage Hill said in a statement, adding that the “consistent practice has been to recommend against the use of independent college counselors.” Some of the students implicated in the case unearthed by federal prosecutors last week appear to have been knowing participants in the fraud. But it was adults who played the dominant roles, with parents, consultants, college officials and athletic coaches under indictment for scheming on behalf of unwitting children. In the court papers, which contain transcripts of conversations between parents and officials at the organization that arranged the bribes, one parent recounted a “glitch” when her son, fraudulently recruited as a track athlete, was asked about the sport by an adviser at orientation. “Apparently the adviser said something to the effect of, ‘Oh, so you’re a track athlete?’ And [my son] said, ‘No.’ Cause, so [my son] has no idea,’’ the transcript reads. “I understand, she won’t even know,’’ another parent said, referring to elaborate plans to deceive her daughter about an arrangement to falsify her standardized test score. Still, several colleges issued statements this week indicating that students unwittingly associated with the scandal could still be held accountable because they are required to certify, by signing their applications, that they had told the truth. At the University of Texas, for instance, that language reads: “I certify that the information I have provided is complete and correct, and I understand that the submission of false information is grounds for rejection of my application, withdrawal of any offer of acceptance, cancellation of enrollment and/or appropriate disciplinary action.” University officials declined to discuss specific cases, citing privacy rules, but they said punishment could be as severe as being expelled or having admission rescinded. The federal investigation found that a Yale coach gave bogus athletic endorsements to two students, one of whom was admitted to the college, Tom Conroy, a spokesman for Yale, said Tuesday. He said that how well a student performed academically while at Yale would not factor into a disciplinary decision. “When applicants sign their applications, they attest that the contents are true and complete,” Mr. Conroy said. Even beyond such formal attestations, some ethicists said there was a case for expelling the students who benefited unknowingly from their parents’ machinations. “It’s pretty common in the law, and it coincides with moral intuitions: If you’re the unwitting beneficiary of a fraud, you don’t get to keep the benefits,” said Brian Leiter, director of the Center for Law, Philosophy and Human Values at the University of Chicago, who has posted on his philosophy blog, “Leiter Reports,’’ about the scandal. And children, Professor Leiter said, share a common interest with their parents. Allowing them to acquire a prestigious college degree would reward their parents’ behavior, even if they had been unaware of it. But he said what to do with students like those at T.M. Landry whose high school administrators had falsified their applications was more difficult, because the school had an interest in raising its own reputation. “If it’s entirely on the administrator, probably the penalty shouldn’t be exacted on the student,” he said. Messages left with more than three dozen parents and students associated with the alleged scheme were not returned on Tuesday. William Singer, the college counselor at the center of the fraud case, expressed sympathy for the children of his former clients who now find themselves facing possible expulsion, his lawyer, Donald H. Heller, said in an interview. “He feels horribly for the distress the kids are going through,” Mr. Heller said. Mr. Singer’s suggestion, for what it’s worth, is that “each student should be judged on the student’s personal culpability — as opposed to the conduct of others,” the lawyer said.",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | ‘Do Your Children a Favor: Develop Some Real Values’,"Readers respond to the college admissions scandal. Ms. Harris and Ms. Tarchak are senior editorial assistants. Gross class privilege, the repression of meritocracy and the hypocrisy of supporting affirmative action are just a few of the concerns raised by Opinion readers since Tuesday’s college admissions scandal broke. We received more than 4,000 comments on our coverage, which included Frank Bruni’s column, “Bribes to Get Into Yale and Stanford? What Else Is New?,” the Editorial, “Turns Out There’s a Proper Way to Buy Your Kid a College Spot” and “I Learned in College That Admission Has Always Been for Sale,” an essay by Rainesford Stauffer, a writer and recent college graduate. A selection of those comments, edited for clarity and length, is below. Private institutions like Stanford have the right to shape their student bodies based on their own values. No one has a right to a Stanford education. That some have a leg up on elite college admissions because they can afford a tutor doesn’t bother me at all. Rich people also have a leg up on buying Porsches and fancy houses; on paying tuition at elite private high schools. So what? The real scandal is the defunding of state universities. As a society, we should be more concerned with providing a solid, affordable undergraduate education to every willing student. — James Grosser, Washington, D.C. So much raw greed on display. Such anxious, seething lust for status, position, privilege, and money. Frankly, it’s disgusting. I’ve been reading all these columns for days now, watching news coverage, and so far not one word about students wanting to learn or about what education might mean to them, apart from being a kind of weapon with which to scratch and claw over others while climbing some grand pyramid of power and acquisitiveness. Life is more than all that; learning is more than all that. Do your children a favor. Develop some real values. — R.R.I., Ocean Beach, Calif. Gone are the lofty days when education was meant to make us a better citizens. Now it’s simply another gate for a young person who can barely balance a checkbook to pass through for the chance of not being as unequal in income as their peers. It’s all about pedigree, not substance. As a millennial, I see what a fool I was for obtaining multiple degrees that got me nowhere, except in debt. — Anne, New Jersey Wealth makes things more attainable. That’s why we seek it. The question is, what goods and services should be beyond the reach of wealth? Of course there are inequities in life. Arguably, our system has let them grow out of control. But that doesn’t mean the parent who pays for an S.A.T. prep course is the moral equivalent of one who pays someone to change their child’s score. — Charlie B., U.S.A. When I first heard about this story, I really did wonder what was actually criminal about this very bad behavior. Families have been gaming the system forever to get their children into top schools. How is bribing a coach all that different from writing your child’s essay? It’s just a heavier thumb on the scale. — Marcia Goodrich, Michigan The children of the wealthy and privileged have always been given special consideration at selective colleges. It’s affirmative action for the aristocracy, although it’s never referred to or criticized as a betrayal of the meritocratic ideal. But set aside even a few spots for members of minorities who have historically been the victims of discrimination, and suddenly it is important not to compromise academia’s strict meritocratic standards. The hypocrisy is breathtaking. — lydgate, Virginia The thing about having a stack of dollar bills is that if some get dirty, you can just clean them off with the rest. This scandal will no doubt outrage the mere upper-middle class parents, who can only afford the $100 per hour tutors and will, no doubt, feel particularly victimized that their own efforts to game the system have just been outdone by the class they aspire to join. — Josh, Seattle Be outraged. Hold our institutions to a higher standard. Hold the fraudsters accountable. It’s a good thing that these acts are being prosecuted and denounced. I don’t want people with pedigrees not earned operating on me, engineering my bridges and buildings, operating my financial system or running my country. Complacency is killing us, cut by cut. The elite and privileged might always exist but we can still demand a meritocracy rather than slinking away quietly and accepting it with our tails between our legs. — sebb, Washington This kind of cheating contributes to the creation of a permanent economic underclass. Right or wrong, degrees from the elite schools mean something when young people start to look for work. They provide tremendous access and opportunities that less competitive schools can’t offer. That’s why these crimes are serious. Because of these cheaters, deserving working class and middle class children are denied an opportunity for a better life than their parents had. — Orion Clemens, Florida, Mo. The problem is that these people, who have been given every leg up that their parents, their wealth and their connections have afforded, often believe that they are a product of their own intelligence and hard work. Then they tend to have less understanding and compassion for those who started in this world with far less and support policies that continue to hold back the poor, the under served and those who have truly started out in this world with the deck stacked against them. — J.B. Hart, Charlotte I was a student at a very good university in the Midwest where I met a guy who told me he was he was only there because of his legacy status (his father had gone to the school). He seemed to feel that he had let his father down and was afraid he looked stupid to his classmates. Our children are not trophies for us to show around. They need to find the right niches for themselves and parents should help them do that. — scrim1, Bowie, Md. The real losers in all this are the children of these wealthy parents, who learn that cheating is the way to win in life. They have been failed by their parents and lost something precious: their self-respect. Their entire life, people will wonder if what they achieve is a product of honest work and skill or another cheat — even if they end up being presidents or senior White House advisers. — Jim Brokaw, California The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

2019,‘Dog Suicide Bridge’: Why Do So Many Pets Keep Leaping Into a Scottish Gorge?,"Scotland Dispatch DUMBARTON, Scotland — “I was sure she was dead,” Lottie Mackinnon said quietly. Ms. Mackinnon was sitting huddled in the corner of a cafe with her two children, sipping hot chocolate as she described the day three years ago when she was walking with her Border collie, Bonnie, over the Overtoun Bridge in Dumbarton, Scotland. “Something overcame Bonnie as soon as we approached the bridge,” Ms. Mackinnon said. “At first she froze, but then she became possessed by a strange energy and ran and jumped right off the parapet.” A bewitched dog lured to leap off a bridge by a malevolent force? It sounds like a preposterous scene straight from an old “Twilight Zone” episode. But Ms. Mackinnon’s dog is one of hundreds that Scots insist have suddenly been compelled to throw themselves off the gothic stone structure since the 1950s. Many have ended up dead on the jagged rocks in the deep valley bed below. Residents of Dumbarton, which is northwest of Glasgow, began calling Overtoun, a century-old bridge that stretches across a 50-foot gorge, the “dog suicide bridge.” Ms. Mackinnon, who grew up in the neighboring village of Milton, winced at the memory of scurrying down the gorge through the trees and the bushes in a desperate hunt for Bonnie. But when she approached the dog’s body, Bonnie started to whimper and eventually tried to stand up. “It was a miracle that she survived,” she said. In a land rife with superstitions, myths and monsters the bridge has been at the center of an enduring mystery. Why do so many dogs jump? Local researchers estimate more than 300 have sailed off the bridge; tabloid reports say it’s 600. At least 50 dogs are said to have died. Some say there are rational explanations involving the terrain and the scents of mammals in the gorge that may drive the dogs into a frenzy. Other explanations take on a more paranormal tone. The bridge’s location, hushed, lush and sometimes still, fits the description of what the pagan Celts called a “thin place,” a mesmerizing spot where heaven and earth overlap. 5 miles Overtoun Burn scotland Glasgow Overtoun Bridge Dumbarton scotland Milton 1/2 mile By The New York Times “People in Dumbarton are very superstitious,” said Alastair Dutton, a local taxi driver. “We grew up playing in the Overtoun grounds, and we believe in ghosts here because we’ve all seen or felt spirits up here.” The leaps inspired an episode of the American TV series “The Unexplained Files.” An entire book is dedicated to exploring the phenomenon. But despite all this attention, the mystery lives on, unsolved. From a distance, it seems as if the ornate Victorian bridge, built in 1895, is a mere extension of the driveway of an adjoining 19th-century manor built in Dumbarton by a wealthy industrialist, James White. Closer still, one can make out the bridge’s three archways spanning a small river, the Overtoun Burn. Standing in the middle on the bridge’s blackened granite parapets, it is easy to forget the space beneath falls away into the deep gorge. In the manor nearby, the current tenant, Bob Hill, said he and his wife had seen several dogs suddenly dive off the bridge since they moved into the property, now called Overtoun House, more than 17 years ago. But Mr. Hill, a pastor from Texas who runs a local center for women in crisis, had an earthbound explanation: The smell of small animals scurrying around in the gorge below the bridge drives the dogs into a frenzy; then they break free of leashes — if they’re on any — and jump. “The dogs catch the scent of mink, pine martens or some other mammal and then they will jump up on the wall of the bridge,” Mr. Hill said. “And because it’s tapered, they will just topple over.” Still, he allowed, the Overtoun grounds are “more spiritual than other parts.” “Scotland is kind of a place where there is a lot of the supernatural, and it is very common in people’s lives,” he added. Paul Owens, a teacher of religion and philosophy in Glasgow, grew up in a town close to the bridge and recently published a book about the mystery. When it comes to an explanation for the leaping dogs, he is firmly in the supernatural camp. “After 11 years of research, I’m convinced it’s a ghost that is behind all of this,” he declared, while sitting outside a pub on a drizzly day in Glasgow. Mr. Owens’s theory is popular among some local residents, who grew up hearing stories about the “White Lady of Overtoun,” the grieving widow of John White, James’s son. “The lady lived alone in grief for more than 30 years after her husband died in 1908,” said Marion Murray, a Dumbarton resident. “Her ghost has been lurking around here ever since. She’s been sighted in windows and walking around the grounds.” In 2010, the animal behaviorist David Sands investigated the phenomenon and ruled out the possibility that the animals were deliberately killing themselves. His experiments at the bridge found that dogs — especially long-nosed breeds — were drawn to the scent of mammals below. Dr. Sands theorized that the dogs’ limited perspective, their ignorance that the path changes from level ground to a bridge spanning a deep gorge and the smells wafting through the air probably enticed the dogs to jump. But even he acknowledged that the bridge had a “strange feeling.” Some residents found his theory plausible, but many here still take the position that the leaps are inexplicable. They question why the phenomenon does not occur at the same rate at other bridges in Britain where mammals roam below. “Other bridges don’t have troubled spirits lurking about,” Ms. Mackinnon insisted grimly. Despite the macabre reputation, the Overtoun grounds remain a popular dog-walking area and many of the animals are off leash. “Many people don’t believe in the story until they see it for themselves, and even then they don’t think it will happen to them,” said Mr. Hill, the pastor. One day, Emma Dunlop, who said she had heard “the horror stories,” took her Labrador retriever, Ginger, for a walk to Overtoun anyway. She did not let him out of her station wagon until he was on a leash. “He’s never tried to jump,” she said, “but sometimes he freezes or hesitates when he gets on the bridge, so I’m always careful.” Ginger jumped from the car, raced around his owner and headed straight toward Overtoun Bridge, crossing it without any hesitation. But then Ginger froze, looking back intently at something on the bridge, which appeared empty to human eyes. “Aye, there she is — there’s the White Lady,” Ms. Dunlop said with a laugh, suggesting Ginger had seen the bridge’s ghost. Then the pair continued their walk.",The New York Times
2019,‘Don’t Succumb to the Fear’: Women Share Travel Safety Tips,"No woman is responsible for harassment or any other violent act against her. But experienced travelers and government agencies show how to travel as safely as possible. On Tuesday, Google unveiled a Doodle in honor of Chen Mao Ping, the renowned Chinese-born author known as Sanmao, on what would have been her 76th birthday. She traveled the globe and wrote of her adventures, inspiring generations of women to see the world beyond their own homes. Sanmao died in 1991 in Taiwan, but it’s not hard to imagine that while traveling she had encountered some risk, as many women who travel today do. After the publication of a New York Times article about the dangers women face while traveling alone — a thread in a broader fabric of harassment and violence — readers had lots of suggestions about how to keep women safe. Jessica Nabongo, who appeared in the article, says she stays in hotels with 24-hour security or in Airbnbs that have achieved Superhost status. She tries to always take Ubers so that her location is tracked, especially at night. Paramount among the suggestions were calls for men to be allies. Many readers noted that men can do much to help women — and others — who travel alone by simply not ignoring the bad behavior of others. If something seems amiss, check on another traveler, and if need be, intervene safely or alert the authorities. Below are other suggestions. “Bring a basic rubber doorstop and use that to wedge under the inside of your hotel/lodging door while you’re in your room. It’s almost impossible to push open a door while that’s in place.” — Allison Lane, 38, San Francisco. Has traveled to Sierra Leone, Ghana, Kenya, Uganda, Egypt, India, Nepal, Jamaica, and Russia. Many women said they practiced self-defense tactics like martial arts. But they also said that above all: Heed your gut; trust your instincts. Carry pepper spray, a pocketknife, a laptop or anything that can be used as a weapon or to summon help. There’s nothing to lose by going on group tours or guided excursions. Others also stressed the same tactics they used at home: not walking alone in the dark, never taking a drink you haven’t seen poured and being aware of the “friendly” stranger. Some women suggested carrying two phones in case one is stolen. Others said to divide up your belongings and your cash in case you’re robbed, so that you do not lose everything. Free applications like Chirpey, RedZone, MayDay, Tripwhistle and Noonlight let women flag incidents and areas of danger, and show how to contact local law enforcement. “Be prepared to be bombarded as you step off the bus, train, or out of the airport. These can be some of the most intense moments of solo travel. It’s good to already know what you want and where you are going next. If you don’t, then just walk away a short distance, observe, and take a little time to get your bearings before making a decision. “Overnight buses are the worst when you’re traveling alone as a woman! More than once I’ve woken up with the hand of the man next to me wandering over between my legs. Now I put a bag in between me and the next person, and the first time he tests the waters, even if I’m not sure he has bad intentions, I make a point to overreact a little.” — Kelsi Lyon, 37, Portland, Ore. Has traveled to India, Indonesia, Burma, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Hong Kong, Tanzania, Rwanda, Uganda, Peru, Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Philippines, Spain, France and Italy. Many readers stressed that dressing according to the local customs, including wearing modest clothing, simply made sense and was not a way to blame women for the acts of others. The United States State Department notes: “When it comes to health and security, women travelers are more likely to be affected by religious and cultural beliefs of the foreign countries they visit. The truth is that women face greater obstacles, especially when traveling alone.” “In moments between the wonder, awe and privilege of traveling through the world, I have been followed and harassed by men who assume I’m a sex worker, not a solo black female traveler simply trying to see a bit of the world. “When I’m traveling solo through Southeast Asia, I try to increase my visibility and underscore my humanity by making friends with locals. I chat with the older male and female hawkers, guards and food sellers I pass, buy a thing or two and let them know how long I’ll be around. In many cultures, elders are respected, and when you connect with them, they take you under their wing. Learning a few words of conversation, greeting, thanks and emergency go a long way in this regard.” — Martha Mukaiwa, 33, Windhoek, Namibia. Has traveled to Thailand, Malaysia, Ghana, Indonesia, Germany, France and Italy. “I will often hire a local guide to accompany me:you are far less likely to be trifled with when you are with one. They speak the language and pave the way. “I tip at hotels as soon as I get there in countries with a high poverty rate. Concierge, desk, servers, maids and luggage, I give to them all. That way if I need a rescue or anything else, I am covered. This has often paid off for me. “I once needed assistance to get back to my hotel during a riot in Ecuador. I could not take a taxi — it was the taxi drivers who were rioting. I couldn’t get back to the hotel and it was the only time I went out without a guide. I had tipped everyone at my hotel so when I called for assistance, I was covered.” — Caroline Vroom, 63, Sarasota, Fla. I have traveled to South America, Europe, Asia, Egypt — 75 countries. Not always alone. But alone quite a lot. I sometimes prefer it. Many governments issue travel advisories for other countries for their citizens. The State Department, for example, publishes a list of safety levels by country. Its website, Travel.State.Gov, has information on every country and contact information for the closest American Embassy or Consulate. The State Department also has advice specifically for female travelers, and other groups. Consider enrolling in the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program, a.k.a. STEP, or its equivalent in your country. Unicef has data on violence indicators that may be telling for travelers, including domestic violence, female genital mutilation and female homicide. The World Bank has a gender data portal that provides statistics that can signal to women whether it’s a safe location over all. “Try to stay in places where other travelers are staying, i.e. try not to stay in a place where you are the only guest. Try to be sure you can lock your door when you go to sleep.

2019,‘Dragged Across Concrete’ Review: The Evil That Men Do (Repeatedly),"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. A dribbling tear tells you much about “Dragged Across Concrete,” a self-satisfied slow burn of a movie. This salty emanation slides through a slit that a very bad man with a very big knife cuts in the duct tape covering a hostage’s eyes. The captive is a bank employee who has been snatched during a violent robbery. She’s trussed up in the getaway van, and her fate looks bleak. Some of her colleagues were killed during the heist, and one was castrated for no real reason except as a declaration of flamboyant cruelty — putatively on the part of the villains, though the blame really lies elsewhere. A severed hand or finger probably would have sent a similarly strong message to the terrified bank employees. But genital mutilation is something special, an outré shock. It’s a reminder that spectacular violence can be a useful tool for slapping stories and viewers awake. The castration certainly underlines the depravity of the villains, who with each bullet and flick of the blade strengthen the case against them, paving the way for their preordained bloody punishment. Mostly, though, it is directorial swagger, just like the tear that spills from the duct-tape blindfold. The writer-director S. Craig Zahler has embellished “Dragged Across Concrete” — a neo-exploitation potboiler about brutal men on both sides of the law — in both modest and grandiose ways. He’s clearly given a lot of thought to this strain of detective-gangster fiction, to its cruelty, extremity, pessimism and flashes of nihilism. His detectives, Brett (Mel Gibson) and Anthony (Vince Vaughn), fit their types to a T, entering the story with ready guns and well-honed cynicism. Before long, Brett is pressing one of his boots down on the neck of a handcuffed Latino suspect and tossing a near-naked Latina woman into a shower for an interrogation — a Mickey Spillane-style warm-up for the sadism to come. The story is as predictable as expected, with the usual guns, cars and money, though drawn out to an unhurried 158 minutes. There are ostensible good men turned bad, and one who is perhaps less bad. There are women (Jennifer Carpenter makes sympathetic a disposable character), a retinue of the negligible, the victimized, the soon to be dead. Most of the characters fit into three categories — evil men, men who stand in evil’s way and collateral damage — and some from each will be sacrificed on the hard-boiled altar. This includes a baby, whose sole function is to fool you into thinking that things won’t turn really ugly. They do, which makes optimistic viewers suckers. Zahler likes to pull back to show you people in their environments, in vaulted and confining spaces. He plays around with light and dark, but mostly dark, and a lot of the story takes place in shadows or low illumination. Almost everyone lives in an impersonal home seemingly decorated by the same depressed interior designer, with muted colors and generic furnishings that turn each dwelling into a showroom. The characters are less blank largely because of Zahler’s writing, his eccentric metaphors and monologues. More prosaic is his hard embrace of the same old-fashioned American anti-authoritarianism — with its hatred for rules matched only by a love of guns — that helped define Dirty Harry. The movie is generally watchable, even at its slowest and ugliest, simply because the actors are solid even when their characters are repellent. Gibson delivers a tamped-down performance, going for stolid, while Vaughn runs his mouth and enjoys his flashy bits. The most sympathetic character, Henry (a fine Tory Kittles), occupies another story line that soon crosses Brett and Anthony’s. A newly released ex-con, Henry has a brother who uses a wheelchair and a mother who’s been turning tricks while he’s been in the pen. Brett has a daughter and a wife who has multiple sclerosis and uses a cane. Zahler seems to want to make Henry a counterweight to the detectives (Brett especially), as if to suggest that they’re alike, though their worlds and power couldn’t be more different. This spurious parallelism, though, does suit the movie’s dog-eat-dog worldview or its baiting representation of the white characters’ racism. Some openly voice their bigotry, which might have been a bold choice if Zahler had interrogated it rather than given himself convenient outs. Anthony makes a joke about Martin Luther King Jr. Day. He also has a black girlfriend, which is presumably meant to complicate his character but instead feels like a directorial hedge. When Brett’s wife says that she wasn’t a racist until she moved into their crummy neighborhood, her rueful delivery suggests that she was regrettably forced — dragged across concrete, perhaps — into prejudice. Zahler just lets her racism hang in the air unanswered, which says plenty.

2019,‘Dumbo’ Falls Short of Box-Office Expectations but Still Comes in First,"“Dumbo” was no runt — but it was no mammoth hit, either. Nearly eight decades after the 1941 original, Disney’s live-action “Dumbo” arrived in theaters this weekend to $45 million in ticket sales, topping the domestic box office. But that figure fell slightly below analysts’ expectations of around $50 million, and overall made for a moderately disappointing opening for the Tim Burton film, which reportedly had a production budget of $170 million. An additional $71 million in overseas sales brings its global weekend total to $116 million. Like the animated original, Burton’s “Dumbo” follows the trials and eventual triumph of an elephant outcast. Unlike the original, the new film is led by famous flesh-and-blood actors: Danny DeVito, Colin Farrell, Eva Green and Michael Keaton. It’s a darker (if PG-rated) take on the story, with DeVito playing the owner of a scrappy circus that gets bought by a powerful big-city entrepreneur and amusement-park owner (Keaton), who intends to exploit the circus’s discovery of Dumbo, the flying elephant. [Read our critic’s review of “Dumbo.”] “Dumbo” is the latest in a string of live-action, C.G.I.-buttressed Disney remakes. Its slight underperformance may be due in part to the unenthusiastic reception it received from most critics — it currently holds a 50 percent fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes. By comparison, last year’s Winnie-the-Pooh tale from Disney, “Christopher Robin,” received 72 percent positive reviews, and 2017’s live-action “Beauty and the Beast” holds 71 percent. Remakes of “Aladdin” and “The Lion King” are slated for release later this year. There probably wasn’t much competition between “Dumbo” and this weekend’s other big movie. Universal’s “Us,” Jordan’s Peele’s family-unfriendly follow-up to his landmark 2017 feature debut, “Get Out,” easily landed in second place, selling $33.6 million in tickets according to Comscore, which compiles box-office data. That’s more than enough to send its cumulative sales past the $100 million mark: after two weekends, the film has now made about $128.2 million domestically. That puts “Us” slightly ahead of where 2018’s “Halloween” was after its second weekend. “Halloween,” which carried both the name recognition and baggage of a 40-year-old franchise, had a North American total of about $126.7 million by that point. But it also had a significantly higher debut weekend ($77.5 million versus the $70.3 million brought in by “Us”). The other newcomer in the top five was Pure Flix’s “Unplanned,” an R-rated Christian drama about a young woman who founds an anti-abortion organization. That movie opened to $6.1 million this weekend, landing in fifth place. Neon’s “The Beach Bum,” the latest comedy from the director Harmony Korine which stars Matthew McConaughey as a Florida pothead, flopped with just $1.8 million in domestic sales.",The New York Times
2019,"‘Embarrassing, Stale and Sexist’: Bike Safety Ad in Germany Draws Anger","BERLIN — As he held up one of the new posters about the importance of wearing a helmet when cycling, the German transport minister said the safety campaign was intended to draw attention. “It’s all about getting noticed,” the minister, Andreas Scheuer, said at the official unveiling last week. The posters have certainly achieved that. The focus has not been on the helmets, though, but rather on the lack of other clothing worn by the models, who are pictured in their underwear, and on the language used, which many consider vulgar. “Embarrassing, stale and sexist,” was how one lawmaker described the campaign. “Half-naked women and men should not be put onto posters at taxpayers’ expense,” the lawmaker, Katja Mast, told the German daily Passauer Neue Presse. Ms. Mast is a member of the Social Democrats, which is part of the governing coalition that also includes Mr. Scheuer’s party, the Christian Social Union in Bavaria. The safety posters with women in lingerie and bare-chested men — though no bicycles in view — seek to make the point that although it is difficult to look good in a helmet, the headwear can save lives. The campaign uses models from the reality television show “Germany’s Next Top Model,” which is hosted by Heidi Klum, and features a slogan in English that includes a profanity. According to the Transport Ministry, the campaign is aimed especially at young women who think helmets are unattractive. The posters will line bicycle paths in major German cities and will cost 400,000 euros, or about $453,000, the ministry said. The campaign, with its hashtag “helmets save lives,” immediately drew scorn on social media. Franziska Giffey, the minister for families, posted a picture of her pushing her bike wearing a helmet and everyday clothes. “Dear Andreas Scheuer,” she wrote, “You can also be dressed while wearing a helmet.” Another Twitter user, Udo Güngerich, wrote: “I would have preferred it if an S.U.V. had run over a half-nude helmet wearer. Just for realism’s sake.” Apart from the nudity, the profanity in the slogan was a reminder of how Germans can fall foul of using words in official settings that English speakers would usually balk at hearing in public. In December, Chancellor Angela Merkel used an English profanity to describe chaos during a speech in German at a technology conference. Injuries to cyclists have become a significant concern in Germany. In 2018, 432 cyclists died in accidents, according to ADAC, a German automobile association, 50 more than the year before. Wearing a helmet when cycling is not mandatory in Germany — 40 percent of riders under age 30 do not even own one, and only 8 percent of riders aged 17 to 30 wear one, according to a poll commissioned by the Transport Ministry. Mr. Scheuer, the transport minister, has a history of awkward public messaging. The 44-year-old goes to some length to show a breezy, youthful side. He uses a shortened version of his name on Twitter and has posed as a guest D.J. at a dance club. He has also filmed himself giving a speed tour through his ministry and using a bike-sharing service to head home from work, despite having a reputation as an advocate for cars. A spokeswoman for the Transport Ministry, Svenja Friedrich, said on Monday that the campaign had been intended to garner interest. “We can absolutely understand the criticism from various sides, but we still stand by the images,” she said. In a post on Twitter responding to the furor generated by the posters, Mr. Scheuer expressed gratitude for the attention and called it one of his ministry’s most successful campaigns to date.",The New York Times
2019,‘Everything Went Black’: Attack Rattles a Tense Jammu and Kashmir,"SRINAGAR, Kashmir — Fears of communal violence were once again raised in the disputed region of Jammu and Kashmir on Thursday when a grenade blew up at a crowded bus stand, killing one person and wounding many others. Around the same time, videos of two Indian men beating Kashmiri street vendors in a northern Indian city went viral online, further stoking tensions. The violence followed a week of hostilities in Kashmir between India and Pakistan, both of which claim the mountainous region. On Thursday, witnesses said that a young man lobbed a grenade toward a crowd of people, including many students, who were waiting for a bus in central Jammu, one of the larger cities in the Indian-controlled part of Kashmir. A simple guide to the roots of the conflict and what could happen next. “There was a loud bang — everything went black in front of my eyes,” said Sat Kumar, a trader, who was taken to the hospital along with more than two dozen others who were injured in the attack, some critically. The young man who threw the grenade initially got away. But later in the day, Indian police officials said they had apprehended someone with the help of CCTV footage. Indian officials identified the suspect as a 17-year-old Kashmiri who was part of a militant group fighting against Indian rule in Kashmir. The police said that during an interrogation, he had confessed to throwing the grenade. Last month, a young Kashmiri separatist blew up a bus full of Indian soldiers, setting off a sharply escalating military crisis between India and Pakistan, which India has accused of supporting separatist militants. India and Pakistan have feuded for decades, and both wield nuclear arms. Other countries, including the United States and China, have urged the two sides to step away from conflict. The crisis was somewhat defused late last week after Pakistan returned an Indian pilot whose plane it shot down over Kashmir. Some in the region have wondered whether the bus stand attack might be connected to India’s coming elections and a nefarious effort to provoke animosities between Hindus and Muslims in the country. The Jammu area is predominantly Hindu, while the larger Jammu and Kashmir region is majority Muslim. Jammu has a history of religious tensions erupting into violence. M.K. Sinha, a police official in Jammu, urged people to remain calm. “The culprits will not be spared,” he said. India and Pakistan continue to eye each other warily, and artillery shells continue to fly across the disputed border in Kashmir. Last week, shelling killed several people on both sides of the border. In Lucknow, a large city in northern India, the police arrested four people on Thursday on suspicion of beating up Kashmiri street vendors after a video went viral that showed the attack. Wearing saffron shirts, the color favored by many Hindu nationalists, the attackers called the street vendors “terrorists” and said, “You sell here and throw stones there,” referring to protests in Kashmir. The attackers slapped the Kashmiri men in the face and hit them with a long wooden stick. This was hardly an isolated incident. After the Indian convoy was attacked in mid-February, hundreds of Kashmiri college students at universities in India were chased off their campuses, and some were beaten up. And in New Delhi, the capital, some Kashmiris were thrown out by their landlords simply for being Kashmiri.",The New York Times
2019,"Opinion | ‘Extreme Partisan Gerrymandering Is a Real Problem,’ Says Kavanaugh. He’s Right.","The Supreme Court could make history by erecting a constitutional barrier to electoral maps that put party over country. The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section. On Tuesday, the Supreme Court once again took up the issue of partisan gerrymandering, hearing two cases that could allow the justices to put an end to the practice of drawing legislative maps for no other reason than to give an electoral edge to the party doing the drawing. Or as Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has described it, “the drawing of legislative district lines to subordinate adherents of one political party and entrench a rival party in power.” Voting rights advocates fear that an emboldened conservative majority on the court may not be open to policing politically motivated gerrymandering, in turn barring federal judges from considering future lawsuits. One of the cases before the Supreme Court this week comes from North Carolina, where Republicans won barely 50 percent of the vote in the 2018 midterms but took nine of 13 congressional seats. (That count does not include the Ninth Congressional District, which remains contested as a result of rampant election fraud.) In a lengthy ruling addressing these disparities, which arose from a map drawn in 2016, a panel of federal judges in August said that the state’s Republican-controlled General Assembly violated the Constitution by drawing districts to give Republicans a partisan advantage. The other case is from Maryland, where a different panel of judges ruled that the Sixth Congressional District was unconstitutionally drawn because Democrats “specifically targeted voters … who were registered as Republicans and who had historically voted for Republican candidates.” The judges found that Republican voters’ rights were violated because the gerrymander effectively moved about 30 percent of them out of the district, which for nearly two decades had been represented by a Republican congressman, and replaced them with Democratic voters. In both cases —  Rucho v. Common Cause and Lamone v. Benisek — lawmakers were clear about their intentions and set out explicitly to one-up the other party. In deciding these disputes, the justices could send a clear and important message against the practice of legislators drawing district boundaries in a way that increases their party’s re-election chances — by moving voters for the other side in and out of districts and diminishing the value of their votes. The Supreme Court showed signs on Tuesday that it may be willing to do just that. Surprising many court-watchers, Justice Brett Kavanaugh acknowledged the challengers’ claims. “Extreme partisan gerrymandering is a real problem for our democracy,” he said. “I’m not going to dispute that.” In the face of politically motivated redistricting, citizens have sought solutions through state courts, ballot initiatives and Congress. For instance, H.R. 1, which the House approved this month, contains a provision requiring states to create independent redistricting commissions. Justice Neil Gorsuch on Tuesday pointed to some of this activity to suggest that the Supreme Court need not intervene in this area. Piggybacking on that theme, Justice Stephen Breyer echoed the age-old worry that judges aren’t equipped to handle dicey political disputes. “There is a great concern that unless you have a very clear standard,” he said, “you will turn many, many elections in the United States over to the judges.” But as Justice Elena Kagan wrote last year when the Supreme Court punted on the question of partisan gerrymandering, “the need for judicial review is at its most urgent in these cases,” because “politicians’ incentives conflict with voters’ interests, leaving citizens without any political remedy for their constitutional harms.” Could Justice Kagan persuade a majority of her colleagues to finally put an end to extreme gerrymandering? That will become clear before the end of June. If she does, it will be a welcome and long-overdue outcome. The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

2019,‘Ferrante Fever’ Review: A Bland Tribute to the Enigmatic Writer,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. The documentary “Ferrante Fever” is, as its title suggests, less about Elena Ferrante — the enigmatic, pseudonymous Italian writer whose Neapolitan novels have enthralled readers around the world — and more about the author as a literary phenomenon. It’s an anodyne fan flick that casts only furtive glances in Ferrante’s direction, as if the filmmaker, Giacomo Durzi, were a reverential subject who doesn’t dare to make eye contact with the queen. His approach is worshipful, decorous and therefore strikingly incongruous with the layered, ambivalent genius that his film pays tribute to — a novelist who has made a point to excavate the darker recesses of a woman’s experience. Ever mindful of what Ferrante has called her deliberate “absence,” Durzi has opted to have writers, editors and other cultural figures explain what it is they find so beguiling about her books. Their comments are generally smart and incisive, what you would want from an expert panel — though at least on a panel people have the chance to respond to one another, and even to disagree. Here, they’re presented as a series of talking heads; any possible nodes of friction, or dramatic tension, aren’t really explicated, much less explored. What Durzi does include are numerous shots of the Manhattan skyline interspersed with gauzy scenes of a woman’s figure in a gray coat and a cloche hat, her face obscured, walking around New York City as a voice-over narrates excerpts from Ferrante’s letters and interviews. It quickly becomes clear that the time it takes to sit through this padded mash note would be better spent immersed in Ferrante’s mesmerizing work instead.

2019,‘Five Feet Apart’ Review: Ailing Teenagers Live Dangerously for Love,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. In “Five Feet Apart,” Stella (Haley Lu Richardson) is a teenager with cystic fibrosis. Will (Cole Sprouse), a newcomer to the hospital where she resides, also has the disease and is undergoing a drug trial for an antibiotic-resistant infection. They don’t mesh, at first. She is obsessive-compulsive and effusive; she dutifully takes her meds and keeps a YouTube diary about her life. He is a brooding artist and rule-breaker convinced that they are breathing borrowed air. Because of the risk of cross-infection, they must stay six feet apart. Five feet, as measured by the pool cue they carry between them, will be their eventual concession to love and living dangerously. Promoted by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation as an awareness tool, “Five Feet Apart” is better made than a synopsis suggests. To maintain the illusion of intimacy, the director, Justin Baldoni, plays tricks with focal lengths, often framing Richardson and Sprouse so that they appear close together before cutting to a wide shot that shows them far apart. Richardson, previously wonderful with good material (“Columbus,” “Support the Girls”), here cements her genius status by finding depths beyond the contrived screenplay. The cast’s schlock redemption efforts only go so far in a story that stacks the deck with a tragedy in Stella’s family and a series of increasingly implausible rendezvous between Stella and Will. You can set your watch to what happens to Stella’s best friend (Moises Arias), also a patient, and the last act is a supernova of shamelessness. But even then, this weepie is tough to resist entirely. When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.",The New York Times
2019,‘Florida Is Tired of Being a Cheap Date’: Andrew Gillum Wants to Help Democrats Win in 2020,"In an interview, the former mayor and rising Democratic star confirms he’s not running for president, and outlines his plans to mobilize Florida voters for the election. Andrew Gillum, the Democratic nominee for Florida governor in 2018, said he will not run for president in 2020.CreditCreditCharlotte Kesl for The New York Times Andrew Gillum has more free time than he would like. After losing his bid for Florida’s governorship by less than one half of a percentage point, Mr. Gillum, the former Tallahassee mayor, is now carefully planning his next steps amid speculation that he would run for president. On Wednesday, he announced he will not join the Democratic field seeking to oppose President Trump, but instead return to political organizing. He said he aims to build a voter mobilization network in Florida that will help whoever becomes the Democratic Party’s nominee to capture the state’s all-important 29 electoral votes. Mr. Gillum spoke with The New York Times about why he’s confident Democrats can wrest Florida from Mr. Trump in 2020, what he hopes to see from the primary field, and how he grades the performance of the Republican who beat him last year, Gov. Ron DeSantis. The interview has been edited and condensed. I heard your father recently passed and wanted to offer my condolences. That means a lot, I really appreciate it. How serious were you thinking about running for president? Did you give it real thought? Everybody has to consider what role they play in Trump’s America right now to bring this to an end. But for me, it was a pretty quick consideration. I had to put into focus that I’d spent the better part of two years running around the state of Florida and away from my three children and my wife. [Sign up for our politics newsletter and join the conversation around the 2020 race.] If Beto O’Rourke can get into the presidential race, why not Stacey Abrams or Andrew Gillum? Is that a sign of privilege, as some have suggested? There’s no doubt that O’Rourke enjoys a set of privileges in his decision making that other candidates don’t. Can you imagine it for any of the women that are in the race for president or considering a run? They probably could not muse out loud, or in the recesses of their mind have these sorts of conversations and then say them out loud, and think it would be taken seriously or they would be taken seriously. I recognize that, but, as I understand it, the congressman also recognizes that there is privilege that accompanies him here. That doesn’t make him less deserving of consideration, it’s just something that has to be acknowledged. I think over the course of this race, we will — and America will — discover what Beto O’Rourke’s views are. And I think he’ll be measured on that. What’s the importance of this effort you’re announcing Wednesday? It’s Florida-specific, right? This is Florida-specific, but guess what — Florida-specific impacts the nation. Twenty-nine electoral voters answers a lot, and not just for the state, but for the country. My dad used to give me this advice a lot: “Son, when you know better, you do better.” And having just come from two years on the campaign trail, and having looked very critically at my own race, there’s some things I learned that I recognize that we can do better at. When Obama was on the ballot in 2008, Democrats enjoyed a registration advantage of almost 800,000. When I showed up on the ballot, that advantage had shrunk to less than 300,000. And it makes a difference, if you have more marbles on the table and more voters you can choose from and have the opportunity to produce. Given the migration patterns in our state, and given the challenges we have around producing an electorate that's favorable to Democrats to get out and vote — we've got to put more people in the game. Florida is tired of being a cheap date. You can’t just come in when it’s a presidential election and we’ve got a nominee and then do a few months of organizing. Republicans have been disciplined in our state in that way now for 24 years. And now it’s time for Democrats to do the same. Is this work only happening now because the Democratic Party and state party historically dropped the ball? When you don’t have a governor who can raise money for a party in 24 years, it’s very difficult for you to expect that party to turn on a dime and pull rabbits out of the hat. I’d say it’s a failure, writ large, of how people have treated Florida when it comes to organizing. It’s a state to go to when you want a presidential win, but outside of that? Good luck. What are you looking for the Democratic presidential candidates to prioritize? I am convinced that, through our primary process, we will produce the person who’s our strongest bet toward winning the White House. I hope whoever that is will be closer to my ideological end of the spectrum, but the truth is these primaries tend to produce candidates who are likely going to be our best bet to compete against Donald Trump. And more than anything, I think Democrats want to win. But what about a Joe Biden-esque figure, a moderate who doesn’t have the same type of progressive message you ran on? Whatever message Joe Biden may carry is closer to what I carry than Donald Trump’s. But if you're Joe Biden, you’re really going to have to search the recesses of your past and make sure that you're ready to reconcile those places that will put you outside the mainstream of where Democrats are today. And I expect that that’s probably part of the preparation to him entering the race, right? He’s got a long record, and there’s a lot for him to mull over, and a lot for him to assess where he’s evolved. And maybe where he hasn’t. Has Governor DeSantis been more pragmatic than you thought he’d be? The governor recognizes what I know, which is, 30,000-odd votes separated the two of us. We each got 4 million-plus votes, and the difference was practically a rounding error. So the governor did what I think any smart politician would do: He reduced those areas in the early phases that would divide. He tacked a little more toward a pragmatic and less ideological place, and that has produced some good will for the governor. The test is how he performs, now that he has a Republican-controlled House and Senate that may push him back to either his natural leanings, or create a contrast within his party. I know you have to go, but I keep coming back to you, Beto O’Rourke, and Stacey Abrams. It is striking that the two black candidates are currently going to work in grass-roots organizing and the white candidate is running for president? You don’t have anything else to say on that? Listen, man, we’re used to working.",The New York Times
2019,"‘For Us, by Us’: Inside the New Social Spaces for People of Color","In New York City, there’s a growing movement when it comes to places to gather. Members access the space, located in Central Brooklyn, by having their fingers scanned and giving a passcode. Upon entering, they find a lounge, complete with couches, a barber chair and books on finance. The spiral staircase leads to an area with workstations. Inside on a recent day, a man who works as a consultant helped five others get businesses certified. Another launched a campaign to run for City Council, engaging members to assist in outreach. An author presented research in a forum. The Gentlemen’s Factory brought them all together. As one of the very few spaces in New York City exclusively for men of color, The Gentlemen’s Factory began as a middle ground between work and home for men who need a venue for networking and socializing. “They’re going through a divorce, or they have mental health challenges, or they’re going on an interview but they don’t know how to ask for a salary increase,” said Jeff Lindor, the club’s founder. “There wasn’t an outlet for them to be.” Mr. Lindor, clad in a custom-made Prince James suit (the designer is a Gentlemen’s Factory member) noted that members contribute to making the space their own, whether it’s the Malcolm X art above the leather sofa or the magazines near the coffee table. Born in Petit-Goâve, Haiti, Mr. Lindor was raised in a Coney Island housing project. The son of non-English speaking immigrants, Mr. Lindor and his family were wedged between a wealthy, white community on one end of the neighborhood and an impoverished and predominantly black population on the other. He asked himself: Why does my community look like this? Why does blackness look like this? The socioeconomic disparities between white and black people inspired Mr. Lindor to study Urban Policy at the New School, where the seed of what would become The Gentlemen’s Factory started to germinate. While earning his master’s degree, he organized gatherings with other black men to discuss their experiences. Their first event was a Saturday gentlemen’s brunch in Brooklyn, with a $50 entry fee. When 40 black men showed up, Lindor realized that the group might need a dedicated physical space. The mixers that followed led to hundreds of black male New Yorkers gathering. “I had to ask myself,” Mr. Lindor said, “Is this an enterprise or a hobby?” At the time, Mr. Lindor was working as the strategic adviser to the executive staff at the Department of Correction, in the DeBlasio Administration. He resigned, spent two months developing a business model, then secured a lease with money he had saved. Mr. Lindor asked friends who made more than six figures a year if they would support him; in the end, they invested $100,000 into The Gentleman’s Factory. ""There are very few spaces where men of color can come together and engage in meaningful dialogue, said Rubain Dorancy, a member who is also an attorney and an educational consultant. “At the Gentlemen's Factory, you will find men of all ages and with varied backgrounds, engaging, supporting and uplifting each other."" Spaces made by and for people of color are not new. In 1826, young African-Americans gathered at 161 Duane Street to socialize and discuss the arts in a group known as the Philomathean Literary Society. In 1892, Victoria Earle Matthews, an author and activist, created the first black women’s club in New York City, the Women’s Loyal Union. Five years later, in 1897, she created the White Rose Mission, in uptown Manhattan, where young black girls who migrated from the South could get acclimated to city life. Yet social spaces for people of color such as The Gentlemen’s Factory — with its 100+ member strong base and a range of event programming, from finance workshops to wellness seminars — remain extremely rare in New York. In the 1950s and ’60s, there were many social clubs in different communities of color, but as the decades passed, their numbers dwindled. Some clubs closed because they were being operated illegally; others could not afford the expensive licenses required. Today, Toñita’s is often called the last Puerto Rican social club in Brooklyn. The last remaining black LGBTQIA+ club in New York City, Langston’s, needs $73,000 to stay open. The Gentlemen’s Factory charges $150 a month for membership. Prospective members must fill out an application and be interviewed and screened by a committee. If a white man wanted to join, Mr. Lindor says, “We don’t discriminate. He’ll just have to know that all of the content is still going to speak about the black and brown male experience.” In New York, the law states that any public establishment must allow full and equal access to people irrespective of race, as well as “color, religion, or national origin.” Alicia McCauley, Deputy Press Secretary of the New York City Commission on Human Rights, says, “NYC Human Rights Law protects against racial discrimination in any form, including in public accommodations such as social clubs. However, social clubs can be centered around certain experiences as long as the membership policy is not discriminatory based on race, religion, national origin, or any one of the other 22 protected categories in NYC.” Mr. Lindor’s dream is to expand into Harlem, DC, and London, and to learn how to navigate venture capital funding. “I was privileged enough to get family and friends to donate, but when I look at my counterparts, they’re getting millions. There need to be more spaces like this — but how are we going to fund it?” Najla Austin, the 27-year-old founder of the forthcoming Ethel’s Club, has no interest in venture capital funding. While working at tech start-ups, Ms. Austin kept her eyes on the women’s co-working space The Wing, which opened in 2016. She considers it to be one of the “coolest, innovative” spaces around — and wondered if there might be a possibility for black and brown people to replicate that success. For two years, she kept her ear to the ground to see if more spaces for people of color would pop up. When they didn’t, she said, “I’ll do it.” Last October, Austin created an Instagram page for Ethel’s Club — a name honoring her grandmother. The following day, 600 people had signed up for the wait list on the accompanying site. “I got tons of emails — people wanting to have an event or buy a membership. Most companies struggle with demand, and for me, it was the opposite.” While Ms. Austin will not disclose the amount of money she’s received in fund-raising, it is enough for her to be looking at 10,000-square feet locations in Brooklyn for a proposed August 2019 opening. There will be a boutique featuring products made by people of color in the front of the club, and a members-only quarter in the back. Membership is application-based; interested parties must support the brand mission of empowering and advancing people of color. With regards to fees, Ms. Austin said, “There is tiered access with the hope of allowing everyone the ability to use the space as needed with a financial commitment they’re comfortable with.” A one-year membership is required, and events will range from matchmaking to wellness to tech workshops. Her credo is “for us by us.” Ms. Austin is not looking for investors whose interests might conflict with those of people of color. Ladin Awad was a student at the New School where she met and befriended Sienna Fekete. A few years later, the duo linked up with June Canedo at a brunch; they then planned conversations about identities, privilege, and the spectrum of experiences for women of color. Each woman is from a different place in the diaspora — Ladin from Sudan, June from Brazil and South Carolina, and Sienna, a Caribbean-Canadian, from Los Angeles. When they researched lexicons, “chroma” stood out for its meaning as an intensification of color. “That makes sense because that’s what we’re amplifying, women of color,” Ms. Fekete said. Although there is no strict ban on white people attending their events, like Mr. Lindor and The Gentlemen’s Factory, the trio emphasizes that people of color are going to be centered and prioritized. Chroma has organized events with names like “Working Women of Color” and “Continuity: A Conference on Self-Preservation for Women of Color.” Its members recently celebrated the grand opening of their studio in the Lower East Side, a goal financially realized through their networks. At the Chroma studio, they partner with other collectives and document the conversations, which have themes such as digital archives, social media and mental health, and alcohol and drug addiction. “We were having a candid transparent conversation of the struggles that we go through as a collective,” Ms. Fekete said. “There is a need for a physical space.” What these spaces share, in addition to catering to people of color, is the privilege of connections. While they exist outside of traditional venture capital and corporate structures, pre-existing networks of families, friends, and friends of friends were responsible for carrying the financial backing. Tim Jack, the general manager of The Gentlemen’s Factory said, “I’ve never been a fraternity kind of person. I actually shunned them because of the elitist part of it. But this space is different. [Mr. Lindor] is giving black men the opportunity to unleash in a positive way and also deal with the things that have been traumatic to us. He gives us a space to be able to talk about it and not feel rejected.”",The New York Times
2019,‘Fosse/Verdon’ Has Magic to Do. And Undo.,"A hip cocks. A shoulder jerks. The fingers fan like a Swiss Army knife that’s nothing but blades. To see a body like this — a congregation of angles kinked in opposition — is to recognize Bob Fosse’s slinky specter. Fosse died in 1987, but he still haunts Broadway, where he won a record eight Tonys for choreography, plus one for direction. He also brought home an Oscar, for “Cabaret,” and three Emmys, for “Liza with a Z.” “I don’t think it’s possible to do a musical that has dance in it and not have the influence of Fosse,” Thomas Kail said. Kail, who directed “Hamilton,” is an executive producer on “Fosse/Verdon,” a limited series that debuts on FX April 9. Though based on “Fosse,” Sam Wasson’s exhaustive 2013 biography, the series, as the name implies, twines Fosse’s story with that of Gwen Verdon, his third wife and longtime muse. Sam Rockwell plays Fosse, Michelle Williams is Verdon. Why the slash? Verdon, a knockout dancer and an unimprovable musical comedian who won four Tonys in six years, was no slouch. (Watch her in “Damn Yankees.” Her slouch is electric.) Fosse often shaped his choreography on her body, which means that she shaped it, too, and she taught it to dancers in turn, even after she and Fosse separated. Her inclusion also suggests a narrative informed by the #MeToo movement, a way to reframe the myth of the lone male auteur, of the man who behaves badly, but still, my God, those steps. If “Fosse/Verdon” succeeds, it could inform how we now tell stories about men like Fosse. Assuming we should tell these stories at all. Because if Fosse was a great man, he wasn’t necessarily a good one. He had genius, he had charm, but coercion and scapegoating colored his rehearsals, and he rarely met a chorus girl he didn’t try to bed. (Would he take no for answer? More or less. But his seductions often constituted an ugly abuse of power.) His addictions — pills, sex, all that jazz — were legion. In making “Fosse/Verdon,” the showrunner, Steven Levenson, knew what he didn’t want to create: “Another story about a brilliant man haunted by demons who behaves badly and does terrible things and the question of the series becomes, Well, was it worth it?” “No,” he said recently over breakfast in Brooklyn. “Of course it’s not worth it.” Kail had read Wasson’s book as soon as it was released and had bought a copy for the “Hamilton” choreographer Andy Blankenbuehler as an opening night gift. When Kail learned that “Fosse” had been optioned, he and Lin-Manuel Miranda approached FX and joined the project in the summer of 2016 as executive producers. That fall he met Levenson, who wrote the book for “Dear Evan Hansen,” at a “La La Land” screening. Over sushi a deal was struck. Today’s Broadway royalty would make a show about yesteryear’s. Blankenbuehler joined Susan Misner as a choreographer, while Alex Lacamoire, another “Hamilton” veteran, was brought on as music director. Eight episodes were ordered, with Kail slated to direct five of them. So yes, the lead artists are primarily white and male, but the writers room, which includes Tracey Scott Wilson, Debora Cahn and Ike Holter, is at least a little more diverse. Before preproduction kicked off, Kail and Levenson wanted the blessing of Nicole Fosse, Fosse and Verdon’s daughter. In the spring of 2017 they met her for a breakfast so long it stretched into lunch. A few months later they went up to New Hampshire, near where she lives, and met with her again, spending a weekend looking through her archives. At that point, they still thought they were making “Fosse,” but as they flicked through photos and listened to old recordings, they knew they would have to include Gwen Verdon, too. Like Lola and Joe from “Damn Yankees,” Charity and Oscar from “Sweet Charity,” Roxy and Velma from “Chicago” — all characters from shows they built together — Fosse and Verdon were two lost souls, not one. So why had Fosse’s name endured and Verdon’s hadn’t? They decided that the show would explore, as Levenson put it, “how these complicated partnerships and collaborations become about one person, almost always the man.” “Fosse/Verdon” moves forward and backward in time, but centers, roughly, on the decade between “Cabaret” and “All that Jazz.” “It’s really a story of interdependence and codependence and” — Levenson paused here — “and love.” Still, Levenson wavered. The more he learned about Fosse’s behavior the more he wondered why he wanted to tell this story. “Like, why is this an interesting story? Is this just another awful person who made great art?” he asked himself. Then in the fall of 2017, the Harvey Weinstein scandal broke and Levenson realized, “We have to tell this story because of the way he behaved instead of in spite of the way he behaved.” Williams, speaking by telephone as she rode to the studio, put it a little more dryly: “Thank you to the movement. We’re now going to find out who Gwen Verdon is.” Kail — who had spent years making “Hamilton,” another show about a man of talents and flaws — had always figured they could tell the story with nuance. (When I saw him on set one day he had accessorized with a 30-pound weighted vest. “Otherwise it would be too easy,” he said. This is a man who likes a challenge.) “We need to examine these things, we need to talk about them,” he said later, speaking by telephone. Of course, examining can look a lot like glamorizing, and if you saw the first teaser, which played during the Oscars, you’ll have spotted the legs, the breasts, the zippers plummeting down, down, down. But if the show celebrates Fosse, it’s the kind of party where the cake falls and most of the balloons pop. It would be a mistake to strip Fosse’s world of its appeal, its libidinal oomph. And another mistake to ignore how that appeal could sour. Levenson figured that Fosse’s own work suggested a possible approach. Fosse had magic to do and an almost compulsive need to then show you how the lousy trick was done. He created shows for grown-ups — decadent, mordant, cynical. The first time I came on set, to Grumman Studios on Long Island, cameras were placed to shoot “Big Spender” from “Sweet Charity.” The dancers wriggled in their stilettos and miniskirts, sequins skittering. They looked like unadulterated sex. Until you looked closer. Behind the fake eyelashes, these dance hall girls were dead inside. Fun, laughs, good times? Not exactly. This complicated sexuality had roots in Fosse’s own trauma. Dancing in burlesque houses as a teenager, he experienced transactional sex too early and too often. But his love of sparkle and his need to reveal sparkle as a sucker’s bet also stemmed from professional doubts. He worried that his talent was somehow superficial, all light and no heat. “Razzle Dazzle” from “Chicago” could have been his theme song: “Throw ‘em a fake and a finagle/ They’ll never know you’re just a bagel.” Nicole Fosse, a co-executive producer, said that she feels her father was drawn to projects that allowed him to explore himself. “He was figuring out parts of himself by the work that he chose to do,” she said. Most of his shows have the particular flavor of what Levenson called “his self-hatred mixed with self-aggrandizement.” If the series doesn’t try to overlay 2019 values on a 1970s story, it doesn’t exactly absolve Fosse either. Back then his habits were laughed aside, broadly condoned. In this series, as Rockwell wrote in an email, “nothing is glossed over. You see all of his flaws and self-destructive behavior.” As Rockwell acknowledged, that behavior wasn’t only self-destructive. “He was so destructive,” he wrote. “Destructive to everyone around him. Especially the women in his life.” Was aggression essential to his work? Did predation somehow color “Chicago” or “All That Jazz?” Fosse thought so. Kail not so much. “I refuse to buy into the idea that you need acrimony and tension to create great work,” he said. Williams wondered what kinds of work Fosse would have made if he’d left his demons at home and protected his colleagues. “When I feel safe is when I can be fully expressive and completely free,” she said. “That’s when you’ll get the best out of me. In an environment like what Fosse created, that person wouldn’t be safe.” Genius can take other forms. The episodes that focus on Verdon offer a counternarrative. She started in burlesque clubs, too. Her first marriage was abusive. She had to leave a son with her parents. Her work ethic was equally relentless. But unlike Fosse, “Gwen wanted to stay high and bright and on top of everything,” Williams said. “She just gave joy. When you watch her dance, you feel her love of it.” When I first spoke to Levenson, he mentioned how he’d worshiped Fosse as a teenager. “He was sort of like the cool musical theater person, you know?” he said. A month or so later, as the final episodes were being prepared, I asked him if he could still enjoy Fosse’s work, knowing what he now knows about the man who made it. “That’s a really good question,” he said. He told me that twice, buying time. “The thing that makes this work fascinating is that the pathology and pain is so there on the surface,” he said. “A lot of these artists, once you know the personal stuff, you realize that it was there all along in the work. So I can’t enjoy it in an uncomplicated way. Enjoy is, like, no longer quite the word.”",The New York Times

2019,"‘Game of Thrones’ Season 2, Part 2: Is a Comet Ever Just a Comet?","Game of Thrones The final season of “Game of Thrones” arrives April 14. Before then, we’re getting prepared by rewatching the first seven seasons. Sign up to get these straight to your inbox. This article contains spoilers for Seasons 1-7 of “Game of Thrones.” It’s 10 p.m. — do you know where your dragons are? If not, we’re here to help, as we wrap up Season 2 in our great rewatch. If you missed the first Season 2 installment on Monday, it’s available here. If you have any burning questions you would like answered, send them to gameofthrones@nytimes.com. House Baratheon is the biggest loser — Renly died, Stannis suffered a major defeat in the Battle of the Blackwater. House Stark won battles but lost Winterfell. Tyrion’s star was on the rise, but his own House doesn’t give him credit for saving King’s Landing. House Tyrell, however, takes a licking but keeps on ticking — Margaery started the season as Renly’s queen, and ended the season striking a deal to become Joffrey’s. All hail the queen. Just as in our world, the tension between competing forms of mysticism and skepticism is a defining feature of “Game of Thrones.” It is also a prominent theme of Season 2, beginning with the red comet that streaks through the sky in the first episode. The men in the North see it as a sign that Robb Stark will win the war. Others see it as a sign that the Lannisters will rule the Seven Kingdoms. Osha tells Bran of the latest hot takes before concluding, “Stars don’t fall for men. The red comet means one thing, boy: dragons.” It’s possible. Or a comet could be just a comet. Everyone is certain that their interpretation is correct, just as they’re certain that their god or gods are the right ones. As the pirate Salladhor Saan says: “I’ve been all over the world, my boy, and everywhere I go, people tell me about the ‘true god.’ They all think they’ve found the right one.” Maester Luwin says that magic might have once been a mighty force, but not anymore: “The dragons are gone, the giants are dead and the Children of the Forest forgotten.” But we’ve seen the dragons hatch, and we know that not everything that was thought to be extinct is really gone. Pyat Pree claims that magic has grown stronger in the world since the birth of Dany’s dragons. Bran has prophetic dreams. “My dreams are different,” he insists. “Mine are true.” Dany has prophetic dreams, too. “I’m no ordinary woman,” she insists. “My dreams come true.” Like horoscopes, the dreams are easier to read in hindsight. Bran’s vision of a sea coming to Winterfell and drowned men floating in the yard — of course that’s Theon Greyjoy’s takeover! Dany’s vision of snow (Snow?) on the Iron Throne in the House of the Undying? It could be a trick, a temptation — we won’t know if it’s actually a prediction until, presumably, we learn how this story ends. And then we have this story’s most self-aggrandizing seer: Melisandre. She tells of a prophecy regarding her god and a reincarnated hero known as the Prince (or Princess) that was Promised, who had been sent to vanquish the Great Other. “After the Long Summer, darkness will fall heavy on the world,” she says. “Stars will bleed. The cold breath of winter will freeze the seas, and the dead shall rise in the North. In the ancient books it is written that a warrior shall draw a burning sword from the fire, and that sword shall be Lightbringer.” Some of that seems to be coming true. She tells Stannis that he is the Lord’s chosen, and they base their battle strategies on this assumption. While Melisandre repeatedly demonstrates her magical abilities — She can look younger and prettier! She can birth shadow babies! She can resurrect the dead! — performing magic and reading prophecies are different powers. Besides, her actual intentions aren’t entirely clear. She insists that Stannis will be king, but the more interesting prediction comes when she tells him that he will betray everything he once held dear. Is that really prophecy, or is she priming him with the power of suggestion? Much of what Melisandre does with Stannis is psychology and seduction, not magic. Even if we take what she says at face value, her beliefs don’t line up with those of the Red Temple priests and priestesses we meet later — they believe Dany is the Chosen One. Not Jon. And certainly not Stannis. So did Melisandre truly believe Stannis was the Chosen One and flock to his side? Or did she sell him on that idea solely out of self-interest, perhaps hoping he would make the Red Temple’s faith the state religion of Westeros? (It’s hard to turn down a belief system in which you’re the messiah). But shouldn’t a fabled hero be able to draw his burning sword from the fire on his own, without a priestess essentially handing it to him? Fans love to try to decode these visions and prophecies, but we should be wary not to repeat Melisandre’s mistakes. Prophecies are like propaganda — they can be useful for propping someone up but they rarely tell the whole story, and believing in them can ensure your doom. In an interview seven years ago, George R.R. Martin addressed the traditional audience expectation that the hero “is the chosen one, and he is always protected by his destiny.” Martin said he didn’t want that to be the case in A Song of Ice and Fire. Or, as Tyrion says in the books, “Prophecy is like a half-trained mule. It looks as though it might be useful, but the moment you trust in it, it kicks you in the head.” Stannis, your prophecy awaits you. Believe at your own risk. Many characters in “Game of Thrones” live and die by the sword, but few expect to be stabbed in the heart by a magical shadow. We talked to the actor Gethin Anthony about King Renly’s abbreviated reign in Season 2. (Adapted from an interview for an earlier article.) How did you find out about your character’s death? While auditioning, I read the first and most of the second book. By the time I was called in to read for Renly, I was well aware of his grisly demise. It made the process feel more like a movie for me. I knew his beginning, middle and tragic end before stepping on set. It clarified in my mind what my approach should be. Did you read any of the fan reaction? I’ve heard some very nice things said about Renly. Whatever you can say about his naïveté in dealing with Stannis and Melisandre, he had a good heart. People have told me they miss the character, which is just lovely. I think they miss seeing Renly and Loras together as well. I feel like it could be a whole spinoff! As preparation for Season 2, I wrote a little fan fiction for myself about Renly, Loras and the marriage of Margaery. I had all these visuals in my head for the end of Season 1, beginning of Season 2: What they did between the seasons. The nights they stole away together — on the wedding night, Renly and Loras just went off to be by a lake under the trees. How did you feel about Brienne avenging Renly? Finally! She took some time. Watching Brienne kick ass with Stannis was a good thing. But Melisandre … She’s become this huge presence, this darkness in the show, and Brienne needs to sort it out. I think Melisandre represents the corruption that power brings. It’s quite hard to fight these fantastical, supernatural forces. Keep training, keep up the sword fighting, but ultimately, get a powerful ally. What do you remember from your last day on set? We were doing a quick shot in Renly’s camp on the beach at night with the wind blowing and huge lighting setups. Seeing all those hundreds of people working in these epic circumstances as I got to say goodbye really brought home what a privilege it was to be a part of this huge endeavor. Who had your favorite death and why? Viserys. I always thought the symbolism of him being burned to death with the gold he so coveted was a brilliant representation of what the books and the show were about. Gethin Anthony (Renly Baratheon) went from murder victim to murder mastermind on the now-canceled NBC historical fiction drama “Aquarius,” in which he played Charles Manson for two seasons. He next plays a god of war on “The Magicians.” Kerr Logan (Matthos Seaworth) has been very, very busy since the Battle of Blackwater. Logan played a murderous stable hand in “Alias Grace,” a manipulative fiancé on “C.B. Strike,” and a queen’s barrister in “Victoria.” Roxanne McKee (Doreah) went from duplicitous Khaleesi handmaiden to ruler of Vega Claire Riesen in the Syfy series “Dominion.” Now she is one of the leads on “Strike Back: Retribution,” playing Captain Natalie Reynolds. Nonso Anozie (Xaro Xhoan Daxos) escaped the vault in Qarth to take on the role of Domovoi Butler, the trusted servant and bodyguard of Artemis, in the upcoming film adaptation of “Artemis Fowl.” • Our recap of Season 2. • The showrunners on the Battle of the Blackwater. • “Game of Thrones” as history. • Samwell Tarly’s assessment of the climate in Westeros. Tweaking a minor character might not seem significant at a glance, but converting Jeyne Westerling, the daughter of a Lannister bannerman, to Talisa Maegyr, a battlefield nurse from Volantis, rippled far beyond just her story. It also changed the reason Robb Stark throws away his alliance with the Freys, which, as we know, leads to all sorts of trouble for him and others. In “A Clash of Kings,” a wounded Robb learns of Theon’s purported execution of his younger brothers Bran and Rickon. In his anguish, Robb receives “comfort” (i.e. sex) from the young noblewoman tending his wounds at the castle he just conquered. This is perhaps an understandable lapse in judgment, because of his youth (he’s even younger in the books), his grief and his state of mind (he’s feverish and might have been given milk of the poppy). The problem is, Jeyne’s not a prostitute or a commoner — she’s a lord’s daughter. So Robb is honor-bound to marry her. Robb faces an ethical dilemma. This is not a dating game, choosing between the possibly ugly Frey behind door No. 1 and the winsome Westerling behind door No. 2. It’s actually a choice between protecting his own honor or protecting someone else’s. Since he’s Ned Stark’s son, he tries to protect someone else, even though it could end in misery. And sure enough, book-Robb makes a tragic mistake that leads to many deaths, including his own. TV Robb isn’t facing an ethical dilemma — he’s disregarding honor entirely. He actively pursues this young woman, whom he finds beautiful and intriguing, even though he’s already committed to an arranged marriage. He chooses to spend time with her when he could be sorting out troop movements, perusing battle plans or seeking counsel from his top lieutenant (a slight that Roose Bolton doesn’t forget, and which leads to his participation in the Red Wedding). Even after Catelyn warns her son away from battlefield hookups when he’s betrothed to another, Robb continues flirting with Talisa. Because this is all presented as a love story, we’re supposed to root for the young lovers. And isn’t Talisa a great catch — smart, sassy, good with amputations? Best of all, she’s not taking sides in this ugly war. Or is she? In the books, Robb’s marriage to Jeyne was a little more suspicious — and, quite possibly, a setup. The Westerlings may not have been privy to the entirety of the Red Wedding plans, but they had some sort of an “understanding” with Tywin, which included making sure Robb did not conceive an heir with his new bride. Jeyne never got pregnant, did not attend the massacre and is still alive. Knowing the extent of the Westerling conspiracy to undermine and destroy the Starks, some book readers were understandably confused by the show’s name-and-character swap between Jeyne and Talisa and the large deviation from the book plot. It didn’t help that the character was originally listed as “Jeyne Westerling,” until George R.R. Martin suggested to the showrunners that if they were going to change Robb’s wife’s back story to make her a citizen from Volantis, they should also give her a Volantene name. (Thus: “Talisa Maegyr.”) Conspiracy theories naturally arose that Talisa must be a Lannister loyalist posing as a Volantene noblewoman, and had been sent to seduce Robb and spy on him — in other words, she was still Jeyne, but with the rest of the Westerlings excised. After all, she keeps writing all these letters! This honey pot theory was debated throughout Seasons 2 and 3, and the issue wasn’t settled until her death at the Red Wedding. It’s possible the showrunners did intend this character to be a spy at one point, but then decided that would make the story too complicated. Or maybe they just wanted a simple, tragic love story. In our last installment, we asked if you had any burning questions — and boy, did you! Two readers asked related questions, which we’ve lighted edited for clarity: “Why did Littlefinger have Lysa kill her husband? What did Littlefinger have to gain in his death other than causing lots of chaos?” — Teresa Prather Control. Instead of allowing Jon Arryn to run to King Robert with the twincest news, Petyr Baelish can manipulate the release of this valuable information, to his own benefit. Knocking Arryn off the board also creates two vacancies: Hand of the King and Lord of the Vale. Hand of the King, he can predict, will be filled by the more gullible Ned Stark (whose wife he’s long desired). Leadership of the Vale would fall to Lysa (who is already in his thrall). Blaming the Lannisters for the murder sets them against the biggest power block (Houses Arryn, Tully, Stark and Baratheon), creating a feud in which he could play both sides. Even if one of Littlefinger’s goals was lots of chaos, it’s chaos with predictable outcomes — a new king, hopefully one he can pick, and some lands and titles (and their attendant wealth) from whichever side wins. Plus the pleasure of pulling all the strings. “How exactly did Tyrion manipulate Catelyn into releasing Jaime? What was the trick that he pulled?” — Mark Robson Tyrion’s manipulation is also aided by Littlefinger. In Season 2, Episode 3, Tyrion recruits Littlefinger for his “next deception”: to offer Catelyn a prisoner exchange — Jaime Lannister for her two daughters. One snag: the Lannisters don’t have both of the Stark daughters to trade. When Littlefinger presents Catelyn the offer at Renly’s camp, he lies, implying Arya is safe and sound. He also gives Catelyn Ned’s bones as a token of good faith. She falls for the bait and releases the Kingslayer.

2019,‘Gender Star’ Stirs Linguistic Conservatives to Battle in Germany,"BERLIN — A simmering linguistic controversy has flared up in Germany, with a group of more than 70 influential figures publishing an appeal against the use of gender-neutral terms. The group issued the letter on Wednesday. On an accompanying petition, they said they were responding in part to a recent decision by the city of Hanover to officially adopt language practices including the so-called gender star — an asterisk that invites readers to choose between gendered spellings. “The so-called gender-neutral language is first based on a general error; second, produces a wealth of ridiculous linguistic structures; and third, cannot be sustained consistently,” the signatories, who include writers, lawyers, journalists, teachers, linguists and a former head of Germany’s domestic intelligence agency, assert. “This whole contortion of the language leads to something that is illegible — and hard to understand,” said Oliver Baer, the managing director of Verein Deutsche Sprache, an organization that describes itself as dedicated to promoting the use of German, claims about 34,000 members and helped to write and distribute the letter. The 74 original signatories include Hans-Georg Maassen, a former head of the domestic intelligence service who was accused of being too close to the right-wing populist party Alternative for Germany; Werner Patzelt, one of the leading experts on Germany’s populist right; and Didi Hallervorden, a well-known comedian. They may find themselves fighting a losing battle, however. The letter initially went relatively unnoticed, despite the prominence of some of its signatories. One reason may be that much of the country’s news media has long made use of workarounds like the gender star, as have many other parts of German society. “Of course everyone can bring up whatever issue they want, but this question of gender neutrality is an old hat — I remember when we discussed it in the 1980s,” said Annette Trabold, who works for the Institute for the German Language, a state-funded body that studies contemporary usage of German. Even Hanover’s decision, announced in January, merely codified something it had been doing since 2003, according to the city spokeswoman, Annika Schach. “We are not rewriting the dictionary or saying what is correct and what isn’t — this is about style,” she said in an interview. Still, she added: “It was quite controversial and led to a lot of debate. We are still working through the emails — the good and the bad — that we received.” Unlike France, where Académie Française officially adjudicates on the language, Germany doesn’t have a national linguistic arbiter, though a council for orthography — which has its offices in the Institute for the German Language — sets spelling rules in schools and official bodies. There are several nongovernmental associations that deal with the German language — and often politics are involved. Last year, the Society for the German Language, another association, voted to crown the German for “alternative facts” as the ugliest word in the language. “Its funny what people get upset at these days; of course there are conservative forces in our society and I’m sure they are not happy about how language evolves — but there’s nothing you can do about it,” Ms. Trabold said. On the occasion of International Women’s Day last year, the equal-opportunities officer for Germany’s Family Ministry stirred outrage by suggesting gender-neutral lyrics to the national anthem.",The New York Times
2019,‘Girl’ Review: A Transgender Portrait of Uncommon Depth,"Streaming Movie Review When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. The Belgian film “Girl,” on Netflix, is among the most lived-in transgender portraits to hit the screen, which doesn’t mean it arrives without controversy. The captivating Victor Polster, who is not transgender, provides the lead performance, which has prompted arguments about his casting. The movie’s provocative denouement is thorny and a little shocking. If, however, you can tune out even a little of the background noise, you’ll find an immersive, empathetic film that speaks the language of tolerance without getting preachy. Shooting mostly with hand-held cameras and relying on the intimacy of the performances, the director Lukas Dhont probes his protagonist’s mind through bold naturalistic style that brings to mind the Dardenne Brothers (and also emulates their signature tracking shots). [Read about the controversy, over a film that some have called “dangerous.”] That protagonist is Lara, a teenager in the process of making the transition from male to female. Lara, blessed with perhaps the most woke dad in film history, has a dream of becoming a ballerina. She is accepted by a prestigious dance academy as the film opens, but there are no secrets here: Students and faculty know who she is and who she’s been. “Girl” wisely disposes of “will they find out?” questions in favor of psychological depth and verisimilitude. Lara is impatient with the medical process, which leaves her headed to her destination at a pace not to her liking. She is hard on the body she so badly wishes to change, pushing herself on the dance floor and harming herself off it. But there aren’t any easy villains in “Girl,” and every time you think one might appear, you end up happily disappointed. For all of that, the best reason to watch “Girl” is Polster. He gives a boldly inward performance that can turn jagged at a moment’s notice, and he never shortchanges the complexity of emotions Lara experiences. Yes, the arguments surrounding “Girl” are worth hearing. But it would be a shame if they kept you from seeing the film for yourself.

2019,‘Gloria Bell’ Review: Love Is in the Air for a Transcendent Julianne Moore,"Critic’s Pick When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. The title character in “Gloria Bell” — played by a transcendent Julianne Moore — is a restless life force. In most other movies, she might also be a cliché. A middle-aged divorcée, she lives alone in a Los Angeles apartment that doesn’t quite feel like a home. Her adult children are off having their own lives; her son has a new baby. Gloria keeps a tidy house, works in insurance, has friends, smokes. She also sings and she dances, moving to pop confections that sound like chapter titles in a wistful romance: “A Little More Love,” “All Out of Love,” “No More Lonely Nights.” The Chilean writer-director Sebastián Lelio has told this story before in a somewhat different key. His 2013 movie “Gloria” also centers on a divorced middle-aged woman who lives by herself and doesn’t like the hairless cat who keeps stealthily invading her place. That Gloria lived (and danced) in Santiago and was played by the superb Paulina García, who, like Moore, inhabits the character so deeply that the performance can feel like a possession. Beat for beat and subtly different line for line, the two movies can seem eerily alike; Lelio has likened “Gloria Bell” to a cover version. The redo feels lighter, perhaps because it is unburdened by originality. The first movie was inexorably saturated in the Chilean history that comes with any character who’s lived through the Pinochet dictatorship. The new Gloria, by contrast, feels unselfconsciously free of her country’s history, its immensity and heaviness, which feels very American. There’s music on Gloria’s car radio, not news, and the Trump presidency might as well not exist. (The movie was shot in 2017.) It’s easy to imagine that Gloria has attended a woman’s march or two (if just for the company), but her pastimes skew classic Californian: She takes a yoga class, smokes weed and attends what looks like a laughter therapy session filled with joyous, hands-on communion. [Julianne Moore and Sebastián Lelio on making “Gloria Bell.”] The laughter scene is brief and invitingly enigmatic; Lelio doesn’t over-explain his characters, which is very non-American, even in cinema’s ostensibly independent registers. The episodic narrative tracks Gloria over a period rived by minor as well as life-altering change. Her daughter (Caren Pistorius) has a new love, and so does Gloria, who shortly after the story opens begins an affair with Arnold (a wonderful John Turturro), a sincere, plodding man with need in his eyes and a girdle cinching his waist. Recently divorced, Arnold has overhauled his life (he had gastric bypass surgery, hence the girdle), and when he and Gloria see each other across the dance floor he comes at her hard. She responds, and they soon become a couple. Lelio conveys the affair beautifully, including in the delicate, fragmented scenes of lovemaking that convey the profundity of desire and its ordinariness. Gloria learns how to shoot a paintball gun at the amusement park that Arnold owns; he meets her friends, and the talk turns to guns. Arnold is a former Marine, a detail that enriches a portrait of a man in permanent crisis, a state of personal emergency that is announced each time he answers a call from his similarly needy adult daughters and former wife. The ponderous music that blares when Arnold’s phone rings is amusing, and then it’s abruptly not, having transformed, call after call, into a dirge, a requiem, a discordant family bleat. “Gloria Bell” is filled with quicksilver tone shifts. It’s often quietly funny and then a little (or very) sad and then funny again. The humor is sometimes as obvious as the hairless cat that looks like a wizened extraterrestrial and the Velcro crackle of a girdle being hastily removed in a dark bedroom. Lelio is acutely sensitive to the absurdities of everyday life, including the comedy of humiliation, both petty and wounding. But while his characters can be cruel, he never succumbs to meanness. His generosity is animated by Moore’s limpid, precise performance. An emotionally open character, Gloria laughs easily and listens closely, often leaning into others when they talk. But she holds back, too, keeping part of herself hidden, which feels natural given all the years that she’s spent taking care of people, her family, her friends, her clients. (The cast includes Michael Cera, Brad Garrett, Jeanne Tripplehorn, Rita Wilson and Holland Taylor.) As a performer, Moore can go big, and a terrible yowl here pierces the heart. But she’s a virtuoso of restraint. She shows you the rush of emotions just before they break the surface, so the hurt and confusion flicker on her face like minute shifts of light. “Gloria Bell” is at once obvious and filled with ambiguities, like the raging neighbor upstairs having a nervous breakdown, a man whose violent, mysterious thundering periodically shakes her apartment and equilibrium. Lelio lets some of his scenes play out from beginning to rounded end, but he also likes to cut away before the joint is completely smoked, the conversation finished, so you can fill in the ellipses. He’s playing with the idiom of the women’s picture, but he self-consciously approaches the genre with expressionistic flourishes — ripples and blasts of color, luminous and diffuse lighting — that show his debt both to Rainer Werner Fassbinder and to old Hollywood. He tips his hand openly with the casting of Barbara Sukowa, the star of Fassbinder’s “Lola,” who briefly appears as a co-worker of Gloria’s who’s struggling in the job. She’s worried about the future and, during a short break at the insurance company, the women speak anxiously about retirement money. The scene is almost over before it begins but it offers a glimpse of a world of cruelty and confusion that also pulses under the surface here, suggesting why Gloria likes to lose herself on the dance floor. Gloria dances because it makes her happy, but also maybe because like many — as the song says — she’s on the run.

2019,‘God Is Testing Us’: Tears and Outrage at a New Zealand Hospital,"CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand — The families drifted from the mosques to the hospital, their emotions battered, their eyes bloodshot. More than a day had passed since the attacks on Friday that killed 50 people at two mosques in Christchurch, and many still did not know the fate of loved ones they believed were at prayer when the gunman arrived and started firing. Akhtar Khokhar, who arrived two months ago from India to visit her son, had come to the hospital for answers. “This is my husband,” she said, holding up a photo before an imam who was at Christchurch Hospital to try to help family members. He shook his head with uncertainty. Others faced similar frustrations, with no firm answers about who had died. “This is the best they can do?” asked Zuhair Darwish, as his brother’s wife in Jordan kept calling, desperate, wanting to know whether to plan a funeral. Hours before, the gunman who had inflicted all this pain was charged with one count of murder, with dozens more expected. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, who flew to Christchurch to visit with families, vowed that “our gun laws will change — now is the time.” Minutes before the shooting began on Friday, Ms. Ardern was emailed a copy of the racist manifesto purported to be from the gunman. [Read live updates here from New York Times journalists in Christchurch.] On Saturday evening, Mr. Darwish, like many others, still could not believe where the horror had landed him: in a hospital cafeteria, renamed a “relatives room,” that was crowded with grief and hot with anger. Dozens of family members — teenagers in T-shirts, grandmothers in head scarves, bearded men in jeans — were there, squeezed together and pressing for information from overwhelmed officials. “It’s illegal to hide the names from us!” Mr. Darwish shouted at a police official, who was fielding questions while standing on a chair at the back of the room, where few could hear him. “You have to provide them!” This was not where they belonged, many of the survivors said. Bloodshed, terrorism and fear were what some of them had left behind, fleeing countries like Pakistan, Afghanistan and Somalia. Others were born here, used to relative quiet and peace. But in the land of emerald green rugby pitches, hatred found them all anyway. [Go here to read how the attack unfolded on Friday.] They responded with the full range of human emotion. Walking between the mosques and the hospital revealed countless examples of tears and outrage. There was debilitating sadness. There was confusion, but also the kind of love you see in hugs that hold tight and bring tears without concern for who is looking. “This is a test,” said Zia Aiyaz, 32, an engineer originally from Afghanistan who flew to Christchurch from Hamilton, New Zealand, to help the families of those who were killed or wounded. “God is testing us — testing the families and us, and we’re here to help.” Islam first arrived in Christchurch in 1854, with a family from India, local history says. Its roots strengthened in the 1970s with the arrival of Afghan immigrants, and again in the ’90s with new arrivals from other countries. The Muslim community is neither highly visible nor invisible here in Christchurch, a pleasant city of 350,000 near the South Island’s Pacific Coast. Mostly Sunni, they are part of a small but growing group of around 46,000 Muslims overall in a country of 4.6 million. In Christchurch, their ranks include students at local universities, taxi drivers, professionals, nurses — and imams like Lateef Alabi. A leader at the Linwood Mosque, he is originally from Nigeria but is also close to finishing a Ph.D in Malaysia. He has been in New Zealand for three years. On Saturday, he moved briskly between all the areas where families had gathered, having changed into a clean, gray dishdasha robe. His garment from the day before had been stained with blood. He often found that he had little to offer those in need. When Ms. Khokhar found him, and told him her husband had been at Al Noor Mosque, he shook his head and just said, “Oh no.” That was where 41 people had been killed. Many of those who attended prayers on Friday were regulars, for whom Islamic practice was woven into engaged lives in the city. Yasir Amin Nasr, 35, who moved from Lahore, Pakistan, five years ago, now works for the Christchurch City Council. He and his father, Muhammad Amin Nasr, had parked their car up the road from Al Noor Mosque on Friday and were walking toward the building when they first heard gunfire. After another burst of gunshots, he pleaded with his father to run away, and quickly. But it was too late. “Two, three seconds, he was just in front of us, pointing the gun at us,” Mr. Nasr said, trying to show a distance of some eight yards separating them from the gunman. “I saw him. He looked at us,” Mr. Nasr said. “He was driving. He stopped the car when he spotted us and he got his gun.” Mr. Nasr said the gunman aimed the weapon across the driver’s side of the car, through the passenger window toward him and his father and began firing. His father was hit twice. On Saturday night, he was in critical condition in Christchurch Hospital. His father, a regular traveler to New Zealand, had arrived three weeks ago for this latest visit and had planned to stay for longer than usual. “He likes it here,” Mr. Nasr said. “He said he would stay for at least one year because of peace, because here he has nothing to worry about, he can just relax.” More might have died at the Linwood Mosque but for the selfless actions of Abdul Aziz, 48, who was praying there with his four sons when he heard gunshots. Rather than fleeing, he ran toward the sound and grabbed the first thing he could find — a credit card machine — and tossed it at the attacker. He then tried to draw the gunman’s attention to himself, and away from other worshipers, by weaving through cars in the parking lot. Mr. Alabi told The Associated Press he believed the death toll would have been far higher without Mr. Aziz’s actions. Mr. Aziz, originally from Afghanistan, said he saw the attacker drop one of his guns and managed to grab it. But when he pulled the trigger, the gun was empty. When the gunman went to his car, presumably to grab more ammunition, Mr. Aziz said he threw the gun at the assailant’s windshield, shattering the glass. The assailant sped away. Perhaps because of where the shooting took place — a country where there are fewer than a dozen murders in some years — many of the survivors found themselves reaching back in time, using words like peace and quiet, calm and safety. Mr. Darwish, 40, said that was how he persuaded his brother, Kamel, to move to New Zealand from Jordan: “I told him it’s the safest country in the world and the best place to raise kids.” “He was here for six months,” he added. “He was going to bring his wife in a month.” Instead, Kamel was missing and presumed dead. Inside the hospital’s relatives room, Mr. Darwish could not contain his frustration. Several relatives had to walk him outside to help him calm down when a local imam he didn’t know stood up and tried to explain that they were trying to wait until all the names had been confirmed and all the bodies identified before sharing information with the group. “We want connectivity,” said the imam, Mustafa Farouk. “So everyone gets closure at the same time.” Others in the crowd demanded an alternative, something quicker “so we can rest!” shouted one man in a far corner. Mr. Farouk explained that some of the victims were unrecognizable because of their wounds. Another imam reminded them that “it’s not a car accident, it’s an international crime scene,” and that officials had to be careful not to get anything wrong. Still, the crowd pleaded: Let people share photos. Let imams who know some of the dead identify them. For a time, the pain brought division. Then the discord was broken when a man shouted “Allahu akbar!” — God is great — and called for patience. A few minutes later, officials announced that they would not wait for all the bodies to be identified. They acceded to the community’s demands and let people send photos to the police and choose imams to identify those they could. The survivors knew this victory would only bring more pain. But at least they were moving toward a resolution, together and alone. OpinionOmer Aziz",The New York Times
2019,"‘Gone by Tonight’: Trump, Maps in Hand, Predicts the Collapse of ISIS","WASHINGTON — President Trump said on Wednesday that the last territory in Syria held by the Islamic State would be “gone by tonight,” despite reports of continuing fighting between the extremist group and American-backed local forces in Syria. It was the second time over the last month that Mr. Trump was ready to declare the liberation of the extremists’ self-declared caliphate — an area once roughly the size of Britain — across Iraq and Syria. In February, at a military base in Alaska, he said the Islamic State’s territory in Syria had been “100 percent” reclaimed; the group no longer controls land in neighboring Iraq. In Syria, officials with the American-backed Syrian Democratic Forces near the last pocket of extremist-controlled territory said on Wednesday that a group of Islamic State fighters still controlled a sliver of land along the eastern bank of the Euphrates River, where they were holed up with women and children. As long as that area was still under the Islamic State’s control, “it would be weird to expect an announcement in the next day,” said a Syrian Democratic Forces official, who was not authorized to respond to Mr. Trump’s comments and spoke on the condition of anonymity. Mr. Trump, speaking to reporters before leaving the White House for a trip to Ohio, sought to prove that his earlier assertion had been correct — or close to it. He brandished two maps showing before-and-after snapshots of Islamic State territory that he said proved that his administration had done more to eradicate the extremists than President Barack Obama had. “This is ISIS on Election Day,” Mr. Trump said to reporters, pointing to one map, marked with red splotches that he said represented territory held by the extremists. “When I took it over, it was a mess.” Then he pointed to what he said was a Trump administration map, which he said was updated only 20 minutes earlier, with a red mark that indicated one small Islamic State-held village on the verge of collapse: “There’s actually a tiny spot which will be gone by tonight.” For weeks, the Islamic State’s remaining territory consisted of the village of Baghuz, where fighting raged on and off and tens of thousands of fighters, women and children surrendered and were taken to prisons and crowded refugee camps. The Syrian Democratic Forces recently pushed the last remaining fighters out of the village, leaving them only the sliver of territory by the river. It remains unclear how many people, both fighters and civilians, are there. The Trump administration has been eager to announce the eradication of the militant group, even as concerns over its influence grow in other regions of the world. [Read more on the president’s earlier declaration that ISIS is defeated and the differing views on his statement.] Earlier this week, Abu Hassan al-Muhajir, the Islamic State’s spokesman, belittled the White House’s claim of victory over the terrorist organization. In a 44-minute taped speech after the deadly mosque shootings in New Zealand, Mr. al-Muhajir said the Trump administration had created a “state of confusion and contradiction that make it impossible for any observer to know what is meant by the word ‘victory.’” Mr. Trump also reaffirmed on Wednesday that 400 American troops would remain in Syria, in part to ensure that the Islamic State does not resurge. He also said some American forces would be based in an area of Syria that was “closer to Israel for a period of time” but did not elaborate. His comments came as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was meeting in Jerusalem with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel.

2019,‘Hands in the Air!’,"daily crossword column Brian Thomas holds us up. THURSDAY PUZZLE — I have said this before, but it is worth repeating: The theme in a crossword puzzle is not always where you might expect to find it. There have been crosswords where the theme has been scattered all over the grid and denoted by asterisks. There have been themes denoted by circled or grayed squares. There have been themes that run from the top to the bottom of the grid. There have been themes that exist outside the grid itself. Occasionally, the theme might bend and twist to the constructor’s will and solvers need to go in search of it when it ends unexpectedly. Figuring out why it’s doing that is just another step in conquering the puzzle. Follow Brian Thomas; he’ll show you where to find the theme, eventually. Just keep your hands where he can see them. 1A: The OWLET is, indeed, a “Forest hatchling,” but it is a well-known fact that they have a tendency to dry out. An owlet should be bathed regularly, because you never know when you will need a moist owlet. 19A: Very clever. Notice that Champagne in “It’s hardly a Champagne cooler” is capitalized, which makes it the location in France, rather than the bubbly beverage. And, with the French word in the clue, we need a French word as the answer. The three-letter entry is ETE, which is the French word for “summer.” A summer’s day is hardly a cooler. 42A: It is honestly beyond me why the entry RUN-ONS has not appeared in The New York Times Crossword since 1977, because it is a perfectly cromulent word that I encounter on the regular as an editor, and often occurs in students’ and even professional writers’ work, which is a shame because they really should know better. 45A: I, personally, don’t use my thumbs to TEXT (I use my middle finger, which is not as hostile as it sounds), but many people do. Hence the pun on clumsiness in the clue “Be all thumbs?” 2D: It might come as a surprise that the phrase WHAT A TOOL has already appeared in the Gray Lady, but it has. Only once, and a little more than six years ago. 44D: In this puzzle, “Bolting down” does not involve securing something to a surface. It refers to throwing food down your throat, and the answer is EATING. Mr. Thomas’s theme appears five times in his grid, if you count that it repeats in the fabulous center entry. You will probably be scratching your head before you get to the revealer at 59A, but as always, that should help clear things up. I tumbled to the theme when I tried to write in ROCK ’EM SOCK ’EM ROBOT, but ran out of squares. It was hard to get past that, because I had the toy as a child and I knew the answer was right. I deleted the entry, turned on the Autocheck function in our game and the minute I got to the first M, it marked me wrong. Huh. So I did what any other solver would do. I filled in ROCK E SOCK E ROBOT, and figured that Mr. Thomas had lost his mind. It turns out that the revealer, which calls on us to STICK ’EM UP, means just that. In each of the theme entries, as soon as you get to an E, the M will be right above it, sticking EM up. Very clever, Mr. Thomas. Maybe I’m the one who has lost my mind. It’s funny looking back at older puzzles and seeing what you’d do different. I distinctly remember deciding what to do with the big northwest and southeast corners and thinking “This is gonna be a Thursday, go for the snazzy long downs!” Nowadays, I think I’d add another block at the T of TADA and use less gluey short entries. I was especially excited to find ROCK ’EM SOCK ’EM ROBOT for a center 15 with its two EMs, and to debut CHIN MUSIC (although I know it as a baseball term). Hope all enjoy!

2019,"‘Hello, Kevin Knox.’ A Knicks Rookie Breaks Out.","In a rookie season that has resembled a seismograph, Knicks forward Kevin Knox needed a performance like Sunday’s against the Los Angeles Lakers.

The way he was attacking, the force he was playing with.” Knox shot 8 of 14 from the field and 3 of 5 from 3-point range in the Knicks’ 124-123 victory over the Lakers, their 14th win in a dismal season. “I’d been struggling a little bit, but the whole team and coaching staff had confidence in me,” Knox said. “I came to work every single day, got up extra shots. I knew I was going to come out of the streak, so I just wanted to make sure I kept shooting.” Last year the Knicks selected Knox, a freshman from Kentucky, in the first round of the draft, ninth over all. After an ankle sprain sidelined him at the start of the season, Knox’s play took off in December, when he averaged 17.1 points and was named the Eastern Conference rookie of the month. Knox, 19, hit the rookie wall beginning in mid-January, with a 20-game stretch in which he shot 31.8 percent from the field and 27.7 from beyond the 3-point arc. The slump started soon after he scored 31 points, his highest total in the N.B.A., during a game against the Philadelphia 76ers. Shortly before that, Knox had said that he was still learning how to adjust to the demands of the long N.B.A. schedule and its 48-minute games, compared with a 40 minutes in college and A.A.U. ball. “It’s totally different,” he said in late December. “Eight minutes doesn’t seem like a lot, but it really is. That’s a whole quarter almost. Eight minutes is a long time in basketball.” To improve his fitness, Knox did extra sprints after practice and spent more time on the treadmill, running spurts of 15 minutes with the last two as fast as he could. At various points in the season, Fizdale has brought in former Knicks greats like Bernard King, Patrick Ewing, Bill Bradley and Walt Frazier to speak to his young, struggling team. (The coach, who was a Miami Heat assistant coach when James played for them, also made a point of introducing Knox to the Lakers star after Sunday’s game.) King, who was with the Knicks for five seasons in the mid-1980s, and was known for his seemingly unstoppable baseline turnaround jump shot, has focused especially on mentoring Knox. In between their meetings early in the season, Knox studied online video highlights from King’s career. “He helps my game, every time I talk to him,” Knox said. “He’s kind of like me, a wing that gets to the basket, loves transition. He kind of reminds me of myself.” Perhaps the other way around, rook. Knox said he had sought out his own tutors as well, connecting with Chris Bosh, Grant Hill, Jalen Rose, Carmelo Anthony and former Kentucky players for bits of advice during the trying moments. After Monday night’s 128-92 loss in Toronto, the Knicks had 11 games left in the season, all of them meaningless, except for their effect on the draft. The three teams with the lowest win totals will each have a 14 percent of landing the No. 1 selection in June, which presumably will be the Duke freshman Zion Williamson. The Knicks, who have the worst record in the league (14-57), are expected to lose their way into one of those slots, even after that uplifting win against the Lakers, which ended when the Knicks’ Mario Hezonja blocked a shot by James in the waning seconds. “We had a lot of ups and downs this season,” Knox said afterward. “It was big-time win, the first sweep of the season. It’s just a great way to win in the Garden, in the last 10 seconds, against one of the best players to ever play the game and we get a defensive stop with the crowd standing up yelling.” At a critical stretch in the fourth quarter, the Knicks had its three rookies on the court — Knox, center Mitchell Robinson, guard Allonzo Trier — plus guard Kadeem Allen, who was just called up from the Westchester developmental team, and forward Lance Thomas, the longest-tenured Knick. “There’s a process that needs to happen, and ours is growth, making sure the young guys are getting the experience they need in order to be good in this league,” Thomas said. “A lot of young guys don’t get to play especially extended minutes in their first year. It’s a learning experience for young guys. Our goal is to fast-track them.” Knox is sixth in the league among rookies in minutes played per game, at 28, despite shooting a subpar 36.4 percent from the field and struggling with weakside defense. He is averaging 12.3 points with 4.3 rebounds. Even so, Fizdale has never considered sending Knox to Westchester to work on his game in the anonymity of the G League “because our team was already like a glorified G League team,” Fizdale told reporters last week. Because his rookies played substantial minutes all season, he said, he thought it was better for them to take their knocks against the best. Such as James on Sunday and Toronto’s Kawhi Leonard on Monday. “Welcome to the league, kid,” Fizdale said. “This is what it’s about. This is why I wanted him in this. Take those lumps now. Later on in his career, no one will remember this stuff when he is the guy beating up on kids. This is all good for him.”",The New York Times
2019,‘Hotel Mumbai’ Review: Terrorism as Popcorn Movie?,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. Like “United 93,” “Hotel Mumbai” begins from the uncomfortable premise of turning an actual terrorist incident into material for a dramatized suspense feature. In November 2008, 10 men unleashed gunfire and grenade assaults across Mumbai, killing more than 160 people. The film, inspired by a documentary, “Surviving Mumbai,” relays these events from the vantage points of a sprawling international ensemble. The characters, many of them composites, are the guests and staff members of the Taj Mahal Palace & Tower Hotel, one of two luxury hotels the terrorists targeted, and where more than 30 died during the siege. An affluent couple (Nazanin Boniadi and Armie Hammer) leave their newborn upstairs with the nanny (Tilda Cobham-Hervey) to enjoy their dinner date in the hotel restaurant. A high-rolling Russian (Jason Isaacs) plans to spend the evening cavorting with local escorts. The heroic hotel employees include the head chef (Anupam Kher) and a Sikh waiter (Dev Patel) who shows up to work that day without proper footwear but begs to stay, needing the shift. Anthony Maras, making his first feature, interweaves these threads with precision and clarity, conveying an impressive sense of the hotel layout, the confusion of the circumstances and the visceral fear of hiding from the gunmen. (The opulent hotel was re-created in both Mumbai and Adelaide, Australia.) But the more involving “Hotel Mumbai” plays in the moment, the queasier it seems in retrospect. It reduces the randomness of real-life bloodshed to the slick thrills of a popcorn movie. And after the mosque attacks in Christchurch, which led the film’s distributor in New Zealand to suspend the movie’s release there, its savagery is especially difficult to take.

2019,"‘I Can’t Be Myself Here’: At the Border, Transgender Women Navigate 2 Worlds","For many transgender women, crossing between the United States and Mexico can also mean moving uncomfortably between genders. “I always have to be two people at once,” Jess Enriquez Taylor said. “And I always want to be ready to be myself.”CreditCreditEmily Kask for The New York Times MEXICALI, Mexico — In the pictures, Jess Enriquez Taylor wears artful makeup and her hair is carefully styled. But her face was bare as she rode the bus toward the international border one recent afternoon, and her long black hair was tucked under a hat. One of her hands was painted with glittering nail polish, but she kept it folded and out of sight. She used the hand with no polish to point to the images on her cellphone. “This is me, this is who I really am. When I get out of here, I transform,” she said of the photos, taken on the other side of the border, in the United States. Crossing between Mexico and the United States is an everyday practice for people living in the border towns of the Southwest. But for transgender women like Ms. Taylor, who is Mexican but grew up in the United States, crossing between countries also requires her to move uncomfortably between genders. [Read the latest edition of Crossing the Border, a limited-run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet. Sign up here to receive the next issue in your inbox.] Ms. Taylor, 39, cannot afford an apartment in California, but her family and neighbors in Mexicali demand that she live essentially as a man. She has not told her family she is preparing to undergo hormone replacement therapy, and going home to her brother’s house means wiping her face clean of cosmetics, changing her hair and, when outsiders are present, avoiding the feminine adjectives that women use in Spanish. Her family in Mexico makes her use separate dishes for fear she carries sexually transmitted diseases, a common and bigoted misconception about lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. Rather than go back to Mexico regularly, she chooses to be homeless in America, sleeping on friends’ couches or sometimes in someone’s garage. “It’s easier to not know where I’m going to end up than to come to Mexicali. I can’t be myself here,” she said as the bus made its way toward the international border crossing at Calexico, Calif. If she wants to be safe in Mexico, she said, “this is how I have to be.” Intolerance toward homosexuality and nontraditional gender identities are woven into the culture in parts of Mexico, where the Catholic Church, a powerful force, describes such orientations as sinful. Mexicali, a large city of one million, is not ultraconservative: The city has several gay and lesbian nightclubs, for instance. But even as cities across Mexico become more tolerant — with big gay and lesbian communities emerging in Mexico City and Oaxaca — transgender women are still treated with derision. Physical attacks are not uncommon, and they often go unpunished. In California’s agrarian Imperial Valley, transgender women, many of whose extended families are just across the border in Mexicali, say they feel greater safety from physical violence and harassment because of American laws and cultural norms. Yet the question of simply moving to the United States is not a simple one, even for those, like Ms. Taylor, who have green cards. Life can be prohibitively more expensive compared with the cost of living in Mexico. And the Imperial Valley, one of the most fertile farm regions in the United States, can be rather quiet because it is so rural. “It’s kind of like a double-edged sword,” Ms. Taylor said. “Mexico is really old-fashioned and there’s a lot of machismo. In Mexicali you get discrimination, but yet you can party. In Imperial Valley you don’t get discrimination, but you have few places to go.” And so they navigate two worlds. In the valley today, there is a growing network of services for gay, lesbian and transgender people, drawing Mexicans and Americans alike. Rosa Diaz, 58, founded the Imperial Valley L.G.B.T. Resource Center four years ago, shortly after she came out as a lesbian and was shunned by her church community. The center, the first and only one of its kind in the region, has become a gathering spot for members of the L.G.B.T. community from both sides of the border. It is a place that offers support and community, as well as practical help with such services as therapy, legal advice, H.I.V. counseling and consultations with endocrinologists, who administer hormone therapy for people who are transitioning gender. It also provides a Spanish-language support group. Ms. Diaz remembers one transgender woman from Mexico bringing her mother in so Ms. Diaz could help explain what “transgender” meant. The center has been a lifeline for people like Sonia Coronado, 65, who for years led a largely traditional life on both sides of the border before joining the small transgender community. Born and raised in Mexico, Ms. Coronado went to work at a slaughterhouse in 1972 in the California town of Brawley, while continuing to live in Mexicali. After more than a decade, she and her wife relocated to a small farm community in the United States. They raised six children together. “I tried to live like a man,” she said. “I lived with the responsibilities of a man, working and supporting my family. I did the best I could. I felt so much confusion.” Ms. Coronado came out as transgender to her children and siblings three years ago, following her wife’s death after 40 years of marriage. The only person who knew about her gender identity had been her wife, who accepted it and provided immense emotional support; when she passed, Ms. Coronado felt very alone, especially because she does not speak English, she said. Like Ms. Taylor, she must dig out men’s clothing and pretend to be “Manuel” when she goes back to visit her family in Mexico. “I still haven’t made that step to go back there dressed as a woman,” Ms. Coronado said. “I’m afraid. I’m afraid about how people are over there. “The laws in California protect you a lot more,” she said. Still, there are a few gay- and lesbian-friendly clubs in Mexicali where groups of transgender women sometimes gather for drinks and dancing. Those places do not provide a replacement for day-to-day social or professional acceptance, but they help, said Sofia Gonzalez, a life insurance agent in the Imperial Valley. A little more than two years ago, she started performing drag shows in Mexicali — where, with her family, she was still living at the time as Raul Gonzalez. “I created a persona, Sofia Kahlo, and I lived through my character, doing drag and doing shows,” said Ms. Gonzalez, 25, who now spends time on both sides of the border. “And little by little I grew stronger, like the character.” Transitioning to living openly as a woman in Mexico, she said, still means daily insults and humiliations. On stage, “You’re like a celebrity, everyone wants a picture. But as a transgender woman in everyday life, you’re seen in a completely different light. They stare at you. They talk about you.” “I still get anxiety when I have to go to a big public place or a meeting,” Ms. Gonzalez said. Of course, life in the United States comes with its own challenges. Ms. Taylor pretends not to notice them: The friend who tells her child that Ms. Taylor is “pretending” when she’s wearing makeup; the man at the recycling center who says, “Bye, man,” when she leaves. On a recent afternoon, the only time Ms. Taylor betrayed any emotion was at the pharmacy, when she was asked her full legal name. A long pause followed. “Jesus Enriquez Taylor,” she said finally. “I didn’t catch that, can you repeat that?” “Jesus Enriquez Taylor.” It’s better than in Mexico, she said, where storekeepers often refuse to serve her at all. Ms. Taylor’s mother lives in subsidized housing for the elderly in Calexico, and while she has largely embraced her new gender identity (“She still thinks of it as ‘dress-up,’” Ms Taylor said), the building’s rules prevent Ms. Taylor from living there. She often stays on a friend’s couch, but she has avoided reaching out lately after a minor disagreement over her hormone replacement therapy. Another friend she typically has stayed with was out of town. With such uncertainty about where she’s staying, she is ready to be either Jess or Jesus at any time: The large backpack she carries with her everywhere contains some clothing along with piles of cosmetics — blush, brushes, lipstick — and wigs, which she keeps safe in repurposed stockings. “I always have to be two people at once,” she said. “And I always want to be ready to be myself.” She’s looking for a job on the American side of the border so she won’t have to worry about where she’s going to sleep — and won’t have to let go of the things that make her Jess. But there is little work in the valley these days, and she earns her living mostly through occasional jobs as a freelance makeup artist and by fixing iPhone screens. For now, she calls herself “a queen on a budget.” “I’ll figure it out,” she said, her voice soothing, as if she were consoling someone else.",The New York Times
2019,‘I Do It From My Couch’: The Next Generation of Explorers,"[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] The Explorers Club is exactly what it sounds like: a members-only institution, established more than a century ago, and dedicated to scientific inquiry. Many of those admitted — there are currently 3,500 members — have touched upon uncharted territories, and all are active in the field of science research. Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay were part of the club, as was Thor Heyerdahl. Recently, Elon Musk joined. For 115 years, members have gathered annually for a weekend of science and a black-tie dinner at the New York headquarters, on the Upper East Side. The most recent event, held on March 16, featured 10 astronauts who were part of the Apollo program and an auction where attendees could bid on joining a world-renowned paleontologist on a dinosaur fossil dig. The weekend of science also introduced something new: The club let its youngest members, some still undergraduates in college, present their initiatives. There was Alex Borowicz, a Ph.D. candidate at Stony Brook University, who uses high-resolution satellite imagery and artificial intelligence to track whales. “It used to be that people had to go on a boat with binoculars to do that,” he said, during his presentation. “I do it from my couch.” Another young presenter was Stephen Daire, a graduate student at the University of Southern California. He had built robots able to explore caves so humans don’t have to. His robot even builds itself a charging station before it starts its work so it can take care of its own needs later. For generations, exploration meant going to faraway lands and bringing back significant artifacts. The club is filled with items from these journeys: tusks from a rare elephant species and flags that flew on the moon. A giant taxidermy polar bear hovers over the second floor. But it is clear that the newer members are different kinds of pioneers. Many of them are using technology, in addition to safari gear and compasses, to uncover the world’s greatest secrets. This has resulted in some growing pains at the club, as younger and older members struggle to expand the definition of exploration in 2019. “For the older folks, maybe they were the first person somewhere because the world hadn’t been explored that much, and they had that opportunity,” said Aleksandr Rikhterman, 26, a Brooklyn-based documentary filmmaker. “We can’t do that so we have to look at exploring differently. We can use new tools to take a closer look at the environments that have already been found.” The afternoon of presentations showcasing new technologies was the first step. To join the club with full voting rights, two other members must nominate you, and annual fees can cost hundreds of dollars. But there is also a way to as a join as a student member, for which the initiation fee is waived, with just one referral. That said, being a young member in the Explorers Club can sometimes be challenging to navigate. Adam Gordon, 32, who works in human rights law at N.Y.U., said he remembered when he first got his membership and immediately went to the members-only section of the website. “It was a ghost town,” he said. “There was nothing on it.” Going to events in person was intimidating for Mr. Gordon, too. “Members tend to be in their 50s, 60s and 70s,” he said. “And some are pretty renowned.” The clubhouse, with its wooden walls, leather club chairs, and plaques on the wall commemorating member firsts (like the summit of Mount Everest in 1953), has a somewhat faded 20th-century grandeur that might come across as outdated to younger members. For example, the taxidermy. “The concept of Victorian hunters is quite alien to some of the younger members,” said Joshua Powell, who is deciding whether to pursue a doctorate at the University of Oxford, of a similar institution in England. “But England tried to cleanse itself entirely of it, and its clubhouse is quite stark as a result.” The Next Generation Explorers Network, or NGEN, was created in 2017. At first it was just a Facebook group where young members could share their work, ask questions and find one another. “The group currently has 175 members,” said Brianna Rowe, one of the organizers, during the annual weekend of science. After the event, membership grew to 199, pending approval from the club. The network has also started holding events like “beer and gear” nights where members talk about their favorite equipment, sometimes with an expert, like the climber Vanessa O’Brien, and seminars on how to get funding for an expedition. But these initiatives are mostly created by young members for young members. (All members are welcome in NGEN, but according to Ms. Rowe, most of the participation is by those under 40.) The big problem is how to mix the new with the old. Francesco Bandarin, the former assistant director-general for culture of Unesco and a member for about a year, said he believes the club needs to be going in this direction. “The Explorers Club has had an emphasis on geographic exploration, the South Pole, the North Pole,” he said. “It’s a little different now. We can explore the world with many more tools than hundreds of years ago. These young people are using satellites and lasers. It’s so cool.” Peter Lenahan, 62, brings young members along on expeditions he organizes, his most recent of which was a caving trip in Laos. “I’ve been leading trips for a long time, and I try to get the young people involved,” he said. “It’s really not that hard; you just have to tell them about the trip.” George Basch, 82, seemed a bit let down that more older people didn’t attend the most recent round of NGEN presentations. “It wasn’t that well advertised, and I’m disappointed the room was so small,” he said. “This is something that should have been presented to thousands of people. There were only about 20 of us old folks in the room.” But Mr. Basch planned to spread the word about the presentations. “I’m going to talk about it to everybody I meet or see the rest of the weekend,” he said. “These kids are so bright, so enthusiastic and so resourceful. Our club is lucky to have them so we won’t die out.”",The New York Times
2019,‘I Had Finally Found the Right Place for My Son’,"Green Chimneys, a school on a farm outside of New York City, is in the vanguard of using animals to help special-needs children learn. Xander DeLeon and Catherine Cummings feeding one of the farm’s pigs.CreditCreditDesiree Rios for The New York Times Eight-year-old Xander DeLeon could not have been more surprised if he had walked up the gangplank into Noah’s ark. There were camels in pasture, a gigantic wingless emu, shrieking peacocks on the dirt paths, a pen stocked with miniature horses and donkeys. There were owls, falcons and an Andean condor with a 10-foot wingspan, as well as every conceivable breed of farm animal housed in the barns, cages and outdoor enclosures that dotted the campus of what might be his new school. For his mother, Leslie DeLeon, that first visit to Green Chimneys, a school for special-needs children located on a former dairy farm outside in Putnam County, N.Y., seemed the answer to her prayers. “He was like, ‘Oh, I can watch the chickens lay their eggs and sit on them,’” she recalled. “I was crying, because I knew that I had finally found the right place for my son.” Before coming to Green Chimneys, Xander, who has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and dyslexia, felt overwhelmed at school. He would throw tantrums and often simply walk out of class at the Manhattan charter school that he attended. By 10 a.m. most mornings, the school would call Ms. DeLeon, a public-school teacher in Washington Heights, to ask her to pick up her son. Now at Green Chimneys, Xander is getting A’s and B’s. “The school staff tell him that he won’t be able to work on the farm if he doesn’t continue to do well in school,” Ms. DeLeon said. The prospect of being separated from his beloved goats has motivated Xander in ways his traditional school never could. The Green Chimneys School for Little Folk was opened in 1948 by an animal-loving educator and philanthropist named Samuel B. Ross Jr. He pioneered the idea that emotionally challenged children could gain confidence and become socially adept by caring for animals. What started as a boarding school with 11 students is now a fully accredited day and residential facility with two campuses (the larger in Brewster, N.Y., and the smaller in Carmel, N.Y.), with 243 students, and at least as many animals. While the idea that animals could help kids learn and heal emotionally was revolutionary in Dr. Ross’s day, the benefits today are practically common knowledge. “There has been a lot of research on pets at home and how healthy it is in the past 10 years,” said Steven Klee, director of clinical and medical services at Green Chimneys. Yet psychologists have been slow to translate these insights into effective strategies for helping people in a therapeutic setting. At first, Dr. Klee himself was skeptical that animals could be a part of therapy. “When you have traditional training as a psychologist, you never think about doing anything outside of the office,” Dr. Klee said. “Therapy means talking — you wouldn’t even consider using an animal.” At Green Chimneys, however, he learned that sometimes it’s easier for kids with behavioral issues to develop relationships with animals than with people. “Humans are much harder to understand,” Dr. Klee said. “Animals in a sense are purer, more consistent, more accepting. You are kind to the animals, they show their appreciation.” For a fearful child, Dr. Klee has found that interacting with an animal can be a first step to relating successfully with others. Perhaps surprisingly, this kind of interaction works even with the least outdoorsy city kids. Most come from New York suburbs, and around 10 percent are from the city itself. “I used to stay in my room not doing anything — I’d miss school and stuff,” said Austin Stark, a Green Chimneys senior from Midtown Manhattan. “I wasn’t exactly a nature fan in the beginning.” He initially resisted the school, and was able to fall asleep only with music blaring in his headphones. “It seemed like nothing was happening here,” he recalled. “I wanted to get back to the city.” That changed when Austin developed a bond with the somewhat bowlegged horse Nelson. “I felt for his pain; I gave Nelson moral support,” he said. “If I was feeling bad, I would come to the horse barn to clear my head.” Before long he had signed up to mentor younger children in the dorm. Sean Duffy, a history teacher at the school, witnessed the transformation firsthand. “I’ve seen Austin grow from a quiet, withdrawn kid in ninth grade,” Mr. Duffy said, “to someone who is successful academically and socially. He has even become something of a leader in the class.” Animal-assisted therapy is no longer unique to Green Chimneys. Several schools in New York state, like the Orchard School, run by the nonprofit Andrus in Yonkers, and The Charlton School for girls in Burnt Hills, near Schenectady, offer some kind of therapeutic program incorporating animals. But according to Kevin Morris, the director for the Research Institute for Human-Animal Connection at the University of Denver, Green Chimneys remains in the vanguard. “There are schools with a horse program or a dog program; there are other places with farm animals,” he said. “But this is the only place that I know of that incorporates all of those programs at one site.” Dr. Morris and his team have been conducting research at Green Chimneys as part of an ongoing study into animal therapy. The researchers have installed cameras in the classrooms that record classes on a daily basis. They analyze the children’s behavior before and after they have been on the farm. While the results of their study won’t be published until their research is completed, it is already clear, Dr. Morris said, “that there is a calming and focusing effect inherent in these farm programs.” It remains to be seen, however, whether the changes that they are observing are temporary, he said, or if they can lead to a permanent shift in a child’s well-being. Public schools seem to be at their capacity in their ability to help children with special needs. One reason for this, according to Rachel Fish, an assistant professor of special education at New York University, is the nationwide shortage of teachers who are trained to work with them. Demand for programs like Green Chimneys has never been greater, she said, especially in New York City, when limits on reimbursing privately run schools for such services was lifted by the de Blasio administration in 2014. With a staff-to-student ratio of 4 to 1 on the main campus and a level of individualized care that few schools can offer, Green Chimneys has become a beacon for children who are unable to function in a traditional school environment. Every year there are about 1,000 referrals to Green Chimneys; last year, only 95 new students were admitted. It is also expensive. Tuition is $50,000 a year for day students, and considerably more for those who board. The school is partly funded by the New York State Education Department, which has licensed it to serve students from kindergarten through high school. Green Chimneys is always free for the students themselves, said the school’s executive director, Dr. Edward Placke. Their tuition is paid by their local school districts, which are sometimes reluctant to send students there. Parents who are eager to get their children into the program occasionally hire professional “parent advocates” to argue their case before the districts, or even lawyers to file suit. Once they are admitted, most students are eligible for the “Learn and Earn” program, where they are assigned chores on the farm, working with the animals or tending garden plots in exchange for a small stipend. Xander’s job is to feed the goats and clean their pens. On a recent Thursday, the soft-spoken boy visited his charges together with his social worker, Elaine McGlinchey. “This is Snowflake, my favorite” he said pointing to a cream-colored Saanen goat that had come to the gate to greet him. “Sometimes when I feed Snowflake, the sheep come by and try to eat her food,” he said. But he pointed out that Snowflake has two friends called Tom and Jerry who use their horns to drive off hungry intruders. “The goats help one another,” Xander said. “They also really help me when I’m angry, because they are so peaceful and calm. If I feel sad, Snowflake comes and sits next to me.” Like many children at Green Chimneys, Jack Elliot, a 12-year-old from Rye, N.Y., has received a diagnosis on the autism spectrum. When Jack, a loquacious boy with long brown hair, first went there, he often failed to pick up on people’s body language, standing too close to people or touching them in ways that made them uncomfortable. Then Jack met Dixie, a shaggy-maned Shetland pony. He had been at the school for weeks, and it was the first time that the staff saw the boy smile, said Valerie Parody, Jack’s riding instructor. Horses have to be approached slowly and calmly, Ms. Parody said, and you need to become sensitive to subtle cues like swooshes of the tail and the position of their ears to know whether or not you can safely get near them. “Let’s say you are really going crazy, they might bite or kick you,” Jack explained as he led a brown miniature horse across a field. Being with horses has required Jack to work on his own emotional self-regulation, Ms. Parody said. By learning the body language of horses, she says, he has also gradually learned to pick up on similar body cues in people. “He’s become more aware of people’s personal boundaries and the need to respect them. I’ve seen him grow in confidence, the feeling ‘I can do this,’” Ms. Parody said. Jack now works with bigger horses as well, grooming and riding them and mucking out their stalls. He has also become something of an expert. He spoke with relish about different types of dominance in horses, the reason they sleep standing up (to quickly escape predators) and what their favorite foods are. “Maya is pregnant now,” he said, pointing to a gray mare lounging in the pen. “When I touch her belly, I can feel the baby kicking.” Not every child flourishes at the school. Those with severe learning disabilities and behavioral problems may struggle, and the average stay (two and a half years) is not always long enough to affect permanent changes in children. Transitions from Green Chimneys back to families and local schools can also be difficult. Moreover, not everyone agrees that special-needs children should be sent to privately run schools at public expense. Some argue that the money would be better spent strengthening the special-needs programs in public schools rather than offering the best education that money can buy to a fortunate few. Still, for the children who are lucky enough to be admitted to Green Chimneys, the prognosis is good. Luis Tejada grew up in Washington Heights in the 1990s. By his own admission, he hung out with the wrong circle and became so unruly that his single mother could no longer handle him. Luis was angry and often violent, and mistrustful of adults. But he was also a secret lover of animals. He collected stray dogs and persuaded a local building superintendent to let him house them in the basement where he would go to feed them. When his mother shipped him off to Green Chimneys, as he put it, he was resentful. But Luis immediately fell in love with the horses, relishing the challenge and danger of working with big animals. He developed a special connection with one ex-racehorse called Bonz. “They rescued him just like they rescued me,” recalled Mr. Tejada, now 31 and an information technician at a nursing home in Pennsylvania. Miyako Kinoshita, an administrator at the school who was his riding instructor at the time, recalled a turning point in his development. “Luis really wanted to take Bonz to the local horse show,” she said. At first the staff was skeptical. “It’s really hard for our kids to compete in such a situation with children whose families have money to give them private lessons and own their own horses.” Ms Kinoshita said. “It is a very difficult thing to compete against other kids who don’t have the same problems he did.” They needn’t have worried.

2019,‘I Put My Work In’: Honest Applicants Await College Admissions Results,"Unlike the parents indicted by federal prosecutors last week in the college admissions scandal, these students have followed the rules. The college application process, for those staying within the rules, is one long and maddening lesson in the limits of control. Study hard, make the sports team, detail the family financial situation and then … sit and wait. That this nerve-racking powerlessness could simply be bought off is among the most galling parts of the college admission scandal that exploded across the country last week. Instead of students doing what they can and hoping for the best, the elaborate scheme outlined by federal prosecutors involved nailing down spots at elite schools by cheating on standardized tests and funneling bribes to athletic coaches. For the honest applicants, the path to college is paved with years of effort and culminates now, in these early spring weeks, with answers landing at any moment in email inboxes. Some students worry that their achievements are too few. Others fear they might be viewed as not authentic enough. Some are led by their parents, but many navigate the process with little or no guidance at all. [How the admissions scandal looked to students at a predominantly black school in Kansas City.] There are athletes who have spent years in sports like crew, trying to keep their grades up while also drawing the legitimate attention of recruiters, unlike the families caught in the scandal last week. Most students are not applying to superelite schools. Some have already entered the world of higher education by going to community college — and are now hoping to transfer to a four-year school not too far from home. Even within the rules, aspirants eye the angles, looking for activities or experiences that would increase their chances. But there is only so much an honest person can do. When she was 19, Surbhi Sharma cut short her college education to move to America. Her family left their home in northern India, following relatives to the United States and settling outside of Gary, Ind. She went to work immediately at Dunkin’ Donuts. But she knew even then that she wanted to go back to college. Now 26, Ms. Sharma is waiting to hear news of her applications to several four-year universities around Pennsylvania. For her, the college application was not a harried process dominating the afternoons and weekends of her junior and senior high school years, but something that unfolded over nearly a decade. “It took a long time,” Ms. Sharma said. “It’s a very long journey and now I’m just waiting for that moment.” When she started out, Ms. Sharma had no sense of how the American college admissions process worked and no one around to tell her. Not long after the family had moved again to the Pittsburgh area — her parents finding work at a gas station and Ms. Sharma as a teller at a bank — she went to an open house at the Community College of Allegheny County. It left her wondering how much time she would really have for her education. She left halfway through the presentation to get back to her job, and missed learning about financial aid. “It’s a very long journey and now I’m just waiting for that moment.” Surbhi Sharma Eventually, though, she applied for and won a scholarship at the school and in 2016, four years after that open house, enrolled as a full-time student at the community college. The past two years have been jam-packed: commuting from home, studying mathematics and radiation technology, winning honors and other scholarships, serving in student leadership positions — particularly those involving outreach to immigrant students — and most recently putting in clinical hours at a hospital. By the time she had begun the process of applying to four-year colleges, she was something of a veteran. “I was ready for it,” she said. Now, some eight years after first starting at a university, Ms. Sharma is nervously seeing where she will spend the next four. She wants to study radiation therapy technology at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia, and perhaps, eventually, start working toward a doctorate. “It’s a stressful feeling but patience and time, that’s what I can say,” she said. “I am just waiting.” [Your questions about the college admission scandal answered.] The email arrived at the end of Jackson Lamb’s junior year at the McCallie School, one of the South’s most prestigious boarding schools. What were his preferences, his guidance counselors wanted to know, for where he would go for college? Mr. Lamb, now a 19-year-old attending high school on a scholarship, had never given it much thought. “I think they wanted me to take it more seriously because I was like, ‘Oh, whatever happens will happen,’” he said of his parents. So began Mr. Lamb’s college application odyssey. Searching for schools on Google and looking at suggestions from his school, Mr. Lamb gradually whittled down his list. An important criterion: a place where he could easily go rock climbing. “There are definitely students I know who choose harder classes and take bigger workloads.” Jackson Lamb Mr. Lamb, who has attention deficit disorder, had been granted extended time to complete his standardized tests. Unlike the children whose parents were indicted last week, Mr. Lamb’s reasons were legitimate. In the fraud case, parents falsely claimed their children had learning disabilities, so they could take their tests under conditions that would make it easier to cheat. Mr. Lamb is surrounded by wealthier students whose parents were more involved in their applications. “There are definitely students I know who choose harder classes and take bigger workloads,” he said. With hindsight, he said, maybe he should have started thinking about colleges when he was in the ninth grade. Maybe, he said, he would have been “generally more aware that I’m eventually going to have to deal with all of this stress.” In the end, though, he suggested that his most aggressive strategy to impress admissions officers was writing an essay about his experience earning his Eagle Scout rank. His mother, back home in Central City, Ky., checked his essay for spelling. But he has grown weary of the endless paperwork that comes with college admissions. “I’m glad it’s going to be over soon,” Mr. Lamb said. [Read about how Rick Singer built a national brand appealing to parents’ worries about their children’s college prospects.] The college application season began in earnest last spring for Karen Ge when her parents proposed hiring a college consultant. As Chinese immigrants who had attended graduate school but not college in the United States, they worried that they were not prepared for the infamous intricacies of the process. There were plenty of consultant recommendations to be had from other families at the public high school Karen attended in the Chicago suburbs, or from the College Confidential website that they read regularly. Karen’s mother, Kejia Ho, who had a terminal cancer diagnosis, wanted to give her daughter every chance. But Karen, who has an SAT score of 1590, a GPA of 4.8, and in 2017 scored among the top students nationwide in a major high school math competition, said no. With some combination of calculation and authenticity, she felt she had already been shaping herself to be a competitive candidate for admission to top colleges for years. “I had to factor in all the stereotypes about Asians. Like they’re really good at math and have no social skills.” Karen Ge First, at her mother’s insistence, she had practiced for the test to apply for a magnet program that began in the fourth grade. When she got in — the following year — there was MathCounts, a middle-school math competition, to prepare for. Then the goal was qualifying for the state championship, and then the national one. The pleasure of achievement was mixed, always, with the pressure of the looming uncertainty of college admissions. When Ms. Ge realized she had come to genuinely love math, there were new considerations: One high school summer, she chose to attend an elite math program that was thought to be more prestigious for a college application, rather than one that was better tailored to her interest. And her application essay itself was a balancing act. As an Asian-American who loved math, she had been well-warned by peers and mentors to avoid appearing too much like one. The Harvard admissions lawsuit, which claims that the college discriminates against Asian-American applicants by assigning them low scores on “personality” criteria, did not help her confidence, especially since she was applying early to Harvard. Despite all her math accomplishments, she focused her essay on the experience of overcoming her social shyness. The goal was to come across as “warm” rather than “flat,” — the term often assigned to Asian applicants by admissions officers. “I had to factor in all the stereotypes about Asians,” said Ms. Ge, who is now 17. “Like they’re really good at math and have no social skills.” Rejecting the consultant was something that could let her feel, she said, a little less like she was trying to manipulate the system — or that she was a cog within it. Even in December, when she learned she had not been admitted early to Harvard, she had no regrets. “I did all I could and I didn’t cheat, even if I didn’t get the results I wanted,” she said. It was a stressful year, full of dark moments, Ms. Ge said. Her mother died in the fall. It helped that she was accepted last week at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “It was like a huge cloud lifted, because I can actually go to a college now,” she said. But her wait continues. She will find out about Harvard on March 28. Stanford, another top choice, will let her and other applicants know a few days after that. When he received an email from a crew coach at an Ivy League school soon after he began his junior year of high school, Angus Gosman was still uncertain whether he would attend college. “It was quite surprising for me,” said Mr. Gosman, 18. “I didn’t realize that recruiting was starting then. These are amazing academic institutions, not something that I ever saw myself in.” By the beginning of his senior year, Mr. Gosman was speaking with rowing coaches at nearly a dozen universities, including Princeton, Syracuse and Northeastern. “This is not a sport you can rely on — you’re always just one injury away from losing everything.” Angus Gosman Mr. Gosman did not even consider himself an athlete when he picked up an oar and stepped into a boat for the first time at the age of 13. But he loved it immediately. “There’s a level of camaraderie that is just unmatched when you’re in sync with the rowers,” he said. “I love the rhythm of it. When you’re going fast, it’s almost euphoric.” Though he knew the Marin Rowing Club had won national championships and boasted a history of sending students to top-tier schools, Mr. Gosman said he had never felt confident it would be his ticket into college. “This is not a sport you can rely on — you’re always just one injury away from losing everything,” he said. “With the recruitment process, you have to be constantly getting better and better.” Every weekday, Mr. Gosman wakes up in the morning no later than 6 a.m., attends class until practice starts at 4 p.m. and usually gets home about 9 p.m. Saturdays are set aside for races, and Sundays are his one day off. Managing college recruiters became a near constant side job for Mr. Gosman, who would send emails every few weeks with updates on his speeds for rowing two kilometers, telling recruiters about new personal records in races. His coaches in Marin helped guide him through the often bewildering process. There are strict rules from the N.C.A.A. about when a coach is allowed to speak with a high school athlete and what details they are allowed to exchange. His parents never pressured him, he said, but the appeal of being in college became clear quickly for Mr. Gosman. He flew across the country to visit Syracuse — the free trip was part of being recruited — and stayed in a dorm with rowers, watching them practice and attend class. Ultimately, Mr. Gosman was most taken by a school close to home: University of California, Berkeley. Last fall, while like most students he was still filling out applications, he reached a verbal commitment with the coach, all but assuring his admission. Still, he is anxiously awaiting the official admissions letter this month — if his grades slipped too much, he said, he could be rejected. It is impossible to know whether Mr. Gosman could have been admitted to Berkeley on his grades alone. Becoming a prized athletic recruit at a top school gives an applicant a serious edge, which is why the wealthy parents indicted last week bribed soccer, sailing and crew coaches to pretend their children were top athletes when they weren’t. Mr. Gosman has committed countless hours to become a true recruit. But will other students still look at him on campus and dismiss him as a jock who doesn’t deserve to be there? Maybe. No doubt, he said, being a top rower helped him “a lot.” “That’s not to say I don’t deserve it — I put my work in,” he said. “There’s a lot of responsibility: You’ve got to be on top of your sports and you’ve got to be on top of your school. You’ve no chance to rebound, you’ve got to be on top of all of it.” Audra D.S. Burch contributed reporting. Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated in some passages the surname of the student who rows crew. He is Angus Gosman, not Carson.",The New York Times
2019,‘I Was Biking West on 21st Street When I Came to a Barrier’,"METROPOLITAN DIARY Riding through, tension at the smoothie counter and more reader tales of New York City in this week’s Metropolitan Diary. Dear Diary: I was biking west on 21st Street when I came to a barrier between Second and Third Avenues. Whatever, I thought. I’m on a bike. As I rode past the barrier, I noticed several police vans parked along one side of the street. The only sound was the click of a shutter. Looking around, I saw a photographer kneeling down and taking pictures of something I couldn't see. I was continuing on when I had to stop suddenly. What looked like the entire 13th Precinct was standing there dressed in their finest, posing for what I figured was their annual photo. About 20 officers turned toward me. I swallowed nervously. They laughed and waved me on through. “Give it a good kick for us,” one of them yelled as I pedaled away. — Sydney Scott Dear Diary: I was stepping up to order at Planet Smoothie in Penn Station when a man who had just gotten a smoothie stomped back to the counter. “What’s in this?” he said. The cashier looked nonplused. “Which one did you order again?” he said. The man waved at the board on the wall. The cashier continued to have a nervous look on his face. “It looks like strawberries, blueberries, nonfat yogurt,” he said. “I can read,” the man said. “But it doesn’t taste like it.” The people waiting behind me began to shuffle impatiently. The cashier shrugged and shifted his feet. Two other employees moved in closer. I started contemplating whether a smoothie was worth waiting out this scene for. “I can make you another one if you like?” the cashier said. There was a pause. “Nope, that’s all right, it’s good, ” the man said. “I like it and I was just hoping for the recipe to make it at home.” — Janine Yoong Dear Diary: It was spring 1968, and my classes at Columbia University had been suspended because of student protests. I had also just quit my part-time job as the social secretary for a wealthy older man. He was not giving me enough hours for me to survive in New York. So it was with a “What do I do now?” feeling that I decided to walk from near Central Park down Fifth Avenue toward 34th Street, where I had plans to meet friends for dinner. I took my time, stopping to gaze in the store windows. One was a framing and print shop. I was startled when an older man who had apparently been watching me from inside knocked on the window. Before I knew it, he had come outside and was talking with me. He said I looked a bit down. I told him I had just quit my job. He commiserated with me. He told me he had just broken up with his girlfriend. I commiserated with him. “Let me take you to lunch,” he said. His favorite restaurant was not far away. Since I had nothing to do until dinner, I agreed. We had a wonderful lunch, and the conversation never stopped. It was as if we were two old friends. We returned to the shop and he invited me in. He sorted through some drawers and boxes, and then he handed me two beautiful small wooden frames. He insisted on wrapping them before I went on my way. I left the city that summer to get on with my life. The frames have housed two lovely paintings for 50 years. When I look at them, they evoke a crystal clear memory of my lunch with a stranger. — Carol C. Neely Dear Diary: We went to see Elton John at Madison Square Garden. Not an empty seat in the place, and he still rocks the house. The music covered us like a favorite old sweater. There was one big difference between the show at the Garden and the concerts of our youth. Instead of the smell of pot, there was a pronounced odor of Vicks in the air. — Jack Hartog Dear Diary: I couldn’t help but bristle at the woman throwing herself into the packed M train at the last minute, even though I had just done the same thing myself. She jostled me far too close to a man there in the car. He was clearly unhappy. “Come on,” he said as the woman cleared the closing doors. “Wait for the next one.” My backpack was dangling from my left hand. My book was in my right. When I was ready to turn the page, my left hand was tucked too tightly at my side to be any help. I tried sliding my right thumb beneath the page, but that didn’t work. I had just decided to wait until the next stop to turn the page when the man I had been shoved into used his empty hand to turn it for me. — Anna Gabianelli Read all recent entries and our submissions guidelines.

2019,‘I Was Thinking of Our Bench in Central Park Today’,"METROPOLITAN DIARY Where they parted ways, encountering a rat on a subway platform and more reader tales of New York City in this week’s Metropolitan Diary. Dear Diary: I was thinking of our bench in Central Park today,The one across from the dirt-patch field that seemed to catch each gust of wind. The one where we said that very sorry goodbyeThat floated in the air, Joining the other goodbyesOn that very bench In that very parkIn this very city. — Diana Sanchez Dear Diary: I was coming out of the subway elevator with my son in his stroller, when I saw a rat on the platform barely two feet away. A rat is one of the few things that can truly unnerve me. So there I stood, clinging to the stroller and weighing my options. A man standing nearby was watching in amusement. He chuckled, smoothed his black mustache, approached the rat calmly and watched it for several seconds. Then, with a small, graceful jeté of his left black boot, he sent the rat sailing off the platform, through the air and onto the tracks, where it landed safely. The man looked down, smiled and shrugged. Then he turned toward me, took a small bow, turned again and walked away. I hurried to squeeze onto the uptown express. — Melissa Gluck Dear Diary: Most Tuesdays, I pull into a spot on Riverside Drive at the corner of 116th Street just before noon. I sit there for a half-hour reading until alternate-side is finished, securing a space that lets me see my car from the vestibule of my apartment when I get upstairs. On a recent Tuesday, I wasn’t able to pull onto the block until 12:15. There were no empty spaces left when I got there. I drove laps around the neighborhood until I found a spot 10 blocks away. Later in the day, I was looking out the window and I saw an empty spot. By the time I got my sneakers on, it was gone. Taking a chance, I walked the 10 blocks to my car anyway. After doing more laps, I eventually found a spot on Riverside two blocks from my window. Crossing the street toward home, a spot ahead of me opened up. It was not only in view of my apartment but would also allow me not to move my car for an extra day. A couple in a car nearby saw me turn back. They rolled down their window. “You want that spot?” they said, pointing toward the space I had my sights on. “Yes,” I said. “Do you?” They shook their heads. “Hurry, hurry,” they said before driving away. I pulled out quickly, but when I got to the space, another car had already pulled in. Despondent, I started to pull away. The driver of the car that had pulled into the spot rolled down the window and waved. It was the same couple. “Hurry,” they said before driving away. — Georgette Culucundis Mallory Dear Diary: A lithe young man in tight jeans got on the A train. He was carrying a boom box and a bag. He pulled out a pair of sparkling red high heels, put them on and proceeded to fly around the car, twirling on the vertical poles and hanging from the horizontal ones. He pulled a woman much younger than me into a sensuous dance. As I moved to the beat, I wondered whether she had been waiting there to accompany him. After she sat down, he turned toward me and held out his hand. We danced together for a few minutes in a kind of semi-ballroom style. “Take a bow,” he whispered, bending me backward as though I were Ginger Rogers. I sat back down. What a ride. — Mary F. Blehl Dear Diary: I went to see “The Band’s Visit” at the Ethel Barrymore Theater with my cousin, Carolyn. We were ordering a cocktail before the show started when we noticed a man standing in front of a large framed portrait of Ethel Barrymore. He was posing so as to mirror her profile, and another man was taking his picture. As Carolyn and I went to our seats, I noticed the two men sitting in the row behind ours. Making my way down the row, I smiled and leaned toward them. “I saw your profile pose back there in the lobby,” I said to the man who had had his picture taken. “There’s an uncanny resemblance.” He looked up at me. “Ethel Barrymore was my great-grandmother,” he whispered. I took my seat. “That guy in the lobby having his picture taken?” I said to my cousin. “Ethel Barrymore was his great-grandmother!” She looked over her shoulder, and then leaned toward me. “And these are the best seats he could get?” she said. — Barbara Travers Read all recent entries and our submissions guidelines.

2019,"‘I, Too, Was a Survivor’: Senator McSally Ends Years of Silence","Martha McSally became the first American woman to fly in combat. But years before, she had been attacked by one of her own. Martha McSally at Laughlin Air Force Base in Del Rio, Tex., in 1993.CreditCreditAssociated Press WASHINGTON — The Air Force of three decades ago was a challenging place for women, especially those ambitious few with aspirations of becoming fighter pilots. There were lewd singalongs among the airmen. Pornography was strewn around. Sexual harassment, and worse, was rampant. So when a promising young military servicewoman named Martha McSally was raped by a male superior officer on her journey to enter that distinct boys club, it was hardly surprising that she did not report the allegation up the chain of command. [Sign up for the weekly At War newsletter to receive stories about duty, conflict and consequence.] The first woman to pilot an American warplane into combat, Ms. McSally was known for her outspoken ways. She hectored her superiors to waive the height requirement that stood in her way, sued the Bush administration for making her wear an abaya while on duty in Saudi Arabia, and wore a men’s flight cap to her promotion ceremony in defiance of regulations. But calling out colleagues for sexual assault was considered career ending for women back then, say people who served in the Air Force with her. And Ms. McSally has said that the negative response she received when she brought up, in general terms, what had happened to her traumatized her all over again. Ms. McSally did eventually raise her rape in public earlier this month. Now a Republican senator from Arizona, she revealed the attack during a subcommittee hearing on sexual assault in the military. In remarks that she would later say were agonizing to prepare, she told other assault victims that she knew of their suffering. The public announcement comes as Ms. McSally, who declined to be interviewed for this article, is fighting for her political life. Last month, Mark Kelly, an astronaut who is married to Gabrielle Giffords, the former congresswoman who survived a gunshot wound to the head, announced a bid to unseat Ms. McSally. Senator Martha Elizabeth McSally has long been a complicated and contradictory figure. She was renowned for her historic first in the cockpit of an A-10 Warthog (known as a “gun with an airplane attached”); she was also mocked for once taking off with little fuel in her jet. But never was her complexity more on display than on March 6, when she reported her rape to official Washington. “Later in my career, as the military grappled with scandals and their wholly inadequate responses, I felt the need to let some people know I, too, was a survivor,” Ms. McSally said. “I was horrified at how my attempt to share generally my experiences were handled. I almost separated from the Air Force at 18 years over my despair. “Like many victims, I felt like the system was raping me all over again,” she went on. “But I didn’t quit. I decided to stay and continue to serve and fight and lead.” And then, the woman who said she was raped by the system said that the same system should continue to handle cases such as hers. She said that she was opposed to Senate legislation to take the prosecution of sexual assault cases out of the hands of the military chain of command, endangering the bill’s prospects and confounding other sexual assault victims. At a news conference on Thursday outside Luke Air Force Base in Arizona, she told reporters that she would press defense officials to come up with reforms for dealing with sexual assaults within the ranks and would herself sit on a new Pentagon task force on the issue. Friends of Ms. McSally’s describe how she learned to mask all vulnerability in order to survive an aggressively masculine military culture in which women were barely seen as equals, let alone capable of leading. That she achieved all that she did, they say, is testament to a fierce will. When Ms. McSally arrived at the Air Force Academy in 1984 at the age of 18, sexual assault at the school was almost entirely unreported. Cases were not formally tracked. Between 1976 and 1992, the first 16 years that women attended the academy, the number of sexual assault reports at the academy was zero, according to the 2003 congressional testimony of the secretary of the Air Force at the time, James G. Roche. Enter Ms. McSally, an avid swimmer who used to get airsick as a child. As a first-year cadet, the diminutive Ms. McSally informed her flight instructor that she planned to be a fighter pilot. The flight instructor just laughed, she later told Air Force Print News. Not only were women not allowed to fly fighters at the time, but at 5 feet 3 inches tall, Ms. McSally was an inch too short to fly any plane at all. That didn’t stop her. She pressured commanders to grant a waiver. She hung upside down to try to stretch herself out, and she even got a fellow officer to knock her on the head, hoping the ensuing lump would help her reach the height requirement, according to two of her peers. Ms. McSally has not disclosed who raped or assaulted her. But when she was a junior officer in the Air Force, she had told friends that by the time she arrived at the academy, she had already been sexually assaulted in high school by a coach. She hasn’t given details about the superior officer who raped her once she joined the military, but a friend, Rich Robinson, said she confided in him more than two decades ago about the assaults. “It’s almost like you’re a wounded sheep in the field, and they sniff you out,” Mr. Robinson said of predatory officers in the military. “As you’re learning the situation, they gain your trust and then they violate that, and that’s when the abuse takes place. The betrayal is when you totally believe in someone, and then they took advantage of you for their own benefit.” Many women of that era simply dropped out. During the early years of women at the academy, one in four left before graduating, an attrition rate at least double that of West Point and the Naval Academy. One victim was Lynn Hall, who said she was raped in December 2001 while in her first year at the Air Force Academy. Already a civilian pilot when she entered the academy, Ms. Hall had been introduced to a senior upperclassman, who would go on to rape her on one of the upper floors of the academy’s library. Ms. Hall contracted herpes from the assault, which led to a meningitis and encephalitis infection. A doctor asked her whether she was sexually active, but fearing what would happen if she reported the rape, she said no. As a result, she said, she never received the right diagnosis or treatment. “It cascaded into all sorts of medical problems, and I didn’t get the medical care I needed,” she said. She tried to stick it out, but left the academy in 2004 with a medical discharge. Ms. McSally, during her senior year at the academy, finally got the height waiver she was seeking. It was the first such waiver in seven years. In 1994, at the stick of an A-10 Warthog over the deserts of Iraq, she became the first American woman to fly in combat. But even as she was making history, Ms. McSally was also making enemies. In 2014, in the heat of Ms. McSally’s campaign for Congress, two pilots criticized her publicly, including Lt. Col. Thomas Norris. He told an Arizona radio host that as a pilot, Ms. McSally displayed “incredible ineptness in the air” and was “under the highest level of supervision starting back in 1995, because she had severe lack of knowledge and credibility.” Two other pilots said in recent interviews that Ms. McSally once took off with not enough fuel in her jet. And yet, they complained, she was often promoted ahead of her peers, despite what they described as middling pilot skills. Ms. McSally’s allies say that much of the criticism about her stemmed from professional jealousy and an anti-female bias in the hyper-macho fighter pilot culture. “She got extra attention, and that’s not right. But it wasn’t her fault,” said Don Bacon, a retired Air Force brigadier general who served with her at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Tucson. “You’ve got a senator flying in, and they’d say ‘We want to see Martha McSally.’ If you’re a commander, you’ve got to protect someone like that. I don’t know that all of them did.” Mr. Bacon, now a Republican congressman from Nebraska, remembered her as an effective leader. “I thought she was very competent as a commander and in how she treated people,” he said. The grumbling grew steadily every time Ms. McSally was promoted, and every time she challenged the status quo. And challenge it she did — again and again. In 2001, as a lieutenant colonel flying missions out of Saudi Arabia, she was required to wear the black head covering and long black robe known as an abaya whenever she went off base. She filed suit in federal court, saying the requirements were discriminatory. Ms. McSally showed the same defiance in 2004 when she became the first woman to command a fighter squadron, the pilots said. The Air Force had just issued a regulation barring women from wearing men’s flight caps, which many women preferred over the women’s version. At the ceremony where she took command, she wore the men’s cap. Female former officers who served in the same time frame said that it was almost inconceivable that an officer with any ambition would have reported a sexual assault by another officer. Not only would it have been clear from the outset that there was almost no chance of anything happening or any charges being pursued, but blowing the whistle on another officer — or even just reacting negatively to the routinely bawdy banter of pilots — would get you ostracized and harm your career prospects. Ms. McSally alluded to this retribution in a paper she wrote in 2007 while at the Air War College. “Blame must be placed appropriately,” she wrote. “The assaulter is the one who degraded cohesion of the team, not the victim.” The youngest pilots were often tasked with carrying around the squadron’s box of pornography. Squadron members sang group songs that included lyrics about raping women, ejaculating, and mutilation of women, and female officers and airmen were expected to tolerate it, if not sing along, said Jennifer Jones, who enlisted in the Air Force at 17, became an officer and then went to law school and rose to be a major in the Judge Advocate General’s Corps. Women described laughing at bawdy jokes knowing that if they were not viewed as part of the team, they would not advance in their careers. And the quickest way to kill your military careers, they said, was to report. This retaliation against sexual assault claimants has long been military-wide. Stacey Thompson was a young Marine lance corporal in Okinawa in 1998, when she said she was drugged and raped by her sergeant. She reported it immediately to the military chain of command that also, incidentally, included her sergeant. During the investigation, the military discharged Ms. Thompson’s sergeant. But they discharged Ms. Thompson as well, effectively ending her career in the military. Nine years later, halfway around the world, after commanding a squadron, Ms. McSally graduated first in her class from the Air War College in 2007, and was in line to become a group commander. But she was passed over and eventually retired from active duty in 2010. She had survived 26 years in the aggressively masculine culture of fighter pilots in the Air Force. She ran unsuccessfully for Congress in 2012, and then won in 2014. When Jeff Flake announced he was leaving the Senate, she ran unsuccessfully for his seat, losing to Kyrsten Sinema, a Democrat, in November. And then, Gov. Doug Ducey of Arizona put her in John McCain’s vacant seat, and in the sights of Mr. Kelly, the popular astronaut. On Feb. 28, Ms. Thompson, the former Marine and sexual assault survivor, went to Ms. McSally’s Senate offices to try to get her to sign on to the congressional legislation that would take such cases out of the hands of the military. During a private meeting with other survivors, Ms. McSally disclosed that she, too, had been raped and mistreated by the military. But Ms. McSally said that despite what happened to her, she still believed that the handling of such cases should be left in the hands of the military command structure. Ms. McSally said that taking rape cases away would be letting commanders off the hook. She said that military commanders needed to know that they would be fired if they did not prosecute such cases. Critics of that logic say it ignores the tremendous influence male commanders have among their male colleagues. “She kept saying, ‘We’re on the same side on this,’” Ms. Thompson recalled. She said she left the meeting thinking about the contradictory nature of Ms. McSally. “Yeah, we’re both survivors,” she said. “But we are not on the same side.” OpinionLynn K.

2019,‘Iceman’ Review: Retribution in the Neolithic Age,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. Before 20 minutes of “Iceman” have passed, we’ve already seen an agonizing birth, multiple deaths and a generous amount of raping and pillaging. Despite the lack of understandable dialogue — the setting is prehistoric and the characters’ language is extinct — we can, as promised by a note at the beginning of the picture, easily follow the unsubtitled narrative. Less clear is why the German filmmaker Felix Randau would have the imaginative idea of reconstructing the possible final days of Europe’s best-preserved mummy, only to give him such a basic plot. Even if the death of the ancient man, discovered in a melting Alpine glacier in 1991, is pretty well understood, the events preceding it leave plenty of room for dramatic speculation. Randau’s script, though, is an implacable plod from one bashing to another as the man (here named Kelab and stoically played by Jürgen Vogel) returns from a hunt to find his village burned, his clan slain and his wife violated and murdered. Tracking the Neolithic thugs (led by the forbidding André Hennicke) responsible for the massacre, Kelab traverses treacherous ice sheets and narrow crevasses. Yet his misadventures, filmed with elemental energy and wide-screen pizazz by Jakub Bejnarowicz, are necessarily limited to broad strokes: When characters are buried beneath animal furs and carpets of hair, subtle emoting is hardly an option. Telling them apart is another challenge, though Randau, by giving the frigid beauty of the Tyrolean mountains a starring role, lessens our need to discern who’s beneath the whiskers. Still, I like to think that the great Franco Nero, in a silent cameo as a Moses-like settler, must have demanded his all-white outfit and hair to match. If you’re Nero, you’re not going to endure such a grueling shoot just to blend into the pack.

2019,"‘In Afghanistan, We Laugh Differently’","For a handful of teenage girls, robotics offered a reprieve from their violent, patriarchal country. Now they are back home, with the Taliban poised to gain power. CreditCreditAndrea DiCenzo for The New York Times HERAT, Afghanistan — A 2017 wall calendar dangled from a nail over Kawsar Roshan’s bed on the otherwise blank wall of her room. “Best year for me” she had written, in curly script, above aerial photos of lakes and waterfalls. She drew a smiley-face next to her wobbly English letters. The out-of-date calendar was “nothing too special,” said Kawsar, though she does love waterfalls, especially Niagara Falls — which she saw with her own eyes during that best year. Kawsar, then 16, saw a lot of places as a member of Afghanistan’s first-ever girls’ robotics team. More than any other Afghan girl she knows. Or boy. Or even grown-up, for that matter. You may remember hearing about that team. In the summer of 2017, Kawsar and five teammates, along with their coach, were denied visas into the United States for a robotics competition in Washington, prompting an international outcry. Eventually, 53 members of Congress signed a petition and President Trump intervened to get the girls travel documents on special humanitarian grounds. They received a silver medal in “courageous achievement” and Congressional certificates of merit. Back in Afghanistan, they were received as icons of progress, though some sniped that they had dressed immodestly while abroad and compromised their marriageability. In the time since, the photogenic troupe of teenage girls in head scarves and protective goggles has shuttled between their homes in Herat and competitions in North America, suitcases bulging with robotics contraptions, trophies and rice cookers. They met Ivanka Trump three times. Justin Trudeau offered to be their backup robot driver. The rapper Will.i.am, one of their sponsors, took so many selfies with the girls that Lida Azizi, the team’s robot driver, called him, “a true friend.” Over and over again, they were showered with a compliment to which they never quite knew how to respond: “It’s so inspiring to see an all-Muslim team.” They amassed tens of thousands of Facebook followers and, as their English improved, learned the art of the sound bite, delivering messages about “resilience” and “self-confidence.” It was an unimaginable odyssey between two worlds, as their friends and families faced continued violence in Afghanistan. While at a major competition in Mexico City last summer, the girls awoke to news that a suicide bomber in Kabul had killed 47 boys about their age in a college-exam prep class. They traded pajamas for black head scarves and posted a selfie on Facebook with a sign that read, “We continue for you.” Now, with peace negotiations underway involving the Taliban, many inside and around Afghanistan are fearful that recent gains in women’s rights and girls’ education could be washed away. Earlier this month, Roya Mahboob, an Afghan expat tech entrepreneur and the team’s founder, sent a letter to Ms. Trump, who had been so enthusiastic about the team, pleading that the youth of Afghanistan not be forgotten in the talks; last week, Ms. Mahboob met with the United States’ special envoy for Afghan reconciliation. The girls’ one-year visas expired in the fall, so they are focused now mostly on school: Kawsar and Fatemah Qaderyan, the team’s pint-size captain and a “Harry Potter” fan, study English in an after school program, and Lida, dreaming of college in Canada, where the team trained last winter, is being tutored by an uncle. They are eager for peace, of course, though concerned that a newly empowered Taliban could further stifle girls’ ambitions. Such a future, Kawsar said recently via What’sApp, “would be unbelievable for me.” She added a sad-face emoji. It is not often that teenagers get to travel the world. It was unheard-of for 16-year-old girls from Afghanistan — girls not used to leaving the house without a male chaperone, girls whose peers were getting married — to travel the world competing in robotics. Before it all started, the only robots they had known were the drones used by the American military. And the only Americans they had seen outside of television were soldiers in armored cars. We followed Kawsar and her teammates through much of that “best year.” These are snapshots from their journey. [For more on women and girls, sign up for In Her Words, a weekly newsletter.] Their odyssey started with an invitation from an American inventor named Dean Kamen, who had founded a robotics league in the United States decades before and in 2017 planned an Olympics-style competition. He enlisted Ms. Mahboob to put together an Afghan team. More than 150 girls turned up to try out. A dozen made the first cut. As they awaited the robot parts sent by Mr. Kamen, they set up a workshop in the basement of Ms. Mahboob’s parents’ home in Herat, watching YouTube how-to videos and tinkering with scrap metal that their coach, Ms. Mahboob’s brother, Alireza Mehraban, picked up in the market. They hammered nails with rocks, twisted chains by slamming doors on them, and searched for kitchen knives sharp enough to make slits in aluminum. They worked barefoot, as is customary inside Afghan homes, and without any safety equipment. “When you have Taliban outside, goggles aren’t your biggest security problem,” one of the girls joked. They came from different schools, neighborhoods and ethnic groups, but most were born in 2001, the year United States troops began what the military called “Operation Enduring Freedom.” When the team returned to Herat after that first competition, Fatemah’s father, Mohammad Asif Qaderyan, planted a congratulatory kiss on her cheek in front of the TV cameras at the airport — a public display of affection not looked kindly upon by all. He had been the team’s biggest booster, helping persuade other fathers to let their daughters travel. A building contractor with a ninth-grade education, Mr. Qaderyan was an avid supporter of girls’ schools, of robotics and, above all, of Fatemah. They had a special closeness, staying up late to watch science documentaries on DVDs. “We would talk about complicated stuff, and I could ask him any question,” she said. “Sometimes he would be surprised by my questions, but he always tried to answer.” Exactly one week after the team came home from Washington, Fatemah waved to her father as he shut the gate of their home and headed to the mosque. When the blast hit a bit later, her mother ran into the street, panicked. Fatemah kept dialing his cellphone. The Afghan affiliate of the Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack, whose official death toll was 36, though neighbors counted more. “All our neighbors thought I was the cause of his death,” she said. “They said if I had not been on the robotics team, it would not have happened.” In early 2018, the girls were invited to train with a robotics team in Canada, and ended up qualifying for a 700-team competition in Detroit. They arrived late one evening at a suburban hotel, where the bar was filled with men and women drinking, laughing and eating chicken wings. Somaya Faruqi, the team’s mechanical whiz, cocked her head toward the bar, her eyes widening. “In Afghanistan we laugh differently,” she said. Yes, like, not loudly, the others explained. And no teeth showing. “At home,” Kawsar said, “they stone women to death for adultery — or even if they just suspect it.” Then she added: “But the truth is, I like to smile.” Sometimes, when no one was around, the girls would crack each other up with a routine. “You are so awesome,” one teammate, Sahar Barak, would say in her best American accent, mimicking the people who kept telling them as much. Kawsar, batting long dark lashes, would join in: “You guys are really inspiring!” Lida might make a little heart shape with her fingers: “Yes, yes, you have touched our hearts!” Without fail, this would reduce the girls to a heap of giggles, hands flying to cover mouths and hold onto slipping head scarves, eyes darting to make sure Coach Ali wasn’t watching. “When we go home, we will change our behavior,” Fatemah said. “We will know how to hide our smiles when we need to.” A trip to Canada that was supposed to last a few weeks turned into months on the road, and the girls began to worry about missing too much school. They liked the freedom to ride bikes in New York — “At home, if you are a boy you can go bike riding, but not us,” Kawsar said — and loved using the swings in Central Park. They also appreciated the flip-flop selection at Kmart. But their suitcases were getting heavy and they missed their mothers. They slept on beanbags at Ms. Mahboob’s apartment in Queens, N.Y., for a few weeks between competitions, taking turns cleaning, cooking, and painting each others’ nails with glitter polish. “I’m so happy for Ed Sheeran that he is getting married,” Lida said one day. She was a big fan of Ed Sheeran, as well as of Lionel Messi. And she loved everything having to do with World Wrestling Entertainment, including Mr. Trump. “He might be a W.W.E. fan, but he doesn’t like Muslims like you,” Sahar told Lida. “Is it true Trump supports ISIS?” Kawsar asked. They discussed their collective crush on Prime Minister Trudeau, whom they called “Justin.” They wondered who — “besides us” — might be the most famous Afghans outside of Afghanistan, and dissected another famous young Muslim woman who promoted girls’ education: Malala Yousafzai, the Nobel Peace Prize winner, who is Pakistani. “She repeats the same lines to everyone!” Fatemah argued. Then they wondered aloud: “Do we do that?” They had recently learned the word “weird,” and were pleased with its ability to encompass feelings about the unfamiliar. People kissing in the streets in America, for example, was weird. Billboards with women half-undressed? Weird. Or strangers talking to you in the street: “You don’t know them, and suddenly they are saying something,” Fatemah said. Once, riding the subway from Queens to Manhattan, a stranger called Lida a “cookie” and asked to touch her head scarf. Another time, somebody leaned over and said: “People get blown up right on the street in your country. What do you think about that?” But the worst was on an overnight Greyhound bus from Detroit to New York. They had showed up in high spirits, with matching blue eye shadow and mascara they had been trying on in a Sephora that afternoon. Then, on the bus, one man was watching porn on his phone. When they asked another to change seats, he cursed and pushed them. “You are rude!” Sahar retorted in her best English before bursting into tears. They missed the way time moved slowly in Herat, where aunts and uncles were constantly visiting, and dinners were long, and always homemade. “There is no greater pleasure in life,” Somaya said, “than a family picnic at the park, at home.” “No one would ever push you there,” Kawsar added. After one competition in Albuquerque, N.M., the girls stopped for ice cream at an outdoor mall, where, after long discussions on the merits of each flavor, they all ordered pistachio. They discussed the robotics team from Burundi, whose members had disappeared after the competition in Washington and then resurfaced a few weeks later, requesting asylum. “It’s annoying that Americans think everyone wants to sneak into their country,” said Fatemah. “I don’t.” “When I grow up, I’m going to start a robotics company with Somaya,” she said. It would be a fleet of robots to monitor security issues. Or maybe agricultural robots to help farmers collect saffron. That is, if she doesn’t become president of Afghanistan, which is her real dream. Somaya could be her chief of staff, Fatemah said. The others could help with her campaign. Sahar rolled her eyes. “Yes, it would be nice to live, for a while, in a country where girls are allowed to ride bikes and swim and where there are Baskin-Robbins everywhere,” said Kawsar. And it would be “awesome” to study overseas, they agreed. But stay? “Not us,” they said. The girls had been traveling for 30 hours, changed planes five times and gone through 13-and-a-half time zones. It was the first day of Ramadan when they touched down in Herat last May, and they would soon be fasting. As they prepared to exit the plane, they put on their medals and dialed down their smiles. Awaiting them on the tarmac were TV cameras, a government minister with bouquets of plastic roses, and families relieved to have their daughters safely home. The only mother missing was Fatemah’s. Someone made an excuse, saying she was sick. “Not exactly sick,” she said later. “I am sick in my heart.” It had been less than 10 months since the mosque attack that killed her husband. With their U.S. visas having run out, the team’s activities have quieted. Fatemah, Somaya and Lida went to a robotics competition in Estonia in November and, with three new girls, to one in Istanbul in February. Fatemah and Ms. Mahboob met with Afghanistan’s president, Ashraf Ghani, about a plan to start a robotics club in Kabul, as well as a technology-focused school, which the Yale Engineering Department has offered to design. He offered support, but there is as yet no budget. At a school assembly, Lida and Kawsar spoke to hundreds of girls in matching black tunics and white head scarves about how the team had won the all-rookie award at a championship in Canada and how they each came home with six medals and how, above all, they were proud to serve their country. One girl asked if they had seen the Statue of Liberty. Yes, they had. And they had met Justin Trudeau! It was unclear how many in the audience knew who that was. Afterward, one girl said: “I could do robotics, too.” “If I just knew what it was,” she added. “And if my dad allowed.” Danna Harman is a London-based journalist who has reported from across Africa, the Middle East and Latin America.",The New York Times
2019,"‘In the Twitching Subway Light, a Band Swung Into Our Car’","METROPOLITAN DIARY A dance on the No. 1, a delicious snack on York Avenue and more reader tales of New York City in this week’s Metropolitan Diary. Dear Diary: We were apart for seven months. He was in Alabama, at Fort Rucker, and I was at Columbia. We spent three days together while he was on leave. The day before he left, we were on the No. 1. In the twitching subway light, a band swung into our car and seasoned the tight air: One musician kneaded a metallic accordion, and another sang. He smiled — there is a slight gap between his front teeth — and we danced. In the music, the moment felt infinite. I didn’t think about saying goodbye, about the distance from Alabama to New York. I just thought about him, on the No. 1, with me, swinging to the music. The next day he boarded his train at Penn Station. I walked to Times Square, crying and cold, and I caught the No. 1. After two stops, a band swung into the car: It was the one from the day before. I couldn’t help but smile and swing my hips to the music. — Emma O’Leary Dear Diary: I was walking down York Avenue after a discouraging second day at my first job. Feeling overwhelmed, I was holding back tears as I trudged home through the rain. A few blocks from my apartment, I slowed to a stop in front of a fruit cart. I pretended to scan the contents as I replayed the previous eight hours in my head. The vendor tried to tempt me with cherries and tangerines, but I was lost in my own thoughts. I heard a voice whispering from behind me: “Get the grapes.” I turned to face a woman with gentle features and streaks of gray hair, her body wrapped tightly in a fur coat. “They’re sweet and delicious,” she said. “And you can put them in your pocket and eat them on your way home.” So I did. And they were. — Michael Harmon Dear Diary: There is an older man who stands at the corner of Stockholm Street and Knickerbocker Avenue in Brooklyn selling churros every day. “Two for a dollar,” he says to those who pass by. He keeps the churros in an empty cooler. It’s the dead of winter, and the winds from the polar vortex are causing branches to tap at my window. Looking out, I see frozen puddles, and litter lining the curb. An empty chip bag would shatter like glass if it was picked up and dropped. I take a sip of coffee. “Oh my God,” I think, “the churro man.” — Cameron Gleason Dear Diary: I was supposed to meet a friend to pick up a dress she was altering for me. We were going to rendezvous in the middle of the No. 1 subway at West 79th Street. She was coming downtown from Washington Heights on her way to work. When the train pulled into the station, I looked up and down the platform to find her, but I didn’t see her. The train operator poked his head out the window. His smile was as bright as the sun. “Who are you looking for?” he said. “Jackie,” I said. He got on the public address system. “Will Jackie please step out of the door of your car so your friend can find you?” he said. Jackie stepped out. I saw her, and we hopped back on the train together. The train operator made another announcement: “Jackie and her friend found each other. That’s good.” People on the train were laughing and smiling. Jackie gave me the dress and I got off at the next station. I ran up to the train operator to thank him. “You see that musician over there?” he said, pointing to a guy on the platform playing a keyboard. He handed me a $5 bill. “Give him this.” The train began to leave the station. “How’re you doing my man?” the train operator yelled as he pulled away. — Claudia Goddard Dear Diary: It was raining as I zoomed down the street on my longboard. The station was 11 blocks away, and the train I wanted to catch would be leaving in five minutes. I didn’t like my odds. Just as my leg began to tire out from pushing, a small sedan turned the corner behind me and began to trail me. I swerved to the side of the street to make space for the car to drive by. After speeding up, the car slowed down once it came even with me. The window rolled down, and a young guy wearing a Yankees cap poked out his head. “Where you off to?” he asked as we cruised along parallel to each other. “L.I.R.R.,” I said between breaths. “Queens Village Station.” He grinned. “Grab on.” I smiled, grabbed onto the window and felt my wheels scream as he picked up speed. — Zakariah Rizvi Read all recent entries and our submissions guidelines.

2019,‘Incarceration Helped Me Find My Voice’,"lens Years after serving time as a youth offender, the photographer Brian Frank has devoted himself to documenting young men’s experiences with the criminal justice system. In “Out of Bounds: Coming of Age in Gang Territory,” Brian L. Frank takes an intimate look at the effect of targeted policing on minority youth in the Central Valley of California, where the children of agricultural workers and former factory workers have few opportunities. Coming from areas labeled “gang territory” — a distinction largely reserved for communities of color — that have experienced generations of neglect and aggressive policing, many young people enter the system on “gang related” charges as children. Mr. Frank, who himself was a juvenile offender, said that instead of addressing the root causes of violence with community development or jobs programs in working-class areas, the police aggressively sweep minority neighborhoods to rack up arrest figures. At the same time, he has been looking at programs that offer nontraditional approaches to reducing recidivism. “I had my own run-ins with the law; a lot of the people that I’m photographing now, I see myself in them and I think, ‘The only difference is you didn’t get out and I did,’” Mr. Frank said. “Being able to not only tell these stories through my own lens, but also help people visually tell their own experiences with the criminal justice system, has been one of the highlights of my career.” In the following essay, Mr. Frank reflects on his experiences inside and outside the system. — David Gonzalez My eyes opened to the flat, gray light of dawn. Between sleep and reality, I got up and put my feet to the floor. Cold concrete. I moved toward the small window in the door, hoping for a way out, but there was none. I pounded the wall. It was only when I snapped a bone in my hand that I realized I wasn’t in a bad dream. The pain was real. I was 14 years old. It was my first day in jail. It wouldn’t be my last. I have reported throughout California in recent years on groups that challenge traditional norms of justice, community engagement, intervention and policing. I’ve ridden with police gang units, shadowed former gang members as they reach out with advice to a younger generation, and photographed California’s last remaining youth prison work camp (which for many young offenders is their first extended experience with nature). I have photographed in Pelican Bay State Prison, the first state-operated Supermax lockup. It’s a hell of deprivation. Warehousing doesn’t work and prisons, rather than offering a solution, can often compound the problem. Initiatives with the boldest imaginations and the most unorthodox methods are often the ones that reduce violence and recidivism, renew trust, and offer viable alternatives to crime for people caught in cycles of poverty and transgression. Led by activists, police officers, community liaison teams and corrections professionals, these various initiatives seek to stop the flow of people into prisons and equip those already incarcerated to get out and stay out. I am fascinated by the out-of-the-box responses that ordinary citizens and law enforcement officials are pursuing in the interests of rehabilitation and improved public safety. Anything but prison … … As a child in that cell, I felt alone, powerless and unique in my pain. As a photojournalist, I’ve learned that many people feel isolated and stuck with limited choices and unyielding institutions. I felt enslaved, and in many ways I still am. Slavery was part of this nation’s foundation, and its legacy of generational inequality is evident in American prisons, which house a quarter of the world’s inmates. I don’t know what’s worse: the feeling of complete abandonment as an imprisoned young teenager or the knowledge that tens of millions have felt, and still feel, exactly the same. I cannot turn away from this. As with so many black and brown young men, memories of injustice and exploitation live on in my DNA, too, passed from my ancestors who toiled for European masters, to my grandmother, who worked as a house cleaner in the United States to bring her children, one by one, from Trinidad. That gray dawn in jail was one of the most formative days of my life: a crash course in civics no student would ever want to sign up for. But it was there, in school, on the streets and at home, that I learned more about how race, health, employment and social mobility can conspire to keep young people trapped. I saw firsthand how, as far the public debate over crime was concerned, fear and hyperbole trumped empathy and accuracy. Yet in a way I never imagined, incarceration helped me find my voice. One of the most visceral memories I have from my time incarcerated was how I felt speaking to my mother from the prison phone. It was a time of extreme shame and embarrassment — that I had let down my family, that I had let down my mother, who worked so hard to give me every opportunity in life. That’s why I used to hover around and photograph the prison phones. I was telling my own story, not just those of my subjects. As a 2017 CatchLight Fellow, Mr. Frank spent a year working with The Marshall Project examining alternatives to incarceration. Last year, he also worked with CatchLight and Project Rebound with support from the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting to facilitate a photojournalism workshop for formerly incarcerated youth at San Francisco State University.

2019,‘Island of the Hungry Ghosts’ Review: Migration and Trauma on Christmas Island,"Critic’s Pick When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. “Blessings to those in between,” a Chinese woman says near the end of Gabrielle Brady’s ethereal, intensely moving documentary, “Island of the Hungry Ghosts.” She’s speaking to her ancestors, brought to the Australian territory of Christmas Island over 100 years ago to work the mines and whose spirits are believed to haunt this wild, strangely forbidding place. Her benediction, though, could just as easily be directed at the island’s other migrants: the hundreds of asylum seekers housed indefinitely in a gigantic detention center deep in the woods, and the millions of red crabs that make the perilous journey to the ocean each year to mate. Workers build makeshift bridges to help the crabs cross a roadside ditch, but our sole bridge to the detainees is Poh Lin Lee, a demoralized trauma counselor whose patients are slowly deteriorating. Unfolding without narration or pushy musical cues, “Island of the Hungry Ghosts” (filmed from 2014-17) explores, with great delicacy, the agony of living in limbo. As Poh Lin struggles to process the horrors and humiliations that necessitate her work, she also begins to question her complicity in an increasingly secretive system. Yet the movie doesn’t harangue, making its points with soft voices and often surreal imagery. Following Poh Lin and her young family as they explore the island, Michael Latham’s camera is alternately serene and agitated, thrusting through jungly undergrowth or gazing, bewitched, at a crimson carpet of crabs by a restless gray ocean. The result is at once acutely distressing and quite lovely, transforming the island into something primitive and inscrutable. Interpreting island lore, Poh Lin’s partner, Arthur Floret, tells their children that the jagged coastal rocks were created by a dragon to protect the island from humans. He doesn’t add that they didn’t succeed. When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.",The New York Times
2019,‘It Is Unspeakable’: How Maduro Used Cuban Doctors to Coerce Venezuela Voters,"Yansnier Arias knew it was wrong. It violated the Constitution, not to mention the oath he took as a doctor in Cuba. He had been sent to Venezuela by the Cuban government, one of thousands of doctors deployed to shore up ties between the two allies and alleviate Venezuela’s collapsing medical system. But with President Nicolás Maduro’s re-election on the line, not everyone was allowed to be treated, Dr. Arias said. A 65-year-old patient with heart failure entered his clinic — and urgently needed oxygen, he said. The tanks sat in another room at the ready, he recalled. But he said his Cuban and Venezuelan superiors told him to use the oxygen as a political weapon instead: Not for medical emergencies that day, but to be doled out closer to the election, part of a national strategy to compel patients to vote for the government. May 20, 2018, was nearing, he said, and the message was clear: Mr. Maduro needed to win, at any cost. “There was oxygen, but they didn’t let me use it,” said Dr. Arias, who defected from the Cuban government’s medical program late last year and now lives in Chile. “We had to leave it for the election.” To maintain their hold over Venezuela, Mr. Maduro and his supporters have often used the nation’s economic collapse to their advantage, dangling food before hungry voters, promising extra subsidies if he won, and demanding that people present identification cards tied to government rations when they came to the polls. But participants in the schemes say Mr. Maduro and his supporters have deployed another tool as well: Cuba’s international medical corps. In interviews, 16 members of Cuba’s medical missions to Venezuela — a signature element of relations between the two countries — described a system of deliberate political manipulation in which their services were wielded to secure votes for the governing Socialist Party, often through coercion. Many tactics were used, they said, from simple reminders to vote for the government to denying treatment for opposition supporters with life-threatening ailments. The Cuban doctors said they were ordered to go door-to-door in impoverished neighborhoods, offering medicine and warning residents that they would be cut off from medical services if they did not vote for Mr. Maduro or his candidates. Many said their superiors directed them to issue the same threats during closed-door consultations with patients seeking treatment for chronic diseases. One former Cuban supervisor said that she and other foreign medical workers were given counterfeit identification cards to vote in an election. Another doctor said she and others were told to give precise voting instructions to elderly patients, whose infirmities made them particularly easy to manipulate. “These are the kinds of things you should never do in your life,” said the doctor. Like several others, she spoke on the condition of anonymity because she and her relatives could face retaliation by the Cuban or Venezuelan authorities. The accounts of manipulation and fraud underscore the many challenges to Mr. Maduro’s legitimacy as president. After the start of his second term in January, the opposition-controlled legislature declared its leader, Juan Guaidó, the country’s rightful president, calling the election undemocratic. More than 50 countries, including the United States, now recognize Mr. Guaidó as Venezuela’s president, though Mr. Maduro still holds the reins of power. Mr. Maduro’s opponents often accuse Cuba — which has long depended on oil from Venezuela — of propping up his embattled government by sending agents to work with Venezuela’s intelligence agencies, helping its ideological ally crush dissent. But the use of Cuban doctors to exert political control is not widely known, the doctors say, and the practice casts a harsh light on a sweeping exchange that supposedly benefits all Venezuelans, regardless of their politics. The Venezuelan government did not respond to questions, while the Cuban government noted that, for decades, its doctors have been celebrated for their medical missions across the globe, fighting Ebola in Africa, blindness in Latin America and cholera in Haiti, to name a few. It rejected the doctors’ assertions that they had been dragged into campaigns and pressured to manipulate or threaten patients for political ends in Venezuela, citing the “honorable task” they have accomplished. “The historical impact of that cooperation in Venezuela has been reflected in the 1,473,117 human lives that have been saved,” the government said. But human rights experts point to the special pact between Cuba and Venezuela over the last two decades. “The Cuban government wants to make sure the Venezuelan regime survives and is willing to do anything in their power to support Maduro,” said José Miguel Vivanco, director of the Americas program at Human Rights Watch. “It is unspeakable.” Dr. Carlos Ramírez loved the work. A dental surgeon, he left Cuba and came to Venezuela, proud of the cause. Many of his patients had never seen a dentist before, he said. But he despised one part of his job: Each weekend, he and other medical workers were told to hand out medicine and enlist voters for Venezuela’s Socialist Party, he said. The visits were so routine they had a name — “casa-a-casa,” or house-to-house. “You arrived with vitamins and some pills for blood pressure” or the like, said Dr. Ramírez, who defected to Ecuador after six years. “And when you started to gain their trust, you started the questions: ‘Do you know where your voting place is? Are you going to vote?’ ” All 16 of the Cuban medical personnel interviewed confirmed the house-to-house visits mixing medicine and politics. They were part of Barrio Adentro, a program set up by former President Hugo Chávez in 2003 to bring medicine to poor neighborhoods in Venezuela. Under a new Constitution passed in 1999, health care was a universal right. Shifting the nation’s focus to the poor, Mr. Chávez turned to Cuba for medical personnel. Cuba, still reeling from the collapse of its former patron, the Soviet Union, had much to gain. Doctors are the island’s most profitable export, with medical missions in more than 60 countries that provide Cuba with an estimated $8 billion in cash. Venezuela paid for its doctors in a precious resource: oil. Mr. Chávez was beloved by many Venezuelans. So in the early years, Dr. Ramírez and other doctors said they were mainly instructed to remind voters that Mr. Chávez had provided the medicine — and should be thanked with their votes. But in 2013, after battling cancer, Mr. Chávez died. His handpicked successor, Mr. Maduro, was not nearly as popular and faced a strong challenge from the opposition. Dr. Ramírez and other doctors say they were then told to deliver a warning: If Mr. Maduro lost the election, the next government would break ties with Cuba and Venezuelans would lose their medical care. “With Chavez it had been hard, but with Maduro, starting in 2013, it was worse,” another Cuban doctor said. “It became a form of blackmail: ‘You’re not going to have medicine. You’re not going to have free health care. You’re not going to have prenatal care if you’re a pregnant woman.’ ” Four of the Cuban medical workers said the government established “electoral command centers” inside or next to clinics, with Socialist Party operatives dispatching doctors to pressure residents. One added that, on the day Mr. Maduro was elected to his first term, she witnessed officials opening ballot boxes and tampering with votes, including destroying ballots that chose the opposition. Another said she and others were asked to vote with false identification. On April 14, 2013, officials declared Mr. Maduro the winner with 50.6 percent of the vote, one of the narrowest margins in years. “I asked myself, ‘Why is a physician, someone who is meant to be on a humanitarian mission, having a part in who wins an election?’” said one of the doctors. “This is called tampering. There is no other word for it.” By 2015, the headwinds facing Mr. Maduro had grown. Oil prices and production were dropping. The shortages of basic goods had begun. The opposition was seeking control of the legislature, and appeared headed for victory. “Because the opposition was favored to win, they gave us the work of buying votes,” said Raúl Manuel, a Cuban doctor now in Brazil. “Buying votes in what sense? Going out with medicine.” Dr. Manuel said he was sent to Barinas, the state where Mr. Chávez was born. But it had begun to turn against the Socialist Party, and resentment against Cuban doctors was building for their pact with the government. When Dr. Manuel did his required house-to-house visits, some residents unleashed dogs or came to the door armed, he and other doctors said. On Election Day, Dr. Manuel said he was sent to an opposition stronghold. When early returns showed the opposition ahead, a gun battle broke out. Dr. Manuel said he found himself trapped on a cul-de-sac as bullets ricocheted around him. He called his clinic for help, he said, but it was busy sending out doctors to get voters to the polls. “They said they had no cars to rescue us,” he said. After the shootout, Dr. Manuel said he returned to the clinic, shaken, only to learn that government officials from other departments — including the sports and culture agencies — were going out, too, posing as doctors. “We, the doctors, were asked to give our extra robes to people,” he said. The fake doctors were even giving out medicines, without knowing what they were or how to use them, he added. “They were putting the lives of so many people at risk, the lives of children, all to win votes,” Dr. Manuel said. Another Cuban doctor in Barinas offered the same account: that government employees, dressed as physicians, were sent out with medicine to get votes. When the final tally came in, Mr. Maduro’s party had been trounced nationally, losing its majority in the legislature for the first time since 1999. By the time Dr. Arias arrived in late 2016, Venezuela was suffering a grinding collapse. The economic implosion had led to chronic shortages of food. Inflation had hit so hard that people paid with stacks of bills, counted at cash registers with electric bill counters. Crimes and killings soared. And then there were the hospitals. Vital medicines couldn’t be imported because the government had little cash. Water cuts meant surgeons used bottled water to clean their hands, without soap, which was also in short supply. Doling out the little medicine that remained, the doctors now focused their vote-getting efforts on patients with chronic illnesses, who needed repeated attention, Dr. Arias said. “The theme was chronic illnesses, the ones where you would die if patients didn’t get medicine, and that’s how they controlled people,” Dr. Arias recalled. Mr. Maduro was fighting for control himself. Protests swept the capital for months, setting off a government crackdown in which more than 100 people died in street battles. After receiving death threats from patients, Dr. Arias said he was sent to a fishing town, La Vela del Coro, where food shortages led doctors and nurses to steal medicine and trade it for groceries. “I saw it with my own eyes,” he said, recounting how a Cuban nurse traded antibiotics for “a kilo of potatoes, a kilo of yams.” Residents of La Vela confirmed that both Cuban and Venezuelan doctors regularly bartered medicine for goods on the black market. In mid-2017, Mr. Maduro made a bid to consolidate power: a referendum for a second legislature to replace the opposition-controlled National Assembly. Calling the vote illegal, the opposition refused to participate, so the slate of candidates was composed entirely of figures loyal to the president. The new legislature quickly sidelined the National Assembly, embarking on an aggressive agenda to silence Mr. Maduro’s critics. The government pushed a contentious identification system called the “homeland card,” used by the Socialist Party for both food subsidies and voting. Mr. Maduro urged citizens to get the card to receive groceries, and party officials opened kiosks outside polling places to review the cards after people cast their ballots. Dr. Arias said that doctors’ house-to-house visits started registering people for the cards. But the cards terrified many Venezuelans, who feared the government would see how they voted and restrict their food in retaliation. Before an election for governors that year, Mr. Arias recalled an epileptic patient in the hospital who needed treatment but had refused the homeland card. “‘I don’t want anything to do with this homeland! I don’t want anything to do with Maduro!’” he recalled her shouting. She was sent away without medication, he said, “because she was from the opposition.” As the returns came in, Mr. Maduro’s party claimed a lopsided victory, taking 17 of the 23 governorships, despite polls that had projected losses. “Today, the homeland has gotten stronger,” Mr. Maduro said that night. In 2018, it was Mr. Maduro’s turn to face voters. Measures were taken to ensure his victory. One challenger, Leopoldo López, was dragged between house arrest and a military prison. Another, Henrique Capriles, was banned from running, along with most opposition parties. As shortages worsened, Mr. Maduro promised hefty subsidies to those using the homeland card, saying openly: “I give, you give.” But his government withheld other essentials. Dr. Arias said medical supplies, always scarce in La Vela, soon disappeared, hoarded until the May election. He said his superiors wanted to flood hospitals with supplies right before the vote, giving the impression that Mr. Maduro had fixed the country’s shortages. “When the elections came, everything appeared: medicine, gas, dressings for bandages, injection serums,” he said. Residents in La Vela who had gone to the clinic confirmed it was suddenly supplied before the election. The case of the oxygen tanks still weighs heavily on Dr. Arias. “I argued with my colleagues over and over,” he said. “Yes, of course there was oxygen, but they didn’t let me use it.” Ángel Villegas, La Vela’s opposition mayor, said he was denied medication, too, told that it was in short supply. “There are a large number of services where you feel that, yes, they took into consideration the fact that you were in the opposition,” he said. As Election Day neared, the doctors continued to fan out in support of Mr. Maduro. “They come to your house, they ask you a series of questions, and you start to think, if I answer ‘no,’ they can cut me from health care,” said one patient, who declined to be named, fearing government reprisals. “It just leaves you overwhelmed.” On May 20, Mr. Maduro was declared the winner, landing him a second term. For Dr. Arias, it was too much. He made his way to Chile, taking shelter in a church, cleaning floors in a hospital and seeking asylum, unable to find work as a doctor. “If I can’t be a doctor, I at least want to be a person,” he said. It’s unclear how many other doctors have abandoned Cuba’s medical missions around the world — informal estimates are in the thousands — but the consequences are stark. Dr. Arias and the others are considered deserters by the Cuban government and cannot return to their families. Dr. Ramírez, the dental surgeon, is one of the few doctors interviewed who has returned to medicine, with a small practice in Ecuador. “You don’t finally realize what is right, until you open your eyes,” he said.",The New York Times
2019,‘It Was Not a Panhandler’: Baltimore Man and Daughter Charged in Killing of His Wife,"At first, the stabbing death of Jacquelyn Smith on a Baltimore street corner in December sounded like an act of charity gone wrong. The way her husband, Keith Smith, told it to reporters, the couple and Mr. Smith’s daughter, Valeria Smith, had been driving home after celebrating Valeria’s birthday. Jacquelyn Smith, 54, asked him to stop the car so she could give money to a woman holding what appeared to be a baby outside in the rain, he said. Then, Mr. Smith said, a man ran up to the car, tried to snatch Jacquelyn’s necklace through the open window and stabbed her. “The last thing I thought, that they were going to take my wife’s life,” Mr. Smith told reporters shortly after his wife’s death, his arm around Valeria Smith, Jacquelyn’s stepdaughter, who was sobbing, according to video published by The Baltimore Sun. “I got to live with that every day.” But on Sunday, law enforcement authorities announced a twist in the case: The attack was staged, Michael Harrison, acting commissioner of the Baltimore Police Department, said. Mr. Smith, 52, and his daughter, 28, were arrested by the authorities in Texas on Sunday and charged with first-degree murder in Ms. Smith’s death on Dec. 1. Sheriff Omar Lucia of Cameron County, Tex., said that Mr. Smith and his daughter were arraigned on Monday on murder and other charges, including aggravated assault. Sheriff Lucia said they were being held in jail without bond. “We now know that that was not true,” Mr. Harrison said, referring to Mr. Smith’s account of how Ms. Smith had died. “It was not a panhandler,” the commissioner said at a news conference attended by Mayor Catherine E. Pugh and Marilyn J. Mosby, the state’s attorney for Baltimore. Mr. Smith told the police that a female panhandler had asked for money to help her feed her young child, according to a police report. Texas Highway Patrol officers arrested Mr. Smith and Valeria Smith “without incident” from their rental car, a Toyota Camry, Lt. Johnny Hernandez, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Public Safety, said in an interview on Monday. They were coming out of the parking lot of a convenience store at about 10 a.m. Sunday in Combes, Tex., about 35 miles from a border crossing with Mexico. Lieutenant Hernandez said he did not know what they were doing in Texas or how long they had been there. It was not immediately clear whether Mr. Smith or Valeria Smith had legal representation. The announcement of their arrests was a stunning turnaround in a case that had stoked concerns about the city, which has one of the nation’s highest murder rates, and sympathy nationwide. Oprah Winfrey, the talk show host, said she would think twice about giving money to panhandlers. Ms. Smith was a civilian contractor with the Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense in Maryland, which manages the nation’s supply of defense equipment, a spokeswoman for the agency said on Monday. Mr. Harrison, named the city’s fifth police chief in four years in early January and charged with trying to solve some of its most persistent problems, declined to answer reporters’ questions on Sunday about an alleged motive, saying the investigation was “ongoing.” Mr. Smith moved out of Jacquelyn Smith’s house two weeks ago, said Marcel Trisvan, Ms. Smith’s brother, and handed the keys to him, saying he was moving to Florida, according to The Sun on Sunday. Mr. Trisvan did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday. Officials at the weekend news conference announcing the Smiths’ arrests said the suspects had exploited the city’s image in allegedly trying to cover up the killing. It was one of more than 300 in Baltimore in 2018, according to The Sun. “People take advantage of Baltimore,” Mr. Harrison said. “We want to make sure the truth comes out and justice is done.” Mayor Pugh, referring to Mr. Smith and his daughter, added: “These individuals took advantage of a situation — a city that is already dealing with its own problems.” A Baltimore Sun column on Monday said the initial story of Ms. Smith’s death, about five years after the couple were married, had initially “amplified the worst feelings about Baltimore, a real sense of foreboding around every corner.” In December, at a news conference, Mr. Smith said that he had called 911 to report the alleged attack, and that he had been instructed by a dispatcher to apply pressure to stanch the blood flow of his wife’s wounds as he drove her to the hospital. He said then that Ms. Smith “felt moved” when he saw the woman and baby in the rain. He jumped out of the car, he said, and tried to run after the woman and the man after the stabbing, but returned to the vehicle when he heard his wife’s screams. “I try to help people, but we are in our last days, and we need to understand there are some desperate people,” Mr. Smith said.",The New York Times
2019,"‘It Was a Cold, Drizzly Sunday Morning in 1973, and I Was at the Jon Vie Bakery’","METROPOLITAN DIARY Waiting for a chocolate cheesecake, a cat comes down from the Catskills and more reader tales of New York City in this week’s Metropolitan Diary. Dear Diary: It was a cold, drizzly Sunday morning in 1973, and I was at the Jon Vie bakery on Sixth Avenue in the West Village. The chocolate cheesecake was a specialty of theirs. There were two customers there besides me: a man ordering at the counter and a woman standing next to me who was all bundled up. “Here you go,” the counterman said, handing a cake box to the man who was waiting. “Our last chocolate cheesecake.” The woman and I turned to each other in dismay. “Not the last chocolate cheesecake!” we said at the same time. “I hear their apple strudels are pretty good,” the woman added. That’s when I realized it was Angela Lansbury. — Vincent Zito Dear Diary: A friend’s husband found a young cat wandering in the Catskills. When they posted her picture on Facebook, something about her spoke to me. Although I’d had cats all my life, I hadn’t had one in more than eight months. “How will she get from the Catskills to Manhattan?” I asked. “I’ll drive her,” my friend’s husband said. The sweet little calico arrived three days later. The day after she showed up, I took her to my neighborhood vet for a checkup. He whisked her off for shots and blood tests and to treat her for roundworms, and then he brought her back to the examining room. “You just got very lucky,” he said. “I know!” I exclaimed. “She’s such a great cat.” “I was talking to the cat,” the vet said. — Barbara Peck Dear Diary: I was walking along 60th Street with my 4-year-old son. We were going from Central Park to our apartment on Columbus Avenue. An older woman with a white cane was navigating the busy sidewalk. I explained to my son that she was blind and that we should offer to help her. We introduced ourselves, and she said her name was Shirley. She accepted our help gratefully. She said she was going to Roosevelt Hospital, not far out of our way. As we walked, Shirley told us about herself. She mentioned that she had taken the A train down from 165th Street for her doctor’s appointment, something she typically did on her own. We got to the hospital and parted ways. Later that week, I brought my 8-year-old daughter to a play date in Washington Heights. It was going to be our first time in the neighborhood. As we rode uptown on the subway, I told my daughter about meeting the blind woman earlier in the week. We left the subway at 168th Street and started toward our destination. Within two blocks, I spotted Shirley. “Shirley?” I called out. “Joel,” she said. “Is that you?” — Joel Bloom Dear Diary: Hey, Holden, I hear that you’re worried, concerned —Where are the ducks since the weather has turned?You’ve asked several cabbies, they simply don’t know,Where are the ducks and where do they go? They’re lonely and cold and prob’bly depressed,It’s tough in this town when you haven’t a nest.When the trees are all bare and the temper’ture’s brutal.And the mood is despair and the journey is futile. But kiddo, take heart, because this is the crux:If you listen for quacking, you’ll see that the ducksAre here in the park and they haven’t flown far —They splash and relax in the grand reservoir. The ducklings, the drakes, the mallards, the hens,All the ducks in a row, our fine feathered friends.Dining on sushi, a marvelous feast,Central Park’s their address: West, Middle and East. So, hang in there, Holden, everything’s ducky,Both you and the birds are lovely and lucky.No need to wonder just where the ducks go,Look no further than here, and thank Jackie O. — Lou Craft Dear Diary: I was on the subway platform at Times Square at rush hour. I was trying to slip through a tight corridor between a staircase and the tracks when a man in front of me stopped and stooped over. “What’s he doing?” I wondered, frustrated at having to pause. I saw that he was reaching for a glove that couldn’t have been his: It was on the ground in front of him as he bent over. I looked around, trying to figure out whom the glove belonged to and what the man was going do with it. I was intrigued, but mostly out of self-interest. If he started asking around about whose glove it was, I wouldn’t get as far down the platform as I wanted before my train arrived. A man who looked like a construction worker started walking our way. The first man tossed the glove in his direction, like you would with a pal. The construction worker caught it, smiled, winked, turned around and walked away. — Alexandra Svokos Read all recent entries and our submissions guidelines.

2019,‘It’s Probably Over for Us’: Record Flooding Pummels Midwest When Farmers Can Least Afford It,"VERDIGRE, Neb. — Ice chunks the size of small cars ripped through barns and farmhouses. Baby calves were swept into freezing floodwaters, washing up dead along the banks of swollen rivers. Farm fields were now lakes. The record floods that have pummeled the Midwest are inflicting a devastating toll on farmers and ranchers at a moment when they can least afford it, raising fears that this natural disaster will become a breaking point for farms weighed down by falling incomes, rising bankruptcies and the fallout from President Trump’s trade policies. “When you’re losing money to start with, how do you take on extra losses?” asked Clint Pischel, 23, of Niobrara, Neb., whose lowland fields were flooded by the ice-filled Niobrara River after a dam failed. He spent Monday gathering 30 dead baby calves from his family’s ranch in this northern region of the state, finding their bodies under huge chunks of ice. “There’s no harder business to be in,” Mr. Pischel added. “But with death and everything else, you’ve got to answer to bankers. It’s not our choice.” Farms filing for Chapter 12 bankruptcy protection rose by 19 percent last year across the Midwest, the highest level in a decade, according to data compiled by the American Farm Bureau. Now, many of those farmers have lost their livestock and livelihoods. The rail lines and roads that carry their crops to market were washed away by the rain-gorged rivers that drowned small towns, forced thousands of evacuations and killed at least three people. Some farmers say they have been cut off from their animals behind walls of water, while others cannot get to town for food and supplies for their livestock. Mapping the severity of the region’s flooding, which has killed three people. [Flooding in the Midwest: Here’s why the water is so high.] In Verdigre, also in northern Nebraska, the Ruzicka family has farmed for five generations, dating back to the homesteading days of the 1800s. The farmhouse is a total loss, a prized branding iron is missing and the family’s first tractor, a 1930s model that is still used sometimes, now sits overturned in a pond of mud, its red wheel pointed to the sky. “There’s not many farms left like this, and it’s probably over for us too, now,” said Anthony Ruzicka, whose alfalfa and corn fields were filled with giant ice chunks. “Financially, how do you recover from something like this?” The Ruzickas were still tallying the losses to their cattle herd. They scrambled to move cows to neighboring farms before the dam burst last week, but at least 15 newborn calves perished, and they believe the death toll is much higher. “We didn’t know what to do with them. We never, ever expected anything like this,” Mr. Ruzicka said Monday. “We just ran out of time. It was either sacrifice them or sacrifice ourselves.” Crisis has grown all too familiar for some people in the region. In Knox County, Neb., Hannah Sucha, 25, helped coordinate efforts to deliver emergency supplies including minerals, antibiotics and salt blocks to farmers hurt by the floods. Just two years ago, Ms. Sucha said, farmers and ranchers in the area were busy donating bales of their hay to ranches in Kansas and Oklahoma devastated by wildfires. “It’s going to affect them for years,” Ms. Sucha said. “You’re not going to be able to sleep at night because you’ve got so much loss.” Farm experts said it was too early to quantify the full economic toll of the floods, but Steve Wellman, director of the Nebraska Department of Agriculture, said the disaster could cost the state’s livestock sector $400 million. Farm groups said it would take months or years to recover, and that residents across the region would need emergency federal aid. “You’ve got a generation of young farmers on the verge of leaving; you’ve got a lot of mental health stress out there — and that was before the storm,” said Roger Johnson, president of the National Farmers Union. “You just pile this on top.” As floodwaters slowly ebbed in some places on Monday, other cities, including Fargo, N.D., were getting sandbags ready and bracing for floods from rivers overflowing with snowmelt and late-winter rains. And farmers in flooded rural areas were just starting to calculate losses and consider whether they would be able to get their fields ready for spring planting. In Holt County, Neb., Jerry Kohl, a rancher with 1,600 mature cows and 5,000 yearlings, lost dozens of cows over the past week, a loss in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. As he looked across his 30,000 acres on Monday, he saw more water than dirt. Mr. Kohl said he had spoken by phone to more than a dozen other ranchers in the area in the past few days and concluded that the damage caused by floodwaters and the deep freeze that preceded the flooding would force a number of ranches out of business. “I’m struggling, but there are others who have it a lot worse,” he said. Mr. Kohl, 60, said he had not slept for more than two hours at a time in nearly a week and had not tried to leave his ranch. As much as 70 percent of the land in Holt County is flooded, he said; the roads and bridges to the south and north are washed-out. Farmers and ranchers also said they had lost miles of fences that pen in their livestock and bales of hay that feed them. Ranchers are reluctant to acknowledge the death of their animals and blame themselves when it happens. But Mr. Kohl said he had lost about 40 calves during twin calamities of subzero cold and flooding. He said his son, two daughters and four hired workers had toiled in shifts to save as many animals as they could. “We’re proud of raising cows and taking care of them,” he said. “We don’t like to admit to anyone we lost even one cow.” Farmers said the losses were especially troubling because many cows were giving birth at this time of year, and the newborn calves came just as the blizzards were blowing and floodwaters were rising. Calves born under such conditions were at immediate and dire risk, Mr. Kohl said. “If you didn’t pick it up in 10 minutes, she wasn’t going to make it,” he said. “And we had all those babies out there.” He said that each calf had to be taken by hand into one of his four heated sheds, which are large enough only for about 10 calves each. Mr. Kohl’s focus now is on cows that are rejecting their calves because they were separated from them for as many as four days. “That’s telling her body she doesn’t need to make milk,” he said. He said an old rancher’s trick to try to reunite mothers and their young was to rub vanilla on a cow’s nose and then liberally dose her calf with the same liquid. That mingling of the same smell, he said, often did the trick. The future for cows without calves to care for is a bleak one. So many calves have been lost that some ranchers have decided to cut their losses and sell them now, instead of caring for mature cows until they are pregnant again. As a result, prices have dropped precipitously, from about $1 a pound for a 1,100-pound cow to 60 cents a pound. A cow that would have fetched $1,000 is now only worth $600. “Everybody, me included, is going to show a loss,” Mr. Kohl said.",The New York Times

2019,‘It’s Time to Break the Chains.’ Algerians Seek a Revolution.,"ALGIERS — High above the sea in a heavily guarded villa, Algeria’s 82-year-old president, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, sits in a wheelchair — mute, paralyzed, barely able to move his hands. Hovered over by a flurry of attendants and family members, he has not uttered a single word in public, much less given a speech or interview, since a stroke in 2013. Twenty miles away in the capital, Algiers, tens of thousands of demonstrators fill the streets every week loudly demanding his departure, and that of the extensive, ill-defined entourage around him that Algerians call simply the “power,” the nexus of high-ranking officials, wealthy businessmen and military officers who actually run the country. The demonstrations, the largest in over 30 years, have grown larger every week and seem unstoppable. Algeria, the largest country in Africa and a rare pillar of stability in the Arab world, now faces an uncertain future. The protesters’ demands are unambiguous: After two decades of undivided reign, Mr. Bouteflika, his clan, and his system must go. “We feel like we’ve been violated for 20 years,” said Haid Mohamed Islam, a 27-year-old doctor standing outside the modernistic national library on a recent wind-swept day. “It’s time to break the chains.” While it remains far from clear what happens next, a sense that change is inevitable is sweeping the country. The protest has caught on across the country and among all classes of society, from bankers to bakers to truck drivers to teachers to waiters to students. “It is extraordinarily diverse,” said Nacer Djabi, a sociologist. An offer by Mr. Bouteflika that he would not run for a fifth term, which the government portrayed as a major concession, was roundly rebuffed by the protesters because it fell short of their demand that he step down immediately and because it appeared to leave him in office indefinitely. The episode seemed only to energize them. The government and the security forces, adept at swatting away the small protests that periodically erupt in Algeria, seem stymied. Its officials say they have ruled out firing on the protesters. And as the protesters’ numbers have grown, a violent response could backfire. Although it remains difficult to imagine the government yielding to the protesters, recently there have been positive signs of at least a tacit acceptance. State news media, at first barred from covering the protests, have begun reporting on them. “The Street Is Not Backing Down” was the banner headline in the daily Liberté on Wednesday. The ruling National Liberation Front and the army have joined the chorus of praise for the demonstrators, with the chief of staff hailing their “unequaled sense of civic responsibility.” “Just on its face, the dynamic is really very strong,” said Louisa Dris-Ait Hamadouche, a leading political scientist here, her words nearly drowned out by thousands protesting around her on Friday. For decades, Algeria was seen by allies on both sides of the Atlantic as a bulwark against the regional Islamist threat. After the army brutally crushed an Islamist insurgency in the 1990s, the military chose Mr. Bouteflika, a wily ex-foreign minister whose political roots go back to the earliest years of Algerian independence, to lead the country. Algerians welcomed the end of the nearly decade-long conflict and accepted Mr. Bouteflika with it, an arrangement made even easier as oil money began flowing freely in the early 2000s, and with it generous social benefits. In 2011, Algeria proudly rode out the Arab Spring, its leaders mocking the reckless, pro-democracy demonstrators in neighboring countries even as they shut the country off from the outside world. There are virtually no tourists here, and downtown Algiers is free of the international commercial brands seen elsewhere. Mr. Bouteflika also cloistered himself. According to journalists and political scientists here, he has never given an interview in the Algerian news media in his two decades in office. Since his stroke, even his body has disappeared: He has been replaced in public appearances by his framed portrait, known here as “the frame.” There were few complaints. Large public works programs and free loans to young people, financed by the country’s oil and gas wealth, kept citizens content and quiescent. A top member of the governing coalition, speaking on condition of anonymity to talk freely, said the Bouteflika system was built on patronage and corruption. With oil fetching high prices, “money flowed like water,” he said. “There was corruption in bidding. Easy bank loans. People got rich on public money.” But in 2014, the prices of oil and gas, which account for 97 percent of the country’s exports, started falling. Unemployment among the young bit deeply as the government cut social benefits. Last month, when Mr. Bouteflika announced he would run for a fifth term, the bottom fell out. Algerians had had enough of his system, and his physical incapacity became a metaphor for the withering country. Ordinary Algerians, in the grimy downtown streets where great chunks of plaster are peeling from the Haussmann-style buildings, in the shabby cafes made shabbier by five years of fluctuating oil prices, and in the mass demonstrations, say there is no going back. “They thought that because we were quiet, we were stupid,” said Rabah Bouberras, 32, a shopkeeper from the suburbs who was demonstrating in Algiers on Friday. “But the people are not going to forgive them. We’re not hungry. It’s a question of dignity.” Corruption has become a major grievance. “In my sector it’s flagrant,” said Abdenour Hadjici, a sales manager for a plaster company. “There are certain people that are favored.” A builder he knows, for instance, got a cheap loan because he knows a high-placed general, he said. But it is the central demand of the protesters, that the whole Bouteflika system must go, that would be hardest to satisfy, government insiders and analysts here say. “The clan that governs this country isn’t going to just let go just like that,” said Zoubir Arous, a leading sociologist, as he watched a stream of chanting youth, many draped in the Algerian flag, march on a downtown street. “It’s a question of life or death for them.” And “the system” is wider than Mr. Bouteflika and his cronies. Eliminating it would require purging a tentacular web of corruption encompassing thousands of people and built up over years. “Everybody’s been co-opted,” said Mr. Djabi, the sociologist. “It was, ‘Come with me, and you will have everything.’” Inside the gargantuan marbled government buildings constructed with oil money, there is worry and hesitation. Officials, stunned by the size of the demonstrations, insist occult forces are guiding them. The demonstrations have been taken over by opposition politicians, they say, or Islamists, though there is little evidence of either at the demonstrations. The officials are bewildered at the absence of leaders among the protesters, and at the total rejection of the government’s offers. “They’re saying, all those who are part of the system have to go, but that’s excommunication,” exclaimed a top official, who declined to be quoted by name. “We recognize that there are reasons for frustration. But does that justify calling into question everything that has come before?” There is also the question of who is really in charge and who has the authority to negotiate with the protesters. Mr. Bouteflika is said to be barely able to speak, though top officials and friends insist that he is lucid and capable of dispensing directives. “He’s in control of his faculties, 100 percent,” Lakhdar Brahimi, a former United Nations negotiator and friend of Mr. Bouteflika’s, said in an interview here this past week. He said he had recently seen the president, whom he has known since they were young revolutionaries together in the early 1960s. “Still, the fact is, he’s disappeared from the scene,” Mr. Brahimi said. “And that creates a problem.” Revolution has a cherished place in Algerian memory, and the victory over France almost 60 years ago is enshrined in national pride. In the late 20th century, Algeria was a global archetype of third world revolution and ground zero for revolutionaries from the Black Panthers to the African National Congress. Now France is watching events here anxiously from across the Mediterranean. Home to an Algerian diaspora in the millions, France is already reckoning with the boatloads of young would-be migrants who attempt the dangerous crossing. The protesters say rising up against oppression is a hallowed national tradition. “Our parents made the revolution,” said Hassen Khelifati, 51, a prosperous insurance executive who has participated in the demonstrations. “For us, at least we will be able to say, we tried. We can’t just say to our children, we were cowards.” He is joined on the streets by a banker, Mallem Amel, 25. “There’s been this consciousness raising,” she said. “We can’t stay in this situation.” And a doctor, Zaidi Hamza, 26. “The Algerian people want a radical change,” he said. “There isn’t a single category in the population that will negotiate with them.” They say they will fight to the end. “We’re not afraid of a blood bath,” said Zohir Geurroumi, a 23-year-old law student. “This isn’t for us. It’s for our descendants.”",The New York Times
2019,‘I’d Die of Guilt if I Did That’: Families Who Hired College Consultants Discuss Where They Drew the Line,"When paying for admissions help is a standard practice in a community, parents and children say they feel pressure to keep up. The F.B.I.’s indictment on Tuesday of 50 people who were accused of participating in a scheme to secure college admissions through bribes renewed a national debate over the role that money plays in college admissions. Wealthy parents can lawfully grease the admissions paths of their children by making large donation to colleges. And many parents — wealthy or not — hire college admissions consultants to help their children identify schools to apply to and complete their applications. We asked parents and applicants who have enlisted the help of a consultant why they felt the need to do so, if it helped and if they had any ethical quandaries. Many of the more than 500 who responded defended the practice of paying for services to help their child get into college. Others questioned the entire system. “In retrospect, everything I did was misguided and unethical,” wrote one parent from Los Angeles. Here is a selection of their responses, which have been lightly edited and condensed for clarity. As our daughter started the college application process last year, we realized that we were completely ignorant about how it had changed. Of course we told her that her life outcome would be fine if she went to the University of Washington, but she wanted to see what she could do. We paid a very savvy counselor $2,000 to advise our daughter how to choose which colleges to put on her list, and how to make the most of her essay. Our daughter took a total of 13 AP classes in high school. She managed a 3.9 GPA with this course load and got top AP test scores. That, along with an SAT score of 1490, seemed solid to us, but the counselor said she was on the edge at some of the elite schools she was dreaming of, including our alma mater, Swarthmore, as well as Yale and Wesleyan. The counselor also helped with the essay, mostly just providing edits. We were completely hands-off, and have still never seen the essay. Our daughter had to put in the hard work, and in the end, she applied Early Decision to Swarthmore and was admitted. The flagrant bribery and conspiracy of those indicted in the admissions scandal is a personal insult to families with students who seek admittance through sheer grit. We find it baffling that parents would demonstrate to their children that in life major accomplishments can be purchased with cash, rather than earned through hard work and commitment. — Brendan Works and Kirsten Wild, Seattle We engaged the services of an admissions company in Pittsburgh for my son, and they could not have been more professional. The counselor at our public high school was swamped and had no expertise or interest in college admissions advising for students on academic tracks. The private counselor walked our son through the application process, but our son did all of the work himself. They just kept him on deadline and focused on the goal, as he was not a self-starter. I also respected that they tried to match each student to a school that best fit their abilities and interests, not necessarily an Ivy. We were fortunate that we could afford $3,000 for this service, but the payoff was beyond our wildest dreams. Our son ended up getting a full scholarship to a great university (Drexel in Philadelphia) that had a new department in his area of interest (sport management). We purchased a legitimate service, and our son got into school on his own merits. — Jane Freund, Pittsburgh My daughter hired a local consultant who basically helped with her essay and with targeting which schools would be most likely to accept her. My daughter is at the school she legitimately earned a right to be in, and she’s proud and happy. We could have afforded to pay $15,000 like Felicity Huffman — but I’d die of guilt if I did that. The type of fraud which these people indulged in is outrageous but not surprising in a world obsessed with labels. They are depriving another student of an opportunity! It’s a disgrace! — Jyoti Minocha, Vienna, Va. We had a consultant who legitimately helped identify schools that were likely to give merit scholarships, that my son would be able to get into based on his credentials, and had strength in the field of study he was interested in. She also helped us stay on task and meet deadlines. We understand the privilege and social collateral that our socioeconomic status affords us. I am a first generation college graduate in my family. It would not be consistent with our values to use our privilege to gain access that was not legitimately accessible. — Dianna Howard, Winston-Salem, N.C. It wasn’t so much my consultant who helped me — I actually despised her for telling me all the places she (wrongly) thought I wasn’t competitive. But she did find me an SAT tutor who, at the cost of what I’m sure amounted to thousands if not tens of thousands of dollars, raised my score over 200 points. It was clear to my high school self we were paying this women a lot of money. It was apparent that most of America didn’t have this service, and that felt unfair, which of course it was. But it wasn’t unethical per se. By that, I mean it wasn’t illegal or even vaguely underhanded. I believe the college admissions process is unfair to the disadvantaged or lesser-advantaged, but at the end of the day, the system is what it is, and I had a goal I worked hard to achieve. I don’t feel my family or I did anything wrong by seeking professional input and tutoring. I think the issue arises when people believe in the myth of their own excellence when the reality is that from an early age your admissions prospects — and life prospects — are shaped by factors outside your control. — Zach Dubin, San Francisco My family hired a former MIT admissions counselor. We paid him $15,000 to give a three-day workshop on how to optimize ourselves for admissions, and we had weekly calls with him to edit my admissions essays. He was a cruel person, denigrated me often during our class, and he made me break down in the fall of my senior year. But his general advice was useful, and it may have contributed to me writing the correct style of essay to get into a prestigious STEM university. He, as a former admissions counselor, gave us the insider look on how MIT admissions work. I’m not sure if we should have had that information. Otherwise, there was no foul play. — Alexander Cui, Pasadena, Calif. My parents both went to Ivies, they had me enroll in test prep, hired guidance counselors and paid for the best summer programs. Our family wagon was plastered with stickers from their and my sibling’s Ivy League alma maters. It was clear the goal was bragging rights and not my happiness. So did a consultant try to help me? Yes. Did it work? No. I cracked under the pressure. I became the black sheep when I went to a perfectly acceptable state school in New England. My parents refused to attend my graduation. Today I run a successful business in a foreign country while raising a child alone. What we really need to evaluate is how we measure success in life and what really brings happiness. (Hint: it’s not money from a fancy degree.) — Alexandra Hutchings, Paris My intelligent son with learning disabilities endured a grueling college prep high school, endless test prep and the experience of hearing his life recounted to him in college application essays written largely by me. He endured it to get into the college of my and his father’s choice. Then, after a miserable and aimless two months, he bravely dropped out of the college he never wanted to go to. He has decided to pursue a path his parents cannot game. He is going to the Army. In retrospect, everything I did was misguided and unethical. My son had no interest in college but my narcissism couldn’t take it. It’s a bad scene when the military looks like the more ethical option to a young man than the hypocrisy and total madness of the admissions racket. — Margaret Cranston, Los Angeles A note to readers who are not subscribers: This article from the Reader Center does not count toward your monthly free article limit.

2019,‘I’m Not Here’ Review: J.K. Simmons Stars in a Superficial Study of Regret,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. “I’m Not Here” makes reference to Schrödinger’s cat, which was simultaneously alive and not alive until observed. Watching “I’m Not Here” doesn’t bring it to life as a movie, any more than the screenplay’s allusions to quantum entanglement add novelty to its fragmentary structure or its hollow insights about regret. The “I” of the title is Steve, played at age 60 by J.K. Simmons (who is married to the director, Michelle Schumacher). An inveterate alcoholic who lives alone and disheveled, Steve learns that the love of his life, Karen, has died. Steve searches his memories. As a child (Iain Armitage), he watched his parents (Mandy Moore and Max Greenfield) endure a bitter divorce. As a young man (Sebastian Stan), he had a whirlwind romance with Karen (Maika Monroe) that ran into trouble after their marriage. In one of the better scenes, a judge (Tony Cummings), trying to determine custody of young Steve, summons the boy to his chambers and asks him questions, telling him to put jelly beans on a scale, with one side representing his mother and the other his father. The plot treats revelations like the jelly beans; each new detail provides a false impression of balance. The minute you think Steve’s father is irredeemable, that Karen is a saint or that Steve could never go dry, another flashback will change that perception. But while the film aspires to a clipped complexity, it comes across as gimmicky and amateurish — a chain of miseries passed off as tough truths.

2019,‘I’m Not a Fascist’: E.U. Leader Apologizes for Comments on Mussolini’s Legacy,"The president of the European Parliament apologized on Thursday after he said that Benito Mussolini, Italy’s fascist former leader, had done positive things despite leading his country into war and installing a totalitarian regime. “As a convinced anti-fascist, I apologize to all those who may have been offended by what I said, which in no way intends to justify or play down an antidemocratic and totalitarian regime,” the president, Antonio Tajani, said in a statement. His apology followed a radio interview on Wednesday in which he appeared to offer a positive slant on Mussolini’s dictatorship. “I’m not a fascist, I was never a fascist, and I don’t share his political convictions,” Mr. Tajani told Radio 24, an Italian broadcaster. “But we have to be honest: Mussolini built roads, bridges, buildings, sports facilities; he has developed many parts of our Italy.” “Until he declared war on the whole world by following Hitler, until he became a promoter of the racial laws, apart from the dramatic Matteotti case,” Mr. Tajani added, “he did positive things.” Giacomo Matteotti was a socialist politician who was murdered by fascists in 1924 for denouncing electoral fraud and violence. Mr. Tajani’s comments came after a year of heightened debate about Mussolini’s legacy, 80 years after the fascist leader’s regime introduced Nazi-like anti-Semitic laws. Fascination with Mussolini’s rise and regime seems to persist. A book about the dictator, called “M,” by Antonio Scurati, found a huge audience after it was published last year. Critics said the book resurrected the cult of the leader. And “I’m Back,” a feature-length comedy that imagined Mussolini’s modern-day return to become a TV and YouTube sensation, caused a stir last year. (It was an adaptation of a German film, “Look Who’s Back,” which was based on a satirical novel in which Hitler reappears.) Mussolini’s memory has also been summoned in the political arena. Matteo Salvini, Italy’s deputy prime minister and the leader of the right-wing League party, sometimes quotes from the dictator. Neo-fascist groups regularly hold marches across the country. Mr. Tajani’s comments drew immediate criticism from Italy and across Europe. “Unbelievable quotes from Tajani on Mussolini,” Udo Bullmann, the leader of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, wrote on Twitter. “How can a president of the European Parliament fail to acknowledge the nature of fascism?” The National Association of Italian Partisans, an anti-fascist organization, issued a statement that drew attention to Mussolini’s crimes, for example in Ethiopia, “where entire innocent populations — children, women and men — were murdered with poison gas.” The association said that Mr. Tajani’s original comments defending Mussolini’s legacy were “trite, superficial and typical of those who want to justify a regime like fascism” that propelled Italy into World War II “and caused millions of deaths.” Mr. Tajani had initially defended his comments. “Shame on those who manipulate what I’ve allegedly said on fascism,” he said on Twitter on Wednesday, before changing course. Mr. Tajani has made divisive comments about Italy’s wartime legacy before. Last month, at a memorial service in Basovizza, Italy, he said “Long live Italian Istria and Italian Dalmatia.” Both of those regions have been territories of Italy at various times, including during World War II, but are today part of Croatia and Slovenia, where his comments prompted outrage and calls for Mr. Tajani to resign.",The New York Times
2019,‘Jean-Michel Basquiat’ at the Brant Shows His Bifurcated Life,"Critic’s Pick A few years ago, a plaza in Paris was named after the artist Jean-Michel Basquiat, the Brooklyn-born painter who became a global sensation in the early 1980s and died at 27 of a heroin overdose. No similar honor has been bestowed upon Basquiat by the City of New York. However, the opening of the Brant Foundation Art Study Center in the East Village, with an exhibition of nearly 70 works by Basquiat created from 1980 to 1987, serves as a fitting temporary shrine. The Brant in Manhattan is also part of a wave of private museums opening across the country, including the Hill Art Foundation in Chelsea; the expansion of Glenstone in Maryland; and the Marciano and Broad collections in Los Angeles. But first, Basquiat. The story of this painter of Haitian and Puerto-Rican descent is one of the most documented in contemporary art history. Basquiat moved to Manhattan — partly to escape his strict accountant father — couch-surfed, lived off girlfriends and formed a post-punk band called Gray after “Gray’s Anatomy.” He sprayed poetic, enigmatic graffiti on walls in downtown Manhattan before moving to canvas and starred in an independent film, “Downtown 81.” He dated Madonna before she was famous and made paintings with his hero-turned-friend, Andy Warhol. Basquiat was also part of a group of Neo-Expressionists that were largely rejected by critics interested in photography, video and conceptual art — but embraced by a popular audience and a surging art market, where he often felt treated like a faux-primitive genius, which he found racist and demeaning. And yet, this seemed to fuel his work — and the anger in it — toward greater heights, forging a brand of African-American history painting that addressed everything from cultural figures to black policemen. His reputation has grown posthumously and in 2017 one of his paintings sold at auction for a record $110.5 million to a Japanese billionaire. The show at the Brant Foundation, organized with the Fondation Louis Vuitton in Paris, where more than half of the works here were recently on view, fairly represents Basquiat’s contribution. He concentrated on the human figure and many of the works are grouped for heightened effect. One room is dedicated to paintings of boxers — Sugar Ray Robinson, Joe Louis, and Cassius Clay (later Muhammad Ali) — while another features loosely drawn heads and skulls. And yes, the $110.5 million painting is in the building: a ferocious “Untitled” (1982) skull made with black and colored spray paint and oilstick against a banal blue background. Other paintings pay homage to jazz greats like Miles Davis and Charlie Parker (Basquiat worked in a similarly improvisatory way) and handwritten text appears everywhere. Basquiat favored the cutup technique of the Beat writer William Burroughs but he also witnessed the rise of rap and hip-hop music. His words feel eerily poignant today: “debt shrine,” “per capita,” “Hooverville,” “perishable,” “black teeth,” “immortality.” Others relate to histories from the Roman Empire to “Grillo” (1984), which mentions sugar and the West Indies and sports heavy nails like those driven into minkisi power figures in Africa to cast spells or seal contracts. Crossed-out words also recur in his paintings and are weirdly reminiscent of the bracketing or slashing of text in deconstructionist philosophy, to emphasize the cultural and biased nature of language. Funny to realize in retrospect that Basquiat and the French philosopher Jacques Derrida were on the same page. Notable works include “Unbreakable” (1987), a late painting in which the human figure is mostly banished — the work has never been shown in New York. The wry “Hollywood Africans” (1983), on loan from the Whitney Museum, includes text like “gangsterism,” “tax free,” “200 yen” and “sugar cane, inc.,” linking up creativity, race and corruption. A dramatic salon-style wall on the second floor includes a grid of 16 paintings from 1982, on wooden supports constructed by Basquiat’s studio assistant. So why open the Manhattan branch of the Brant with Basquiat? Peter M. Brant, a newsprint tycoon, was an early collector and the East Village was Basquiat’s old stamping grounds. The new Brant, an urban outpost of the Greenwich, Conn., institution, is in a former Con Edison power substation lavishly remodeled by the architects Gluckman Tang which was also, for several decades, the home and studio of the artist Walter De Maria, who was best known for “The Lightning Field” (1977) in the New Mexico desert. Gluckman Tang has preserved the “bones” of the building — sturdy beige brick walls and sleek industrial staircases — and opened up rear-facing walls with windows that provide light and spectacular views of the neighborhood. The building includes four floors of exhibition space and a rooftop garden with a reflecting pool visible as a glittering skylight on the fourth floor. Nestled among old tenement buildings, the location feels very similar to Lafayette Anticipations in Paris, a new multistory foundation related to the nearby department store. Both institutions serve as emblems of the gentrification of former working- class neighborhoods, but also the proliferation of a new kind of museum. Private collections have long histories — for instance, the Frick and the Morgan in New York — but also, at present, carry a double-edged meaning and purpose: They are private exhibition venues but also tax havens for the very rich. Mr. Brant was on the forefront of this phenomenon — both the private institution showcasing contemporary art and trouble with the IRS — when his foundation opened a decade ago across the street from his estate in Greenwich. One of the arguments in support of the East Village space is that it offers free admission to see works that are rarely on view — although you have to make reservations, which are quickly becoming scarce. And the “free” admission to most of these private museums is the ultimate hidden-fee-economy tactic: We are all paying, in a variety of ways, to live in a system that supports colossal disparities of wealth. Museum admission might be free, but health care isn’t. Interestingly, Basquiat’s work speaks exactly to these issues, but in somewhat coded form. It’s an old, old story: the black artist (or musician) who makes raw, personal work and sells it to a rich white person. There is something that feels almost not right about looking too long at a Basquiat because it’s like looking into an open wound. He didn’t go to art school (except for a few life-drawing classes) to learn this because it’s way beyond art, which is the best kind of art. But the words in Basquiat’s paintings often point to what it’s like to be turned into a masterpiece, a financial instrument, and a trophy. The show at the Brant doesn’t wade directly into this but the Guggenheim will, in an exhibition opening in June that focuses on the response of visual artists, including Basquiat, to the death of Michael Stewart, a young graffiti artist who lapsed into a coma while in the custody of New York transit officers in 1983. (The officers were acquitted by a jury). ”It could’ve been me,” Basquiat said. Instead, Basquiat continued on, living a bifurcated life in which his work was highly valued but his existence, he even stated, was not. I stopped trekking up to the Brant Foundation in Greenwich because the program there didn’t reflect the art I wanted to engage with. It was overwhelmingly male, white and approached through the triumph of the market — what’s hot and expensive — rather than a more critical prism. The current show presents Basquiat in a gorgeous, former-industrial space — but there are already dozens of fantastic, adventurous and experimental spaces in the area. Perhaps one way private and public museums can work together is this: Private ones offer more opportunities to see work that has been highly (or over) valued, rather than stowing it away in free ports or elsewhere, while public institutions do the difficult, scholarly work we expect. (The Brant advertises itself as a “study center,” but it’s not clear yet what is going to be studied.) How the Brant will coexist with this context remains to be seen. It’s great to see Basquiat in the East Village — although, with its new condominiums, steep rents, and expensive restaurants, it barely resembles the neighborhood he inhabited 40 years ago. This exhibition will bring joy to a lot of people. The questions and complications it contains will reach far beyond Sixth Street and the art world.",The New York Times
2019,‘Juanita’ Review: A Heartfelt Rallying Cry for Black Women Sabbaticals,"Streaming Movie Review When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. It has been over 20 years since the debut of “How Stella Got Her Groove Back,” and even now, taking a sabbatical from life’s routine challenges is still portrayed as something only white female protagonists get to do (think Julia Roberts in “Eat Pray Love” or Reese Witherspoon in “Wild”). According to cinema, black women are too strong and too resilient to abandon their many obligations. They don’t suddenly bus it out of the city and away from their demanding families, as does the titular character in “Juanita,” a Netflix Original film directed by Clark Johnson. That makes Juanita (Alfre Woodard) a bit of a rebel. Exhausted with no time to herself, Juanita spends most of her days working an unfulfilling job, babysitting her granddaughter and visiting her son in jail. She can’t even get a reprieve in her dreams, in which she concocts a shirtless Blair Underwood kissing her feet. He, too, asks to borrow money. So one day she jumps on a Greyhound to a town called Butte (hilarious mispronunciations ensue), in Montana, in search of some peace of mind. There, she meets a real-life younger man (Adam Beach), a chef at a local diner, whose charm and warm smile give her excursion an even deeper meaning. On the surface, “Juanita” is a fantasy that gives its older black heroine permission to chase her happiness, whatever that may be (the narrative wonderfully portrays it simply as elsewhere). But even more than that, the film is a testament to how necessary and urgent it is for black women to embark on purely selfish adventures in order to rediscover themselves. Although “Juanita” teeters off track a bit with the chef’s half-baked back story, it soars when it allows its lead to explore the complexities of love and unbridled joy. And Woodard completely owns it. When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. OpinionKate Murphy",The New York Times
2019,‘Keeping Up With the Kardashians’ Returns With Its New Star … Kanye West?,"As the KUWTK trailer promises, Mr. Kim Kardashian is ready to share his feelings with you. For the return of “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” this weekend, we spoke with each of the five Kardashian-Jenner sisters — that’s Kourtney, Kim, and Khloé Kardashian, and Kendall and Kylie Jenner — about their entwined and individual businesses. One family member that makes a notable impression in the new season is Kim Kardashian’s husband, Kanye West. He’ll appear more regularly on the show — and, for the first time, he’ll be doing direct-to-camera “confessionals.” He also helped design the looks for the whole gang. Kanye frequently texts with the show’s producers, we learned — he redid the slightly 1970s aesthetic and clad the sisters in nude and silver. “He’s a real creative force, clearly, and had thoughts on marketing, thoughts on presentation of the show, on the opening title sequence,” Adam Stotsky, the president of E!, told us. At home, Kim told us, there’s a “mood board” that she and Kanye play with all the time. It’s where they put visual ideas they like, changes they’ll want to Kim’s cosmetic, fragrance and accessory lines. Kim doesn’t just put her name on things: she helps design products and packaging too — making changes when Kanye weighs in. He also, we learned, once asked Kim not to do an Instagram sponsored post from a fast fashion company that he said had ripped him off. But she didn’t lose the income — sort of. “He wrote me a check for that amount and said ‘Thank you so much for always being supportive and not posting,’” she said. “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” returns for season 16 on Sunday, March 31, at 9 p.m. Eastern/Pacific and 8 p.m. Central.

2019,‘Knife + Heart’ Review: Gay Porn and Murder in ’70s Paris,"Critic’s Pick When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. “Knife + Heart” opens with a gay-bar pickup in 1979 Paris that culminates in a grisly murder, committed by a man wearing a seriously scary mask. The French director Yann Gonzalez summons not just William Friedkin’s notorious 1980 thriller “Cruising,” but near-countless European giallos featuring faceless killers. His second feature is a not quite nostalgic evocation of dangerous gay living in the pre-AIDS era. Vanessa Paradis, in one of her most striking film roles since 1999’s “The Girl on the Bridge,” plays Anne, an alcoholic producer of gay porn who’s a mess since breaking up with Loïs (Kate Moran), her intrepid editor. Drunk dialing her ex yields no success in appealing to Loïs’s heart. So Anne moves to impress her artistically, initiating a film project she intends to be several cuts above her usual fare. She enthuses to her director that she’ll draw a hunky cast from “the common people,” which prompts the response, “Who are you, Zola?” At the same time, a series of murders committed with a sex toy that contains a knife blade is reducing her repertory company. This movie packs in plenty of cinema acrobatics and spectacle without ever feeling out of control, even as it morphs into a far-fetched whodunit. Gonzalez contains his love of screen excess with a deliberation that never feels contrived or cheap. His depiction of the porn-making world is affectionate without ever flinching from squirmy details (such as a fluffer whose nickname is “Bouche d’Or”). The movie is an apt, and not at all unserious, example of queer cinema at its most playful.

2019,‘Lady J’ Review: The Aristocratic Art of Getting Even,"Streaming Movie Review When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. Revenge is a dish best served when the victim least expects it. And what better place to serve it than in a period drama with splendid candy-colored costumes, spindly gilded furniture and exquisitely coifed characters? “Lady J” (a.k.a. “Mademoiselle de Joncquières”), on Netflix, has the delicious feel of a fable set in 18th-century France, among idle aristocrats who entertain themselves by arranging flowers and betrayals. Written and directed by Emmanuel Mouret (“The Art of Love” and “Another Life”) and based on a plot by Denis Diderot, “Lady J” stars Cécile de France as Madame de la Pommeraye, a wealthy, pretty widow living on a vast estate with perfectly barbered trees. She has acquired a houseguest, the Marquis des Arcis (Edouard Baer), who is determined to win her heart (or something), even if that pursuit keeps him far from his business for months. Madame de la Pommeraye knows him as a serial womanizer, yet she falls prey to him, enchanted by the idea of a boundless passion. Soon her chateau becomes his chateau. And here our suspension of disbelief wears thin, for, rake though the Marquis may be, he is portrayed as a scruffy sort, and what he lacks in sartorial finesse he also lacks in charm. However did he seduce Madame? As we might expect from a man in the Marquis’s mold, this relationship is temporary. Soon, the slightest distraction is enough to draw him away from his latest love. Cleverly, she stays one step ahead, disguising her humiliation by concluding at the same moment he does that their connection is no more than a friendship. She cultivates him and patiently seeks the perfect instrument for his undoing, seizings on the unfortunate — and extremely young — Mademoiselle de Joncquières (Alice Isaaz), who looks like the incarnation of purity. With the promise of rewards, Madame de la Pommeraye lures her and her mother (Natalia Dontcheva), from the brothel that employs them and sets her trap for the Marquis. Mouret manipulates our sympathies effortlessly as the story zigzags its way from there to its ultimately surprising and quite satisfying resolution.

2019,‘Leaving Neverland’ Deepens Shadow Over 2003 Michael Jackson Interview,"Critic’s Notebook In 2003, the “King of Pop” gave a strange, on-brand performance in “Living With Michael Jackson,” a 90-minute television special hosted by the British journalist Martin Bashir. Part documentary, part “Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous,” this program seemed to demonstrate just how out of touch with reality Jackson was. Among other things, he insisted that he’d only had two cosmetic surgeries in his life — a claim that seemed silly at best, even to a lifelong M.J. fan like me. Then there was a 13-year-old boy whom Jackson had befriended. The boy defended sleeping in the singer’s bed at Jackson’s Neverland Ranch, at one point in the interview resting his head on Jackson’s shoulder as the star declared, “The most loving thing to do is share your bed with someone.” For some, this rang alarm bells; months after the special aired, the police began a criminal investigation, which led to Jackson’s being charged on several counts, including child molestation involving the 13-year-old. But in 2005, a jury found him not guilty in a trial in which the former child star Macaulay Culkin and another witness named Wade Robson testified that they had spent many nights with Jackson and had not been abused. It was easy for many fans to categorize that uneasy conversation from “Living With Michael Jackson” not as criminal, but as just another example of the singer’s disconnect. That isn’t possible for me anymore. I came away from “Leaving Neverland,” a new two-part HBO documentary in which Robson and James Safechuck accuse Jackson of having molested them when they were children, fully convinced by their stories. (The 13-year-old did not participate in the documentary, but his presence looms over it in news footage and as a figure Robson says he now wishes he could have been a “comrade” to during the trial.) A subsequent rewatch of that conversation with Bashir left me feeling mortified, in a way I probably should have felt long ago. Perhaps even more difficult to digest than the very explicit details of the abuse Robson and Safechuck describe in “Neverland” are the indelible effects that persisted into adulthood. In “Living With Michael Jackson,” the way Jackson speaks about the physical abuse he suffered as a child at the hands of his father, Joseph, only lends more credence to Robson’s and Safechuck’s stories. The three seemed to process their individual traumas in similar ways. Since January, when “Leaving Neverland” debuted at the Sundance Film Festival, Jackson’s superfans, his family and his estate have tried to poke holes in Safechuck’s and Robson’s stories. During an interview with Gayle King that aired last week, Michael’s brother Marlon wondered, “If Neverland was so horrifying” for Robson and Safechuck, “why would you keep going back?” [Michael Jackson’s fans are tenacious. | Our critic Wesley Morris reviews the documentary.] “Leaving Neverland” answers that question compellingly. In Part 2, Robson recalls the strong emotional bond toward Jackson he still felt as an adult, a closeness cemented when he was 7 and first met the star. Robson, 22 at the time of the trial, says in the film he was “excited at the idea of being able to defend him and being able to save him.” He says he had nightmares of seeing Jackson in jail, and adds that he wasn’t yet ready to see himself as a victim. “I still loved him deeply,” said Robson. And as his wife, Amanda, says in “Leaving Neverland,” “Love is powerful.” In discussing patterns of abuse in relationships, many psychologists and researchers point out that victims commonly do not recognize their abuse as what it is and remain close to those who hurt them. Jackson showered Safechuck and Robson with attention and presented himself as a child trapped in a grown man’s body. When such an intimate relationship is established, as Safechuck and Robson say was the case with Jackson, the memories of happier feelings can overwhelm the toxic ones. In countering Robson and Safechuck’s claims in “Neverland,” Marlon and others in the Jackson family gravitate toward the idea that children who were actually abused by Michael would not maintain a long-term relationship with him. Paradoxically, many Jackson siblings have long undermined their own argument, sticking by their notoriously violent and controlling father in public. For decades, stories of the physical and mental harm Joseph inflicted on his children have been integral to the Jacksons’ own family mythos, often cited as the key to their success. Understanding of how corporal punishment affects children has largely evolved across generations, and many today consider it a form of abuse. Joseph’s methods certainly seemed to cross a boundary. In “Living With Michael Jackson,” Michael describes being hit with belts, electrical cords, “whatever was around.” He tells Bashir that he and his siblings were “terrified” by the mere presence of Joseph, and he admitted to having a “strong hate” for him. In an interview with Piers Morgan from 2011, Michael’s sister Janet remembered being younger than 8 when Joseph hit her. In 1991, their sister LaToya Jackson caused a stir when she said she had been sexually abused by Joseph. Although they have acknowledged the trauma, some of the siblings — including Janet in her self-help book “True You”— have defended Joseph as being “old-school,” and like any other parent of that “spare the rod, spoil the child” era. Janet confessed to Morgan that she wished her relationship with her father had been different, yet she added, “I know that he loves me.” During her tour last summer, she dedicated her song “Together Again” to Joseph, who died in June 2018. LaToya remembered their father in part by saying she was “extremely appreciative” of the way he “disciplined us.” Michael told Bashir: “I totally forgive him for all of it. You have to.” That discussion of Jackson’s childhood might be the most honest moment in the bizarre Bashir special. When Jackson is asked to recall what it was like to be subjected to Joseph’s beatings, the camera zooms closer on his face. He tenses up, letting out an uncomfortable chuckle as he briefly looks away. Jackson winces. He describes his father as presiding over rehearsals with a belt in his hand, and hitting the brothers with it if they missed a dance step. “He would tear you up,” Jackson says, adding that it made all of the siblings “nervous.” “How often would he beat you?” Bashir asks. Jackson winces again, answering softly, “Too much.” The pop star’s pain is palpable and raw; a childhood cut short is evident. The internalized shame and disconnect Jackson showed with Bashir — he seems to suggest that calling his father’s actions abuse is wrong — were mirrored in what Robson and Safechuck said. Held up together, the testimonies of all three make it even easier for me to believe Robson and Safechuck’s stories about Michael. Years later, their pain in “Leaving Neverland” is also palpable and raw. “It still feels shameful,” Safechuck reveals in the final minutes of the documentary. “I still have — feelings that it was my fault.” As he says this, his mannerisms echo Jackson’s — the same wince, the same pain of having to relive a distressing time in his life.",The New York Times
2019,‘Leaving Neverland’ Part 2 Recap: ‘The Abuse Was a Bomb That Dropped in Our Lives’,"In Part 1 of “Leaving Neverland,” two men, Wade Robson and James Safechuck, describe in disturbing detail how they were drawn into Michael Jackson’s orbit when they were boys, and then how he repeatedly used them for sex. In the second half, which aired on HBO Monday night, the boys have grown older and Jackson moves on from them. But their ordeals are not over. Robson and Safechuck describe how their experiences with Jackson left them in tatters, even years later. We meet Robson’s wife, Amanda, and Safechuck’s wife, Laura. We hear that both men became fathers. Safechuck talks about the self-hatred he feels, and his wife recounts his battle with depression. Robson, too, says he became deeply depressed and almost fully retreated from the world. “They say time heals all wounds,” Safechuck said. “But I don’t think time heals this one. It just gets worse.” [Read a recap of Part 1/Our critic Wesley Morris reviews the documentary.] Jackson’s family and estate have denied all the allegations against him. “The facts don’t lie, people do,” the family said in a statement. “Michael Jackson was and always will be 100 percent innocent of these false allegations.” Many Jackson fans have risen to his defense on Twitter, often noting how both men previously testified that the singer had never abused them, a point the men address in Part 2. Here are some other key takeaways from the second half of the documentary: In 1993, Jackson was investigated after a 13-year-old boy accused him of abuse, and both Safechuck and Robson spoke up for Jackson. They told their families that Jackson had never touched them and said the same to law enforcement officials. “As soon as the cop started asking me these questions, the first thing that came to mind for me was everything that Michael started saying to me when I was 7,” said Robson, who was 11 at the time. “If anyone ever found out that we were doing any of these sort of things, these sexual things, that he and I would go to jail for the rest of our lives. It was terrifying.” After having been being fairly absent from the boys’ lives for some time, Jackson was back in regular touch, they said, because he needed them. Safechuck said he rehearsed a law-enforcement interview with Jackson’s lawyers. Whatever the police said, he was instructed to say “no”; if he gave them nothing, they would have nothing. Jackson reached a $23 million settlement in 1994 with the family of his accuser, who then declined to testify. No charges were filed at the time. Joy Robson, Wade’s mother, said she took that as a sign that there had been no truth to the accusations, that the boy’s family had just been out for money. A couple of years later, Robson said, Jackson summoned him one day, and then had sex with him. The next day, he said, Jackson told Robson to get rid of his underwear because it might contain evidence. In 2003, Jackson was investigated again. But this time, child molestation charges were filed and he was brought to trial. Jackson asked Safechuck to testify on his behalf. “I was kind of breaking, like having a nervous breakdown,” Safechuck said. “And I didn’t want to be involved.” He told Jackson no. He said that Jackson responded by threatening him, saying he had the best lawyers in the world, but Safechuck said he stood firm. Jackson asked again toward the end of the trial, but Safechuck still refused. He said that was the last time he and Jackson spoke. [Michael Jackson’s fans are tenacious/“Leaving Neverland” could imperil the fortunes of the Jackson estate] Robson said he was reluctant at first, but he did testify. At that point in his life, he was a successful choreographer in his early 20s working with some of the biggest acts in the world, like ’N Sync and Britney Spears. He said that he wishes now he had been at a place where he could have told the truth. “The idea of this truth coming out and Amanda knowing about it,” Robson said of the woman he would eventually marry, “and my family knowing about it, and everybody in the entertainment business, in my career knowing about it, I mean, was just a ridiculous idea that was never going to happen in my mind. Because in my mind, my whole life would be over.” Jackson was found not guilty of all the charges against him. Four years later, he died at the age of 50 from a mix of powerful drugs he had been administered for sleep deprivation. (His doctor, Conrad Murray, was convicted of involuntary manslaughter.) When Safechuck decided not to testify, he asked his parents not to do so either. He told his mother that Jackson “wasn’t a good person,” he said, and that he didn’t want them involved. His mother, Stephanie, understood what he meant. “I danced when I heard that he died,” Stephanie Safechuck said of Jackson. “‘Oh thank God, he can’t hurt any more children!’ Those were my thoughts. And I danced.” Before Robson could tell his family about the abuse, he fought through a severe depression. It struck not long after his son was born, at a moment when he had reached a new level of professional success, having been hired to direct a big budget feature film. He withdrew from his work. Finally, he decided to see a therapist and realized that if he was going to understand why he was struggling, he would have to talk about the abuse. The day he told his therapist, he also told his family, almost by accident. His brother, Shane, was visiting and told Wade that his wife had just had a dream in which Wade told her that Jackson had abused him. Wade said that he considered responding with his standard joke. (“I don’t know why I wasn’t sexy enough,” he’d say.) Instead, he told his brother that it was true. He also told his wife and sister. Wade described his wife caving in, like someone had punched her in the chest. For five months, his wife would not allow Joy Robson, Wade’s mother, into their home. In Part 1, Joy had described how she allowed her son to become part of Jackson’s life, unaware of what was going on in his bedroom. “The abuse was a bomb that dropped in our life and exploded,” Amanda Robson said, “and ripped apart everything that we found sound and secure and safe.” The documentary suggests that there are others with stories like Robson’s and Safechuck’s, though it offers no testimony to support the idea. The first episode ended with a disclaimer that said the actor Macaulay Culkin, who also spent time at Jackson’s Neverland Ranch in California, and another boy mentioned in the documentary, “categorically deny any sexual contact” with Jackson. For years, Safechuck and Robson, too, denied that Jackson had abused them. A central question the documentary tries to tackle is why viewers should believe them now. Both men describe the terror they felt at the idea of telling their wives and families, much less the entire world, their secret and how many years it took them to consider opening up. Robson says that as uncomfortable as it was to describe what happened between him and Jackson, it still felt better to tell the truth, and he hoped that by going public, he might help other survivors of sexual abuse. Both men sued Jackson’s estate after his death, but the cases were dismissed because they were filed outside the statute of limitations. “I want to be able to speak the truth,” Robson said, “as loud as I had to speak the lie for so long.”",The New York Times
2019,‘Leaving Neverland’: Viewers React With Shock at Disturbing Accounts of Life With Michael Jackson,"Filmgoers who saw “Leaving Neverland” when it debuted at the Sundance Film Festival in January called it “devastating,” “harrowing,” and “more disturbing than you could imagine.” Many of those who saw the documentary when Part One aired on HBO Sunday were just as stunned when they heard for themselves the accounts of two men who say Michael Jackson sexually abused them as boys. At the same time, Jackson fans swarmed Twitter, criticizing the documentary and his accusers. By the time he died at age 50 in 2009, Jackson had been trailed by allegations of child sexual abuse for more than 15 years. But “Leaving Neverland” contains granular, disturbing detail that could reshape his legacy for years to come: A secret system of bells to warn when other adults were approaching. A mock wedding ceremony with a young boy, complete with a gold ring studded with diamonds. Parents who were only too happy to be guests at Neverland, unaware what was happening to their sons a few closed doors away. The Michael Jackson estate has denied all of the allegations, likened the documentary to a character attack and sued HBO. Part Two airs on Monday night, but is already available to stream on HBO Go and HBO Now. [Michael Jackson’s fans are tenacious. | Our critic Wesley Morris reviews the documentary.] Here are some key points and a sampling of more viewer reactions from Part One: The movie shows how two boys and their families were pulled deep into Jackson’s orbit through fame and show business. Wade Robson, an aspiring dancer who became a successful choreographer as an adult, met Jackson after winning a dance competition. His mother, Joy, went so far as to move herself, Wade and her daughter to Los Angeles from their native Australia, leaving behind her husband and eldest son, on promises that Jackson would work with them to make Wade a star. James Safechuck met Jackson when he was cast in a Pepsi commercial that featured Jackson, and at age 10, Safechuck joined Jackson on tour. His mother, Stephanie, recounts meeting celebrities like Sean Connery, flying first class and being chauffeured in limousines. James describes the otherworldly frenzy of just walking with Jackson to his car, slicing through waves of screaming fans. Every night, he said, he would sleep in a hotel room with Jackson. His mother recounts that as the tour went on, her room got farther and farther from the one her son and Jackson shared. “Everybody wanted to meet Michael or be with Michael,” James Safechuck says as the film opens. “He was already larger than life. And then he likes you.” He nurtured relationships, including with the boys’ mothers. He spent hours on the phone with James and Wade, but he would also call their moms, just to talk to them. Jackson also spent time at the Safechucks’ modest home in Simi Valley, Calif. He could have been anywhere in the world, Stephanie Safechuck said, but he chose to be with them. “He was a son I started to take care for,” Stephanie Safechuck said. “He would spend the night, I’d wash his clothes.” She said that she once told Jackson that she had prayed for her son’s success in getting into commercials, and that he went on to find success right away. In response, she said, Jackson told her that he had prayed, too. He had prayed for a friend, and then he found James. The Neverland Ranch was Jackson’s California compound that included an arcade, an amusement park, an assortment of exotic animals and a train station. It was the perfect playground for children, and in the documentary it is also portrayed as the perfect place to keep children apart from their parents. Robson’s and Safechuck’s families were offered rooms in a guesthouse, which was separate from the main house where the boys would each stay with Jackson. Wade Robson’s mother, Joy, recounts that she got the sense during one long visit that her son and Jackson were avoiding her — and in such a big place, that was easy to do. She said she spent a lot of time alone and with Jackson’s chimpanzees. [“Leaving Neverland” could threaten the fortunes of Jackson’s thriving estate.] One of the most uncomfortable sequences in the film is when James Safechuck recounts all the places in Neverland where he said that he and Jackson had sex: On a blanket in Jackson’s closet, where several doors and a system of bells would alert them if someone was coming. In a private screening room at the back of the movie theater. In a house filled with Jackson’s memorabilia, such as a rhinestone jacket he wore to the Grammys. In an attic. In a castle in the theme park. In an upstairs room in the train station. The property had been for sale for several years, with an asking price as high as $100 million, and was recently listed with new brokers for $31 million. James Safechuck takes a small gold ring, studded with diamonds, out of a jewelry box and slips it onto his finger. It doesn’t fit past the fingernail of his adult hand. This was the ring, he said, that he and Jackson used in a mock wedding ceremony. When they went to a jewelry store to pick it out, they pretended Jackson was buying it for a woman whose hands were small, like the boy’s. As each sits alone in front of the camera, Robson and Safechuck recount a frightening pattern of abuse by Jackson, made even more disturbing by the similarities between them. Both said Jackson would ask them to get on all fours so he could look at them from behind while he masturbated. He asked them to rub his nipples. He would perform oral sex on them and they on him. He showed them pornography. Safechuck says the abuse started when he was 10. Robson says it began when he was 7. They say it went on for years. Jackson was the subject of two child molestation investigations during his lifetime. The first time, Jackson reached a settlement with the boy who accused him and no charges were filed against him. The second time, after a trial, Jackson was acquitted. [Read a timeline of Jackson’s history of sexual abuse allegations.] Jackson’s defenders have pointed out that both Safechuck and Robson have told the authorities in the past that they were not molested by Jackson, and that Robson took the stand in Jackson’s defense during the trial. Both men said that Jackson had trained them for those moments for years, drilling into them that if anyone found out, their lives would be over, or that he and they would go to jail. The Jackson family and his estate have emphatically denied the allegations, though neither they nor any other Jackson supporters appear in the film. “The creators of this film were not interested in the truth,” the family said in a statement. “They never interviewed a single solitary soul who knew Michael except the two perjurers and their families.” The statement said that Jackson “was and always will be 100 percent innocent of these false allegations.” Last month, the coexecutors of Jackson’s estate sued HBO and its parent company, Time Warner, for $100 million for breach of contract, saying that by airing the documentary, HBO violated a nondisparagement clause in a 1992 contract it signed before airing a Jackson concert in Romania. HBO said it would not change course. “Despite the desperate lengths taken to undermine the film, our plans remain unchanged,” HBO said in a statement. “This will allow everyone the opportunity to assess the film and the claims in it for themselves.” Devoted Jackson fans had been girding themselves for the documentary, and through a loose network of pro-Jackson websites and hashtags began planning to counteract the film. When it began, they overwhelmed the #LeavingNeverland hashtag with thousands of tweets calling the men liars and the film a work of fiction. The celebrity gossip and news feed Baller Alert also posted a series of skeptical tweets. The Jackson estate encouraged people to watch the Romanian concert instead. And Taj Jackson, the singer’s nephew and longtime defender, parried with a critic. But as Part One moved into more disturbing territory, viewers began reacting with disgust, shock and sadness. Some asked why the men’s parents had allowed them to get so close to Jackson. The second half of the documentary, airing on HBO Monday night and available for streaming now, moves through Jackson’s trial, introduces Robson’s and Safechuck’s wives, and takes the audience through their decision, after years of publicly proclaiming Jackson’s innocence, to come forward with their accounts.",The New York Times
2019,‘Living the Dream’: Pete Alonso Powers the Mets Past the Nationals,"Mets 11, Nationals 8 WASHINGTON — When Pete Alonso, the Mets’ first baseman, collected his first hit as a major leaguer on opening day, his general manager, Brodie Van Wagenen, congratulated him, and encouraged him to do better than a soft single to center. “For your next hit, make sure you get it on the barrel,” Van Wagenen said. Alonso quickly complied, helping the Mets to an 11-8 victory against the Washington Nationals on Saturday in his second major league game. Alonso, who won the starting job after spraying hits all over Florida during spring training, stroked a single to right field in his first at bat Saturday. He then blasted a Stephen Strasburg pitch over the center fielder’s head for a double. Mets fans in the left-field stands at Nationals Park started their traditional “Let’s Go Mets!” chant. Others added a new salute. “Pete A-lon-so!” they said. “Pete A-lon-so!” The chants continued in the eighth inning when Alonso launched another double, this time off the wall in right-center. His onslaught — 3 for 4 at the plate with two R.B.I. and another run scored — powered the Mets, who staved off a late rally. Though the bullpen surrendered four unearned runs in the ninth inning, the Mets’ 14 hits proved the difference as they improved to 2-0. “Our offense was fantastic today,” Mets Manager Mickey Callaway said. “It ended up we needed those last two innings of runs.” Noah Syndergaard, the Mets’ starter, who pitched six innings but did not figure in the decision, found Alonso’s support welcome. “Pistol Pete, the Polar Bear, trying to knock down outfield walls out there,” Syndergaard said. “Just a lot of fun to watch out there.” Even when he walked in the seventh inning, Alonso eventually made contact. With Alonso on first, second baseman Robinson Cano pulled a pitch down the first-base line, where Nationals first baseman Ryan Zimmerman caught the sharp grounder, stepped on first and fired the ball to shortstop Trea Turner, who caught it and tried to apply a tag to Alonso. Sliding in hard, Alonso broke up the double play. “He was doing it all over the place,” third baseman J. D. Davis said. Alonso was replaced by Dominic Smith in the bottom of the eighth, but his contributions were twofold. Though the Mets cited his defense as the reason he was not called up to Queens last September, he has proved adept at picking balls and applying tags. Against the Nationals, he handled a one-hop throw from shortstop Amed Rosario with aplomb and tagged out Victor Robles on a pickoff play from Syndergaard. He also managed to stay on the bag while stretching to receive a wide throw from Davis. “Just trying to make a play for my pitcher,” Alonso said. Callaway pointed to Alonso’s patient approach at the plate as the reason he was able to rip the ball to all fields. While left fielder Jeff McNeil continued to hit the ball well, catcher Wilson Ramos beat out an infield single and Rosario drew a timely walk, it was clear that the most effective Met on Saturday was Alonso. “I’m living the dream right now,” he said. “Just having a blast.”",The New York Times
2019,"‘Lot’ Offers a Fictional Look at a Vibrant, Polyglot American City","Books of The Times When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. There isn’t a single pickup truck in “Lot,” Bryan Washington’s first book of stories. The setting is Houston, but oil is barely mentioned. The Bush family and the space industry don’t come up at all. No one tells anyone to go big or go home (an unofficial state slogan). But because many of Washington’s characters are recent immigrants, that imperative is more or less implied. Washington’s subtle, dynamic and flexible stories play out across the city’s sprawling and multiethnic neighborhoods. His characters move through streets named so often — Richmond and Waugh, Rusk and Fairview — that they come to have talismanic power, like the street names in Springsteen songs. Washington’s stories, like Philip Levine’s poems, are heavily peopled. “Gonzalo belched it and Neesha sang it and Marilyn prayed for a flash of intuition” is a not untypical sentence. One story gives us a frightened crew of gay hustlers, many of them boys, named Scratch and Google and Poke and Knock and Nacho. There’s a zigzag through line in “Lot.” About half of the stories are about a single family. In particular they’re about the coming-of-age of a teenager, the son of a black mother and a Latino father, who works in the family restaurant and is discovering, to the delight of his shivering senses, that he likes to fool around with boys. [ This book was one of our most anticipated titles of March. See the full list. ] Other stories loop around this boy’s tale. One is about how a woman’s affair with a “whiteboy” rattles an entire apartment building. “When she came around looking for ackee,” Washington writes, slyly, “his was the freshest on the shelf.” Another is a caper about two amiable numbskulls who work at a restaurant called the Sushi Shack. They find what they call a chupacabra under a bridge, and hope their photos of the poor animal will go viral. Others are about drug dealers, the members of a baseball team and hurricane survivors. The first thing to say about Washington is that he’s an alert and often comic observer of the world. “Denise lived in one of those walk-ups that look like garbage from a distance,” he writes. “Then you get a little closer and they don’t look any better.” He has a gift for observing things like skin tones. The central character’s father “wore his skin like a sunburnt peach.” His mother has a darker pigment, “like rust on the rim of the stove.” He places the casual racism of the food industry on display. When the boy goes out looking for work in restaurants besides his family’s, “They read my name and they saw my face and they pointed to the dishes.” At the same time, Washington’s writing about food has a resonant matter-of-factness. “I slice and I marinate and unsleeve the meat,” the young man says. “Pack it in aluminum. Load the pit, light the fire. The pigs we gut have blue eyes. They start blinking when you do it, like they’re having flashbacks.” There’s nothing overtly or pretentiously literary about his stories, but when books are mentioned you tend to want to visit the passages twice. Here he is on a young woman, a sometime prostitute, and her bookishness: “She hit the resorts; she discovered Milton; she worked the coast; she discovered Rimbaud; she bought some heels; she discovered Babel; she took care of her skin; she discovered Rumi; she tried not to catch the clap; she discovered Borges; she caught the clap; she discovered Allende; she waited it out; she discovered Plath; she tried not to catch anything else.” Washington cracks open a vibrant, polyglot side of Houston about which few outsiders are aware. On one level, this landscape is bleak. These stories take place amid dismal laundromats and broken-down pharmacies. There are turf wars and shootouts. Things happen near Dollar Tree stores or in Whataburger parking lots. The men and women here are extended hope only in minuscule, homeopathic amounts. Perversely, their neighborhoods are gentrifying at the same time, pricing many long-timers out. But there is a fair amount of joy in Washington’s stories, too. (Some have previously appeared in magazines like Tin House and The New Yorker.) An underthrob of emotion beats inside them. He’s confident enough not to force the action. The stories feel loose, their cellular juices free to flow. Living in what the critic Albert Murray called “this great hit-and-miss republic,” Washington’s characters pivot between alienation and longing. Many of them lack papers or have expiring visas or worry about getting deported over a traffic ticket. “I haven’t seen the stars since I made it to Houston,” one recent immigrant says. She feels the city’s smog in her throat. She wants to learn not just English but “English english, the language of money,” the kind she hears in banks. These newcomers are mostly welcome. As one character remarks, “With our not-legals shuffling in, people who don’t have time for the violence, people whose only reason for bouncing was to get away from the violence, we’ve mellowed out, found our rhythm. Slowed down. You can raise a kid in the complex. Start a garden.” A few of these stories are barely more than vignettes. One or two don’t quite coalesce. This is on a certain level a modest book, one that isn’t going to drive other young short story writers into the shadows. But the promise Washington displays is real and large. One of the moving things about “Lot” is its communal sensibility. There’s a sense that these characters are all in it together, and the narrators have a way of gliding between “I” and “we.” One of them tries to remember “a time when you could probably look at the four of us and still call us okay.”",The New York Times
2019,"‘Lula,’ Ex-President of Brazil, Temporarily Leaves Prison for Grandson’s Funeral","RIO DE JANEIRO — Former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of Brazil left prison this weekend to attend the funeral of his 7-year-old grandson, and, while he was out, reiterated to an audience of political leaders and relatives who had gathered to mourn that he is not guilty of corruption and money laundering. Mr. da Silva, who was jailed in April after receiving a 12-year sentence, was released Saturday morning from a prison in Paraná State. He then flew to São Paulo before taking a helicopter to São Bernardo do Campo, where the funeral took place. He was to be escorted back to his cell Saturday afternoon. The funeral was the first time Mr. da Silva, popularly known as Lula, has left prison since being jailed. His grandson Arthur Lula da Silva died of meningitis on Friday. A note on Mr. da Silva’s website said he spoke at the funeral. “Ex-President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva said at his grandson’s funeral that when they meet in heaven, he will bring proof of his innocence for all the bullying that Arthur suffered in school for having a grandfather in prison,” the note said, adding that Mr. da Silva said he would prove that the prosecutor and judge who jailed him had lied. João Pedro Stédile, coordinator of the far-left Landless Workers’ Movement, told The Associated Press, “He said to us: ‘Stay strong, I’m going to get out, I am innocent.’” Leaders from the Workers’ Party, including former President Dilma Rousseff, came to pay their respects at the funeral, while around 200 supporters gathered outside the cemetery chanting, “Free Lula!” The party says he is a political prisoner. Others said that Mr. da Silva should not have been allowed to attend. “Lula is just an inmate, and he should be at a common prison,” Eduardo Bolsonaro, the son of President Jair Bolsonaro, wrote on Twitter on Friday. “When the relatives of other inmates die will they also be escorted by the federal police for the funeral? It is absurd to even contemplate that. It only lets him pose as a poor thing.” The tweet was later deleted. In January, Mr. da Silva was barred from attending his brother’s funeral despite Brazilian laws that grant inmates permission to leave for the funerals of close family members. His arrest has divided the country, with some believing that justice was being served to a corrupt politician and others saying that Mr. da Silva has been unfairly persecuted by Brazil’s elite and a partisan judiciary. Mr. da Silva served as president between 2003 and 2010. He was poised to run for re-election last October but was barred from doing so because of his criminal conviction.",The New York Times
2019,‘Maze’ Review: A Prison Break and a Confidence Game,"Critic’s Pick When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. “Maze” is, on its surface, an escape movie, but its true appeal lies elsewhere. Closely based on the 1983 mass breakout from the notorious Maze prison in Northern Ireland, Stephen Burke’s careful drama hits the familiar genre bases with almost soothing efficiency. Yet underneath the plotting and internecine tussles of the would-be escapees lurks something much more interesting: the story of a seduction. The seducer is the real-life Larry Marley (a superb Tom Vaughan-Lawlor), an Irish Republican Army prisoner still smarting from the deaths of fellow hunger strikers some months earlier. (At the time, the I.R.A. was engaged in a violent struggle to free Northern Ireland from English rule.) A hard, pale man with intelligent eyes and a deceptively compliant manner, Marley knows that any escape from this fortress will require information only the guards possess. Accordingly, he embarks on a campaign to gain the trust of Gordon (Barry Ward), an officer he instinctively recognizes as more conflicted and vulnerable than the others. What follows is a slow, sidling dance of advance and retreat as Gordon gradually becomes accustomed to Marley’s helping with housekeeping and hanging around to chat. This charm offensive turns “Maze” into an unusually quiet, watchful thriller: Aside from one early skirmish and the rather chaotic escape itself, Burke’s thoughtful script mostly unfolds without the usual prison-movie tumult. Following his lead, the cinematographer David Grennan uses calm close-ups to isolate the two men, zooming in tight even in crowd scenes to elevate the individual over the mob. Adopting a measured, nonpartisan approach to his touchy material, Burke shows Gordon weathering political pressures and a terrifying attack on his family, while Marley struggles to dissuade his son from following him into a life of political terrorism. In one beautifully lighted scene, as Marley comforts the widow of a hunger striker, this brooding movie takes time to remember the women who were left to carry on.

2019,Opinion | ‘Medicare for All’ May Not Be Good for All,"letter A reader cautions that Medicare does not mean free coverage for all medical care. To the Editor: Re “Eager to Sink Medicare Plan, Lobbies Unite” (front page, Feb. 24): Do proponents of “Medicare for all” really want that, or something else? I think a lot of the public who want free or subsidized health care plans might be disappointed if Medicare were extended to everyone. Medicare is not free health care. Nor is it the universal coverage that some countries like Britain have. It is insurance that covers some, but not all, health care expenses. Anyone who signs up for Medicare must pay a premium for Part B (medical services) coverage. In addition, most people purchase a Medicare supplement (Medigap) plan from a private insurance company to cover deductibles, co-payments and other out-of-pocket costs. Many also purchase a separate Part D plan to cover some of the costs of prescription drugs. Eye care and dental care are generally not covered. And, of course, Medicare, designed for an older population, does not cover maternity care and contraception. Total premiums can come to $300 or more per month. Medicare is not just like a group, employer-provided or individual plan that many people envision when they think of insurance. While it may be a good plan for those 65 and over, it may not fit the needs of everyone. Rebecca S.

2019,Opinion | ‘Medicare for All’: The Impossible Dream,"There’s no plausible route from here to there. Opinion Columnist The Brits and Canadians I know certainly love their single-payer health care systems. If one of their politicians suggested they should switch to the American health care model, they’d throw him out the window. So single-payer health care, or in our case “Medicare for all,” is worth taking seriously. I’ve just never understood how we get from here to there, how we transition from our current system to the one Bernie Sanders has proposed and Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris and others have endorsed. Despite differences between individual proposals, the broad outlines of Medicare for all are easy to grasp. We’d take the money we’re spending on private health insurance and private health care, and we’d shift it over to the federal government through higher taxes in some form. Then, since health care would be a public monopoly, the government could set prices and force health care providers to accept current Medicare payment rates. Medicare reimburses hospitals at 87 percent of costs while private insurance reimburses at 145 percent of costs. Charles Blahous, a former Social Security and Medicare public trustee, estimates that under the Sanders plan, the government could pay about 40 percent less than what private insurers now pay for treatments. If this version of Medicare for all worked as planned, everybody would be insured, health care usage would rise sharply because it would be free, without even a co-payment, and America would spend less over all on health care. It sounds good. But the trick is in the transition. First, patients would have to transition. Right now, roughly 181 million Americans receive health insurance through employers. About 70 percent of these people say they are happy with their coverage. Proponents of Medicare for all are saying: We’re going to take away the insurance you have and are happy with, and we’re going to replace it with a new system you haven’t experienced yet because, trust us, we’re the federal government! The insurance companies would have to transition. Lots of people work for and serve this industry. All-inclusive public health care would destroy this industry beyond recognition, and those people would have to find other work. Hospitals would have to transition. In many small cities the local health care system is the biggest employer. As Reihan Salam points out in The Atlantic, the United States has far more fully stocked hospitals relative to its population and much lower bed occupancy than comparable European nations have. If you live in a place where the health system is a big employer, think what happens when that sector takes a sudden, huge pay cut. The ripple effects would be immediate — like a small deindustrialization. Doctors would have to transition. Salary losses would differ by specialty, but imagine you came out of med school saddled with debt and learn that your payments are going to be down by, say 30 percent. Similar shocks would ripple to other health care workers. The American people would have to transition. Americans are more decentralized, diverse and individualistic than people in the nations with single-payer systems. They are more suspicious of centralized government and tend to dislike higher taxes. The Sanders plan would increase federal spending by about $32.6 trillion over its first 10 years, according to a Mercatus Center study that Blahous led. Compare that with the Congressional Budget Office’s projection for the entire 2019 fiscal year budget, $4.4 trillion. That kind of sticker shock is why a plan for single-payer in Vermont collapsed in 2014 and why Colorado voters overwhelmingly rejected one in 2016. It’s why legislators in California killed one. In this plan, the taxes are upfront, the purported savings are down the line. Once they learn that Medicare for all would eliminate private insurance and raise taxes, only 37 percent of Americans support it, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation survey. In 2010, Republicans scored an enormous electoral victory because voters feared that the government was taking over their health care, even though Obamacare really didn’t. Now, under Medicare for all, it really would. This seems like an excellent way to re-elect Donald Trump. The government would also have to transition. Medicare for all works only if politicians ruthlessly enforce those spending cuts. But in our system of government, members of Congress are terrible at fiscal discipline. They are quick to cater to special interest groups, terrible at saying no. To make single-payer really work, we’d probably have to scrap the U.S. Congress and move to a more centralized parliamentary system. Finally, patient expectations would have to transition. Today, getting a doctor’s appointment is annoying but not onerous. In Canada, the median wait time between seeing a general practitioner and a specialist is 8.7 weeks; between a G.P. referral and an orthopedic surgeon, it’s nine months. That would take some adjusting. If America were a blank slate, Medicare for all would be a plausible policy, but we are not a blank slate. At this point, the easiest way to get to a single-payer system would probably be to go back to 1776 and undo that whole American Revolution thing.

2019,‘Mind the Pay Gap’: Reduced Berlin Transit Tickets for Women to Highlight Discrimination,"BERLIN — In Germany, women are paid an average of 21 percent less than men, one of Europe’s widest gender pay gaps. In Berlin next week, for one day only, the public transportation system will offer them a corresponding discount. The BVG, which runs the city’s bus, tram and subway systems and is the country’s largest public transit authority, will offer women an unlimited day pass for 5.50 euros, about $6.20, instead of the regular €7. The Frauenticket, or women’s ticket, is limited to Monday, which campaigners in Germany have designated as Equal Pay Day, and the authority is calling the promotion “Mind the Pay Gap.” “The women’s ticket not only challenges the discriminatory wage gap in our country, but also shows that the BVG itself is doing something about it,” Sigrid Nikutta, the authority’s director, said. Despite its reputation as a socially progressive country — and its long-serving female leader — Germany has the third-widest pay gap in the European Union, according to 2017 figures from the bloc’s statistical agency. Only the Czech Republic and Estonia, both much smaller countries, did worse. (It also lags the United States, where the figure was 19.5 percent in 2017.) Quotas for the representation of women on corporate boards became law here in 2015, but the number of women in the national Parliament has declined since then, with the arrival of a male-dominated delegation from the far-right Alternative for Germany. There are now two male lawmakers for every female one. The city state of Berlin, which is governed by a coalition of progressive and socialist parties, has been actively pushing women’s rights, and for the first time this year made March 8, International Women’s Day, an official holiday in the city. Iris Spranger, a member of the city’s House of Representatives who campaigned for that measure, is also supportive of the transportation system’s public relations exercise. “The women’s ticket is an original idea to highlight the gender pay gap,” she wrote in an email. “The lively discussion alone shows that it was a good idea.” According to Ms. Spranger, even more important than the ticket is the fact that the BVG has had an equal-pay policy since 2003. Equal Pay Day, which in Germany this year falls on Monday, has been around since 1988. It symbolizes the extra days into the new year that German women have to work to earn the same as men. The public transport system in Berlin attracts over three million riders a day and has rails spanning almost 300 miles. Its yellow subway cars have become symbols for the city, as have its cheeky ads. In one of its online ads for the women’s ticket campaign, the BVG says: “Gender-specific wage gap. Sounds stupid. Is stupid. We’ll close it.” Men found using the special tickets, the authority said, would be treated like regular fare evaders and charged €60. But in a city where day passes are largely purchased by tourists — regular riders tend to buy monthly tickets — few men seemed to be taking offense at the idea. “With the campaign, we also call on women to apply for jobs with us,” said Ms. Nikutta, the first woman to run the BVG and the first leader to make it profitable. An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of the Berlin House of Representatives member who had campaigned to make International Women’s Day a holiday in the city. She is Iris Spranger, not Sprangler.",The New York Times
2019,"‘Mockingbird’ Play Publisher Demands $500,000 From Harper Lee Estate","“To Kill a Mockingbird” is proving to be an eventful legal drama. And not just in the theater. Last month the producer Scott Rudin, seeking to protect the financial future of a new stage adaptation of the novel now running on Broadway, forced at least eight theaters around the country to cancel productions of a 1970 stage version. Now the publisher of the earlier script says he will seek compensation and legal vindication. “We feel horribly for those affected by the shameful bigfooting coming from Mr. Rudin,” Christopher Sergel III, president of Dramatic Publishing Company and the grandson of the author of the first adaptation, said. Mr. Sergel said he would ask an arbitration tribunal to protect the ability of local theaters to stage his grandfather’s adaptation and to award damages of at least $500,000. He accused the estate of the “Mockingbird” author, Harper Lee, acting in concert with Mr. Rudin, of causing financial losses to Dramatic Publishing by making “false statements” to local theaters. A lawyer representing Ms. Lee’s estate declined to comment. Rick Miramontez, a spokesman for Mr. Rudin, said, “This is an action between the Dramatic Publishing Company and the estate of Harper Lee, and as such we have no comment.” The move by the publishing company is only the latest legal controversy to erupt over the play since Mr. Rudin persuaded Ms. Lee, shortly before her death, to grant him the rights to create a Broadway adaptation of her novel and to permit the screenwriter Aaron Sorkin to write the script. Last year the Lee estate sued Mr. Rudin, asserting that a draft script deviated impermissibly from the novel; Mr. Rudin countersued, and the case was settled. The latest dispute, over whether and when the Sergel adaptation can be staged now that the Sorkin adaptation exists, pits an agreement Ms. Lee signed with Dramatic Publishing in 1969 against one she signed with Mr. Rudin in 2015. The disagreement broke into public view in January, when a British production company announced that it was canceling a planned tour of the Sergel production under threat from Mr. Rudin’s lawyers. Then last month, eight American theaters separately said they were canceling productions of the play for the same reason. The cancellations, some of them at small, volunteer-run theaters, and in some cases just before the start of planned productions, prompted an outcry. Mr. Rudin then said he would allow the affected theaters to stage the Sorkin production, rather than the Sergel production, an offer that came too late for some, but was enticing to others. Mr. Rudin and the Lee estate cited provisions in the 1969 contract that prohibited the Sergel play from being produced in or near many cities when a “first-class dramatic play” based on the novel was on stage in New York or on tour. In a complaint seeking binding arbitration filed with the American Arbitration Association, Mr. Sergel included the original contract between Dramatic Publishing and Ms. Lee, in which she granted the rights to a stage production for a $2,500 advance. The contract allowed Dramatic Publishing to sell licenses to local theaters to stage the Sergel play, and Dramatic, in turn, would pay royalties to Ms. Lee, and now her estate. The author earned millions of dollars in royalties from the play over the years, the complaint says. According to correspondence filed with the tribunal, a representative of Ms. Lee’s estate specifically approved many of the community theater productions that Mr. Rudin later contested. In July 2018, after the schedule for the Broadway production was announced, Dramatic Publishing wrote to the estate to ask if nine local theaters that had already purchased rights to stage the play could proceed, including the Dayton Playhouse in Dayton, Ohio, the Grand Theater in Salt Lake City and the Curtain Call Theater in Braintree, Mass. The estate objected to a planned production in Staten Island, saying that while it was “certainly not economically competitive, it would be preferable not to have any competing press distraction here in NYC,” but authorized the others. Then, earlier this year, a different lawyer for the estate emailed a lawyer for Dramatic Publishing and said that several of the productions that had previously been cleared by the estate were in violation of the 1969 contract and could not go forward, and that any “prior consent by any purported representative of the Estate to the granting of these licenses is hereby revoked, and the Estate demands strict compliance with the terms of the Agreement.” It was not clear why the Lee estate changed its position, but the controversy forced the eight small theater groups to call off “Mockingbird.” Some had to cancel at the last minute and suffered financial losses as they had to refund tickets or could not substitute another production in time.",The New York Times
2019,"‘Mockingbird’ Producer Reconsiders, Letting Local Plays Go Forward","The Broadway producer Scott Rudin, facing a barrage of criticism over his efforts to shut down productions of “To Kill a Mockingbird” around the United States, on Friday offered an olive branch to the affected theaters, letting them put on a version of the play. At least eight theaters from California to Massachusetts were being forced to cancel productions of “Mockingbird” that would have used a decades-old script by the playwright Christopher Sergel. Mr. Rudin, whose “Mockingbird” now playing on Broadway uses a new script by Aaron Sorkin, invoked a contractual provision that prevents theaters around many cities from putting on the play while a version is playing on Broadway. The clause is intended to protect the financial viability of Broadway productions, but Mr. Rudin’s moves, reported Thursday by The New York Times, were criticized by many as bigfooting. Mr. Rudin called several of the theaters — some of them tiny nonprofits with all-volunteer staffs — to apologize, to explain what happened and to offer them the scripts to the new adaptation. Mr. Rudin said there would be no fee for use of the new script. The offer was extended to any theater whose rights to stage the old version had been challenged by Mr. Rudin’s legal team. But as a practical matter, the offer was too late for some of the theater companies, which had already rehearsed the older script, and were days away from beginning performances. At least one, the Kavinoky Theater in Buffalo, had already torn down its set after receiving a threatening letter from Mr. Rudin’s lawyer. Some of the theaters, though, said they would accept Mr. Rudin’s offer and stage the Sorkin version. “This is wonderful,” said Jill Brennan-Lincoln, chairwoman of the theater arts department at Azusa Pacific University, a Christian college outside Los Angeles that had been planning to cancel its production of the play after getting a cease-and-desist letter from Mr. Rudin’s lawyers. “A.P.U. is grateful and excited about the prospect of producing Sorkin’s version.” Lyn Adams, the executive director of the Oklahoma Children’s Theater, which had abandoned its plan to produce the Sergel script, was also intrigued, saying that “if given the opportunity, we definitely could and most likely would take them up.” Doug DeGirolamo, president of Hill Country Theater in Buda, Tex., said he had received a copy of the Sorkin script from Mr. Rudin’s office and was hoping to stage it. “For our small little theater to do a show that’s on Broadway right now would be a huge boon to us,” he said. But his theater’s production will have to be delayed so the cast can learn new lines and movements, and some actors have already taken other roles, he said. Mr. Rudin defended his actions in a brief statement, saying, “As stewards of the performance rights of Aaron Sorkin’s play, it is our responsibility to enforce the agreement we made with the Harper Lee estate and to make sure that we protect the extraordinary collaborators who made this production.” But he also blamed the situation on the Dramatic Publishing Company, which is run by Christopher Sergel III, Mr. Sergel’s grandson, saying it had erred in issuing licenses to present the play to theaters that should not have received them. Mr. Rudin has argued that a 1969 agreement between Ms. Lee, the author of the novel, and Dramatic Publishing bars productions by theaters within 25 miles of a city that in 1960 had a population of more than 150,000 people, as well as productions using professional actors, when a “first-class” production is running on Broadway or on tour. “We have been hard at work creating what I hope might be a solution for those theater companies that have been affected by this unfortunate set of circumstances, in which rights that were not available to them were licensed to them by a third party who did not have the right to do so,” Mr. Rudin said. “In an effort to ameliorate the hurt caused here, we are offering each of these companies the right to perform our version of ‘To Kill a Mockingbird,’ Aaron Sorkin’s play currently running on Broadway.” Mr. Sergel declined to comment. It was an unusually conciliatory gesture for Mr. Rudin, who has a reputation in the theater industry for being strong-willed and litigious. Before the Broadway adaptation opened, he was locked in a legal battle with the Lee estate, which argued that the play departed too much from the novel; the dispute was eventually settled. It is also rare for a hit Broadway show to grant licenses to local theaters, particularly when a national tour is anticipated. Mr. Rudin’s “Mockingbird” has grossed $24 million since opening in December. When news broke that local theaters were canceling their performances after Mr. Rudin’s lawyer threatened them with copyright infringement lawsuits, many supporters of community theater were outraged. Some called for a boycott of Mr. Rudin’s productions, using the hashtag #boycottRudinplays. “Unfortunately this issue has been the shot heard ’round the fine arts world over recent days,” said Davis Varner, the president of the board of the Theater of Gadsden, a community theater in Alabama that is planning to stage the Sergel version this month. The theater is not near a big city, so its rights appear to be unchallenged, but Mr. Varner issued a statement referring to Mr. Rudin as “the bully from Broadway” and said, “I am saddened and disappointed for those groups who have been forced to cancel their productions through no fault of their own.” Others took to social media to vent their unhappiness. Some community theaters are intrigued by Mr. Rudin’s offer but wary of the logistical challenges involved in staging a completely different version of the play on such short notice. While Mr. Sorkin’s version closely tracks Ms. Lee’s novel — the story of Atticus Finch, a small-town lawyer in Alabama who defends a black man, Tom Robinson, against false charges — it follows a dramatically different narrative structure, and gives more prominent roles to the novel’s two main African-American characters, Robinson and Calpurnia, the Finch family cook. Seth Miller, the executive artistic director of the Grand Theater in Salt Lake City, which canceled its planned production of “Mockingbird,” said it was too late for his theater to mount a different version of the play in the scheduled time slot. It would have to do it next season, but he said he was not sure how long Mr. Rudin’s offer was good for. For some, like the Dayton Playhouse in Ohio, which was scheduled to stage “Mockingbird” on March 8, there was little time for the cast to prepare. “At best we could mount a reading,” said Matthew Lindsay, the chairman of the theater’s board, describing a performance in which the actor would hold scripts. “The optimal situation would be that Mr. Rudin offers us the opportunity to perform the Sergel script.”",The New York Times
2019,‘My Dad’s Not a Racist’: Book Describes Ivanka Trump’s Defense After Charlottesville,"WASHINGTON — When Gary D. Cohn was considering resigning as the top White House economic adviser after President Trump blamed “both sides” in a deadly white nationalist protest in Charlottesville, Va., his first stop was a meeting with Mr. Trump’s children. In a conversation in August 2017 with Ivanka Trump, the president’s eldest daughter and senior adviser, Mr. Cohn was shocked by her reaction to his concerns, according to a new book about Ms. Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner. “My dad’s not a racist; he didn’t mean any of it,” Ms. Trump said of the president’s refusal to condemn white nationalists outright. Appearing to channel her father, she added, “That’s not what he said.” Mr. Cohn ultimately did not resign over the Charlottesville episode, instead leaving after losing a battle over trade policy last year. In a statement late Monday, Mr. Cohn said: “Ivanka and Jared brought me into the administration. We worked well together and continue to be friends to this day.” But the episode permanently changed his view of Ms. Trump and Mr. Kushner, who are often painted as moderating influences on the president, according to “Kushner Inc.,” by the journalist Vicky Ward. The book, which will be published by St. Martin’s Press on March 19, seeks to tell the behind-the-scenes story of Ms. Trump and Mr. Kushner’s rise to extraordinary power in the White House. Ms. Ward has said she spent two years interviewing 220 people for the book, granting many of them anonymity. Her account is not a flattering one, and White House officials have dismissed the book and any coverage of it. She portrays Ms. Trump and Mr. Kushner as two children forged by their domineering fathers — one overinvolved with his son, one disengaged from his daughter — who have climbed to positions of power by disregarding protocol and skirting the rules when they can. And Ms. Ward tries to unravel the narrative that the two serve as stabilizing voices inside an otherwise chaotic White House, depicting them instead as Mr. Trump’s chief enablers. The portrait that emerges, according to Mr. Kushner’s camp, is far removed from reality. “Every point that Ms. Ward mentioned in what she called her ‘fact checking’ stage was entirely false,” Peter Mirijanian, a spokesman for Mr. Kushner’s lawyer, Abbe Lowell, said in a statement. “It seems she has written a book of fiction rather than any serious attempt to get the facts. Correcting everything wrong would take too long and be pointless.” Ms. Trump and Mr. Kushner wanted to control who could travel on trips funded by the State Department, Ms. Ward wrote, citing a source at the department. Ms. Trump also often requested to travel on Air Force planes when it was not appropriate. When Rex W. Tillerson, the former secretary of state, would deny the requests, the couple would invite along a cabinet secretary, often Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, to get access to a plane. Over the past two years, Mr. Trump has waffled on whether he wanted his children serving in his administration. When he hired John F. Kelly as his chief of staff, a move that Ms. Trump and Mr. Kushner supported at the time, he gave an early directive: “Get rid of my kids; get them back to New York.” Mr. Trump complained, according to the book, that his children “didn’t know how to play the game” and generated cycles of bad press. Mr. Kelly responded that it would be difficult to fire them, but he and the president agreed that they would make life difficult enough to force the pair to offer their resignations, which the president would then accept. Ms. Trump and Mr. Kushner, however, have outlasted those plans, and Mr. Trump’s desire for them to leave the West Wing has come and gone in waves, associates said. Mr. Kelly resigned in December, and the couple has only gained in power since his departure. If there is sympathy in Ms. Ward’s book for her protagonists, it is found in explaining how they grew up. Ms. Trump, she wrote, was wealthy but isolated. When she went to tour Choate Rosemary Hall, the elite Connecticut boarding school where she would attend high school, Ms. Trump arrived in a white stretch limousine. But she emerged from the car all by herself. “No one was there with her,” said her tour guide, who remained anonymous in the book. Mr. Kushner’s father, meanwhile, had been grooming his son since childhood to become his successor in the family real estate company, Kushner Companies. When Mr. Kushner went away to Harvard, Ms. Ward wrote, his parents had a business associate keep an eye on him — by taking him out for dinner and reporting back on his activities — to make sure he was not dating non-Jews or doing drugs. When Mr. Kushner and Ms. Trump decided to get married, both sets of parents were skeptical. Ms. Trump eventually won over the Kushners with her commitment to a grueling religious conversion regimen and her apparent intense desire to become part of a close-knit family. Mr. Trump, meanwhile, did not understand why his daughter had to change her religion for anyone, even though he liked Mr. Kushner. He would joke that Ms. Trump could have married Tom Brady, the quarterback for the New England Patriots, and once joked to Robert K. Kraft, the team’s owner, that “Jared is half the size of Tom Brady’s forearm.”",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | ‘My Girls Are Getting a Future Here’,"Fixes In India, parents who migrate to cities often have no choice but to leave their children alone while they work at low-wage jobs. Now there’s some relief. Ms. Doshi is a former India correspondent for The Washington Post. NEW DELHI — By midafternoon, Usha Devi’s one-bedroom home was a mess. Her infant daughter spilled water on the bed, and her toddler smeared food on the floor and picked up a knife as her 10-year-old thrust her homework under Ms. Devi’s nose. “I only get an hour for lunch,” Ms. Devi said, prioritizing her youngest and unbuttoning her blouse to breast-feed the baby. This precious, chaotic hour is the only time during the day that Ms. Devi, who lives and works on a construction site at Narela, on the outskirts of New Delhi, can be with her children. Millions of people like Ms. Devi, 33, are leaving their ancestral villages and migrating to urban India to take construction jobs as India’s cities continue to swell. Ms. Devi works as a sweeper for a government project that is building low-income housing for residents of Delhi’s slums. Construction accounts for roughly 8 percent of India’s gross domestic product. But the economic pressures on these low-wage workers are disrupting age-old living patterns in villages, where grandparents and family members have traditionally cared for children while their parents worked on ancestral farms. In cities, parents who migrate from rural areas often have no choice but to leave their children alone while they work. The children of construction workers are often left to raise themselves and one another. Ms. Devi is somewhat better off than others who have migrated to Delhi. On the site where she works and also lives, in simple housing provided by her employer, a charitable organization called Mobile Crèches (“crèche” means nursery in French) has set up a child-care center where her girls are looked after for eight hours a day Monday through Saturday, with a break at home for lunch. “My girls are getting a future here,” Ms. Devi said. “They go to school every day. They get food. They don’t get hurt. They’re safe.” Mobile Crèches and its partners run 60 day care centers on construction sites and in urban slums around India. It’s a relatively modest initiative given the enormous need, but it remains an important model of how child care benefits low-income families. Centers focus on early childhood development and nutrition as well as play — an important part of childhood and social and emotional learning that remains undervalued by parents and many educators. Meera Mahadevan co-founded Mobile Crèches in 1969 after she saw street children in Delhi playing at a construction site, neglected by working adults. As India’s construction industry has grown, the organization has scaled up: Since its inception, about 750,000 children have been cared for. Of note, many alumni have attended top Indian universities and landed coveted office jobs, both of which are usually beyond reach for children of India’s low-wage workers. “When looking at a vision of new India, to know that our youngest are still excluded from the most basic entitlements — nutrition and care — it just compels you to do something,” said Sumitra Mishra, executive director of Mobile Crèches. “There is a lack of support structures. Not every builder provides child care. It is stopping women from being more effective in the construction industry.” Successive governments have taken note of the organization’s successes. Mobile Crèches now trains hundreds of caregivers in low-income communities and government-run rural child care centers. In 1996, partly through the organization’s advocacy work, a law was passed that requires all construction sites with 50 or more female workers to have on-site child care centers. Although poor administration and corruption have left the law largely unenforced, Mobile Crèches encourages builders to comply by offering to set up facilities if companies are willing to finance and accommodate them. India’s construction industry is the country’s second-largest employer, after agriculture. The work force is largely unorganized and unskilled. Women are expected to earn money, do housework and look after children. Most do not have maternity entitlements and have limited access to welfare. The sight of unsupervised children from low-income families is so familiar in India’s cities that for many Indians, the children go largely unnoticed. Though similar day care centers have been set up on construction sites in India and in other countries, it is often left to the good will of companies, leaving many parents with no good options for care. For parents in white-collar jobs, child care in India is still far from the norm; for workers like Ms. Devi, employed in the informal sector, it’s barely available and far from a legal right. In 2016, the government increased paid maternity leave from 12 to 26 weeks, but the law applies only to the formal sector. More than 90 percent of the female work force is employed informally, and they are left out. Without child care options, many mothers have no choice but to leave paying jobs. Rural migrants come to cities for short stints, until the seasons change, or sometimes for a few years, hoping to save up. With little education or money, they have limited opportunities. They devise temporary homes under tarpaulins and tin panels on sidewalks or under street overpasses, or rent cheap rooms in slums. Many end up doing factory work or set up roadside businesses. Others, like Ms. Devi, do temporary work on construction sites. According to a 2011 report by Mobile Crèches, about seven in 10 children on construction sites are malnourished; newborns are often deprived of the health benefits of breast-feeding, and older children frequently miss school. Incomplete immunizations are common, too. Many women on construction sites take young children to work because they have nowhere else to leave them, said Mubashira Zaidi, a research analyst at the Institute of Social Studies Trust. Interviewees in a recent study told her that children taken to work sites were often injured by falling debris. “Women were aware of the risks involved in taking their child to work sites, but expressed not having a choice,” she said. In her village, Ms. Devi and her husband worked as potters. But with four girls to feed, Ms. Devi fretted about making ends meet. The reason for the move to the city, Ms. Devi explained, was all the weddings they are going to have to pay for. “We have only girls. How will we get them married?” she asked. (The bride’s family usually bears the brunt of wedding costs and is often forced to lavish the groom with expensive gifts or cash, even though the practice of paying dowries has been outlawed in India since 1961.) Ms. Devi left her eldest daughter back in their village to care for her aging mother. The younger three are looked after by Mobile Crèches while Ms. Devi and her husband go to work on the construction site. To Ms. Devi and the girls, the day care center is invaluable. When her infant daughter Gauri’s weight dropped below normal, a teacher noticed and put her on a special diet until she was healthy again. On a recent Saturday morning, sitting in a circle with her friends, Ms. Devi’s 11-year-old daughter, Mahak, learned simple arithmetic. Next door, her sister was listening to a story about a little boy who finds a tiger under his bed. “At school the girls learn songs, and they come back and tell us stories,” Ms. Devi said. “They come home and teach us things.” In 2014, a report by the International Labor Organization said that participation by women in India’s work force is falling despite economic growth. Though this is attributed to a complicated and much-debated set of reasons, the report noted that much of the work handled by women in India is not counted as economic output. It is either not documented or accounted for in official economic statistics. Women’s work in the home goes unrecognized — as it does around the world. Shubhika Sachdeva, a former deputy manager of advocacy at Mobile Crèches, said that on a recent visit to the city of Udaipur, she spoke to women who told her about the various tasks that occupied their time, including cooking, cleaning and walking for miles to get fuel and water. But when asked how much they worked, they told her: “We don’t work. We do nothing.” She found the same attitude among those in well-meaning organizations that want to encourage female participation in the work force. “Many of these women empowerment initiatives encourage women to work, but don’t consider this unpaid work as ‘work,’” she said. “Child care and household tasks that women do are not taken into account. The nurturing role is considered a mother’s natural duty. It is just not culturally considered that looking after children could be somebody else’s responsibility.” Mobile Crèches alone can’t change the centuries-old belief that child care should be left to women, but it can illustrate the powerful social and economic benefits that quality child care can bring to all families, regardless of their social status. Before she starts her job at 8 a.m., Ms. Devi prepares the family’s meal, washes clothes and gets her girls dressed for school. When she comes home, she cooks again, cleans some more and prepares the girls for bed. Her husband sits outside, talking with other husbands. But in Ms. Devi’s case the organization’s efforts have allowed her to expand her ambitions by taking away the burden of child care and letting her earn her own income. Ms. Devi’s fortunes have risen since she moved to the city. Now she has a kitchenette full of utensils and an electric fan she gazes at with pride. Next on the list, Ms. Devi said, will be a flat-screen television, an ambition that would have been well beyond reach had she stayed in her village. “There, all day I work,” she said. “Here, I can rest.” Vidhi Doshi is a journalist who has been a correspondent for The Washington Post and a contributor to The Guardian.

2019,‘My Heart Is on Fire’: Ethiopian Airlines Victims Embodied Kenya’s Ambitions,"ENGOSHURA, Kenya — John Quindos wailed and hyperventilated so violently that officials rushed him to a first aid station. Then, as the magnitude sunk in, he lost his voice. He had been standing at Nairobi airport waiting for the arrival of his wife, his daughter and her three children. He was particularly excited to greet his granddaughter, Ruby, born nine months earlier in Canada. He had never seen her before. He never got the chance. The plane his family was aboard — a Boeing 737 Max 8 operated by Ethiopian Airlines — smashed into a field on Sunday, killing all 157 people aboard. “My heart is on fire,” he said quietly at his modest farmhouse in the Kenyan highlands, receiving a stream of mourners with almost preternatural grace. As a clamorous global alarm over air safety rings in the wake of Sunday’s crash, causing Boeing 737 Max planes to be grounded across the world, a quieter reckoning is taking place in shattered homes across Kenya, the country that suffered the single largest toll. The 32 Kenyans who died — executives, cancer specialists, the head of the national soccer association, senior aid workers and educators, among others — offered a vivid snapshot of the nation’s internal growth and ambitious integration into the regional and global economies in recent years. For decades, Nairobi has been the hub of East Africa, trading on its reputation as an oasis of calm in a region often rocked by famine, conflict, even genocide. A base for numerous United Nations bodies, its open economy and tolerant ethos have attracted all comers. More recently, multinational corporations have flocked to Kenya, strengthening an economy that has grown sixfold in the past 20 years. Over the same period, its population has grown to 50 million from about 30 million. Victims like Mr. Quindos’s daughter, Caroline, 34, illustrate part of the phenomenon — the success of a generation of Kenyans who emigrated to wealthier nations, turning the education provided by their impoverished parents into jobs abroad, money sent back home and foreign passports. Paying school fees to nurture such opportunity is an obsession across Kenyan society, said Murithi Mutiga, an analyst with the International Crisis Group in Nairobi. “This is not a resource-rich country, so it sees its strength in its people,” he said. “In rural areas, people invest everything they have in their children’s education. It’s all that matters to them.” Engoshura, where Mr. Quindos and his family lived, is a simple rural hamlet, only 90 miles from Nairobi, but a world away from its high-rises, traffic jams and shopping malls. A quarry provides some jobs, but the backbone is subsistence farming. The land, a giant farm in the colonial era, has been divided into a patchwork of small plots. “Maize, beans, bananas. One cow. Maybe some sheep,” said Paul Karanja, a neighbor. One day this week thousands of residents flocked to the funeral of a 95-year-old veteran of the Mau Mau, the insurgents who fought colonial settlers in Kenya during the 1950s. Mr. Quindos and his wife, Ann Wangui, were both teachers and pillars of the community. Ms. Wangui, 60, led church committees and raised money for a water tank. Mr. Quindos was a candidate in parliamentary elections in 2013 but came in third, failing to win a seat. They sent their children to the best schools they could afford. Foreign travel followed. One son, Kelvin Karanja, studied medicine in Venezuela. Their daughter Caroline became an accountant, married a banker, and six years ago moved to the island of Bermuda. “Most of us just went to local universities and that was it,” said Mr. Karanja. “They were the trailblazers.” Their success brought dividends for their parents back in Kenya. Remittances by diasporic Kenyans have soared in recent years, driven by increased flows from the United States and Canada, and become a central peg of the economy. Kenya’s Central Bank recorded remittances of $244 million in January alone, up from $209 million in the same month in 2018. Caroline paid for a new roof for her parents’ modest, turquoise-walled home, as well as for a large chicken coop in the back yard. Neighbors, mindful of her success, joked half-seriously to Mr. Quindos that she should pay their school fees too. Last year, Caroline sent her mother the price of airfare so she could visit Canada, where the young family had moved from Bermuda. “It was a surprise,” said Mr. Quindos. “My wife had just retired, and my daughter paid for the ticket as a present.” This week, dozens of Ms. Wangui’s former students streamed into her house to pay their respects. Neighbors gathered around her husband, even if they struggled to grasp the enormity of his loss. Five dead in the same family was “unimaginable,” said John Maku. “People are talking in whispers. They didn’t know what to say. It is …” He paused, searching for a word. “It is beyond.” Mr. Quindos stood on the porch, fielding visitors and phone calls. “Pole sana!” one mourner said in Swahili — I’m sorry for your loss. An official from Ethiopian Airlines called — the airline needed a DNA sample to help identify the remains that had been collected at the crash site. Other Kenyans who perished in Sunday’s crash also embodied their country’s outward reach. Among the dead were three women who specialized in the treatment of cancer. One of them, Jayne Kamau, was an expert in helping children with retinoblastoma, a rare eye malignancy. Then there was Derick Lwugi, an accountant who quit his job at a Kenyan dairy company to emigrate to Canada, and was returning to take his mother for treatment for arthritis. Kenya’s outward posture has come at a price. The Shabaab terrorist group claimed responsibility for an attack on a luxury hotel and office complex in Nairobi that killed 21 people in January. It also killed 71 people at the city’s Westgate Mall in 2013. Both times the targets were clear: Kenya’s modern, cosmopolitan image and lifestyle, its symbols of prosperity. That security threat, as well as a rash of ethnically driven political violence a decade ago, has caused some Kenyans to worry that their country’s hegemonic status in the region has slipped in recent years. “Kenyans got used to the idea of exceptionalism, that they are different,” said Patrick Gathara, a commentator and cartoonist. “The violence in 2008 made them realize they could go the way of their neighbors.” The tremendous economic growth of Ethiopia, he said, has posed a further threat to Kenya’s status. “We are trying to find out where we fit into the region,” he said. “It’s no longer about looking over our shoulders. It’s about looking around us.” The plane crash, though, was also a reminder that Nairobi and the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, have become twin hubs in East Africa with different focuses. Kenya’s economy grew to nearly $80 billion in 2017 from $13 billion in 1999, according to the World Bank. In the same period, Ethiopia’s economy surged to $80 billion from less than $8 billion, while its population surged to 105 million from 64 million. Still, it is Ethiopia that exudes the buzz these days. In recent years, Chinese and Gulf investors have poured in. A dynamic new prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, made peace with the country’s archrival, Eritrea, within months of his election last year. He has taken first steps toward liberalizing the economy. The national carrier, Ethiopian Airlines, is one of the most prominent in Africa, with a fleet of new planes, a growing network of routes, and a base at Addis Ababa’s shiny new airport. “The Ethiopians are reaching for the kind of cosmopolitanism you find in Kenya,” said Mr. Mutiga, the analyst. “They want to be more engaged with the world. At the same time, going from an authoritarian to a liberalized system is very difficult. They face some formidable challenges.” In Engoshura, Mr. Quindos lamented the corruption that has hobbled Kenya’s growth. He wondered why no Kenyan official had even called to offer a word of condolence for his loss. “They might have just said ‘pole,’” he said, using the Swahili word for sorry. But most of all, he wanted to get the remains of his family members so he could bury them. “Every family needs to get what belongs to them,” he said. An earlier version of this article misstated the number of people who died in the Ethiopian Airlines plane crash. It was 157 people, not 159. An earlier version of this article misstated the location of the island of Bermuda. It is in the Atlantic Ocean, not the Caribbean.",The New York Times
2019,‘Newark’s Original Sin’ and the Criminal Justice Education of Cory Booker,"The Long Run Mr. Booker’s road from enforcer to reformer began with rocky oversight of the Newark Police Department. Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey at Voorhees College in South Carolina, last month.CreditCreditTravis Dove for The New York Times NEWARK — After football practice one summer evening in 2008, a Pop Warner league coach and two of his players were driving through the Clinton Hill section of Newark when a car swerved and blocked their path. Suddenly six police officers emerged from unmarked vehicles and forced them out of their car at gunpoint. “I felt like this: Don’t kill me, just send me to jail. Please don’t kill me,” one of the boys, Tony Ivey Jr., then 13, would later say in a videotaped interview. The officers, members of a narcotics squad, searched the car and found nothing but football equipment. The coach had been taking the boys to get hamburgers. The episode became known as the case of the Pop Warner Three, and it was one of more than 400 misconduct allegations cited two years later when the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey asked the Justice Department to investigate the Newark police. Newark’s mayor, Cory Booker, had swept into office in 2006 pledging a safer city through zero tolerance on crime. And while killings actually rose in his first year, over the next three they fell to historic lows. Yet grievances against the police were piling up in the city’s black wards, with allegations of racial profiling, unlawful stops and excessive force. The A.C.L.U. and local activists pressed for reforms, complaining about pushback from Mr. Booker, whose administration was promoting the plunging homicide rate. And when the A.C.L.U. finally went public with its plea to the Justice Department, the mayor went on WNYC radio, telling an interviewer that the petition was “one of the worst ways” to bring about meaningful change. “We don’t need people who are going to frustrate, undermine and mischaracterize our agency,” he added. Today, the mayor turned United States senator is running for president, building his candidacy, in no small part, on a platform of criminal justice reform that places him at the forefront of shifting national thought on questions of crime and punishment. On the campaign trail, he has made passionate pleas for expunging minor drug convictions, ending private prisons and expanding re-entry programs for the formerly incarcerated. He recently introduced legislation to remove marijuana from the federal list of controlled substances and to expunge past convictions, noting the disparate arrest rates of black and white users. In Newark a decade ago, he was a rising-star mayor with a problem. The way he handled it may offer insights into what kind of president he would be. Suburban-raised, Stanford-educated, Mr. Booker, 49, had begun his political career in Newark by moving into decrepit public housing to earn his inner-city bona fides, a story replayed on documentary film even before his election. When he took over City Hall with his zero-tolerance vow, he was walking a tightrope: Citizens were crying out for tougher policing, yet the crime-fighting tools he employed, including stop-and-frisk searches for drugs or weapons, ran the risk of alienating the very people he was seeking to help, especially given Newark’s searing history of police brutality. As Mr. Booker now tells it, he was both enforcer and reformer from the first, seeking to drive down crime while transforming a department crippled by scarce resources and antique equipment, and shot through with a culture of brutality protected by an intransigent police union. But an examination of Mr. Booker’s stewardship of the police department — based on dozens of interviews with officials and activists, Booker allies and Booker critics — suggests a mayor slow to make changes, fixated on the top-line measures of crime-fighting success while at times ceding too much authority to his police director and other aides. “He wasn’t as hands-on as I would have been, if you will, with the department,” said Ronald L. Rice, a state senator and former Newark police officer who lost to Mr. Booker in the 2006 mayoral election. As a new mayor navigating a city with time-hardened political powers, Mr. Booker often sought to play mediator rather than impose some of the confrontational reforms — such as an independent police monitor — that would have alienated the police union. “The police are a political force as well as a paramilitary force. And any politician that takes on the police to stop police brutality or violations of constitutional rights — they’re going to incur the wrath of the police,” said Lawrence Hamm, chairman of the People’s Organization for Progress, a progressive group that protested against the police during Mr. Booker’s mayoralty. In a recent interview, Mr. Booker described himself as intimately involved with policing, though he framed that involvement in the sort of communal, we’re-all-in-this-together terms that suffuse his campaign arguments for himself — his omnipresence at community meetings, his contact with block leaders into the wee hours of the morning, the civilian caravans he dispatched into dangerous precincts of the city. “I don’t know how much more hands-on you could get a mayor at that point,” he said. “This was a very big priority for me in my early days. I was just pushing like you wouldn’t believe. So I was on the streets.” Even so, he acknowledged that he should have more quickly reined in police abuses. He attributed that failure, in large part, to a reliance on “imperfect data, imperfect measures,” that erroneously showed complaints going down. “Even as I had strived my entire life to be a force for equity, fairness, justice and opportunity, it was obvious that some of our police practices, on my watch, were undermining not only my own values but my life’s mission,” he wrote in his 2016 book, “United.” Ultimately, the Justice Department intervened at the A.C.L.U.’s request and Mr. Booker came around, calling the investigation a “win-win” for the city. That inquiry would document a pattern of unconstitutional behavior by the Newark police: Three-quarters of pedestrian stops failed to meet the legal criteria, and blacks were at least 2.5 times more likely than whites to be stopped or arrested. The police department remains under a Justice Department consent decree. Today, in the era of Black Lives Matter, these tactics and their outsize impact on minority communities have helped drive a broad reassessment of criminal justice policies. That has left many politicians with tough-on-crime histories, especially on the Democratic side of the aisle, in a potentially awkward place. For Mr. Booker, there is an extra layer. In the interview, he recalled how, as a young black man, he had been a police target himself. He described the episode in a column written at Stanford in 1992, after Los Angeles had erupted in fire and rage over the acquittal of three police officers in the beating of Rodney King. Mr. Booker’s trial by police stop had come near the George Washington Bridge. “Five police cars, six officers, surround my car, guns ready,” he wrote. “I sat shaking.” The officers told him he had fit the description of a car thief. Newark’s policing problems date at least to the 1950s, when relations grew tense between the mostly white force and the city’s growing black population. The combustible mix exploded in July 1967, after two officers arrested and beat a black cabdriver who had passed their double-parked patrol car. Four days of rioting and looting killed 26 people, injured more than 700 and left Newark a smoldering national symbol of urban violence and blight. “I call police brutality in the city of Newark ‘Newark’s original sin,’” said Ronald C. Rice, a former councilman and the son of Mr. Booker’s opponent in the 2006 mayoral race. After a campaign built on twin promises of safer streets and downtown renewal, Mr. Booker inherited that traumatic legacy, along with a high rate of violent crime — three times the state average — that made Newark among the most dangerous cities in America. Cutting crime, and being seen cutting crime, became his obsession. He set up a BlackBerry alert for every shooting. He left a staff meeting to be with a 14-year-old struck by a stray bullet. He chased down a scissor-wielding bank thief in broad daylight. He was already famous, a nationally recognized face from the Oscar-nominated documentary of his failed 2002 mayoral campaign, run during his tenancy at the notoriously troubled Brick Towers. His first year in office was chronicled in a Sundance documentary series, “Brick City,” and he became a regular presence in living rooms around the country: talking Newark reforms on Oprah’s couch, trading late-night jokes with Jay Leno and Conan O’Brien, making frequent appearances on “The Colbert Report” and “Real Time with Bill Maher.” One blogger nicknamed him “Hollywood.” Everywhere he pointed to changes in Newark as evidence that his unique brand of positive, uplifting politics could work in this hardscrabble city. The changes were real. During his first term, homicides fell nearly 40 percent, and reports of rape, arson and auto theft saw similar declines. It was enough for Mr. Booker to grow boastful during his 2010 state-of-the-city address. “In Newark we are driving down crime in historic proportions,” he said, turning to the police officers in attendance. “Thank you for this tremendous, unprecedented work for public safety in our city.” At the heart of the effort was the zero-tolerance strategy brought across the river from New York by Mr. Booker’s new police director, Garry McCarthy. Under Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, New York’s police department, and Mr. McCarthy with it, had embraced what is known as “broken windows” policing. The idea was that eliminating outward signs of crime, like public drunkenness and urination, loitering, graffiti and, indeed, broken windows, would reduce more serious crimes. Mr. McCarthy was also an exponent of stop-and-frisk, which would be fiercely debated in New York. “I will enforce all laws, from traffic laws, with people speeding down our streets, to littering laws,” Mr. Booker had proclaimed in his inaugural address. In an interview, Mr. McCarthy said he had pitched Mr. Booker on bringing this style of policing to Newark. He told of a stop two weeks into his tenure when officers frisked a man drinking on a corner and found two guns. “So what’s the moral of the story?” Mr. McCarthy said. “If they had forgone the opportunity to intercede in the low-level event of drinking an alcoholic beverage in public, they would not have prevented a murder likely that night, because that guy was there to take his corner back.” Both Mr. McCarthy and Mr. Booker have said that, even as their officers stopped people on the street, their approach was meant to be constructive. They said it was a way to improve community relations, much as Mr. McCarthy had sought to do as a commander in the drug-ridden Manhattan neighborhood of Washington Heights. In the interview, Mr. Booker also pointed out that the Newark police had long used stop-and-frisk. Mr. Rice, the former councilman, said that while he personally opposed broken-windows and stop-and-frisk policing, he understood why many of his constituents had welcomed it. “My ward was a residential ward, and the quality-of-life issue was the most important thing,” Mr. Rice said. “People wanted to come back home and be able to live their lives in peace. They supported stop-and-frisk. They supported being aggressive with the guys on the corners and moving them away.” But for many people in Newark, four decades after the riots, the tactics were akin to throwing gas on a smoldering fire. “There was an exponential spike in stop-and-frisk, racial profiling, excessive force,” said Udi Ofer, the former executive director of the A.C.L.U. of New Jersey. “That’s what happened in Newark.” Travis Rattray was 15 when he got caught in the dragnet in 2010. He was waiting for a friend on the friend’s porch when four officers drove up. One got out of the car and confronted him. “I was explaining to him what I was doing, why I was out there waiting,” Mr. Rattray recalled. “I wasn’t out here selling drugs or anything.” The officer accused him of belligerence and smashed his head into the door, shattering the glass, then pulled him down the stairs, according to Mr. Rattray’s account. At some point, he was joined by the other officers. “I was probably all of 110 pounds at the time, and I had two grown men trampling me with their knees while I was on the ground,” he said. Mr. Rattray screamed for his mother, who came running from down the street to find her son handcuffed, his braces pushed through his lip. “She had to pull braces off my lip. It was actually like stuck together,” he said. The officer faced criminal charges, but was acquitted despite a video of the beating. “It was overzealous,” said Bishop Jethro C. James Jr., senior pastor of Paradise Baptist Church, who went on to describe “an incident I will never forget.” It was Mother’s Day, and the police had blocked the street near his church to investigate a shooting. “The folks couldn’t get into the parking lot of my church,” he said. The pastor started to move the barricade. “All of a sudden, this young lady in a squad car, lights on, 10:30 in the morning, says, ‘Sir, don’t touch that barricade.’ I told her the barricade could not block my entrance, and she put her hands on her weapon. She had been trained under this zero tolerance. She didn’t look like me, but she was going to shoot a pastor in front of his church.” Mr. Booker, he said, later called him to apologize. The lawyer for the Pop Warner Three, Avidan Y. Cover, now a law professor at Case Western Reserve University, said that traffic stop was a case study of the police department’s practice of stopping vehicles, despite insufficient legal justification, in neighborhoods where drug dealing was considered common. The coach and his players eventually settled a lawsuit against the city. “They were paying their way out of these problems, but not changing police tactics,” Mr. Cover said. As complaints mounted, the A.C.L.U. began pushing for change. It called for dashboard cameras in police cars, but complained that the city would commit to placing them in only 12 percent of vehicles. Misconduct complaints seemed to disappear in the police bureaucracy, but when the A.C.L.U. paid to print brochures so citizens would understand the complaint process, “testers” sent to station houses couldn’t find them, although posters describing the process were visible. In a city where the police force still skewed whiter than the population, demands for an independent police monitor were ignored. In 2009, the A.C.L.U. issued a report card, grading Mr. Booker’s police practices as a “D.” “Both Mayor Booker and his appointed police director, Garry McCarthy, promised the A.C.L.U.-N.J. that they would reform the city’s police practices. However, we have not seen significant improvement,” the organization said in a statement. Mr. Booker said his efforts to stem police abuses while also fighting crime required “a massive turnaround effort on every imaginable level.” “This was like taking over a police department that was just devastated by lack of resources, lack of investment, with a lack of professionalism in terms of the way politics ruled in the department,” he said in the interview. Officers were still using typewriters instead of computers and filing forms in triplicate. “You have to understand. We didn’t have cars. I used to joke that they were like Flintstone cars, the ones we had, with holes in the floors,” Mr. Booker said. He also had to contend with the police union. “You fire a police officer for bad conduct, and then they force you to rehire them and you lose the court case,” Mr. Booker said. “I mean, this was a very frustrating time.” “At times I felt like I was caught between trying to push really fast and having a police union that pushes back on you,” he added. In the fall of 2010, after four years of sluggish progress, the A.C.L.U. turned to the Justice Department. Its petition cited 407 allegations that it said were indicative of police misconduct, most from Mr. Booker’s time as mayor. Since the beginning of 2008, the petition said, 51 lawsuits had been filed against the Newark police, many claiming beatings, theft, illegal searches and threats. An additional 50 people had filed notices that they planned to sue. Of 261 complaints filed with the department’s internal affairs unit, only one had been upheld. The petition, Mr. Booker wrote in his book, “felt like a stab in the back.” In the interview with The Times, he said his public criticism of the A.C.L.U. was born of a frustration that the organization took its complaint to Washington, rather than working with him behind the scenes to address the problems. “I felt we were working together, and that’s why I was sort of caught off guard by the actual complaint,” Mr. Booker said. “We share the same goals, ultimately.” He pointed to the many public safety reforms he was instituting that went beyond just the police department: “senior citizen groups working with police, a police-clergy alliance, the changes we were making in our court systems.” “It was very much this idea that the way we deal with these problems is build community,” he said. But to some officials in Newark, such initiatives — and the mayor’s media-grabbing derring-do — had taken precedence over the practical details. “His management style was in contrast with his public image that he was creating by going into a fire, by going into a shooting, or being followed by a camera,” said Augusto Amador, a member of Newark’s city council. Mr. Booker, he said, had erred by taking the word of subordinates that things in the police department were fine. “I think that, in a sense, contrasted with the fact that the city was not being run properly, and the problems we had in the police department reflected that.” Mr. Ofer, the A.C.L.U. official, said he was not sure that Mr. Booker fully understood the implications of his broken-windows policy at the outset, and he credited Mr. Booker with coming around. “It’s definitely fair to say that after the filing of the A.C.L.U. petition but before the Justice Department concluded its investigation, something clicked,” said Mr. Ofer, who is now the A.C.L.U.’s deputy national political director. “I don’t know if he was just persuaded by the petition.” As Mr. Booker tells it in his book, there was another factor: his chief of staff, Modia Butler, who sat him down in the mayor’s office and told him that he had grown blind to some of his constituents’ complaints. “If I stepped out of my crime-fighting bubble and was once again just another young black guy, I would not only embrace a comprehensive investigation, I’d be demanding it,” Mr. Booker recalled Mr. Butler telling him. The message was punctuated with a blunt assessment: “I had my head up my large black posterior region.” Mr. Butler also sold the potential Justice Department intervention as a blessing — “millions of dollars’ worth of free consulting” — for an underfunded department that had just laid off 13 percent of its force. As he digested the A.C.L.U. complaint, Mr. Booker realized that he was missing ground-level data on the community impact of broken-windows policing in Newark. “I had established no reliable analytics on these types of issues,” he wrote. “At a time when I was fond of using that old saying, ‘In God we trust, but everyone else bring me data,’ I was making the critical mistake of not looking at good data on police-community relations and misconduct. I was confusing activity with progress.” So when the Justice Department announced that it would be investigating allegations that police brutality, baseless searches, intimidation and false arrests had become commonplace in Newark, the mayor held a news conference and changed his tune. “Please come in,” he said. “We encourage you, we’re asking you, we’re welcoming you.” As crime rose in his second term after controversial cuts to the police department to shore up a sagging budget, Mr. Booker endorsed a civilian review panel. In what would be his final state-of-the-city address in 2013, he conceded that he had fought with council members on creating the board, but had been won over. “It is my vision that this citizen-led police oversight panel will help us to make Newark a model for police-community trust, respect, cooperation and, ultimately, safety,” he said. Mr. Booker was elected to the Senate seven months later. In 2015, his successor, Ras J. Baraka, issued an executive order creating the Civilian Complaint Review Board, though the police union recently won a lawsuit stripping it of subpoena power. In January, the Justice Department’s independent monitor issued a status report on the police department. The reform process, it wrote, is still a work in progress: While community meetings and trainings are improving, the department’s data systems “continue to contain critical deficiencies.”",The New York Times
2019,‘Newark’s Original Sin’ and the Criminal Justice Education of Cory Booker,"The Long Run Mr. Booker’s road from enforcer to reformer began with rocky oversight of the Newark Police Department. Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey at Voorhees College in South Carolina, last month.CreditCreditTravis Dove for The New York Times NEWARK — After football practice one summer evening in 2008, a Pop Warner league coach and two of his players were driving through the Clinton Hill section of Newark when a car swerved and blocked their path. Suddenly six police officers emerged from unmarked vehicles and forced them out of their car at gunpoint. “I felt like this: Don’t kill me, just send me to jail. Please don’t kill me,” one of the boys, Tony Ivey Jr., then 13, would later say in a videotaped interview. The officers, members of a narcotics squad, searched the car and found nothing but football equipment. The coach had been taking the boys to get hamburgers. The episode became known as the case of the Pop Warner Three, and it was one of more than 400 misconduct allegations cited two years later when the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey asked the Justice Department to investigate the Newark police. Newark’s mayor, Cory Booker, had swept into office in 2006 pledging a safer city through zero tolerance on crime. And while killings actually rose in his first year, over the next three they fell to historic lows. Yet grievances against the police were piling up in the city’s black wards, with allegations of racial profiling, unlawful stops and excessive force. The A.C.L.U. and local activists pressed for reforms, complaining about pushback from Mr. Booker, whose administration was promoting the plunging homicide rate. And when the A.C.L.U. finally went public with its plea to the Justice Department, the mayor went on WNYC radio, telling an interviewer that the petition was “one of the worst ways” to bring about meaningful change. “We don’t need people who are going to frustrate, undermine and mischaracterize our agency,” he added. Today, the mayor turned United States senator is running for president, building his candidacy, in no small part, on a platform of criminal justice reform that places him at the forefront of shifting national thought on questions of crime and punishment. On the campaign trail, he has made passionate pleas for expunging minor drug convictions, ending private prisons and expanding re-entry programs for the formerly incarcerated. He recently introduced legislation to remove marijuana from the federal list of controlled substances and to expunge past convictions, noting the disparate arrest rates of black and white users. In Newark a decade ago, he was a rising-star mayor with a problem. The way he handled it may offer insights into what kind of president he would be. Suburban-raised, Stanford-educated, Mr. Booker, 49, had begun his political career in Newark by moving into decrepit public housing to earn his inner-city bona fides, a story replayed on documentary film even before his election. When he took over City Hall with his zero-tolerance vow, he was walking a tightrope: Citizens were crying out for tougher policing, yet the crime-fighting tools he employed, including stop-and-frisk searches for drugs or weapons, ran the risk of alienating the very people he was seeking to help, especially given Newark’s searing history of police brutality. As Mr. Booker now tells it, he was both enforcer and reformer from the first, seeking to drive down crime while transforming a department crippled by scarce resources and antique equipment, and shot through with a culture of brutality protected by an intransigent police union. But an examination of Mr. Booker’s stewardship of the police department — based on dozens of interviews with officials and activists, Booker allies and Booker critics — suggests a mayor slow to make changes, fixated on the top-line measures of crime-fighting success while at times ceding too much authority to his police director and other aides. “He wasn’t as hands-on as I would have been, if you will, with the department,” said Ronald L. Rice, a state senator and former Newark police officer who lost to Mr. Booker in the 2006 mayoral election. As a new mayor navigating a city with time-hardened political powers, Mr. Booker often sought to play mediator rather than impose some of the confrontational reforms — such as an independent police monitor — that would have alienated the police union. “The police are a political force as well as a paramilitary force. And any politician that takes on the police to stop police brutality or violations of constitutional rights — they’re going to incur the wrath of the police,” said Lawrence Hamm, chairman of the People’s Organization for Progress, a progressive group that protested against the police during Mr. Booker’s mayoralty. In a recent interview, Mr. Booker described himself as intimately involved with policing, though he framed that involvement in the sort of communal, we’re-all-in-this-together terms that suffuse his campaign arguments for himself — his omnipresence at community meetings, his contact with block leaders into the wee hours of the morning, the civilian caravans he dispatched into dangerous precincts of the city. “I don’t know how much more hands-on you could get a mayor at that point,” he said. “This was a very big priority for me in my early days. I was just pushing like you wouldn’t believe. So I was on the streets.” Even so, he acknowledged that he should have more quickly reined in police abuses. He attributed that failure, in large part, to a reliance on “imperfect data, imperfect measures,” that erroneously showed complaints going down. “Even as I had strived my entire life to be a force for equity, fairness, justice and opportunity, it was obvious that some of our police practices, on my watch, were undermining not only my own values but my life’s mission,” he wrote in his 2016 book, “United.” Ultimately, the Justice Department intervened at the A.C.L.U.’s request and Mr. Booker came around, calling the investigation a “win-win” for the city. That inquiry would document a pattern of unconstitutional behavior by the Newark police: Three-quarters of pedestrian stops failed to meet the legal criteria, and blacks were at least 2.5 times more likely than whites to be stopped or arrested. The police department remains under a Justice Department consent decree. Today, in the era of Black Lives Matter, these tactics and their outsize impact on minority communities have helped drive a broad reassessment of criminal justice policies. That has left many politicians with tough-on-crime histories, especially on the Democratic side of the aisle, in a potentially awkward place. For Mr. Booker, there is an extra layer. In the interview, he recalled how, as a young black man, he had been a police target himself. He described the episode in a column written at Stanford in 1992, after Los Angeles had erupted in fire and rage over the acquittal of three police officers in the beating of Rodney King. Mr. Booker’s trial by police stop had come near the George Washington Bridge. “Five police cars, six officers, surround my car, guns ready,” he wrote. “I sat shaking.” The officers told him he had fit the description of a car thief. Newark’s policing problems date at least to the 1950s, when relations grew tense between the mostly white force and the city’s growing black population. The combustible mix exploded in July 1967, after two officers arrested and beat a black cabdriver who had passed their double-parked patrol car. Four days of rioting and looting killed 26 people, injured more than 700 and left Newark a smoldering national symbol of urban violence and blight. “I call police brutality in the city of Newark ‘Newark’s original sin,’” said Ronald C. Rice, a former councilman and the son of Mr. Booker’s opponent in the 2006 mayoral race. After a campaign built on twin promises of safer streets and downtown renewal, Mr. Booker inherited that traumatic legacy, along with a high rate of violent crime — three times the state average — that made Newark among the most dangerous cities in America. Cutting crime, and being seen cutting crime, became his obsession. He set up a BlackBerry alert for every shooting. He left a staff meeting to be with a 14-year-old struck by a stray bullet. He chased down a scissor-wielding bank thief in broad daylight. He was already famous, a nationally recognized face from the Oscar-nominated documentary of his failed 2002 mayoral campaign, run during his tenancy at the notoriously troubled Brick Towers. His first year in office was chronicled in a Sundance documentary series, “Brick City,” and he became a regular presence in living rooms around the country: talking Newark reforms on Oprah’s couch, trading late-night jokes with Jay Leno and Conan O’Brien, making frequent appearances on “The Colbert Report” and “Real Time with Bill Maher.” One blogger nicknamed him “Hollywood.” Everywhere he pointed to changes in Newark as evidence that his unique brand of positive, uplifting politics could work in this hardscrabble city. The changes were real. During his first term, homicides fell nearly 40 percent, and reports of rape, arson and auto theft saw similar declines. It was enough for Mr. Booker to grow boastful during his 2010 state-of-the-city address. “In Newark we are driving down crime in historic proportions,” he said, turning to the police officers in attendance. “Thank you for this tremendous, unprecedented work for public safety in our city.” At the heart of the effort was the zero-tolerance strategy brought across the river from New York by Mr. Booker’s new police director, Garry McCarthy. Under Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, New York’s police department, and Mr. McCarthy with it, had embraced what is known as “broken windows” policing. The idea was that eliminating outward signs of crime, like public drunkenness and urination, loitering, graffiti and, indeed, broken windows, would reduce more serious crimes. Mr. McCarthy was also an exponent of stop-and-frisk, which would be fiercely debated in New York. “I will enforce all laws, from traffic laws, with people speeding down our streets, to littering laws,” Mr. Booker had proclaimed in his inaugural address. In an interview, Mr. McCarthy said he had pitched Mr. Booker on bringing this style of policing to Newark. He told of a stop two weeks into his tenure when officers frisked a man drinking on a corner and found two guns. “So what’s the moral of the story?” Mr. McCarthy said. “If they had forgone the opportunity to intercede in the low-level event of drinking an alcoholic beverage in public, they would not have prevented a murder likely that night, because that guy was there to take his corner back.” Both Mr. McCarthy and Mr. Booker have said that, even as their officers stopped people on the street, their approach was meant to be constructive. They said it was a way to improve community relations, much as Mr. McCarthy had sought to do as a commander in the drug-ridden Manhattan neighborhood of Washington Heights. In the interview, Mr. Booker also pointed out that the Newark police had long used stop-and-frisk. Mr. Rice, the former councilman, said that while he personally opposed broken-windows and stop-and-frisk policing, he understood why many of his constituents had welcomed it. “My ward was a residential ward, and the quality-of-life issue was the most important thing,” Mr. Rice said. “People wanted to come back home and be able to live their lives in peace. They supported stop-and-frisk. They supported being aggressive with the guys on the corners and moving them away.” But for many people in Newark, four decades after the riots, the tactics were akin to throwing gas on a smoldering fire. “There was an exponential spike in stop-and-frisk, racial profiling, excessive force,” said Udi Ofer, the former executive director of the A.C.L.U. of New Jersey. “That’s what happened in Newark.” Travis Rattray was 15 when he got caught in the dragnet in 2010. He was waiting for a friend on the friend’s porch when four officers drove up. One got out of the car and confronted him. “I was explaining to him what I was doing, why I was out there waiting,” Mr. Rattray recalled. “I wasn’t out here selling drugs or anything.” The officer accused him of belligerence and smashed his head into the door, shattering the glass, then pulled him down the stairs, according to Mr. Rattray’s account. At some point, he was joined by the other officers. “I was probably all of 110 pounds at the time, and I had two grown men trampling me with their knees while I was on the ground,” he said. Mr. Rattray screamed for his mother, who came running from down the street to find her son handcuffed, his braces pushed through his lip. “She had to pull braces off my lip. It was actually like stuck together,” he said. The officer faced criminal charges, but was acquitted despite a video of the beating. “It was overzealous,” said Bishop Jethro C. James Jr., senior pastor of Paradise Baptist Church, who went on to describe “an incident I will never forget.” It was Mother’s Day, and the police had blocked the street near his church to investigate a shooting. “The folks couldn’t get into the parking lot of my church,” he said. The pastor started to move the barricade. “All of a sudden, this young lady in a squad car, lights on, 10:30 in the morning, says, ‘Sir, don’t touch that barricade.’ I told her the barricade could not block my entrance, and she put her hands on her weapon. She had been trained under this zero tolerance. She didn’t look like me, but she was going to shoot a pastor in front of his church.” Mr. Booker, he said, later called him to apologize. The lawyer for the Pop Warner Three, Avidan Y. Cover, now a law professor at Case Western Reserve University, said that traffic stop was a case study of the police department’s practice of stopping vehicles, despite insufficient legal justification, in neighborhoods where drug dealing was considered common. The coach and his players eventually settled a lawsuit against the city. “They were paying their way out of these problems, but not changing police tactics,” Mr. Cover said. As complaints mounted, the A.C.L.U. began pushing for change. It called for dashboard cameras in police cars, but complained that the city would commit to placing them in only 12 percent of vehicles. Misconduct complaints seemed to disappear in the police bureaucracy, but when the A.C.L.U. paid to print brochures so citizens would understand the complaint process, “testers” sent to station houses couldn’t find them, although posters describing the process were visible. In a city where the police force still skewed whiter than the population, demands for an independent police monitor were ignored. In 2009, the A.C.L.U. issued a report card, grading Mr. Booker’s police practices as a “D.” “Both Mayor Booker and his appointed police director, Garry McCarthy, promised the A.C.L.U.-N.J. that they would reform the city’s police practices. However, we have not seen significant improvement,” the organization said in a statement. Mr. Booker said his efforts to stem police abuses while also fighting crime required “a massive turnaround effort on every imaginable level.” “This was like taking over a police department that was just devastated by lack of resources, lack of investment, with a lack of professionalism in terms of the way politics ruled in the department,” he said in the interview. Officers were still using typewriters instead of computers and filing forms in triplicate. “You have to understand. We didn’t have cars. I used to joke that they were like Flintstone cars, the ones we had, with holes in the floors,” Mr. Booker said. He also had to contend with the police union. “You fire a police officer for bad conduct, and then they force you to rehire them and you lose the court case,” Mr. Booker said. “I mean, this was a very frustrating time.” “At times I felt like I was caught between trying to push really fast and having a police union that pushes back on you,” he added. In the fall of 2010, after four years of sluggish progress, the A.C.L.U. turned to the Justice Department. Its petition cited 407 allegations that it said were indicative of police misconduct, most from Mr. Booker’s time as mayor. Since the beginning of 2008, the petition said, 51 lawsuits had been filed against the Newark police, many claiming beatings, theft, illegal searches and threats. An additional 50 people had filed notices that they planned to sue. Of 261 complaints filed with the department’s internal affairs unit, only one had been upheld. The petition, Mr. Booker wrote in his book, “felt like a stab in the back.” In the interview with The Times, he said his public criticism of the A.C.L.U. was born of a frustration that the organization took its complaint to Washington, rather than working with him behind the scenes to address the problems. “I felt we were working together, and that’s why I was sort of caught off guard by the actual complaint,” Mr. Booker said. “We share the same goals, ultimately.” He pointed to the many public safety reforms he was instituting that went beyond just the police department: “senior citizen groups working with police, a police-clergy alliance, the changes we were making in our court systems.” “It was very much this idea that the way we deal with these problems is build community,” he said. But to some officials in Newark, such initiatives — and the mayor’s media-grabbing derring-do — had taken precedence over the practical details. “His management style was in contrast with his public image that he was creating by going into a fire, by going into a shooting, or being followed by a camera,” said Augusto Amador, a member of Newark’s city council.

2019,‘Not Just One of the Boys’: How Women Fought Their Way to N.Y.’s Seat of Power,"A century after the first two women arrived in Albany, New Yorkers elected a record number of women to state government. Here are the stories about how they made their mark. New York’s government has never looked so female. After record numbers of women ran and won in November, there are now 70 women in the State Legislature, the most women ever to serve in the state’s lawmaking body. But 2019 is not just a historic year for women in Albany; it’s also a historical one. Exactly 100 years ago, the state’s first-ever female legislators arrived in the Capitol, making New York the first state east of the Mississippi River to have women writing laws. (New Yorkers also played a role in the eight frontier states that had already elected women: Of the three women who became the first-ever female state legislators in Colorado in 1894, two were originally from New York City.) In the century since, New York’s female lawmakers have steered conversations on reproductive rights, child care, education, labor and far more. Their bills have often inspired change on the national level. They have also made clear how far New York still has to go. Even today, women make up only 32.9 percent of the Legislature. That makes New York 15th in the nation for female representation. (Only Nevada is half female.) Women still tell of sexual harassment and discrimination. Nevertheless, for 100 years, they have persisted. Here are some of their stories. 1919 New York’s first female legislators arrived at the State Assembly chambers on Jan. 1, 1919. The armed guard couldn’t believe it. “You must go to the other door, lady. This door is for members of the Assembly,” he told Ida Sammis, according to her written account of that day. I was thrilled by the opportunity for service which my new office gave me; yet sobered too, by a sense of my responsibility, as a pioneer, in the law-making body of our State. IDA SAMMIS The election of Ms. Sammis, from Long Island, and Mary Lilly, from New York City, directly followed women winning the right to vote in New York in 1917. The women’s suffrage movement had deep roots in their state, most famously at the 1848 Seneca Falls Convention, and New York was the first eastern state to grant women voting rights. Eleven western states and the Alaska territory had legalized women’s suffrage before. New York’s law predated the 19th Amendment, which guaranteed women’s suffrage nationally, by three years. Within 14 days of her arrival in Albany, Ms. Sammis, a Republican, became the first woman to sponsor a bill into law, when Gov. Alfred E. Smith signed her bill to regulate the hunting season for water fowl. She also attracted attention for her spittoon, a vessel that male legislators used to spit out chewing tobacco. Ms. Sammis had no use for hers — so she filled it with ferns instead, a story that female legislators still tell today. Ms. Lilly, a Democrat, sponsored a number of bills that might seem bold even today. One would have forced the fathers of children born out of wedlock to pay child support. Others would have abolished the death penalty for minors, and required women’s night court to have a female judge. None passed. The whole women’s program failed and was dubbed sentimentalism by the speaker of the house. MARY M. LILLY Her very first act as a legislator, she told a woman’s suffrage magazine in 1919, was to submit a resolution asking the state’s United States senators to lobby for the 19th Amendment. The women, who both ran for office as widows, left observers pleasantly surprised. A journalist wrote in the New York Tribune in 1919: “Both are revealing to the people that women with mature minds, at an age when some women are beginning to worry about crow’s feet, can be of real service to the state.” 1930-1950 After the initial victories of 1919, women’s progress in Albany slowed. Just three more women were elected in the 1920s. But then the Great Depression, followed by the wartime frenzy of the 1940s, pushed women into public life. In the Assembly, the number of women peaked in 1947 at eight — the highest number until 1975. In 1933, New York passed a minimum wage law barring employers from paying women “oppressive and unreasonable wages.” The law was critical in the nation’s labor fight: It was the first state minimum wage law after the Supreme Court in 1923 ruled such laws unconstitutional. The court would eventually strike down New York’s new law too, but the backlash paved the way for a federal minimum wage in 1938. Rhoda Fox Graves became New York’s first female senator in 1935, winning an empty seat upstate. She had tried for the same seat three years earlier, running against the incumbent, even though local party leaders told her not to. She lost by less than 200 votes. My house does not suffer any more than my husband’s business does if he is away for a day or two at a time. RHODA FOX GRAVES Ms. Graves served in the Senate for 14 years. By the time she died in 1950, she was still the only woman ever elected to the chamber. Still, the number of female legislators in the Assembly continued to rise, as men went to war and women stepped in to take their places. Mary Gillen, of Brooklyn, pushed to create school lunch programs. Maude Ten Eyck, from Manhattan, led a charge to make the state pay for child-care facilities. The state university system, which now includes more than 1.4 million students each year, owes its start to Elizabeth Hanniford, from the Bronx, who was elected in 1947 and helped write legislation to create the system. 1950-1980 When people talk about the women’s rights movement, they often mean the 1960s and 1970s, two heady decades of victories in state capitols, Washington and the courts. In 1972, Congress passed Title IX, to ban gender discrimination in public schools, and the Equal Rights Amendment. The Supreme Court decided Roe v. Wade in 1973. In New York, women saw their numbers more than double, and voters sent some of the state’s best-known women — especially black women — to Albany. There was Constance Baker Motley, the first black woman elected to the State Senate in 1964. (Bessie Buchanan became the first black woman in the Assembly, in 1955.) Before she won that seat, Ms. Motley wrote the complaint for Brown v. Board of Education. She later became New York City’s first female borough president, and then the first black female judge in Manhattan federal court. I don’t think I have any attributes anyone else doesn’t have. I’m just a plain ordinary person. I think you have to look at my career in terms the time in which I’ve lived. CONSTANCE BAKER MOTLEY There was also Shirley Chisholm, who was elected to the State Assembly in 1965. She would go on to be the first black woman in Congress, and the first black woman to run for president in 1972. I’m supposed to be seen and not heard. But my voice will be heard. I have no intention of being quiet. SHIRLEY CHISHOLM Women were also scoring major legislative victories. In the 1970s, led by Assemblywoman Rosemary Gunning, New York City launched a housing court for the first time. Perhaps the most iconic moment in New York’s legislative history came in 1970, when the state legalized abortion, three years before Roe v. Wade. The fight was led by Assemblywoman Constance Cook. An article in The New York Times described how she argued for the bill: “rarely raising her voice and never doubting ultimate success.” In politics, it’s the pushing that hurts, to put your colleagues to the test. That is not a popular thing to do. CONSTANCE COOK Ms. Cook’s husband was clear about who was the brains of the operation. “Hell, she’s a woman, right?” he told a reporter at the time. “And to get to where she is, she had to be at least as smart as the men in that game.” That was also true of Mary Anne Krupsak, a former state senator who in 1975 became the first female lieutenant governor of New York. To win that seat, she defeated in the primary the favorite of the state Democratic Party: a young man named Mario M. Cuomo. We’re going to have to win elections, be there ourselves, and make it happen. MARY ANNE KRUPSAK Ms. Krupsak wasn’t done there. After her first term, unhappy that her running mate, Gov. Hugh Carey, hadn’t given her enough to do, Ms. Krupsak decided to challenge Mr. Carey for his job instead. (She lost; New York still has not had a female governor.) 1980-2000 By the 1980s, women had been debating policy and writing laws in the Capitol for decades. But one thing hadn’t changed: The only bathroom near the Assembly chambers was for men. The female lawmakers decided to act. Every time an assemblywoman had to use the bathroom, she approached the majority leader with a pink piece of paper, telling him she needed a pass to the ladies’ room, recalled Assemblywoman Helene Weinstein, who was first elected in 1980 and is the longest-serving woman in Assembly history. At one point, the women presented the Assembly’s leadership with a pink toilet seat. After session ended that year, the men’s room was split in two, with one for women. When this building was built, there was not anticipation that there would ever be women serving in the chamber. HELENE WEINSTEIN The number of female legislators surged in these decades. Between 1979 and 1983, the number nearly doubled, to 22 up from 13. Then came the so-called Year of the Woman, the name commentators and historians gave to 1992, when more new women won seats in Congress than in any previous decade. The phenomenon arrived in Albany, too: Between 1991 and 1993, the number of female lawmakers jumped to 34 from 28, the biggest-ever two-year increase until 2017. After decades of serving only on “women’s issue” committees, such as social services, they won important posts on other powerful bodies, such as the judicial, education and ways and means committees. Still, many of their male colleagues saw them as something of a novelty. After Nancy Larraine Hoffmann, a former model and go-go dancer, won a Senate seat in 1984, The New York Post called her the “most beautiful woman lawmaker to reach the Capitol in decades.” Eight years into her tenure, other senators were still complaining that all she did was “shout, walk and wiggle.” Assemblywoman Deborah Glick deliberately tried to avoid attention to her appearance. The first openly gay member of the Legislature, she campaigned only in skirted suits and pearls before winning a seat in 1990. I think for the first two years, I never wore pants in the Assembly. The stereotypes were stupid but real. What are people expecting, me to roll up on a motorcycle? DEBORAH GLICK Ms. Glick, who successfully led a codification of Roe v. Wade this year, after more than a decade of trying, said much had changed since then. She recalled that when she first took office, people asked what it was like being the only gay legislator. “I’d say, ‘Homophobia would be a welcome change of pace because of the sexism,’” she recalled. 2019 Whether it was because of a blue wave or a pink wave or a fourth wave (of feminism), women ran for and won elected office in record numbers last year, in New York and around the country. It’s not just the numbers that are newsworthy, though they are: Twenty women in the State Senate and 50 in the Assembly, the most ever in both chambers, many of whom unseated incumbents and bucked the wisdom of talking heads. There’s also the staggering array of diversity that these women bring. Senator Andrea Stewart-Cousins, the head of the Senate Democrats, is the first woman to lead a New York legislative chamber, and Assemblywoman Crystal Peoples-Stokes, a Democrat from Buffalo, is the first woman to serve as the second-most powerful member of her chamber. Many people see only certain people in certain roles, so I know that I’ve been given an extraordinary privilege to be in a unique position, and to be a representative in some ways of people’s aspirations. ANDREA STEWART-COUSINS Assemblywoman Catalina Cruz is the first Dreamer. Assemblywoman Michaelle Solages was the first person to breast-feed on the chamber floor, and Senator Julia Salazar is the first democratic socialist, as well as one of the youngest-ever senators. In just two months, the women have led a dizzying push for long-stalled legislation, on both so-called women’s issues — contraceptive coverage and abortion, for example — and others, such as protection for immigrants, gun control laws and election reform. Men or women who are sexist and don’t have the same level of respect, it doesn’t matter what your job title is. They put you in one little place and they still think you’re there, no matter what. CRYSTAL PEOPLES-STOKES In a speech on her first day as Senate majority leader, Ms. Stewart-Cousins marveled at the fact that not too long ago, women had not been allowed on the Senate floor. Across the building, Ms. Peoples-Stokes was striking a similar note. She quoted Susan B. Anthony by saying that “whenever women gather together, failure is impossible.” Then she pivoted to another equally illustrious source. “‘We can’t change the world unless we change,’” she recited. “Biggie Smalls.”",The New York Times
2019,"Opinion | ‘On Paper, the Election Is the Democrats’ to Lose’","In response to Trump’s presidency, America has gotten more liberal — despite appearances to the contrary. Will it matter in 2020? Mr. Edsall contributes a weekly column from Washington, D.C. on politics, demographics and inequality. With more than a year and a half to go before the 2020 elections, Republicans can take comfort in a number of factors. The result of the Mueller investigation has set back Democratic hopes for an easy victory; the history of presidents running for a second term favors incumbents; and the economy under Trump is booming. Trump, however, has stepped on his own re-election prospects. His 2020 budget proposal calls for a $845 billion cut over 10 years in Medicare, a $25 billion cut in Social Security and a $1.5 trillion cut in Medicaid — programs that benefit the old, the disabled and the poor. More recently, the Department of Justice announced its support for a suit brought by a group of Republican attorneys general seeking to have the entire Affordable Care Act — which currently provides medical care for 8.5 million Americans — declared invalid. This foreshadows Trump’s gamble on his continuing ability to sell the dark issues of racial resentment and cultural alienation that dominated the 2016 campaign. But what is the current state of play in the American electorate? Two major studies released this month, the General Social Survey and the Cooperative Congressional Election Study, reveal some generally positive trends for Democrats: defections in the Midwest among Trump voters, as well as a shift to the left among all voters on issues of race, immigration and spending on the poor. G. Elliott Morris, a political analyst for The Economist, examined state-by-state data in the Cooperative Congressional Election Study. In an email, Morris wrote that the 2018 results make it clear that the president has lost a significant amount of support across the nation, both among his “core"" or “base” supporters and the rest. While millions of suburban whites who voted for Trump in 2016 cast ballots in 2018 for Democratic House and Senate candidates, “the defection runs much deeper than that,” Morris said. Not only did better-off suburbanites defect, “but more important so did working class whites.” “My analysis of the 2018 C.C.E.S. data,” Morris continued, “finds that 7 percent of white voters without a college education left Trump’s side.” These non-college whites were crucial to Trump’s Electoral College victory, and “small numbers of defections could make a big difference,” especially in the Midwest, where, according to Morris, they make up 57 percent of the voters, compared with 47 percent nationwide. In 2016, Trump capitalized on hostility to immigrants and minorities. Tom Wood, a political scientist at Ohio State, examined the General Social Survey data and found a noticeable, albeit modest, increase in social and cultural tolerance in 2018 among all voters. That a rise in tolerance is a negative for Republicans speaks for itself. “Quite contrary to popular concerns,” Wood wrote in an email, “it seems that the American public has only grown more tolerant and inclusive over recent decades,” before adding, “There’s been meaningful improvement, or stability, in each of these measures of tolerance since the early 1990s.” The General Social Survey found, for example, growing numbers in favor of federal spending for the poor. Among all those surveyed, the percentage saying that too little is spent on the poor rose from 70 percent in 2014 to 86 percent in 2018 among Democrats and from 38 to 56 percent among Republicans. “I’d be reluctant to infer too much about this for the electoral stakes for 2020,” Wood wrote, but it does suggest that much anguishing about the U.S. electorate — that it’s growing more adverse to minorities, and is becoming scientifically uniformed on issues of high political charge — is basically wrong. In another development with substantial political consequences, the national religious landscape is changing in a direction favorable to the left: Americans with no religious affiliation — a disproportionately Democratic constituency — have now become the largest religious group, edging past evangelical Americans and Catholics by the slimmest of margins, as the accompanying graphic shows. Percentage of Americans by religious affiliation, or lack of one.

Burge, Eastern Illinois University; figures do not add up to 100 percent because the surveys did not classify some respondents. The rise of nonbelievers is even more politically significant if white evangelicals are considered separately from their heavily Democratic black, Hispanic and other minority counterparts. White evangelicals, according to Ryan Burge, a political scientist at Eastern Illinois University, now make up 18.6 percent of the population, 4.4 percentage points less than the 23 percent of the population who profess no religious commitment. Among white evangelicals, Republicans outnumber Democrats 61.1 percent to 21.7 percent, according to Burge. Among those without religious affiliation, Democrats outnumber Republicans 53 percent to 21.5 percent. Robert Jones, the C.E.O. of the Public Religion Research Institute, and Paul Djupe, a political scientist at Denison University, observe that the edging out of white evangelicals by the nonreligious — known to pollsters as “Nones” — is almost certain to drive remaining white evangelicals further into the ranks of the Republican Party. Jones wrote in an email that, according to the new General Society Survey data, “today, the religiously unaffiliated outnumber white evangelical Protestants” by nearly 7 percentage points. The decrease in the percentage of white evangelicals began, Jones continued, during President Barack Obama’s eight years in power. According to Jones, the anxieties that produced about a changing country and white evangelicals’ place in it were actually integral to pushing white evangelical Protestants toward support for Donald Trump in 2016. So these changes are not just now upon us; they’ve been an engine driving the political dynamics for some time. But the new G.S.S. data shows them continuing unabated. In other words, in the short term, as they feel they are being eclipsed, white evangelicals become more politically engaged, more assertive — and more dangerous to their opponents. Burge claims, however, that the long-term future of the conservative evangelical movement could be in doubt: It’s going to run into a demographic brick wall going forward. 81 percent of evangelicals in 2018 were white, compared to 72.4 percent of the overall population. Among younger voters 18 to 25, “only 60 percent are white,” according to Burge. Ultimately, Burge argued, hitching their wagon to Trump may stave off some losses now, but it may be a fatal strategy in ten or twenty years. While the trends highlighted in the Cooperative Congressional Election Study and General Social Survey are generally favorable to the Democratic Party, they also point to obstacles Democrats face. Stephen Ansolabehere, a political scientist at Harvard, noted that more than two thirds of sitting presidents have been re-elected. He went on to point out that “presidential second term elections are driven strongly by the economy.” Ansolabehere maintains that if the economy is steaming along Trump will have the wind in his sails. The presidents who faltered in recent memory are Carter and Bush senior, both of whom faced weak economies. Brian Schaffner, a political scientist at Tufts, raised another issue. “There is certainly some good news for Democrats,” he wrote, but “the caveat seems to be that opinion is mostly moving for the people who were already inclined to support Democrats,” before adding: “What we don’t see is much movement among Republicans.” Schaffner, who serves along with Ansolabehere as a principal investigator at the Cooperative Congressional Election Study, also cautioned in an email against putting too much stock in the data showing that some voters who had cast ballots for Trump switched to Democratic House candidates in 2018. “The C.C.E.S. data do show that about twice as many Trump voters flipped to supporting Democrats in 2018 as Clinton voters switched to Republicans,” Schaffner wrote, “which suggests that a lot of those ‘blue wall’ states from 2016 may be leaning against Trump slightly as we head to 2020.” He warned, however, “that all of these shifts are relatively small in the aggregate, which means we aren’t necessarily too far from where we were in November, 2016.” While Trump in 2016 benefited from “a decent amount of luck” in losing the popular vote but winning the Electoral College, “it is certainly possible that it could happen again absent some larger shift in opinion.” “On paper, the election is the Democrats' to lose,” Zach Goldberg, a political scientist at Georgia State University, contended in an email. The problem for Democrats, in Goldberg’s view, is that the party and its candidate lack a coherent immigration policy or message that addresses the reasonable concerns of non-cosmopolitan voters. They’ve yet to grapple with the serious tension between supporting chain-based immigration and advocating for the enlargement of the welfare state. Moral appeals (“we’re a nation of immigrants”) will only take them so far, and often backfires. Goldberg has developed his own tolerance measure that points to a significant internal conflict among Democrats. What Goldberg found is that among whites, young liberals between the ages of 18 and 29 had the lowest levels of tolerance for racist speech, with a 1.31 score. In contrast, those with the highest tolerance scores were white liberals over the age of 50 (1.84) and young white conservatives (1.94). The 2018 Cooperative Congressional Election Study raises another question about the validity of pro-Democratic predictions based on these large-scale surveys. Alexander Agadjanian, a senior research associate in the political science department at M.I.T., pointed out that Democrats make up the largest share of those moving in a liberal direction on racial issues, while independent voters showed much smaller movement in a liberal direction. “Wow,” Agadjanian declared on Twitter, “white Democrats continue huge movement left on issues of race into 2018,” as the accompanying chart shows. Percentage of white Americans, by political affiliation, who agree with these two statements. 100% AGREE Republicans 84 82 75% Democrats 71 62 59 Independents 50% 47 45 Independents 32 25% Democrats 27 17 16 13 Republicans 2010 ’12 ’14 ’16 ’18 ’10 ’12 ’14 ’16 ’18 100% AGREE Republicans 84 82 75% 71 62 Democrats 59 Independents 50% 47 45 Democrats 32 Independents 25% 27 17 16 13 Republicans 2010 ’12 ’14 ’16 ’18 ’10 ’12 ’14 ’16 ’18 By The New York Times | Source: analysis of Cooperative Congressional Election Study data by Alexander Agadjanian, M.I.T. Election Lab; independents include those who don’t lean toward either party. These findings suggest that there are two reasons Democratic strategists should be wary of overreliance on rising levels of racial liberalism. First, most of the shift is among voters who are already loyal Democrats and therefore it does not represent major additional support for the party. Second, the shift is as much or more a response to Trump’s racism as it is a genuine shift in opinion. An article of faith among political professionals is that incumbents are helped by a strong economy. It is, however, not clear that this will apply to Trump, whose appeal in 2016 was strongest in sections of the country suffering economic distress. Another unknown is whether support for Trump’s re-election by the members of the white working class will be diminished — and turnout constrained — by any success the administration has in ameliorating their economic suffering. Put another way, insofar as anger over economic conditions motivated high turnout and approval among a key segment of Trump voters in 2016, it may be less of a motivating force in 2020. Jed Kolko, chief economist at Indeed, an online job site, produced graphics from the G.S.S. survey suggesting that unless the economy goes south, Trump’s white base will be far less discontented in 2020 than it was in 2016. Kolko found that in 2016, 31 percent of white Republicans said they did not expect their standard of living to improve; in 2018, only 8 percent were that pessimistic. Pessimism about future living standards declined only slightly for Democrats, from 24 to 21 percent. Trump’s explosive persona, the investigations underway in the House and by state and federal prosecutors, not to mention the quality of the Democratic nominee, will all play a crucial role in 2020 — along with much we cannot yet imagine. While many political analysts believe that the presidential contest favors the Democrats, Republicans have some advantages. Most important, at this point none of the Democratic presidential candidates has developed an authoritative and credible strategy to turn out loyal constituencies in large numbers while attracting persuadable but less liberal voters torn between left and right. Furthermore, the very diversity and heterogeneity of the Democratic coalition — one of its core strengths — has attracted an extraordinary range of candidates, which in and of itself breeds a diffusion of focus — what The Atlantic’s Ron Brownstein calls tough competition for “almost every group of voters imaginable.” Along those lines, Democrats have demonstrated a spectacular talent for tripping themselves up over the years, for losing when victory is in reach.

2019,‘One Day at a Time’ and Why Netflix Is Not Your Friend,"Critic’s Notebook On Thursday, Netflix canceled “One Day at a Time” after three seasons. This was a loss for fans and for TV. It was a sharp, funny sitcom, full of heart, that also represented groups of people who don’t get enough screen time: Latino, working-class, gay, nonbinary, military, recovering addicts, immigrants. It combined a classic TV form — the studio-audience family sitcom — with a sensibility that was utterly of the moment. It was one of TV’s best laughs and best cries. Well, as the theme song says, “This is life.” And this is TV. Deserving shows have gotten canceled since TV sets had rabbit ears. What was unusual this time was that Netflix put out an announcement on Twitter, explaining and mourning its own decision. I am not a mind reader. Maybe the sentiment is sincere, maybe it’s spin, maybe a little of each. Either way, Netflix is trying to throw away its cake and get credit for having baked it. TV outlets cancel shows all the time. But more often than not, they let the news come out quietly. In this case, Netflix, maybe anticipating a backlash, wanted to present itself as the disappointed fan as much as the practical-minded enterprise. So it frames the cancellation as less Netflix’s decision than something that just happened to it.“Simply not enough people watched.” You could write a book about all the complications packed into that “not enough.” First of all, neither you nor I nor anyone outside Netflix’s Fort Knox of data knows how many people watched “One Day,” nor any other Netflix show, because Netflix — with the exception of the occasional cherry-picked example like “You” — does not release that information. We have some objective sense of how many people watch “American Idol” and “The Walking Dead” and all the non-streaming shows measured by Nielsen. With Netflix, we have only its very vague word. And even if we knew how many people streamed “One Day,” would we know how many people short of “enough” that was? We would not. Possibly Netflix does not. Netflix sells subscriptions, not ads, so it’s not as if X number of viewers translates into Y dollars for a commercial. Instead, Netflix, like HBO, has to perform a calculation that may be more art than science: To what extent does this show yield subscribers? This is complicated by other unknowns. How much does the show cost to make? (Multicamera sitcoms tend to be cheaper than dramas with ambitious location shoots.) How does the show’s ownership factor in to the calculation? (“One Day” is produced by Sony, not Netflix.) In the end, though, “enough” means what it always does: A show gets canceled when it’s no longer worth it to the company that makes it. Netflix, like a lot of companies these days, likes to present itself on social media as having a personality and a playful voice. It doesn’t just want your patronage; it wants a relationship. It wants to be your TV buddy you spend time with. It wants to assure you that it loves the TV that you love, the better for you to transfer some of your affection toward its #brand. But Netflix isn’t your buddy, any more than ABC or HBO or whoever made your TV set. No corporation is. It is a concern whose purpose is to extract money from you in exchange for entertainment. Hopefully this transaction is worth it! But it remains a transaction. Yet Netflix’s statement — praising the cast and crew (rightfully) for their great work, saying the show “felt like home” — positions Netflix as a disappointed fan, rather than a business that made a choice. “Don’t take this as an indication your story is not important,” it says to fans who finally saw themselves represented in the show. That’s … nice. But canceling a show is literally a judgment of importance — you’re deciding what’s more important than the money you’d spend making the program. “We must continue finding ways to tell these stories,” it says. Hey, I found a way for you! Keep making the great story you already have, using the same money gusher you used to pay $100 million for reruns of “Friends”! On some level, I know, I’m being unreasonable. I’m not entitled to more seasons of a show just because I love it. TV needs more of the representation that “One Day” delivered, but Netflix is no more at fault for airing a mere three seasons of it than other networks that didn’t air it, or any show like it, at all. Netflix is not a charitable enterprise. It’s well aware that appealing to diverse audiences is not just good citizenship but key to a future in which it wants to be indispensable to as many people as possible. It tweets about representation for women of color; it’s invested in series like “Dear White People” and diversely cast romantic comedies. But long-term investment sometimes mean that when you have the high-class problem of creating an acclaimed show that doesn’t have as many viewers as you’d like, you stick with it. Or at least, you don’t cancel it yet try to retain the audience’s good will for the price of a few tweets. Yes, TV is a business. And one of the oldest principles of business is that talk is cheap.",The New York Times
2019,‘One Hundred Years of Solitude’ Is Coming to Netflix,"Books News Netflix announced on Wednesday that it had acquired the rights to develop Gabriel García Márquez’s seminal novel “One Hundred Years of Solitude” more than 50 years after it was originally published, in 1967. It will be the first time the novel is adapted for the screen. It was not for lack of interest. In a recent call, the Nobel Prize winning novelist’s son Rodrigo García who will be an executive producer on the project along with his brother Gonzalo, said that his father had received many offers over the years to adapt the book to film. But, while some of his shorter books were adapted, his father was concerned that “One Hundred Years of Solitude” would not translate well or fit within a single movie (or even two), he added. García Márquez was also committed to the story being told in Spanish, so many offers were “non-starters” to him. “In the last three or four years, the level and prestige and success of series and limited series has grown so much,” García said about his family’s decision to sell the development rights now. “Netflix was among the first to prove that people are more willing than ever to see series that are produced in foreign languages with subtitles. All that seems to be a problem that is no longer a problem.” Francisco Ramos, the vice president for Spanish language originals at Netflix, said the company had tried before to obtain rights to the novel, but had been met with resistance. He noted the success of series like “Narcos” and movies like “Roma,” which recently won the Oscar for best foreign language film, that have shown “we can make Spanish-language content for the world.” “One Hundred Years of Solitude” spans a century in the lives of the Buendía family, whose patriarch, José Arcadio Buendía, founded the fictitious Colombian town of Macondo. It’s considered a masterpiece of Latin American literature, bringing García Márquez to the forefront of the so-called Latin American Boom of the 1960s and ’70s and popularizing the genre of magical realism. Since its publication, the book has sold an estimated 50 million copies and has been translated into 46 languages. It’s still too early to know who will write for or be cast in the series, but Ramos said Netflix was committed to working with the best Latin American talent, and that the show would be shot in Colombia. The financial details of the arrangement were not disclosed. For Latin America — and Colombia — it’s the story of 100 years that “shaped us as a continent,” Ramos said, “through dictatorships, through births of new countries, through colonialism.” But he emphasized the story’s broad appeal: “We know it’s going to be very magical and very important for Colombians and Latin America, but the novel is universal.” “I’ve been hearing the discussion about whether or not to sell the rights to ‘One Hundred Years of Solitude’ since I was 8,” García said. “It was not an uncomplicated decision to make, for myself and my brother and my mom. It feels like a great chapter opened, but also a long chapter has closed.”",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | ‘One Hundred Years of Solitude’ in the Time of Netflix,"The announcement that it will become a series has reverberated throughout the world. Can the streaming giant do the classic justice? Professor Santana-Acuña specializes in Gabriel García Márquez’s literary work. Netflix’s recent announcement that it had acquired the rights for the first screen adaptation of “One Hundred Years of Solitude,” the classic novel by Gabriel García Márquez, has provoked an international controversy. Is it acceptable to adapt a work that its author, who died in 2014, did not want to take to the big screen? Other classics, from “The Odyssey” to “Hamlet"" to “War and Peace,” have been brought to film and television with varying degrees of success. Like them, “One Hundred Years of Solitude,” published in 1967, has a life that extends beyond the printed page. It has inspired songs and ballets, an opera and a play, dozens of paintings, an exclusive Japanese drink, and even the name of an offshore oil platform. Now its time has come for a screen adaptation. The author’s children, Gonzalo, a graphic designer and editor, and Rodrigo, a film and TV director, will be the executive producers of the Netflix series. The crux of the matter is that the adaptation of the novel can now benefit from changes in the modes of creation, production and circulation of audiovisual materials. Today, directors and writers have more creative freedom to tell stories that do not need to bend to Hollywood standards to be successful. Thanks to the algorithms used to track user activity, content production is driven by data about what the public views and how they view it, and consumers can watch recommended content wherever and whenever they like. Netflix, with its nearly 140 million subscribers, leads many of these changes. Therefore, the most important debate is not to speculate on the quality of the future “One Hundred Years of Solitude” series or its faithfulness to the novel, but to analyze how the global distribution of the series in more than 190 countries can give new life to the stories of Macondo and the Buendía family. The success of the “Narcos” series and the feature film “Roma” prove that there is a market hungry for stories based in Latin America. “One Hundred Years of Solitude” never lacked suitors for its adaptation to the cinema screen. The author’s correspondence reveals that he received offers even before winning the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1982. Contrary to popular belief, he did not reject the offers because of a distrust of cinema, which was in fact one of his professional passions. In 1963, two years before starting to write this novel, he worked as a film screenwriter in Mexico City. He was doing so well that in a letter that year he told his friend Plinio Apuleyo Mendoza that he pictured himself soon working in Hollywood. [Need help deciding what movies or TV shows to stream next? Subscribe to our Watching newsletter.] It was thanks to cinema that García Márquez learned to unite magic and reality, two fundamental elements of “One Hundred Years of Solitude.” He used many cinematographic tricks and techniques when writing it. And he did so from the first page: The moment when Colonel Aureliano Buendía stands before the firing squad ends in a flashback, to when he first touched ice as a child and Macondo was only a small village. What did cause the writer some consternation about adapting his novel was determining which audiovisual format was best suited to convey the stories of Macondo. He knew that such a work could not be compressed into a few hours. Therefore, what he actually opposed was any adaptation with a feature film format. García Márquez had more trust in television’s narrative possibilities. In 1989, he told The New York Times that with TV “in one night you can reach 10 million viewers and that’s the idea — to reach that audience with ideas and quality.” He knew that “One Hundred Years of Solitude” had that potential. When the actor Anthony Quinn was interested in adapting it, he told the writer that the novel would be “ideal for a 50-hour television serial.” All literary classics share an ability to reinvent themselves generation after generation, but each classic has its own challenges for screen adaptation. A respectful adaptation must consider details such as local speech and culture, translated into a more universal dimension for a global audience. Otherwise, the series will fall flat, as did the adaptations of his books “Chronicle of a Death Foretold” and “Love in the Time of Cholera.” The lack of dialogue in “One Hundred Years of Solitude"" is one of the most complex technical obstacles. Dialogue makes up only 5 percent of the book. Characters rarely exchange more than three sentences in a row, buried in pages and pages of narration. In his writing of the novel, the author eliminated many phrases from the final text that could be rescued to resolve some of the difficulties of adaptation. Omissions include characters, paragraphs, images and even dialogue that could be heard onscreen for the first time. Another key challenge is how to tell the story. In the novel, linear time — from the founding of Macondo until its disappearance — is intermingled with cyclical time: The names of the characters and their tragedies are repeated. In addition to its unmistakable poetic prose and magical realism, “One Hundred Years of Solitude” is a very sensory work. Is it possible to bring to the screen dozens of scents, like the fragrance that tormented the men seduced by Remedios the Beauty; flavors, like the taste of the substance that freed the inhabitants of Macondo from the plague of insomnia; and textures, like when Aureliano Buendía touched ice for the first time? If anything affirms the transformation of “One Hundred Years of Solitude” into a series, it is the unstoppable power of the classics to enter our lives through formats that are entirely different from those established by their creators. As for the catastrophic predictions about its adaptation by Netflix, the reality is that no classic has lost that distinction because of a bad adaptation. On the contrary, the announcement that “One Hundred Years of Solitude” will become a series has reverberated throughout the world, only reinforcing its standing. Álvaro Santana-Acuña is a sociology professor at Whitman College and is working on a book about how “One Hundred Years of Solitude” became a classic.

2019,‘Out of Blue’ Review: Seeking a Suspect in a Suspect Adaptation,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. Jean-Luc Godard’s 1966 film “Masculin Féminin” was intended to be an adaptation of two Guy de Maupassant stories. When representatives for Maupassant’s estate saw the finished film, they found it so remote from anything the author wrote that they asked that he not be cited in the credits. I thought of this anecdote while watching “Out of Blue,” which, its end credits do tell us, was adapted from Martin Amis’s 1997 novel, “Night Train.” Written and directed by Carol Morley, the movie retains several of the novel’s central characters, but it is so far from the source material otherwise that midway through I asked myself, “Hey, isn’t that the name of a character in a Martin Amis novel?” That name is of Mike Hoolihan, a homicide detective in New Orleans. She’s played by Patricia Clarkson, who clearly enjoys doing detective postures. A recovering alcoholic, Mike is investigating the puzzling death of Jennifer Rockwell, an astronomer whose words “In order for us to live, a star has to die” are the first we hear. An eager colleague of Mike’s wonders if this is the work of “the 38-caliber killer,” who terrorized their city back in the day. “He’d be old by now,” he offers helpfully. There’s but a single elderly person in the primary cast, so don’t strain yourself. “Out of Blue” botches the source material’s story, misses its mordant humor and inverts its despairing core. Much of this is the filmmaker’s prerogative. But “Out of Blue” doesn’t strike out only as an adaptation. What it offers on its own is tepid and predictable.

But reading the dozens of accounts that poured in each day filled me with a renewed sense of appreciation and frustration for these women’s service. Too many had to force their way into an institution that has been designed for and upheld by men for generations. Too many were told they didn’t belong. And too many felt the physical and mental consequences of disrupting and threatening the male-dominated status quo in ways that should have been punishable — and yet were repeatedly ignored by senior military leaders. This collection of stories is both a celebration of women’s military service and a reckoning of what they’ve endured. It’s also a recognition that the military still has a long way to go before we see any real resemblance of gender equality. As Capt. Ja’Mia Rowland wrote: “I have become accustomed to being the only person in the room who looks like me.” You can read her story and 39 others here. The Times also asked readers with a woman in their family who serves or served to tell us about that person. Here is a selection of those responses. Jill Hardy, Temecula, Calif. My mother, Doris Van Meter Peterson, will be 100 this year. She joined the Marine Corps at the beginning of World War II and was the face of female Marines — she was instrumental in getting women to join. She met my father, Clifford O. Peterson Sr., while stationed in Atlanta, in 1944. She still lives in the home she shared with my father. She is an amazing woman who volunteered at a hospital in Redding, Calif., until four years ago. She only had to stop because she had fallen and broken a hip — while sweeping the front steps. Backward! Randi Mahoney, New Boston, Mich. My mother, Amy Hodge, was attached to the 10th Mountain Division out of Fort Drum in New York, during which time she deployed to Mogadishu, Somalia. She told me that while there she pulled over 300 dead bodies out of a river that were contaminating the local drinking water; she was involved in firefights; she held a friend while he died. The biggest challenge I’ve seen my mom face is the lack of recognition that she even served. When she walks into any veteran event or local post, she is instantly written off as a wife, and her stories and experiences are ignored, even though nine times out of 10 she is the most badass person in the room. Dr. Anne Harrington, Hurlburt Field, Fla. My wife, Col. Brenda Cartier, is the first female senior military leader in Air Force Special Operations and one of the first women to fly and command Special Operations combat missions. Brenda flew the AC-130 gunship, one of the deadliest aircraft in the Air Force. In 2003 she was in a gunship overhead during the rescue of Pfc. Jessica Lynch, the first successful P.O.W. rescue since World War II. Brenda is an amazing spouse and role model to L.G.B.T. airmen. We actually get stopped in public by young people who recognize her and thank her for being so out and open about who she is. Capt. William Salvin, Dripping Springs, Tex. I’m a captain in the Navy Reserve. My daughter, Paige Skinner, is a public affairs officer in the Air Force. When she was commissioned, I wanted to give her advice, but I knew that my experience as a man in the military would be vastly different from hers. I sent a note to the amazing women with whom I served over the years, put together a book of advice from them and gave it to my daughter.

2019,‘Pick My Cotton’: Video of Mock Whipping Prompts Fraternity to Expel 4 Students,"Four University of Georgia students were expelled from their fraternity on Saturday after a video surfaced in which one of the students made a mock whipping motion with a belt and shouted at another to “pick my cotton.” In the video, which was initially posted to Snapchat and then reposted on Twitter, two white students are on a bed and two others are standing. One student is covered by a comforter and another holds a belt. When one of the students says “pick my cotton,” another responds, “I’m not black.” After repeatedly saying “pick my cotton” while making a whipping motion with the belt, a different student says, “You’re not using the right words.” That’s when one of them says: “Wait, get a video of it. Pick my cotton,” followed by a racial slur. The students all start laughing, the video shows. The University of Georgia condemned the video. “Racism has no place on our campus,” it said. The university, which is in Athens, about 70 miles east of Atlanta, has the full-time equivalent of 37,190 students, about 70 percent of whom are white. In a memo, Gregory A. Roskopf, the chief risk officer of the fraternity, Tau Kappa Epsilon, said the local chapter was temporarily suspended. In a news release, the fraternity said it was “disgusted, appalled and angered by the remarks” in the video and expelled four members. It said the video was shot in a setting that was unconnected to a fraternity function and did not take place on any chapter premises. The statements, the expulsion of the students from the fraternity and Tau Kappa Epsilon’s temporary suspension of the local chapter did little to quell the concerns of black students. “It is just unfathomable that stuff like this is going on at the school I go to, learn at and attend,” Obinna Ibebunjo, 23, a senior, said. “We are extremely outraged and offended by the ignorance on a modern-day college campus,” said Mr. Ibebunjo, who is a member of the Omega Psi Phi Fraternity, a historically black fraternity. “They were suspended from the fraternity but they were not reprimanded by the school, so it was a slap on the wrist,” he said. “We think colleges are moving to a more liberal state and being more progressive, but just the fact that you would record it and post it is extremely ridiculous.” Black students are working to raise awareness and to create a more inclusive campus. “We think we are a part of a university that is inclusive, but this happens more often than it should,” Mr. Ibebunjo said. An earlier version of this article included a quotation from a University of Georgia student that referred incorrectly to Richard B. Russell Jr. While he was a segregationist, he was not a slave owner.",The New York Times
2019,‘Pied Piper’ of College Admissions Scam Had All the Answers,"He was part coach, part therapist, part motivational speaker and part name dropper. Like a traveling salesman, he sought out clients near and far, selling dreams of prosperous futures. In central Illinois, William Singer made a passionate pitch to local business executives who came by invitation to a hotel meeting room. In Sacramento, he addressed rapt audiences of parents at private schools. He twice spoke to well-heeled employees at Pimco, the giant investment management firm based in Newport Beach, Calif. His message was confident and concise: He knew the secret to getting into college. “He was well dressed, he was well spoken, he had a PowerPoint,” said Eric Webb, a father of two who drove to Champaign, Ill., from Peoria in 2012 to hear Mr. Singer talk about building children’s brands, leveraging their talents and finding the schools of their dreams. Intrigued, Mr. Webb hired Mr. Singer to prepare his son and daughter for college, paying him at least $5,000 a year for several years of monthly visits to dole out sage advice. But even as Mr. Webb’s teenage son began counseling sessions with Mr. Singer in 2012, federal prosecutors say, Mr. Singer was simultaneously bribing a college tennis coach on the East Coast and setting up a foundation on the West Coast to camouflage bribes from rich parents. Mr. Singer, 58, became the mastermind of an enormous, elaborate scheme carried out over years, brazenly paying off coaches and test monitors, faking exam scores and fabricating student biographies, prosecutors say — all to help wealthy parents cheat their children’s way into desirable colleges. [Your questions about the college admission scandal answered.] Thirty-three parents have been charged in the case, and more indictments may be on the way. Mr. Singer, who pleaded guilty to racketeering conspiracy and other counts last week, has claimed on his website that he had thousands of clients, though it is unclear how many of them he helped to break the rules. As news of the charges spread, some of Mr. Singer’s former clients around the country said they were stunned and shaken. To them, Mr. Singer, who was known as Rick, had always been strategic and unabashedly pushy, but they said they had never heard him suggest breaking a law. “He was a great mentor to me,” said Dylan Klumph, a college football player who said Mr. Singer counseled him. Mr. Singer worked in the college counseling business for much of three decades, but he appeared to reach a pivot point around 2011. The earliest in the long list of his deceptions that investigators have traced so far, outlined in more than 200 pages of court documents, date back to that year. [Here’s a history of college admissions schemes, from encoded pencils to paid stand-ins.] Around the same time, Mr. Singer was moving to a new house in a flashier community in Southern California; starting a charitable foundation that prosecutors say was used as a clearinghouse for bribes; and frenetically seeking out clients in cities across the country. Those who knew Mr. Singer described him in interviews as a man constantly on the move, in and out of airports, hotels, boardrooms and living rooms. He was selling himself — a trim former athlete with salt-and-pepper hair who bragged about his connections in college admission offices and his encyclopedic knowledge of the higher-education landscape. He sold copies of his self-published guide to college admissions with a close-up of his face on the cover. Mr. Singer, whose representatives did not respond to interview requests, carefully cultivated networks of parents around the country — typical middle-class families in Illinois, business moguls and celebrities in Los Angeles, and even professional athletes — who used his college counseling services and invited him into their homes and inside their deepest worries. They all wanted the same thing: An answer to the vexing question of how to beat the odds at selective schools that turn away as many as 20 applicants for every one they accept. “He was like the Pied Piper,” said Dorothy Missler, a former administrator at a Jesuit school in Sacramento who had an encounter with Mr. Singer about 20 years ago. “He played the music, and they followed him down the lane.” In the Sacramento of the 1990s, Mr. Singer was not just an ambitious up-and-comer, but a pioneer. Margie Amott, a certified educational planner in Sacramento, said she was a volunteer at a public school in the mid-1990s when Mr. Singer spoke at a college-night event. He was discussing his services as an admissions consultant, a relatively unusual occupation in those days, when college competition was fierce but had not yet exploded out of control. “He was the first consultant of this type in Sacramento,” she recalled. “He was persuasive, articulate and implied he knew the tricks, and that he could really help kids get an edge to get into college. I refer to him as a master salesman. He was a great pitcher. He was believable.” Mr. Singer was a somewhat unlikely messenger. In his own youth, he appeared to display neither wealth nor connections as he bounced from a Catholic university to a community college, before eventually graduating from Trinity University in San Antonio, a respected private institution but not one of the Ivy League-level names he was in the habit of mentioning to his top clients. [How honest college applicants are awaiting admissions results.] As a college student and competitive baseball and basketball player in 1985, he mused to the university’s student newspaper, The Trinitonian, that he might like to work with young people someday. “I like to communicate with people, and I’m definitely a person who works hard on my own skills,” he said. In the article, he was pictured in his basketball jersey, the Trinity Tigers’ No. 25. “I don’t like to lose,” he told the paper. In the years that followed, Mr. Singer dabbled in a series of jobs and companies that he created, but always returned to counseling people for college. The parents who hired him early on, in Sacramento, said they were thrilled by his confident, exacting approach. He swept into presentations, polished, authoritative and willing to drop names of renowned schools and clients from the top rungs of industry. He conveyed a calm certainty about the mysteries of the stress-inducing admissions system. Janis Heaphy Durham, a former publisher of The Sacramento Bee, said that she enlisted Mr. Singer in late 2006 or early 2007, when he was well known among parents around town. “We hired him to keep Tanner on track,” she said of her son. Although her son’s grades in high school were “in order” and he was being scouted by at least two universities as a rugby recruit, Ms. Durham recalled that Mr. Singer “helped us navigate the application process, which can be daunting, and he had a good understanding of the personalities of the various schools.” She would sometimes come home and find Mr. Singer sitting at her dining room table, working with her son on his homework. But other people who encountered Mr. Singer at the time — particularly professional peers and counseling competitors — viewed him with suspicion. Some said he seemed to be promising things he couldn’t necessarily deliver. Others chafed at his aggressive approach. Jill Newman, a longtime counselor at schools in Sacramento, said that in meetings at Rio Americano High School, where she was working, Mr. Singer would forcefully advocate for students whose parents had retained him. “He would just come in and be very demanding, and say, ‘We want this kid transferred to this teacher, and how do we make this happen,’” she recalled. “He clearly schooled the families on how to behave. Parents would say things like, ‘Rick told us to do this.’” Ms. Amott eventually got into the business herself. She concluded that Mr. Singer didn’t know much about what he was doing. She also questioned his ethics. “It drove me nuts that he would say that he could get you into X college, because an ethical consultant cannot make promises like that, since there are no guarantees,” she said. Around 2011, Mr. Singer’s life had reached a turning point. His marriage had officially ended that year, according to court records. But his business was flourishing, as he continued to travel frequently and search out more clients. He appeared to be moving on from Sacramento and establishing a new home base in glitzier Southern California: In May 2012, Mr. Singer bought a house in Newport Beach for $1.55 million, according to property records, getting a mortgage for most of it. Bill Townsend, an entrepreneur, met Mr. Singer around 2010 through a mutual friend, and was enlisted to build a new website for Mr. Singer, one that would more effectively tell the story of his growing business. Mr. Singer spoke of his increasingly high-profile clientele, Mr. Townsend said. “As I recall, a lot of tech contacts, media contacts, politicians,” he said. “It was an expensive service. Back then, it was about $12,000 or $15,000 a year.” It was around 2011, prosecutors said, that Mr. Singer began committing the crimes that were detailed in documents last week, soliciting bribes from parents to facilitate their children’s admissions to college — something he called a “side door” entrance to the entire college competition. Under his theory, the “front door” was for ordinary, law-abiding students applying the normal way and hoping for the best, and the back door was for families who made large donations to schools in the hope of boosting a student’s chances for admission there, a practice that is legal but not certain to succeed. [Learn more about how families who have legally hired college admissions consultants view the ethics of their choices.] Until the operation was interrupted by the F.B.I. eight years later, Mr. Singer promoted his side-door method, including faked athletic credentials and cheating on tests, as something the other methods were not: a sure thing. He recruited coaches to his plan by telling them that plenty of other coaches were already involved, and that he had handled plenty of student applications this way. “You can tell them I did 760 of these this year,” he told a coach last year. And to parents, he conveyed the same sort of certainty and swagger about his side-door method that he had shown for decades about standard college admissions coaching. Could cheating on a standardized test get a family in trouble? “I have never seen it happen,” Mr. Singer assured the father who asked. Explaining the heart of his plans in a call last year that was secretly recorded by investigators, Mr. Singer told one parent: “There’s lots of ways to do this. I can do anything and everything, if you guys are amenable to doing it.” Even as he talked to families in Southern California, Massachusetts and Illinois, Mr. Singer was aiming to expand his reputation nationally. In YouTube videos, Mr. Singer gave tips on college admissions aimed at students and parents — and promoted his company, the Edge College & Career Network, called The Key. At least once, he made passing mention of his son, Bradley, saying that as a father, he understood how stressful the college-admissions process could be. In 2012, Mr. Singer stepped more deeply into criminal activity, prosecutors said, by setting up the Key Worldwide Foundation, the charity that was used to disguise the true nature of payments from parents. It was ostensibly established to provide a gateway to higher education for disadvantaged students, but it made financial donations to colleges and universities that were the top choices of Mr. Singer’s more affluent clients. The foundation’s tax returns show that it received more than $7 million in contributions from 2013 through 2016, and that it listed around $2.7 million in donations that it distributed in the same period, mostly to universities. It is unclear whether the donation figures listed in the tax returns are accurate, since the foundation has been implicated as a major tool in the scheme. Through his foundation, Mr. Singer donated $150,000 to DePaul University in Chicago while his son was an undergraduate there, said Carol Hughes, a spokeswoman for the college, noting that the younger Mr. Singer graduated in 2017. The donations, she said, were intended to support students as they studied abroad. Between 2011 and 2018, parents paid Mr. Singer some $25 million to get their children into the right schools, prosecutors said. By the end, as investigators were learning of the scheme, Mr. Singer seemed to have his illegal methods well established. He had grown bold about his side door, even cocky. When he sought out photos of a student that he planned to insert digitally into a real image of an athlete, he breezily told one parent not to worry, he had done this “a million times.” In communications with colleges, he laid out false athletic credentials for students that might easily have been checked and revealed as lies; he listed one high school student as a “3-year Varsity Letter winner” in water polo and “Team M.V.P. 2017,” even though the girl did not know how to play the sport. Last summer, when an adviser at the University of Southern California asked an incoming freshman about his plans for the track team, the student — unaware that his parents and Mr. Singer had sold him as a track standout, complete with a pole-vaulting photo — phoned home, clearly confused. The student’s worried mother then called Mr. Singer, who brushed it all off. “I would just go about your business and let it be,” he told her. When investigators stepped in last year, and confronted Mr. Singer with his years of questionable dealings, he turned on some of the families who had poured out their deepest parenting fears and trusted him with their complicated family dynamics. In phone conversations that Mr. Singer knew were being recorded by the F.B.I., he prodded parents to acknowledge their part in shared crimes. If a parent sensed a problem and suggested meeting in person, Mr. Singer agreed — and then wore a wire. Even then, he did not fully commit to cooperating with the government, the records show. Mr. Singer had built his business on relationships, recommendations and trust, and he appeared unwilling to tear all of it down again. At one point last year, the authorities say, Mr. Singer secretly reached out to several people involved in the plot — people he had presumably once sold on his know-how, his power, and himself — and warned them about the criminal investigation.",The New York Times

2019,‘Project Runway’ Is Back on Bravo. Here’s What to Expect.,"After life with Harvey Weinstein, the show is back on Bravo for its 17th season. Are you ready to love again? “Project Runway” arrived on television at the end of 2004, the same year that Mark Zuckerberg created a website called The Facebook at Harvard. In 2007, Apple released the first iPhone. Three years later, when “Project Runway” was in its seventh season, Instagram appeared in the App Store. That tech-history lesson is to say: 2019 looks a whole lot different from 2004. So when Bravo reacquired the rights to “Project Runway” last year, the network wasted no time in recalibrating the show, which will have its premiere on Thursday. The most significant of the changes is the cast. Tim Gunn and Heidi Klum, whose faces have been synonymous with “Project Runway,” announced last September that they would not return to the show and that they are developing a new fashion series with Amazon, where viewers will be able to buy the styles they like through the website. Zac Posen, who replaced the designer Michael Kors, also departed. Nina Garcia, now the editor of Elle, is the only remaining member of the original cast. “Heidi and Tim were the originals, and I enjoyed working with them,” said Shari Levine, the executive vice president for current production at Bravo. “But this is 15 years later. It’s important that the show evolve and look to the next generation.” Die-hard fans may embrace the new cast or see them as impostors, but Bravo’s picks carry significant credentials. The new host is the supermodel Karlie Kloss, who is also the founder of Kode With Klossy, a nonprofit that hosts coding camps for girls around the country. Christian Siriano, who won the “Project Runway” competition in its fourth season and made a name for himself as a designer to the stars and a champion for inclusivity, is the new mentor. Joining Ms. Garcia on the judges’ row are Elaine Welteroth, who is the former editor of Teen Vogue, and the designer Brandon Maxwell, who most recently made a splash dressing Lady Gaga for the Oscars. Guests will include the rapper Cardi B and Dapper Dan, who in the 1980s and ’90s made “knockups” using the Gucci logo without permission and who has recently made a buzzy comeback with a Harlem atelier and an authorized Gucci collaboration. Bravo is surely counting on these casting choices to help revive the show’s ratings. According to Nielsen, Season 5 drew the most viewers: almost 3.6 million per episode. By Season 16, the last to air, the audience was roughly half that. Though “Project Runway” was ahead of the curve in some ways — bringing in a designer who incorporated magnets, cameras and other technology into her work, for instance, or asking contestants to make clothing from waste (a Heron Preston move before Heron Preston) — the show also had moments best left in the past. Fans will remember an episode in which Mr. Gunn called a model “zaftig” and then elaborated, saying, “She’s a little large.” Today Mr. Gunn would be swiftly “canceled” across social media for such a comment. The culture has changed. And one of those changes — the #MeToo movement — is in part the reason the show is back on Bravo. “Project Runway” was owned by the Weinstein Company, which declared bankruptcy last year after dozens of women accused Harvey Weinstein of sexual misconduct that spanned decades. Though the show ran on Bravo for its first five seasons, the Weinstein Company signed a deal in 2008 to move it to Lifetime. But after allegations against Mr. Weinstein became public in 2017, Lifetime’s parent, A&E Television Networks, accused the Weinstein Company of breaching its contract and ended all of its obligations to the show, including the airing of Seasons 17 and 18. In May 2018, a Delaware bankruptcy court approved a bid from Lantern Capital Partners to acquire the Weinstein Company’s assets. Days later, Bravo announced that “Project Runway” would return. “It’s been on another network for 10 years, but if you asked a lot of people, they would tell you it’s a show on Bravo,” Ms. Levine said. “We defined it, and it defined us.” A long-running criticism of “Project Runway” is that over a 14-year run, it produced only one high-profile designer: Mr. Siriano. Many of its contestants opened boutiques or started their own lines, but none reached the mainstream recognition of Mr. Siriano. “A lot of people went to design school and wanted to become designers because of that show,” said Fern Mallis, the industry executive widely credited with organizing New York Fashion Week (and who appeared on “Project Runway” several times as a guest judge). “On the other hand, it falsely created a sense that if you sew two pieces of fabric together, you’re a designer.” Ms. Mallis added that many of the challenges tested the contestants’ artistic abilities but not their understanding of the moneymaking side of fashion. “Your business still has to manufacture, deliver and price items correctly,” she said. Some of the changes in the 17th season nod to those concerns. Bravo has increased the prize money to $250,000; thrown in a mentorship with the Council of Fashion Designers of America, which runs the main New York Fashion Week calendar; and added a “flash sale” component to some of the episodes, which will allow viewers to purchase the top looks, as decided by them and the judges. “One of the disconnects about the previous show was that if you loved it, you couldn’t necessarily buy it,” Mr. Maxwell said in a phone call. The change was both a response to the new culture of consumerism — items are a click away — and a way to engage the audience in real time. “Everything is changing in retail,” Ms. Kloss said over breakfast at Mercer Kitchen in SoHo in February. “Here we are in SoHo, and there are so many vacant spaces.” Ms. Welteroth, sitting next to Ms. Kloss, chimed in. “You cannot underestimate the power of the digital revolution,” she said. “Before, there was no dialogue unless you were writing a letter and snail-mailing it in. Now you hear the voices of the people you’re reaching instantly. That gives the consumer or the reader much more power. You can no longer ignore marginalized voices who are saying, ‘Hey, this doesn’t reflect me, this offends me, this doesn’t include me.’” She added: “You can sell online without ever getting the approval of Vogue.” Ms. Welteroth, who is credited with reinventing Teen Vogue as a more socially conscious, politically engaged publication, noted that designers have to be conscious of the world around them. “You have to be mindful of what is happening and really conscious in how you create and what stories you’re telling,” she said. To that end, one of the challenges on the new “Project Runway” will ask each designer to think about and create designs for an issue they want to champion. The new show also strives to reflect a broader swath of experiences. “I’m really proud we have women of all shapes and sizes and the first transgender model in ‘Project Runway’ history,” Ms. Kloss said. “Fashion should serve everyone.” The new judges said they adjusted to their roles quickly, each finding a personal rhythm and style. “Brandon would have, like, really funny stuff,” Ms. Welteroth said of Mr. Maxwell’s design notes. “Like, ‘cowgirl goes to SoulCycle.’ Or he would just put a big ‘No.’ One time Nina left early, and we looked at her cards, and we were, like, ‘Wow.’ We saved them. They were so good.” Ms. Kloss turned to Ms. Welteroth. “Your notes were, like, there was not an ounce of space left on the card,” she said. “I would just have three words.” For all the changes, some things stay the same, even in the “one day you’re in, one day you’re out” world of fashion. “I felt like all I talked about was fabric,” Mr. Siriano said of his time as a mentor. “The importance of choosing the right fabric,” he said, “will exist till the end of time. Satin doesn’t change.” And besides, he said, “If you can’t pick one fabric for one challenge, how are you making a collection four times a year for customers around the world?” An earlier version of this article misstated the name of the nonprofit that Karlie Kloss founded. It is Kode With Klossy, not Kode With Karlie. Also, an earlier version of this article misstated Cardi B’s role on the show. She is a guest, not a guest judge.",The New York Times
2019,"‘Race-Biased Dragnet’: DNA From 360 Black Men Was Collected to Solve Vetrano Murder, Defense Lawyers Say","[What you need to know to start your day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] When Karina Vetrano was found beaten and strangled in a Queens park nearly three years ago, the New York Police Department carried out one of the most intense and extensive manhunts in the agency’s recent history. But defense lawyers for the man charged in the killing, Chanel Lewis, are now contending that the police swept up hundreds of black men in a “race-biased dragnet” before settling on him — information they argue should have been turned over to them before trial. They said they learned only recently that the police took DNA samples from at least 360 black men who had been previously taken into custody in parts of Queens and Brooklyn. Six months after taking the DNA samples, investigators testified that they finally found a match in Mr. Lewis, whom detectives approached on a police lieutenant’s intuition. Mr. Lewis, now 22, confessed to the crime, though he later claimed he was coerced. His first trial ended with a hung jury. As Mr. Lewis’s second trial is coming to a close, his defense lawyers are raising questions about whether prosecutors withheld critical evidence about the wide genetic canvass, as well as whether the police initially suspected that two white men had killed Ms. Vetrano. The lawyers said they will file motions in State Supreme Court in Queens on Monday, seeking a hearing to determine if prosecutors hid evidence favorable to Mr. Lewis. The request for a last-minute hearing, which could lead to another mistrial, was the latest twist in a case that has dredged up questions about coerced confessions, racial profiling and the fallibility of the police. The trial has prompted a debate on social media and in the courtroom among observers who think the confession and DNA evidence is ample proof of Mr. Lewis’s guilt and others who believe that prosecutors have the wrong man. Mr. Lewis’s lawyers said they received an anonymous letter on Thursday from a person claiming to be a police officer. The letter, first reported in the The Daily News, said that early on in the inquiry the police were looking for “two jacked up white guys from Howard Beach” as suspects in Ms. Vetrano’s murder. If the letter truly came from a police officer, then it represents an extraordinary departure from the protocols governing how details of criminal investigations reach the defense and the public. The information typically comes from police officials’ public statements, evidence prosecutors turn over to the defense and witness testimony, not from an anonymous officer halfway through a retrial. A Police Department spokesman said it was false that investigators had suspected two white men. But a person with knowledge of the investigation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said it was true investigators initially thought the assailants might be white and that the police later had sought saliva samples from hundreds of black men in the search for the killer. Mr. Lewis’s lawyers said that that information should have been turned over to them. Prosecutors are obligated under the Brady v. Maryland ruling from the United States Supreme Court to hand over evidence favorable to the accused, including police reports that cast doubt on a defendant’s guilt or witness statements that suggest someone else may have committed the crime. “We think it’s a big deal that merits explanation at this point,” said Richard Joselson, the supervising attorney of the criminal appeals bureau of the Legal Aid Society. Tina Luongo, the chief criminal defender of the Legal Aid Society, said the letter contained “case-altering information” that was “troubling.” She said the police had approached Mr. Lewis “to obtain a DNA swab as part of a race-biased dragnet.” The defense was aware that the police had obtained DNA from hundreds of people, but judges had denied their requests for the identities and races of the people who were tested. Ms. Vetrano’s relatives and neighbors also submitted DNA. A spokeswoman for the Queens district attorney’s office said prosecutors will respond to the allegation that they withheld evidence when the trial resumes on Monday. The police spokesman, Phillip Walzak, said the evidence proved that Mr. Lewis killed Ms. Vetrano and that the court had already ruled on the issues raised in the letter. Ms. Vetrano, 30, went for a late afternoon jog in Spring Creek Park in the Howard Beach section of Queens on Aug. 2, 2016. When she did not return home, her father, Philip Vetrano, a retired firefighter, called his friend and neighbor, John Cassidy, a chief in the Police Department, Mr. Vetrano testified. After Ms. Vetrano was found dead on a park path overgrown with weeds, an intense manhunt ensued. A task force of 100 detectives was assigned to investigate her death, according to testimony during the trial. In the end, the number of detectives on the case dropped to 10. The authorities offered a $35,000 reward for anyone with information leading to Ms. Vetrano’s killer. The person with knowledge of the investigation said investigators were searching for two white men for nearly two weeks until Deputy Chief Emanuel J. Katranakis, the commander of the Forensic Investigation Division, received phenotype results suggesting the DNA collected from Ms. Vetrano’s neck and from her telephone belonged to a black man. The next day, the chief of detectives, Robert K. Boyce, directed detectives to seek DNA samples from black men who had been arrested in the neighborhoods near the crime scene, the person said. Roughly 384 black men were interviewed and gave saliva samples, the source with knowledge of the investigation said, offering a number even higher than the defense lawyers suggested. The samples were entered into the Local DNA Index System, or LDIS, a database maintained by the city medical examiner’s office. A second person with knowledge of the investigation said that once detectives found out the DNA belonged to a black man they focused on black people who had recently been taken into custody in East New York in Brooklyn and Howard Beach and South Ozone Park in Queens. In addition, the person said, security cameras in the area did not show anyone leaving Spring Creek Park from the Queens side, leading investigators to instead focus on Brooklyn, believing the attacker had fled in that direction. “You’re trying to find the killer and you use your resources as intelligently as possible,” the second person said. Still, there was no DNA match, and the investigation stalled for six months. Then Mr. Lewis, who is black, was interviewed on the recommendation of a police lieutenant, John Russo. Months before the murder, Lieutenant Russo testified, he had spotted Mr. Lewis on two occasions “acting suspiciously” and walking slowly through Howard Beach, a predominantly white neighborhood. Detectives obtained a saliva sample from Mr. Lewis, who lived in East New York, Brooklyn, roughly three miles away from Howard Beach, and forensics experts said his DNA matched the traces found on Ms. Vetrano’s neck and cellphone, as well as a mixture from two of her fingernails, prosecutors said. Mr. Lewis at first denied he killed Ms. Vetrano, according to evidence presented at the trial. But after being in police custody for more than 11 hours, including four hours in the interrogation room, he told detectives and a Queens prosecutor in a videotaped interview that he had attacked Ms. Vetrano because he was angry that his neighbors had been playing loud music. He also had a hand injury the day after the slaying that a doctor said was consistent with punching someone, prosecutors said. Defense lawyers have argued that the police coerced the confession. Mr. Lewis, who lived with his mother and had graduated from a school for students with learning disabilities, appeared confused at times during the videotaped interview, and mumbled through some of his responses. Defense lawyers also sought to raise doubts about the DNA evidence, which they maintain could have ended up on Ms. Vetrano’s cellphone or neck if they had both touched the same surface at some point.",The New York Times
2019,‘Ramen Shop’ Review: A Search for Family and Good Soup,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. The power of great cooking to serve as a reminder of lost family members is the subject of “Ramen Shop,” a drama from the Singaporean director Eric Khoo that also demonstrates the power of Instagrammable cuisine to spice up an otherwise straightforward, sentimental film. The movie begins with a search for family — and the recipe for a fondly remembered bak kut teh, a pork rib soup. Masato (Takumi Saitoh), born to a Singaporean mother and a Japanese father, departs Japan after the death of his emotionally distant dad, a celebrated ramen chef in Takasaki. His father strived to create new flavors that blended cultures; he is said to have kept his deceased wife’s memory alive in every bowl. To preserve that tradition, Masato seeks out a long-unseen uncle (Mark Lee) — and his recipe for the Proustian pork rib broth — in Singapore. A food blogger (Seiko Matsuda) aids him in that search, which means that otherwise pedestrian conversational scenes are enlivened with shots of dishes like fish head curry and digressions on how Pandan leaves are used in Southeast Asian cooking to add flavor and color. The anticipated bak kut teh recipe may tempt viewers to take notes. “Ramen Shop” is not all as sweet or insubstantial as that summary suggests. It also deals, heavy-handedly, with the legacy of Japan’s occupation of Singapore during World War II — a past that weighs on Masato’s family history. But this gentle film doesn’t linger on horrors too long. It demands only your appetite.

2019,‘Relaxer’ Review: Help! He’s Sitting and He Can’t Get Up,"Critic’s Pick When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. The films of Joel Potrykus have been described as slacker comedies, featuring, as they often do, shambolic losers barely surviving somewhere between working poor and utter destitution. To me, though, they’re something else entirely: cracked symphonies of anguish and humiliation. What distinguishes Potrykus is his willingness to force this pain — as he did with “Ape” in 2014 and, a year later, “Buzzard” — to the point where our initial revulsion for a character transforms into compassion. Abbie (Joshua Burge) in “Relaxer,” is a perfect example: a thin, pale, Pac-Man-playing dude (it’s 1999) parked on a scabby couch in a roach-infested apartment. There he’ll stay for the duration, having accepted a deranged challenge from his sadistically abusive brother (David Dastmalchian). As the story progresses and Abbie’s condition deteriorates in harmony with his surroundings, we see that the horror-movie music that opens the movie was far from arbitrary. Visitors stop by, but they’re mostly instruments of further torment, including a pair of exterminators who detonate a bug bomb and leave him gasping in a cloud of poison. In one excruciating sequence, a disturbed friend answers his pleas for something to drink by pouring Cola in a trash can filled with God knows what. You do not want to know how his bodily excretions are handled. Sad and strange and defiantly gross, “Relaxer” is a surreal survival tale swirling with childhood trauma and Y2K paranoia. Few directors have as steely a grip on mental damage as Potrykus, and Burge, a regular collaborator, is his perfectly pained muse. Some may find this movie unbearable; yet there’s a place for pictures that push us to the limits of forbearance. Sometimes, even the loathsome have stories worth telling.

2019,"‘Replacement Theory,’ a Racist, Sexist Doctrine, Spreads in Far-Right Circles","SAN FRANCISCO — Before the massacre of 50 people in New Zealand mosques last week, the suspect released a document called “The Great Replacement.” The first sentence was: “It’s the birthrates.” He repeated it three times. If the phrase about replacement sounded familiar, perhaps that was because it echoed what white supremacists bearing tiki torches shouted in Charlottesville, Va., in 2017: “You will not replace us.” It is also the slogan of the neo-Nazi group Identity Evropa. Behind the idea is a racist conspiracy theory known as “the replacement theory,” which was popularized by a right-wing French philosopher. An extension of colonialist theory, it is predicated on the notion that white women are not having enough children and that falling birthrates will lead to white people around the world being replaced by nonwhite people. And like so many fundamentalist ideologies, the foundation of this one requires the subjugation of women. “For people in the white power movement, everything is framed through reproduction and gender,” said Kathleen Belew, a history professor at the University of Chicago who has studied these groups. As far-right groups have grown across the world, many of their members have insisted that the most pressing concern is falling birthrates. That concern, which they see as an existential threat, has led to arguments about how women are working instead of raising families. The groups blame feminism, giving rise to questions that were unheard-of a decade ago — like, whether women should have the right to work and vote at all. The obsession with birthrates is both shaping policy goals within the far right and serving as a rallying cry for recruitment. Experts tracking these movements say they are alarmed by the speed and strength with which the idea is spreading, especially among young radicals. “In their minds, in this clash of civilization, white men are in a weaker position because their women are not doing the work of reproducing,” said Arun Kundnani, a professor at New York University and author of “The Muslims Are Coming! Islamophobia, Extremism and the Domestic War on Terror.” “They are saying, ‘Look, Muslims have got their women where they need to be, and we’re not doing a good job at that.’” The concern over birthrates has hit a fever pitch in part because of recent studies showing sperm counts and testosterone declining. Some men are buying sperm counters to use at home, and some are turning to testosterone replacement therapy, convinced that modernity has feminized them. These have given old fears a new scientific sheen and led many in these communities to more apocalyptic, violent politics. “It’s all related to lower sperm counts and increasing sexual dysfunction,” said Paul Elam, the leader of A Voice for Men, a men’s rights group. “In my community right now, there’s almost this nihilism and cynicism that says, ‘Let it burn.’” And so an old rallying cry is getting refurbished for a new generation. “The way that emotion gets engaged in the right wing today is almost always around questions of fertility,” said Paola Bacchetta, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who serves on the board of the Center for Right-Wing Studies. “It’s about their anxieties about their male others. They fear that they will overproduce them and eliminate them.” Though these fears fester in online message boards, they are spreading to more mainstream right-wing conversations. The Fox News host Tucker Carlson, for one, has engaged in some of these conversations. In January, he opened his show with a segment he said was “the biggest issue facing this country going forward,” bigger than wars and G.D.P.: the collapse of families. The major cause of that collapse, he said, was that some women now out-earn some men. (Mr. Carlson’s discussion of the topic attracted fierce criticism, something he addressed on his show the next night. “This is why important science is no longer being conducted,” he said of the response. “It’s why art isn’t being made and comedy is dying.”) The birthrate panic has been bubbling back up for some time. In a 2012 book by the French philosopher Renaud Camus, he argued that all Western countries were reckoning with erasure by birthrate. That has helped fuel nativist campaigns like the one by the Dutch politician Geert Wilders. It became the animating philosophy in the Charlottesville, Va., attack. And Representative Steve King, the Iowa Republican, tweeted in 2017, “We can’t restore our civilization with somebody else’s babies.” Many of these groups have seized on statistics showing a slowing birthrate in some Western countries. In the United States, the total fertility rate is now about 1,765.5 births per 1,000 women, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which is below the level necessary to keep the population stable without immigration. The birthrate conversation — and the question that goes with it, of women’s continued freedom — has become a key recruitment tool for white supremacists. It is often the first political point of agreement a white supremacist recruiter online will find with a target, especially with young people. “In gaming and comic books and all these things that aren’t politically related, anti-feminism is an easy access point to make your case and then begin people’s journeys,” said Annie Kelly, a doctoral student at the University of East Anglia in Britain who is researching the impact of digital cultures on anti-feminism and the far-right. Clifford Leek, a professor of sociology at the University of Northern Colorado and the president of the American Men’s Studies Association, said the recruiters would focus on teenagers who were experiencing insecurities and who had already been exposed to some of these ideas online. That has made old debates new again. And in the loose collection of anti-feminist blogs known as the “manosphere,” basic ideas around gender equality that have long been taken for granted are now being relitigated. Ideas like banning women from the workplace are bandied around casually in these communities. And most of it is presented amid memes and jokes, as was the case throughout the New Zealand suspect’s manifesto. “Good-faith proponents have this naïve understanding that bad ideas can be defeated by the power of argument,” Ms. Kelly said. “Bad-faith proponents have a vested interest in the idea being back on the table.” Once a group of people in an online forum agree that declining white birthrates are an existential threat, then the conversation turns to policies. In some cases the response is that nonwhites should be killed. Often the response is white women need to be re-educated. “What’s gaining more of a foothold is the idea of reversing a woman’s right to vote,” she said. “That was something I used to see in the overtly neo-Nazi spaces, but now I’m seeing it introduced in less extremist spaces. First introduced as a joke, of course, then as an acceptable policy that maybe not all users agree with but is worth discussing.” An earlier version of this article placed certain comments by the Fox News host Tucker Carlson out of context. The comments, “This is why important science is no longer being conducted. It’s why art isn’t being made and comedy is dying,” referred to the quick and broad criticism he received for saying on his television show that a major cause of the collapse of families was that some women now out-earn some men. The comments did not refer to his own remarks about the impact of women out-earning men.",The New York Times
2019,"‘Rezo’ Review: The Life of an Artist, From His Own Hand","When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. The illustrated memoir “Rezo,” directed by Leo Gabriadze, combines documentary and animation to tell the story of Gabriadze’s father, Rezo, a polymathic artist whose career has included work as screenwriter and as the founder of a marionette theater in Tbilisi, Georgia. The imagery, drawn by Rezo himself and animated by Sveta Matrosova and Elizaveta Astretsova, has a charmingly personal quality. Although this Russian-language feature covers a tumultuous period in history, primarily from World War II until Rezo’s unexpected, career-starting introduction to the power of art, it never once resembles a checklist of sweeping events. The narrative teems with eccentric details. We learn how Rezo, as a boy, read books in a kerosene-heated library with a rat to keep him company. Lenin and Stalin emerge from portraits at his school to discuss whether his tardiness should get him expelled. Filmed in sepia-toned interviews, the now 82-year-old Rezo remembers living with his grandparents in Georgia, where the back of an outhouse had a spectacular view and a “pit full of plankton” became a treasured swimming hole. His images, brought to life with a jerky motion suggestive of marionettes, have an almost childlike sense of geometry (the grandfather’s abundant beard often points horizontally or vertically). Prisoners of war are rendered in shades of gray; a mourning scene makes striking use of blank space. In its judicious use of color, the hourlong “Rezo” shares something with the haunting “Tale of Tales,” the 30-minute film that precedes it. Considered by many to be one of the greatest of all animated movies, Yuri Norstein’s featurette, first shown in 1979, likewise traffics in an individualized mythology, replete with a rope-skipping Minotaur, a baby-snatching wolf and tango partners who vanish into thin air. An ostensible allegory — notices from the state appear onscreen, train cars speed ominously into the night — it is known for resisting comprehensive interpretation.

2019,‘Roll Red Roll’ Review: A Horrifying Assault in a Small Ohio Town,"Critic’s Pick When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. “What did they do with that girl?,” an unseen male asks as the peaceful opening shots of the documentary “Roll Red Roll” reveal a quiet, darkening street lined with tidy family homes. The skin-crawling audio continues, others now joining a conversation pocked with callousness and nervous giggles: “She is so raped right now.” With bone-chilling explicitness, the director Nancy Schwartzman lays out exactly what happened to “that girl” at the hands of high-school football stars in Steubenville, Ohio, in 2012. Picking at the scab of respectability, she reveals a football-crazed culture of misogyny and entitlement that resulted in the brutal abuse of an unwary teenager too inebriated to recall her ordeal. Fortunately, the cellphones and social-media accounts of her attackers and their friends would remember for her. Assembling these repugnant posts and videos (cannily captured and published at the time by the industrious crime blogger and interviewee Alexandria Goddard) into a timeline of casual depravity, Schwartzman deepens her dive and widens her reach. What emerges is an infuriating portrait of sports-mad solidarity and victim-blaming that would eventually attract worldwide attention and prompt the investigative reporter Rachel Dissell to wonder if Steubenville was “putting its daughters at risk by protecting its sons.” A tough but essential watch, “Roll Red Roll” documents how a sexual assault in a declining Appalachian town became an international cause célèbre. Shots of near-empty streets and an abandoned steel mill provide a melancholy frame for behavior that seems horrifyingly incomprehensible. “I can’t wait for this story to go away,” an unseen radio jock says near the end.

2019,‘Room at the Top’: An Affair to Remember,"Rewind A brash working-class bloke gets a new job in a new town, wages a calculated campaign to seduce and marry the local tycoon’s daughter, entangles himself in a passionate affair with an older woman, and finally gets what he wants — with nearly everyone living unhappily ever after. On the 60th anniversary of “Room at the Top,” it’s worthwhile to recall how and why this British movie shocked and excited its original audiences. A first feature by Jack Clayton from a best-selling debut novel by John Braine, it opens for a week at Film Forum in a 4K restoration that puts a new sheen on master cinematographer Freddie Francis’s grimy black-and-white images. Joe Lampton (Laurence Harvey), the film’s antihero, is a ferocious go-getter from a humble background who takes a job in a North England town controlled by the local industrialist. Single-minded and predatory, he sets his sights on the naïve heiress Susan Brown (Heather Sears), while recklessly pursuing the worldly wise but unhappily married Alice Aisgill (Simone Signoret). The heat generated by the affair fuels the movie. Joe’s bluntly articulated class resentment notwithstanding, “Room at the Top” is quite conservative in its morality — although its sledgehammer ending still packs an emotional wallop. The movie was popular with British audiences but, as noted by the film historian Alexander Walker, many reviewers were offended by its explicit dialogue and situations. There would seem to be a political subtext as well. Given that Joe was a sergeant in the R.A.F. during World War II and supposedly in his mid-20s (making Alice a shockingly old 35), the movie appears to be set around 1950 — a period when Britain’s postwar Labour government put the nation’s old boy network on the defensive. Longing for adult fare and quick to note parallels with Theodore Dreiser’s “An American Tragedy,” critics in the United States were more enthusiastic than their British counterparts. “The cynical, disenchanted and footloose postwar youths of England, who justifiably have been termed ‘angry,’ never have been put into sharper focus,” A.H. Weiler wrote approvingly in The New York Times. Citing the movie’s “maturity,” the New Republic critic Stanley Kauffmann praised it as “a rare event among English-language films.” Evidently, the French thought so too. “Room at the Top” was well-received at Cannes, where Signoret (a French national) won an award for best actress; the influential critic Georges Sadoul called it “undoubtedly the most significant British film of the ’50s.” With its vivid Northern locations (and accents) and sexual frankness (Joe and Alice making love midafternoon in a borrowed flat), “Room at the Top” ushered in a new era of British naturalism — the so-called kitchen sink cinema of the 1960s, characterized by provincial working-class protagonists and drab industrial settings. “Room at the Top” was nominated for five Oscars and received two, for best adaptation and best actress. Not everyone was pleased. The gossip columnist Hedda Hopper was particularly irate that Signoret, a well-known leftist, had been so honored. “Let her decorate her mantel with Picasso doves and the like,” she wrote. “I got so mad, I upped and resigned from the Academy.” That, presumably, created a bit more room at the top.",The New York Times
2019,‘S.N.L.’ Cold Open Skewers Michael Cohen Hearings With Stiller and Hader,"There are certain guarantees in life. Death, the rising sun and Ben Stiller returning to play Michael Cohen in this week’s cold open of “Saturday Night Live” are among them. The newest “S.N.L.” spoofed Wednesday’s widely watched congressional hearing in which President Trump’s former personal attorney testified under oath before the House Oversight and Reform Committee that Trump was a “racist” and a “con-man,” and detailed what he said was a pattern of criminal behavior. Cohen has already pleaded guilty to lying to Congress under oath, something Stiller himself poked fun at in character. “Of course the first time I testified was under oath, but this time I, like really mean it,” Stiller said. The sketch began with Kenan Thompson playing the role of Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, the committee chairman, who quipped, “For any other president, this hearing would be the most damning and humiliating moment of their lives, but for Trump, it’s just Wednesday,” before handing the floor to Cohen. Stiller, as Cohen, said in his opening statement that he had help in writing it “from the guys who wrote ‘Green Book.’” “I know that I was wrong,” Stiller said. “And I know it, because I got caught.” He concluded with this missive: “But now, I’m all out of faith. This is how I feel. I’m cold and I’m ashamed and lying naked on the floor. Illusion never changed into something real. I’m wide-awake and I can see the perfect sky is torn.” If this bit went over your head — and we wouldn’t blame you — Stiller was reciting lyrics from the song “Torn,” a ’90s hit for the Australian singer Natalie Imbruglia. The main target of the “S.N.L.” writing team was Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, the ranking Republican. The show brought in a pinch-hitter, one of its most famous alums, Bill Hader, to play a furious version of Jordan. “You’re right that I’m angry,” Hader said. “I’m angry that I have to sit here through this two-bit dirtbag flea circus. I’m so angry I couldn’t even wear a jacket today. You know something, Mr. Cohen, I’ve never even heard of you!” Hader said. “Your mother has,” Stiller responded. The rest of the sketch featured Democrats ceding their time to Jordan, hoping he would make a fool of himself, as well as a lampoon of Representative Mark Meadows of North Carolina, who at the testimony on Wednesday brought Lynne Patton, a black Department of Housing and Urban Development official and longtime Trump ally, to counter Cohen’s claim that Trump is a racist. “S.N.L.” recreated the moment, with Alex Moffat portraying Meadows, and Ego Nwodim as Patton. With one problem, courtesy of Moffatt: “Her name is Omarosa,” Moffat said, a reference to the former Trump aide, who is also black. Nwodim tried to correct him, but Moffat would have none of it. Weekend Update Jokes of the Week Colin Jost and Michael Che teed off on the Cohen testimony as well from the update desk, among other topics. At one point — perhaps illustrating the difficulty of mocking Trump — the hosts simply played clips of Trump giving his more than two-hour speech at the annual gathering of conservatives in Washington, CPAC. Jost: Did you guys see this picture online of a chubby sewer rat that got stuck in a manhole? It’s this creature that usually seems gross, but under these circumstances, it’s kind of adorable and you almost feel sorry for it. That’s how I felt about watching Michael Cohen testify in Congress. Jost: Cohen also provided Congress with copies of letters threatening Trump’s high schools and colleges not to reveal his SAT scores. And while Cohen did not reveal what those scores were, let’s just say Trump lives a little closer to 920 Pennsylvania Avenue than to 1600. Che: Michael Cohen told Congress about all the dirty little nasty freaky things that Donald Trump made him do. I don’t know why I just made that sexual but I am tired of Michael Cohen’s whole damsel-in-distress routine. “Oh, Mr. Trump took advantage of me. I guess I’m a fool.” You stole a United States presidency. Why are you acting like a [expletive] now? Your voice wasn’t trembling when you was threatening schoolteachers and shaking down porn stars. I want to hear that guy talk to Congress. At least Donald Trump has the decency to slowly fall apart until he is dragged off in handcuffs like a boss. I mean, that’s how I want to leave “S.N.L.” Jost: This week, President Trump met with North Korean dictator — and let’s face it, one of his top five closest friends — Kim Jong-un. Talks broke down when the two leaders could not agree on sanctions. Another problem was Kim Jong-un used an interpreter, while Trump just spoke English, but louder. Weekend Update Deskside Bit of the Week We love a good character break, especially when it comes from cast members who typically hold it together. Jost led into the bit telling the story about a pig named Picasso who was saved from a slaughterhouse because of his ability to paint. He invited the owners of “Smokery Farms Meat Gift Delivery Service,” on to comment: cousins Vaneta and Wylene Starkie, played by Kate McKinnon and Aidy Bryant. In deep Southern accents, the two lamented the preponderance of heartwarming animal stories. “People going vegan left and right because the damn internet keeps showing people videos like ‘Pig Teaches Deaf Dog To Bark,’” McKinnon said. The sketch almost derailed immediately after, as McKinnon and Bryant had trouble containing their laughter. They brought on raw cuts to describe the quality of their well-known Smokery cuts of meat. The lines barely mattered at that point, as the spectacle of the duo losing it had the audience in stitches. Wedding Guest of the Week Who knew that John Mulaney, hosting the show for the second time, was so versed in black culture? In this sketch, Mulaney attends a wedding with his girlfriend, played by Nwodim. The wedding is her cousin’s, and Mulaney is the only white attendee. He repeatedly keeps expressing nervousness about not having enough in common with the other guests, especially because he’s a “software engineer from Indiana.” Except, as we learn during a long dance sequence to a remix of “Cha-Cha Slide,” Mulaney fits in as well as anybody in the room. He is a Howard University graduate and knows when to wave a church fan — perhaps from the spades tournament we find out that Mulaney competed in with Nwodim’s aunt, Georgette, played by Leslie Jones. He’s also, apparently, a humble master of Beyoncé‘s “Single Ladies” moves.",The New York Times
2019,"‘S.N.L.’: Idris Elba Hosts, and R. Kelly Gets Roasted","It was a rarity for “Saturday Night Live” this weekend: an opening sketch that had absolutely nothing to do with President Trump or politics. Instead, the show sent up the much talked about sit-down between the “CBS This Morning” host Gayle King and the singer R. Kelly, who has been charged with 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse involving four women, three of whom were underage at the time. Leslie Jones played King while Kenan Thompson portrayed Kelly, who repeatedly asked Jones to call him “Victim.” She declined. Thompson voiced multiple asides in the style of Kelly’s “Trapped in the Closet” series and told Jones that he had “more than millions of dollars: thousands.” When asked about the recent Lifetime documentary series “Surviving R. Kelly,” in which many of the alleged abuses where recounted, Thompson said: “They made it seem like I was the Devil. I’m not the Devil. and even if I was, you can’t think of one nice thing to say about the Devil? I can. Nice horns. Gives good advice.” The sketch also went on to parody the moment when Kelly came unglued and got out of his chair during the CBS interview. But first, the singer seemed confused about whether the interview had even started. He didn’t recognize the cameras directly in front of him. “You all just keep your camera out in the open like that?” Thompson asked. “You all are some freaks.” Asked directly if he had ever held women against their will, Thompson said: “O.K. guys, think for a minute. Use your brains. Why would I do these things? For 30 years. I gave you all ‘Trapped in the Closet.’ ‘Feelin’ on Yo’ Booty.’ ‘Age Ain’t Nothing but a Number.’ And so many other clues.” The standout sketch this week took aim at uproars over Hollywood casting decisions, spurred by social media mobs. The parody came in the form of a game show hosted by Thompson called “Can I Play That?” — “actors’ least favorite game.” The game featured three contestants, played by this week’s host, Idris Elba, and by Beck Bennett and Cecily Strong, each of whom portrayed working actors asked to give their best guesses as to who was allowed to play certain roles. Thompson started by asking contestants about a recent real-life example: Will Smith’s casting as Richard Williams, the father of Venus and Serena Williams. Some have criticized the choice, arguing that Smith is too light-skinned to play Richard Williams. Can he play that? Bennett hit the buzzer first: “Yes, of course, he’ll do a great job,” he said. He was wrong. Strong buzzed in with the right answer: “Absolutely not, he’s not black enough.” Responding to Elba, who asked if this was real, Thompson said: “It sure is. Because this game is produced by Twitter. Twitter: One mistake, and we’ll kill you.” The rest of the sketch followed along the same lines. Elba’s character was told he was not allowed to play a blind person. “Isn’t that what acting is about?” Elba asked. “You know, becoming someone you’re not?” “Not anymore, no.” Thompson replied. “Now it’s about becoming yourself but with a different haircut.” By the end of the sketch, it was decided that no one could play Caitlyn Jenner in a biopic and that Rami Malek could play anyone he wanted. In a lightning round, Bennett guessed correctly that a white male like him could play “a white guy, a white guy who gained 50 pounds, slave owner, and that’s it.” This week, Colin Jost and Michael Che kicked off “Weekend Update” by taking on the sentencing of Paul Manafort, Trump’s former campaign chairman who was sentenced to less than four years in one of the two cases against him, well below the sentencing guidelines. Jost: O.K., here’s how bad Trump’s presidency is going. His campaign manager this week was sentenced to four years in prison, and for Trump, that’s good news. Paul Manafort, who looks like he was born divorced, faced up to 24 years in prison but only got four years, probably in a minimum security white collar facility with a bunch of his friends. The guy stole over $50 million and he basically got sentenced to college. Che later added: Paul Manafort got 47 months for tax evasion and bank fraud, which, as a black guy, feels very unfair. But for a rich black guy, it’s a little encouraging. I mean if I could steal millions of dollars and the United States presidency in exchange for, like, three years of prison in my 70s? I can’t promise I won’t try. Jost went on to riff about a photo published Friday in the Miami Herald of Trump’s Super Bowl party at his country club in West Palm Beach: It was reported that President Trump watched the Super Bowl at Mar-a-Lago with Li Yang, the woman who founded the chain of Asian day spas where Patriots owner Robert Kraft allegedly solicited a prostitute. First of all, what a time to be alive, huh? Second, you know that Trump spent all their time together trying to convince her to give up North Korea’s nuclear weapons.

The bit started innocently enough as Che invited a Goop staffer, played by Heidi Gardner, to discuss the company’s recent wellness summit. She presented a Goop body wash, which was made with ginger and something called ashwagandha. Unfortunately, she couldn’t properly describe what ashwagandha was, so she brought on her supervisor, Pfeiffer, played by Paltrow herself. When Gardner expressed the worry that she would be fired, Paltrow-as-Pfeiffer reassured her that the real-life Paltrow didn’t believe in firing: “Remember, it’s called conscious unemploying.” Perhaps tied to the release of “Captain Marvel,” “S.N.L.” tried a Marvel parody of its own with a version of “The Incredible Hulk” titled “The Impossible Hulk,” in which Elba played Bruce Banner.

2019,"‘Scotty’ the T. Rex Is the Heaviest Ever Found, Scientists Say","There are big dinosaurs. There are old ones. And then there is Scotty, a giant among them all. A Tyrannosaurus rex found in Saskatchewan, Canada, in the 1990s is the heaviest and oldest of its kind, paleontologists recently announced. The dinosaur, nicknamed Scotty, probably weighed about 9.8 tons and lived for more than three decades, they said. The results were published in a study last week in The Anatomical Record, a scientific journal, and posted online. “This is the rarest of rare dinosaurs,” Gregory Erickson, a paleobiologist from Florida State University who was one of the study’s authors, said in an interview Wednesday. “We have a full, grown adult.” [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] Researchers estimated Scotty’s weight by measuring its hip, leg and shoulder bones, and comparing them to the skeletons of other T. rex specimens. The size and width of the femur bone suggest Scotty weighed 19,555 pounds, much larger than a male African elephant, which can grow to 14,000 pounds. In May, a new, updated cast of Scotty, which will reflect the scientists’ findings, will go on display at Royal Saskatchewan Museum in Regina, the capital of Saskatchewan. Scotty was discovered in 1991 when an expedition of paleontologists to the Frenchman River Valley in Saskatchewan found a heavy worn tooth and vertebra from the tail of a T. rex, according to the museum. In 1994, they began excavating the site and found the bones and tooth fragments were dated to the Cretaceous Period and about 65 million years old. It took nearly a decade to excavate the skeleton; analysis of the bones and teeth continued for several years. Scotty, the researchers learned, had a particularly rough life. W. Scott Persons, a paleontologist from the University of Alberta in Canada who led the study, said Wednesday that the T. rex had broken bones, impacted teeth and bite marks, suggesting it had battled with other animals. Some of its wounds were infected. Dr. Persons said Scotty was probably in its early 30s when it died, outliving Sue, a T. rex discovered in South Dakota in 1990 that scientists estimate died at about 28. Sue has long been considered the largest skeleton found. “It gives us a rare view of an elder T. rex,” Dr. Persons said. Scotty had cranial abnormalities, including bumps and ridges down its snout, which suggests it had armored skin. “It had flair to its face,” he said. Despite its name paleontologists are not sure of the T. rex’s gender. Dr. Erickson said Scotty was named after the Scotch researchers drank to celebrate their great find. On Wednesday, the researchers could barely contain their delight. “There is so much negativity in the world,” Dr. Erickson said. “But this is neutral. It’s just fun.”",The New York Times
2019,‘Seraphic Track Stars’ Dancing About Freedom at the Met,"Silas Farley is as comfortable in the Assyrian Court at the Metropolitan Museum as he is on the stage of New York City Ballet. How is this possible? When he was 14 and a new student at the City Ballet-affiliated School of American Ballet, a patron — “a woman who’s like my fairy godmother,” he said — gave him a museum membership. Mr. Farley, now 24 and a member of City Ballet, has been exploring the galleries and corridors of the Met ever since. He doesn’t ignore the traveling exhibitions, but he prizes, above all, the museum’s permanent collection. “Making choreography here is beyond anything I could have hoped,” Mr. Farley said. But starting Friday afternoon his site-specific ballet, “Songs From the Spirit,” a MetLiveArts commission, will take over three of its galleries. As his work for seven dancers moves from darkness (the staid and somber Assyrian Court) to tranquillity (the meditative Chinese Garden Court) and finally lightness (a bright court in the American Wing), Mr. Farley takes the audience on a journey laced with history and spirituality. “Songs From the Spirit” also poses a question: What does freedom mean? The dance, a collaboration with the Radiotopia podcast Ear Hustle, a nuanced look at prison life, features spirituals and new music created by incarcerated men at San Quentin State Prison in California. The idea to collaborate with the podcast came from Limor Tomer, the general manager of MetLiveArts, who commissioned the work. “I thought if you’re talking about spirituals and being separated from community and finding grace,” Ms. Tomer said, “then we have that right now.” Last summer, Ms. Tomer, Mr. Farley and his wife, Cassia Farley, who is dancing in the work, visited San Quentin to meet with inmates and with the podcast’s hosts: Earlonne Woods, an inmate who has since been released; and Nigel Poor, a visual artist. The men had prepared musical selections — modern spirituals in a variety of genres, including rap, folk, spoken word and hip-hop — to perform for the visitors, who chose pieces to use for the dance. Mr. Farley, who is religious, likened the experience to being in church. “Almost every man who contributed music to the ballet experienced some kind of spiritual transformation,” he said. “They’re these very raw, very vulnerable, very revelatory songs.” (Their music will be played on recordings; the soprano Kelly Griffin and the tenor Robert May will also perform spirituals live.) For some of the men involved, Mr. Farley was surprising. “Not too many people of color come in to San Quentin trying to help us,” LeMar Harrison, known as Maverick, said. “He was the first dude who actually looked like me, and he kind of reminded me of all the kinds of things I wanted to be as a kid.” (Mr. Harrison, who was recently released after serving 22 years, 2 months and 2 days, will attend the Met performances, along with two other recently released men.) Even for a ballet dancer, Mr. Farley, nearly 6 feet 6 inches tall, is statuesque. He has legs for days, hands that dance elegantly in the air and a beaming smile. His impressive presence has to do with more than his physicality; it has a spiritual side too. As he sees it, his faith is intertwined with ballet. “I was first introduced to dance in the context of worship,” he said. “The first time I saw a ballet was when a company from Mississippi came to perform at our church. I was 6.” The original seed of “Songs From the Spirit” was planted at Redeemer Presbyterian Church West Side in Manhattan, where Mr. Farley performed a liturgical dance during the offertory portion of a Sunday service. This work “was always worship before it was a performance,” Mr. Farley said. “It was about, ‘I’ve been entrusted with this gift, and I’m offering it.’” On a recent morning at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Mr. Farley stood in the gallery of the Assyrian Court of Ashurnasirpal II and gestured at the reliefs taken from one of his palaces. “Some of these stances you see are in the choreography,” he said. “These very substantial male figures that are very delicately holding these little bowls. It’s such a contrast between the sensitivity and the strength. And that’s so much like the male ballet dancer. It’s power and poetry.” The gallery has a heaviness to it; it’s dark and enclosed, almost like a prison cell. “That’s really the spirit that the ballet begins in,” Mr. Farley said. “We’re literally covering the history of the world in its geography, in its art — we’re traveling from the court of Ashurnasirpal all the way to 19th-century American sculpture to music that’s been written in the past few months by these guys. It is both ancient and imminent.” The dancers, Mr. Farley said, will wear white clothing and sneakers to look “like seraphic track stars — a bit artist and a bit athlete and a bit angel.” As they lead the way to the Asian art wing, they will perform a procession set to a percussive, soulful song, “Blinded by the Light,” by Calvin Johnson, who has since been released from San Quentin. The dancers glide forward in crisp footwork and sleek swirling turns before dashing away. At a recent rehearsal, one of the dancers, Claire Kretzschmar — a City Ballet soloist — aimed her arms as if she were about to shoot a bow and arrow. “Oh,” Mr. Farley said happily. “Do a little Diana!” He was referring to the Augustus Saint-Gaudens sculpture of Diana that graces the final gallery of “Songs From the Spirit.” Once in that setting, Mr. Farley said, he is aiming to uplift. He finds it fitting that ballet is his vehicle to do so. He sees the art form as “a historically transcendent community of presence: People put their bodies in the same shapes, and they were formed by that practice.” Mr. Farley said he saw a connection between a dancer’s training and the spiritual transformation that some men have experienced at San Quentin. “You’re yielding to a force beyond yourself,” he said, “and the idea that you’re becoming freer and freer in what could seem a very confining context.” One man told him that he was grateful for being imprisoned because it was at San Quentin that he became free: He found religion and turned his life around. “That counterintuitive but undeniably true reality is something that a dancer goes, ‘oh, of course,’” Mr. Farley said. “It’s through the submission to this rigorous discipline that you’re actually set free on the stage to express, to be a vehicle of whatever the idea of the choreography is and whatever the music is expressing. You’ve allowed yourself to be formed.”",The New York Times
2019,‘She Had a Poor Choice of Words’: Ilhan Omar’s Constituents Grapple with Her Remarks,"MINNEAPOLIS — When Mohamed Ahmed’s third-grade daughter was assigned a school report about an African-American she admired, she chose to study her newly elected congresswoman, Ilhan Omar. “She’s a hero to my daughters,” said Mr. Ahmed, who like the congresswoman is Somali-American. “She’s an idol. They look up to her. They aspire to be her.” But as Ms. Omar’s comments about American Jews and Israel drew bipartisan rebukes in recent weeks, culminating Thursday with a House vote condemning anti-Semitism and other forms of hate, Mr. Ahmed had a conversation with his 8-year-old daughter about Ms. Omar. “I told her she had a poor choice of words, which hurt people,” said Mr. Ahmed, who voted for Ms. Omar but was unsure whether he would do so again. “And words matter if you’re a leader.” [A House resolution condemning “hateful expressions of intolerance” was as much a statement of Democrats’ values as their factionalism.] Across Minnesota’s snow-covered Fifth Congressional District — a bright-blue bastion of independent coffee shops, Somali malls and proudly progressive politics — the voters who overwhelmingly elected Ms. Omar in November were conflicted about her recent remarks, sometimes along surprising lines. Ms. Omar’s comments, and the weeks of backlash, raised questions about tolerance and free speech in a place that consistently elects a diverse slate of politicians, as well as concerns about the future of a carefully crafted rapport between leaders of the area’s sizable Jewish and Muslim communities. “We don’t want these issues to derail the relationship,” said Steve Hunegs, the executive director of the Jewish Community Relations Council of Minnesota and the Dakotas, who said he was “appalled” by Ms. Omar’s most recent remarks. Ms. Omar’s district, which spans Minneapolis and some of its inner-ring suburbs, is a place attuned to religious tension. Longtime members of the Somali community still speak about the profiling they experienced in the years after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and about the fear they felt after a mosque was bombed by white supremacists in nearby Bloomington in 2017. In those difficult times, they said, Jewish leaders in Minnesota made a point of stating their support. “When religion is under attack, they stand by us, because they’ve been there,” said Zahra Ali, a Somali-American resident of Minneapolis who once saw Ms. Omar’s election as a beacon of hope but who did not plan to vote for her again. “For her to go out there and target, on a daily basis, Jews, is very sad,” Ms. Ali said. Ms. Omar, one of the first two Muslim women elected to Congress, was seen by voters as a symbolic counterweight to President Trump, who is deeply unpopular in Minneapolis and who has spoken critically about the region’s large Somali population. Ms. Omar, a Somali refugee who came to the United States as a girl, received more than three-quarters of the vote last year, taking over a seat that had been held by Keith Ellison, a fellow Democrat and the country’s first Muslim elected to Congress. “Here in Minnesota, we don’t only welcome immigrants, we send them to Washington,” Ms. Omar told a jubilant crowd at her election night party. But shortly after her victory, Ms. Omar began drawing controversy with her remarks about Jews and Israel. At various points, she suggested that Israel was not a democracy, insinuated that American support for Israel was motivated by money from a pro-Israel lobbying group and said pro-Israel activists were pushing “for allegiance to a foreign country.” Rabbi Avi Olitzky, who helps lead a congregation in suburban St. Louis Park, in Ms. Omar’s district, said some of his members had gone from wanting to make sure their congresswoman was better educated about anti-Semitism to frightened about her views. “I think we’ve seen the recognition of the weight of her words, but the continued comments don’t reflect that sensitivity,” said Rabbi Olitzky, who said he had consulted with Ms. Omar and her aides in recent weeks. He suggested that the congresswoman should consider participating in bipartisan trips to Israel and making a visit to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington. Still, he cautioned: “I don’t know about bouncing back” from the damage already done. Ms. Omar, who has apologized for some of her remarks, has insisted that she is not anti-Semitic. She has also drawn attention to bigoted attacks against herself. Ms. Omar tweeted an image of threatening graffiti that was reported at a Minnesota gas station, and suggested a double-standard after West Virginia Republicans displayed a poster that linked fading memories of the 9/11 attacks to her election. But even with bipartisan misgivings about Ms. Omar, the biggest threat to her political future is from fellow Democrats, not Republicans, who are vastly outnumbered in her diverse, mostly urban district. There have already been mutterings about a primary challenge in 2020, and though no such candidate has yet emerged, patience among some Democrats is clearly wearing thin. “Representative Omar has used up the reservoir of good will generally granted to those who begin new jobs by repeatedly insulting the Jewish people even after being told that her words are dangerous and hurtful,” said State Senator Ron Latz, a Democrat from St. Louis Park, in a recent statement. Mr. Latz called on the congresswoman to “discuss policy without inflaming religious conflict.” Still, the deeply liberal makeup of Ms. Omar’s district — a mix of urban and suburban neighborhoods where “Black Lives Matter” signs and L.G.B.T. rights flags are common sights — may shield her from political punishment. Ms. Omar trounced her primary opponents last year, and she built an enthusiastic coalition of supporters of different racial and religious identities. And though many constituents, including some Muslims, saw Ms. Omar crossing a line and trafficking in anti-Semitic tropes, others, including members of the district’s Jewish community, said they were offended only by what they perceived as partisan, even racist, attacks on their congresswoman for legitimate criticisms of Israel. “I feel like she’s being attacked because she’s a black Muslim,” said Ethan Wilensky-Lanford, 38, who is Jewish, and who distributed campaign literature for Ms. Omar last year. Anne Winkler-Morey, also a Jewish resident of Ms. Omar’s district, said she had discussed the congresswoman’s comments with her Somali friends and did not find the remarks offensive. “She’s speaking out about a foreign policy, whether you agree with her or not,” Ms. Winkler-Morey said. “It’s actually an anti-Semitic idea that the State of Israel represents Jews and you have to show your allegiance to this state. It doesn’t represent me, just as Saudi Arabia doesn’t represent Muslims.” But the comments had created an uncomfortable rift in the district, even among loyal Democrats who usually agree on politics. Khalid Mohamed, a Somali-American resident of Minneapolis who said he interned for Ms. Omar when she was a state legislator, reached out to a Jewish friend who had posted critiques of the congresswoman on Twitter. “I told him that I needed to talk to him,” Mr. Mohamed said. “If a person thinks what Omar says is anti-Semitic, well, I haven’t lived as a Jewish person. Personally, I don’t believe it. But let’s put the feelings aside.” Mr. Mohamed said he and his friend planned to meet for a meal to talk it out on Friday, sometime after morning prayers.",The New York Times
2019,‘Slut in a Good Way’ Review: And Then They Staged a Sex Strike,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. In “Slut in a Good Way,” teenagers staff a toy store. But unlike their patrons, who visit for the stuffed animals, the young cashiers and stockists prefer playing games with one another. The charming heroines of this French Canadian coming-of-age comedy are the lively 16-year-olds Charlotte (Marguerite Bouchard), Mégane (Romane Denis) and Aube (Rose Adam). Their politics tend toward anarchism, and as they begin their jobs at Toy Depot, they approach workplace romance with no less reckless passion. The girls find the stock of eligible beaus is a better incentive to show up for work than the pay, but when Charlotte pursues dalliances with several male co-workers, she discovers undesired power dynamics within her encounters. As a collective, she and her friends organize a gendered revolt against their rakish colleagues. These youthful polemicists express themselves vibrantly. Their language is enveloping, and the direction by Sophie Lorain builds upon the sharp dialogue by staging flirtations and confrontations that are not only verbal but also visual. Boys are never simply present in the store with Charlotte and her friends. Instead, they seem to lurk in the background, waiting for their chance to swerve into Charlotte’s field of vision and steal the scene. The bobbing and weaving of characters into and out of the frame provides tension in a film that largely treats its subjects gently. Characters are stylishly but not pretentiously dressed, and these young faces are warmly lit in the film’s attractive black-and-white cinematography. In satisfying fashion, “Slut in a Good Way” recognizes the potential for cruelty that exists as teenagers experiment and learn through sex, but its portrait of adolescence never feels less than loving.

2019,"‘So Disheartening’: At Colleges Embroiled in Scandal, a Sense of Outrage and Sadness","Rarely is there a single conversation that dominates the college campuses of America, a back-and-forth that extends from Palo Alto, Calif., to Winston-Salem, N.C., and from New Haven, Conn., to Los Angeles. There was one this week. In classrooms and dining halls, on quads and in bars, there was a similar sense of astonishment. How could they? Can you believe it? United by an admissions scandal that touched so many of their campuses, students seethed in unison. They railed against privilege and greed. They worried that their diplomas might have been tarnished even before they were handed to them on stage. Two Stanford University students channeled their fury into a class-action lawsuit that claims they wasted their money when they applied to schools that were ultimately linked to what the Justice Department called its largest ever college admissions prosecution. At Yale, a 20-year-old junior said she felt vindicated because her stellar grades had earned her acceptance — not cheating or kickbacks. At Georgetown, arguments erupted between students in classes and others offered their loan applications to each other as satirical proof that their parents had not wielded their wallets to gain them a spot. “When the rich, famous and influential game a system already susceptible to corruption, it perpetuates who remains in power,” said Jessica Wolfrom, a graduate student at Georgetown. “And, really, what does it mean when the system itself is so competitive that the people with the most privilege and wealth feel they have to cheat and lie and pay people off to get their kids ahead? Where does that leave everyone else?” [Read about the completely legal and largely unregulated world of private college consulting.] At the University of California, Los Angeles — among the campuses ensnared in the shocking scheme — students like Ayesha Haleem said she and her classmates were both heartbroken and fuming. “The higher education system has always benefited people who come from privileged backgrounds,” said Ms. Haleem, a Pakistani 23-year-old senior. “Students of color have it so much harder to even get to these places.” The issue of race-based admissions dominated conversations at the University of Texas at Austin, which was party to a landmark affirmative action case several years ago and has a student body that is now 41 percent white, down from 62.7 percent in 2000. The university’s men’s tennis coach, Michael Center, was fired Wednesday after he was accused of taking a $100,000 bribe in exchange for recruiting a well-off student who was not a competitive tennis player. “This is a big story not just because of possible corruption, but also because there is an obvious rift this has exposed on campus,” said Forrest Milburn, a 23-year-old senior who is the managing editor of The Daily Texan, the campus newspaper. “People are thinking it’s affirmative action when really it’s just wealth and privilege that gets you in the door.” [Read more on how the admissions scandal has been a harsh reminder of racial disparities.] The scandal’s legal fallout is most likely only beginning, and it has already spread beyond the criminal indictments that federal prosecutors made public this week. On Wednesday, just one day after prosecutors announced the charges in the so-called Operation Varsity Blues, two Stanford University students brought a class-action complaint in a federal court in California, and accused college after college of negligence. Although the suit was amended on Thursday — dropping one of the students but adding other plaintiffs without ties to Stanford — the case was an example of the exasperation on campuses. The plaintiffs in the case alleged that they had wasted money when they applied to schools that were ultimately ensnared in the scheme and that every “qualified, rejected” student had also been hurt by the coast-to-coast fraud. transcript Many of the universities, though, have moved swiftly to fire coaches implicated in the scheme. Parents have made first appearances in court. And companies have distanced themselves from executives accused of paying William Singer, a college admissions consultant, to use bribes and deceit to raise their children’s test scores or get them admitted to their chosen schools through athletic recruiting spots, despite the fact that they were not competitive athletes. In a brief court appearance on Friday, a Vancouver businessman who is accused of paying Mr. Singer at least $200,000 between 2011 and 2013 to have a hired test administrator take the SAT in place of each of his two sons, and a Canadian high school graduation exam for his older son, pleaded not guilty to conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud. The businessman, David Sidoo, was released on $1.5 million bail, under conditions including that he was not to travel beyond the United States or Canada. He was the first parent to enter a plea. [Learn more about how families who have legally hired college admissions consultants view the ethics of their choices.] U.C.L.A. warned this week that it might punish students who were connected to the scheme, including those already admitted or enrolled, “up to and including cancellation of admission,” the university said in a statement. Wake Forest said that a student who had been admitted after $100,000 in payments were routed through the volleyball coach was still enrolled on the campus in Winston-Salem, N.C., adding that it had no reason to believe that the student had been aware of the scheme. And Stanford said the two prospective students caught up in the case were never admitted; one did not even apply. Still, students at the Palo Alto, Calif., campus said they were deeply disappointed that their university was enmeshed in the scandal. “I worked so hard to get admitted into the school,” said Hailee Hoffman, a 22-year-old senior who is on the gymnastics team. In addition to taking advanced placement classes, she said she also trained more than 30 hours a week while in high school. “To find that someone had exploited the system and tried to buy their way in was so disheartening.” [Read more about how the authorities say the scheme worked, from bribes to doctored photos.] About a year ago, federal prosecutors working on a securities fraud case were tipped off to the elaborate scheme by a suspect who hoped to be granted leniency for his cooperation. The suspect, identified by The Wall Street Journal as Morrie Tobin, who attended Yale University and is now a Los Angeles financial executive, reportedly told investigators that the college’s soccer coach had sought a bribe in exchange for getting his daughter into the school. This week, the campus was mostly quiet because of Spring Break. But students were still abuzz about the scandal. Britton O’Daly, the editor-in-chief of the Yale Daily News, which has published three stories about the university’s connection, said he was spending the week in silence at a French monastery. But he could not stop himself from “sneaking away from monks to check my phone because of all this.” Students whose parents were charged in the case could not be reached for comment this week. But Jack Buckingham, whose mother, Jane Buckingham, is accused of paying $50,000 for an ACT proctor to take the test in his place, told The Hollywood Reporter that he was unknowingly involved in a plot that gave those “who may not work as hard as others an advantage over those who truly deserve those spots.” “For that I am sorry,” he told the publication, adding that this might “finally cut down on money and wealth being such a heavy factor in college admissions.” Olivia Jade Giannulli, a 19-year-old social media influencer whose celebrity parents were accused of paying $500,000 in bribes for her and her sister to be falsely recruited to U.S.C.’s rowing team, has remained silent. But she was dropped from a sponsorship with a makeup company and her Instagram account has been the target of vitriol. This week, as the scandal unfolded and her parents were arrested, Ms. Giannulli was celebrating Spring Break on a yacht owned by a U.S.C. Board of Trustees member. On Thursday, TMZ reported that she and her sister, also a U.S.C. student, decided to drop out over fears of being bullied and would not return to campus next week. Still, there was also a measure of sympathy for those unwittingly caught in their parents’ alleged deception. “I know that I would feel pretty ashamed if my parents were embroiled in a scandal of this magnitude,” Ms. Wolfrom said. “If I were in their position, I am not sure I’d show up to class again anytime soon.” Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misidentified the college from which Morrie Tobin graduated. He attended Yale, but later graduated from the University of Vermont. An earlier version of this article misstated the number of articles that the Yale Daily News published this week about the university’s connection to the scandal. It was three, not one.",The New York Times
2019,‘So Heartbreaking’: Funerals Begin for New Zealand Attack Victims,"CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand — Azaam Afaan did not want to be late. The first funeral since Friday’s terrorist attack was about to begin, and though he had no idea who was being buried, he just knew he needed to participate. Staring through dark sunglasses at the cemetery’s fringe — fighting back tears for a slain friend, as hundreds of mourners approached a hilltop of dirt cut open with row after row of graves — he said he wanted to be part of someone’s goodbye. “It’s like you’re short of breath,” he said, explaining what it has been like to wait so long for the burials to begin after a gunman killed 50 people at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand. “Now we can breathe freely. They’re going to the place they’re supposed to be.” Islam’s rituals of death prioritize immediate burial and a joyful departure. But as the first six victims were laid to rest on Wednesday in a city where flowers and police tape still fill intersections, the opportunities for relief continued to be elusive, drawing out sorrow, allowing time for relatives to arrive from abroad and delivering closure in spare droplets. [Dozens of victims were buried on Friday as Christchurch residents and visitors shared a Muslim call to prayer.] The process of identifying bodies has been, by all accounts, meticulous, in line with international standards and New Zealand’s strict procedures for murder victims. It has also been divisive. Some of the affected families described the process as paternalistic. “We’ve been doing this for 1,400 years — we don’t need instructions,” said Saad Nasser, 57, as he departed the day’s first funeral, for Khaled Mustafa, 44, and his son, Hamza Mustafa, 16, Syrian refugees who had moved to New Zealand last year. Families and some officials spoke of rifts emerging as coroners work overtime to identify the victims while many wonder what is taking so long to bury the dead. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern told reporters on Wednesday that she shared the families’ frustration. “I know the process has been incredibly difficult and frustratingly slow,” she said. Only a few hours earlier, she had spoken to a student assembly at Cashmere High School. Three of the school’s students had been excused to attend Friday Prayer, as they regularly did. They were all shot at Al Noor mosque, and two died. One student raised her hand with a question that no one had yet asked the prime minister in public. “How are you?” she asked. “Thank you for asking,” Ms. Ardern said. “I’m very sad.” The limbo of loss without burial has rearranged the routines of life across Christchurch, where new buildings sit beside empty lots — reminders of the earthquakes that devastated the city in 2010 and 2011. This city of around 375,000 people is for the moment filled with emptiness — with children out of class and offices unused — and also flooded with the world’s humanity. In their simple home at the edge of a quiet park, Nadim Than, 58, the uncle of Talha Rashid and brother of Naeem Rashid — who tried to tackle the gunman when he first entered the Al Noor Mosque during Friday Prayer, only to be shot and killed — welcomed not just long-missed brothers and other relatives from Pakistan on Wednesday. He said his family had received at least 50, and probably closer to 100, visitors paying respects: Christians, Hindus, Sikhs; well-wishers from Fiji, Australia, England, and New Zealand itself. “We feel energized when someone comes,” he said. “At night we feel uneasy, because we have no one.” Their brother, the one who had always been the high-achiever in business and faith — “Naeem the Great” was how he signed his letters as a child — was gone. And still unseen. Earlier in the day, Mr. Than had sent a text message to a reporter: “No update on bodies received here.” In many ways, that was the craving that needed most to be satisfied. Police Commissioner Mike Bush said on Wednesday that the authorities were working long hours, with extra assistance. He corrected the timeline of the attack, noting that the police had arrested the suspect 21 minutes after the first distress call, down from the initial police report of 36 minutes. But he also said that as of 11:30 p.m. on Tuesday, roughly 100 hours after the shootings, the New Zealand authorities had identified and planned to release just 21 bodies. [The Times has compiled profiles of many of the victims. Read them here.] In the bare, white living room of an Airbnb house near the center of Christchurch, just before the coroners finished for the night, Haneen Alayan, 25, and Abdallah Alayan, 21, were waiting to hear whether their brother — Atta Elayyan, 33, a New Zealand futsal player and head of an app development company — would be among them. Abdallah Alayan said he wasn’t picking up phone calls from people he knew, as he waited for an official answer. But every time his phone rang with an unfamiliar local number, he jumped to answer it. “We can’t miss these calls,” said his sister. In the living room were Mr. Elayyan’s friends, talking and laughing together, remembering their brother — a patient family man who could always be relied upon for good advice (and giving sharp amateur haircuts). There were so many people waiting for Atta Elayyan that they had filled this house, and another across town. They said they had received “99.9 percent confirmation” from the police that Mr. Elayyan was killed at Al Noor Mosque. His father, Mohammad Alayan, was also shot and is recovering in the hospital. But as of Wednesday night the family was still waiting for a formal post-mortem to give complete certainty. What they longed for: their brother’s body to be returned to them and buried. Outside the Linwood cemetery, a potent silence surrounded most of those who entered, leaving only the sound of a breeze blowing through fall leaves. The mourners started to appear in droves just before 11 a.m. for the first funeral, for Khaled Mustafa and his son, Hamza. The Mustafa family had fled civil war and spent several years in Jordan waiting for a country to accept them. They arrived in New Zealand last July, and eight months later, they were killed in the attack, leaving behind a grieving family. Mr. Afaan, 38 and originally from Fiji, spoke quietly of the dead. “This is the final resting place for them, from here onward,” he said. Inside, hundreds of mourners — close friends and visitors from around the world who never knew them — squeezed together in groups, men at the front, women near the back. Just before 12:30 p.m., Sheikh Mohammad Amir, the chairman of the Religious Advisory Board of the Federation of Islamic Associations of New Zealand, advised everyone that together they would say the Salat al-Janazah, the Muslim funeral prayer featuring a call and response with four recitations of “Allahu akbar,” then walk with the family as they carried the dead to the graves. Hamza’s brother Zaid — who was in a wheelchair after being shot in the leg — could be seen rolling over the bumpy ground as the body of his father and brother were carried in simple wooden boxes. “Throw three handfuls,” Sheikh Amir announced over the loudspeaker, referring to the Muslim tradition of tossing dirt into the grave. “Please, brothers, just use your hands so everyone can participate.” Backhoes had dug the graves; there were 10 rows of rectangular holes. At the edge, two young men embraced, paused, then embraced again. Mourners later said there were so many people that they could only throw one handful of dirt, not three. “It’s just so heartbreaking,” Shazia Bano, 35, said as she walked to her car. A few hours later, at 5 p.m., it was time for more. Thicker clouds had gathered, the wind had picked up and the crowd looked a bit smaller. One by one, four more bodies were prayed over and carried to their final resting places. There was Junaid Ismail, 36, a Christchurch native who worked at the family business, a dairy. He had a wife and three children. There was Ashraf Ali, a longtime Christchurch resident originally from Fiji, and Lilik Abdul Hamid, originally from Indonesia. Cheerful and well-liked, he had been an aircraft maintenance engineer with Air New Zealand for 16 years.

2019,‘So Heartbreaking’: Funerals Begin for New Zealand Attack Victims,"CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand — Azaam Afaan did not want to be late. The first funeral since Friday’s terrorist attack was about to begin, and though he had no idea who was being buried, he just knew he needed to participate. Staring through dark sunglasses at the cemetery’s fringe — fighting back tears for a slain friend, as hundreds of mourners approached a hilltop of dirt cut open with row after row of graves — he said he wanted to be part of someone’s goodbye. “It’s like you’re short of breath,” he said, explaining what it has been like to wait so long for the burials to begin after a gunman killed 50 people at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand. “Now we can breathe freely. They’re going to the place they’re supposed to be.” Islam’s rituals of death prioritize immediate burial and a joyful departure. But as the first six victims were laid to rest on Wednesday in a city where flowers and police tape still fill intersections, the opportunities for relief continued to be elusive, drawing out sorrow, allowing time for relatives to arrive from abroad and delivering closure in spare droplets. [Dozens of victims were buried on Friday as Christchurch residents and visitors shared a Muslim call to prayer.] The process of identifying bodies has been, by all accounts, meticulous, in line with international standards and New Zealand’s strict procedures for murder victims. It has also been divisive. Some of the affected families described the process as paternalistic. “We’ve been doing this for 1,400 years — we don’t need instructions,” said Saad Nasser, 57, as he departed the day’s first funeral, for Khaled Mustafa, 44, and his son, Hamza Mustafa, 16, Syrian refugees who had moved to New Zealand last year. Families and some officials spoke of rifts emerging as coroners work overtime to identify the victims while many wonder what is taking so long to bury the dead. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern told reporters on Wednesday that she shared the families’ frustration. “I know the process has been incredibly difficult and frustratingly slow,” she said. Only a few hours earlier, she had spoken to a student assembly at Cashmere High School. Three of the school’s students had been excused to attend Friday Prayer, as they regularly did. They were all shot at Al Noor mosque, and two died. One student raised her hand with a question that no one had yet asked the prime minister in public. “How are you?” she asked. “Thank you for asking,” Ms. Ardern said. “I’m very sad.” The limbo of loss without burial has rearranged the routines of life across Christchurch, where new buildings sit beside empty lots — reminders of the earthquakes that devastated the city in 2010 and 2011. This city of around 375,000 people is for the moment filled with emptiness — with children out of class and offices unused — and also flooded with the world’s humanity. In their simple home at the edge of a quiet park, Nadim Than, 58, the uncle of Talha Rashid and brother of Naeem Rashid — who tried to tackle the gunman when he first entered the Al Noor Mosque during Friday Prayer, only to be shot and killed — welcomed not just long-missed brothers and other relatives from Pakistan on Wednesday. He said his family had received at least 50, and probably closer to 100, visitors paying respects: Christians, Hindus, Sikhs; well-wishers from Fiji, Australia, England, and New Zealand itself. “We feel energized when someone comes,” he said. “At night we feel uneasy, because we have no one.” Their brother, the one who had always been the high-achiever in business and faith — “Naeem the Great” was how he signed his letters as a child — was gone. And still unseen. Earlier in the day, Mr. Than had sent a text message to a reporter: “No update on bodies received here.” In many ways, that was the craving that needed most to be satisfied. Police Commissioner Mike Bush said on Wednesday that the authorities were working long hours, with extra assistance. He corrected the timeline of the attack, noting that the police had arrested the suspect 21 minutes after the first distress call, down from the initial police report of 36 minutes. But he also said that as of 11:30 p.m. on Tuesday, roughly 100 hours after the shootings, the New Zealand authorities had identified and planned to release just 21 bodies. [The Times has compiled profiles of many of the victims. Read them here.] In the bare, white living room of an Airbnb house near the center of Christchurch, just before the coroners finished for the night, Haneen Alayan, 25, and Abdallah Alayan, 21, were waiting to hear whether their brother — Atta Elayyan, 33, a New Zealand futsal player and head of an app development company — would be among them. Abdallah Alayan said he wasn’t picking up phone calls from people he knew, as he waited for an official answer. But every time his phone rang with an unfamiliar local number, he jumped to answer it. “We can’t miss these calls,” said his sister. In the living room were Mr. Elayyan’s friends, talking and laughing together, remembering their brother — a patient family man who could always be relied upon for good advice (and giving sharp amateur haircuts). There were so many people waiting for Atta Elayyan that they had filled this house, and another across town. They said they had received “99.9 percent confirmation” from the police that Mr. Elayyan was killed at Al Noor Mosque. His father, Mohammad Alayan, was also shot and is recovering in the hospital. But as of Wednesday night the family was still waiting for a formal post-mortem to give complete certainty. What they longed for: their brother’s body to be returned to them and buried. Outside the Linwood cemetery, a potent silence surrounded most of those who entered, leaving only the sound of a breeze blowing through fall leaves. The mourners started to appear in droves just before 11 a.m. for the first funeral, for Khaled Mustafa and his son, Hamza. The Mustafa family had fled civil war and spent several years in Jordan waiting for a country to accept them. They arrived in New Zealand last July, and eight months later, they were killed in the attack, leaving behind a grieving family. Mr. Afaan, 38 and originally from Fiji, spoke quietly of the dead. “This is the final resting place for them, from here onward,” he said.

2019,‘Solitary’ Is an Uncommonly Powerful Memoir About Four Decades in Confinement,"Books of The Times When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. Albert Woodfox grew up poor in New Orleans’s Treme neighborhood. He didn’t know his father. His mother, who could not read or write, sometimes prostituted herself to keep food on the table for Albert and his siblings. He turned to crime young. For a while his misdeeds were on the mild side, the sort of antics that Chuck Berry referred to in his autobiography as “hubcap ripping and parked-car creeping, dime-store clipping and window peeping.” They got more serious. By the time he was in his teens, he was breaking into houses and convenience stores. He stole cars, mugged people, joined a gang and got a heroin habit. He once broke out of prison and, on his way home, appropriated a cement mixer, roaring away at 10 miles per hour. He was caught because he left his wallet on the dashboard. Woodfox spends the first sections of his uncommonly powerful memoir, “Solitary: Unbroken by Four Decades in Solitary Confinement. My Story of Transformation and Hope,” objectively detailing his young life of crime. This is not easy reading. What life did not give him, he was determined to take. “I robbed people, scared them, threatened them, intimidated them,” he writes. “I stole from people who had almost nothing. My people. Black people. I broke into their homes and took possessions they worked hard for; took their wallets out of their pockets. I beat people up. I was a chauvinist pig.” The first time he was sent to Angola — the notorious maximum-security prison farm in Louisiana, named after the plantation that once occupied its land — he got a tattoo from another inmate: Charles Neville, the musician. That was an eight-month stretch. In 1969, when he was 22, Woodfox was sentenced to 50 years for armed robbery. With good behavior he expected to be released in half that time. In various prisons he’d met members of the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense. They gave him books to read and a historical sense of his people and his past. He learned about the racial iniquities (all-white juries and police forces, for starters) of the American justice system. [ Woodfox spoke to The Times after he was released from prison in 2016: “When I began to understand who I was, I considered myself free.” ] By the time he got back to Angola, he writes, “I was a black man with a long prison sentence ahead of me. Inside, however, everything had changed. I had morals, principles and values I never had before.” He adds: “I would never be a criminal again.” But on April 17, 1972, a white prison guard named Brent Miller was killed at Angola. Woodfox and another member of the Panthers were accused of the murder, despite an utter lack of evidence. A sham trial commenced, and they were found guilty and sentenced to life in solitary. For a crime he did not commit, Woodfox would spend more than four decades in solitary confinement: 23 hours a day in a 6-by-9-foot cell. He recounts consistently brutal treatment by guards, rats and vermin, deadly heat and no way out of solitary for good behavior. His memoir is the story of how he survived. The “legacy of slavery” was everywhere at Angola, Woodfox writes. When he arrived it was segregated. White prisoners mostly worked indoors while the black prisoners worked the fields, often cutting sugar cane under the supervision of guards with shotguns. The prison had a rape culture. The day new inmates arrived was called “fresh fish day,” and sexual predators lined up to view the goods. “If you were raped at Angola, or what was called ‘turned out,’ your life in prison was virtually over,” he writes. Woodfox was tough enough to protect himself. He later began to shield other men from rape on principle, often taking beatings in the process. The heart of “Solitary” is Woodfox’s decision to “take my pain and turn it into compassion, and not hate.” He read legal books and began to win lawsuits over cruel and unusual punishment. His memoir is strewn with words from others he read while in prison — Nelson Mandela, James Baldwin, Frantz Fanon, Frederick Douglass. He taught men to read. He organized umpteen hunger strikes. He made a difference in many men’s lives. “Solitary” is a profound book about friendship. Along with Robert King and Herman Wallace, Woodfox became known as part of the “Angola 3.” These men were mostly kept separated from one another, but managed to remain in contact. “I didn’t know how so much loyalty and devotion could exist between three men,” Woodfox writes. Slowly, word of their decades in solitary began to leak out. This story has many heroes, men and women who worked to bring the men’s story to the public and to demonstrate their innocence in the murder of the prison guard. Some of them are lawyers. Others are those like the late Anita Roddick, the founder of The Body Shop, an early supporter of the Angola 3 who devoted a great deal of time and money to their cause. The prisoners were the subject of a documentary, “In the Land of the Free” (2010), and Amnesty International published a report on them in 2011. This story, which Woodfox has written with Leslie George, is told simply but not tersely. If it sometimes induces claustrophobia, well, it’s meant to. Very often the painful details, and the author’s own humanity in the face of them, start to make your chest feel too small. Only occasionally, when recounting the details of Woodfox’s many appeals and retrials and attempts at retrials, does this memoir perhaps necessarily step into the weeds. In 2007, a Louisiana judge wrote that, by 1999, “these plaintiffs had been in extended lockdown more than anyone in Angola’s history, and more than any other living prisoner in the entire United States.” Wallace had terminal liver cancer and died in 2013, days after he was released from prison when a judge ruled that his original indictment in the killing of the guard had been unconstitutional. King was released from prison in 2001. Woodfox remained behind bars until 2016. “We knew that we were not locked up in a cell 23 hours a day because of what we did,” he writes. “We were there because of who we were.” Woodfox reminds us, in “Solitary,” of the tens of thousands of men, women and children in solitary confinement in the United States. This is torture of a modern variety. If the ending of this book does not leave you with tears pooling down in your clavicles, you are a stronger person than I am. More lasting is Woodfox’s conviction that the American justice system is in dire need of reform. He doesn’t quote Dostoyevsky, but I will: “The degree of civilization in a society can be judged by entering its prisons.”",The New York Times
2019,"‘Star Trek: Discovery’ Season 2, Episode 10: Just Breathe","Star Trek: Discovery Season 2, Episode 10: ‘The Red Angel’ Every time I blinked in this week’s episode of “Star Trek: Discovery,” directed by Hanelle M. Culpepper, there seemed to be another plot twist regarding the identity of the Red Angel. It was difficult to keep track, but let me see if I can run down the key ones: — Future Burnham is the Red Angel and as she travels through time, she hopes a future bit of artificial intelligence will follow her. [A reader points out that Burnham, in a precarious state, mutters “Mom” at the very last second of the episode, so it turns out the Red Angel actually might be not Burnham.] — 20 years before, Klingons were experimenting in time travel. Huh. — Section 31 created Project Daedalus, the suit for time travel that would become the Red Angel. — Burnham’s parents were part of Section 31 and designed the suit. Their death was Leland’s fault. They obtained something called a time crystal, and Klingons traced it back to them, and murdered them over it. Burnham has carried all this grief for years — thinking she was responsible for their death — and now she finds out it wasn’t her fault. — Cornwell used to be a therapist. This is just a sampling of this disjointed, crammed episode where simply too much happened, with minimal time to process and several distracting subplots. The biggest reveal — Burnham being the Red Angel — was an ambitious, interesting twist. But far too many scenes seemed extraneous: Why did Airiam get an onscreen funeral that rivaled Spock’s from “Wrath of Khan?” Did we really need Culber having a therapy session with an admiral? And for the love of all that is Gene Roddenberry, what does Ash Tyler do? The central action of “The Red Angel” comes from the scheme to have Burnham lure the future version of herself into saving her in the present day as she suffocates. The theory is that Future Burnham needs the current version to exist in the future. Once Future Burnham is captured, Starfleet is going to have some tough questions for her. The plan is objectively insane, dangerous and should never have been greenlit, even with the fate of the universe at stake. Present Day Burnham appears to die while the rest of the Discovery crew grimly watch. Cornwell, for an inexplicable reason, demurs to her subordinate officer regarding when to pull the plug on the operation. But in typical “Discovery” fashion, what is dead may never die. Future Burnham shows up, zaps Present Day, and she lives. I must say I really got a great thrill out of seeing the reveal of Sonja Sohn as the future version of Burnham (or her mother?). She is, of course, best known for starring on “The Wire,” but she also put up a strong performance recently in the Netflix film “High Flying Bird.” Section 31’s motivations here are suspect, but not in a way that makes this rogue group compelling. In some scenes, its personnel (Leland, Evil Georgiou, Tyler) are genuinely benevolent Starfleet colleagues. In others, they’re trying to to ruin Spock’s brain. Leland, in particular, doesn’t seem to know what he’s doing. Why was it necessary for him to keep the knowledge about Burnham’s parents (or even Project Daedalus) secret from her this whole time, other than to serve the plot? The strongest part of the episode was easily the performance of Sonequa Martin-Green. She ran the gauntlet of emotions: mourning, raging, physical suffering, contemplative, authoritative, and in one scene with Spock, playful. She had an entire episode on her shoulders and delivered. And speaking of Spock: I’m speculating that we’re all going to skip over him holding crew members who wanted to stop Burnham’s suffocating at phaserpoint while disobeying direct orders. At the risk of seeming too curmudgeonly, I’ll give the writers of the show — this chapter was written by Chris Silvestri and Anthony Maranville — credit for the overarching Red Angel story line. It’s complex, risky and imaginative. “Discovery” has swung for the fences more so than any other show in the franchise’s history and it’s resulted in — ahem — the plots boldly going where no Trek has gone before. Whatever issues I had with this episode, I am definitely curious to find out more about the mystery of why Future Burnham (or her mother) is doing what she’s doing. And also: The notion that pre-Captain Kirk Starfleet developed time-travel abilities that we never heard about in any other Trek iteration is going to be a fascinating box for the writers to get themselves out of. But besides all that: If we’re going to focus on what secondary characters are doing, can we bring back Tig Notaro?",The New York Times
2019,"‘Star Trek: Discovery’ Season 2, Episode 11: Struggle Is Pointless","Star Trek: Discovery The board is now Burnham’s. Or so it seems. So much of this season of “Star Trek: Discovery” is about control. Of course, there is the literal villain — Control — the malevolent artificial intelligence which aims to wipe out all sentient life in the universe. A charming fellow, that one. And then there is the concept of control: So many characters struggle to take command of their own destinies, even though with the time travel element, it is a futile battle. Some characters — Saru, for example — have done better with this than others. But no character has had her life upended due to events beyond her control like Burnham. Whether it is investigating what happened with Spock, the re-emergence of her mother or the loss of her friend Airiam, Burham is running from one emotional shock to the next. Her life has been full of suffering from a young age. The Vulcans shun her. Her adoptive father doesn’t think highly of her human background. Her biological parents were murdered — and she only finds out decades later the real reason. In “Perpetual Infinity,” Burnham is teased with the slightest bit of happiness: Her mother is within arm’s reach and finally they can be together. Of course, there is a containment field between the two of them, and by the end of the episode, Burnham has lost her once again — this time, likely for good. She’s less a Vulcan than a Buddhist: Life is suffering. At the very start of the episode, the Discovery crew awakens Burnham from the dead, because in the “Discovery” universe, death is merely a construct. No one really dies. There is only struggle and even that is pointless. Control takes over Leland’s body, essentially, to fool his Starfleet colleagues into doing the artificial intelligence’s bidding. I am not entirely sure what Control is, but there are some theories that this is an early form of the Borg. I’m not sure I buy that: Control is focused on destruction, whereas the Borg on perfection. (And selfishly, I am really hoping this isn’t the Borg. The most terrifying villains in Trek history do not need an origin story. Their mystery adds to the intrigue.) A side note: How did Control restrain Leland to the chair? As far as last week’s big revelation, Burnham’s mother, Gabrielle, played admirably by Sonja Sohn, is trapped in Burnham’s time. She appears to not be able to stay in different time periods for long, because an anchor of some sort keeps pulling her to a spot where organic life has been wiped out: apparently 950 years into the future from when Klingons appeared to kill her and her husband. She doesn’t want to speak to her daughter. She only wants to speak to Pike, to whom she says, “I could say more about your future, but you won’t like it,” an Easter egg for Trekkies well aware of Pike ending up in a wheelchair. Gabrielle wants Discovery to destroy the sphere’s data archive (a potentially invaluable resource), without which Control can’t evolve. When mother and daughter finally see each other, Gabrielle is cold. She says she’s let Burnham go: “There’s only the bigger picture now. Nothing else.” Destroying the sphere doesn’t work, so the Discovery crew hatches a plan, with some incoherent technobabble: They’re going to launch the time traveling suit and the sphere so far into the future that, somehow, this will save sentient life in the universe. And somehow, they’ll be able to get Gabrielle to stay in the current time too. Possessed Leland disrupts these plans — this isn’t what Control wants. He stabs Tyler, who of course lives, and warns the Discovery crew that Leland is coming to the surface to cause a ruckus. Here, of course, some Starfleet crew members appear to die. The reason they die is because the audience doesn’t know their names. The gambit from Leland doesn’t quite work, but it requires Gabrielle to sacrifice herself in order to send the suit and the sphere into the future. Problem solved! But unfortunately, Burnham is in deep pain once again. “Perpetual Infinity,” written by Alan McElroy and Brandon Schultz, was tightly focused but heavy on exposition. It also was stuffed with technobabble to the point that its developments were a bit difficult to follow. As she often does, Sonequa Martin-Green made the episode a compelling watch. She plays Burnham’s vulnerability very well. I would have liked to see Sohn stick around for a bit more of the story line, but “Discovery” writers like to fool the audience. She might be back before we know it. Once again, I am left wondering what Tyler’s role is here. He seems to have a moral center, but his abilities seem minimal for someone in Section 31. And we seem to have forgotten why he made it to Section 31 to begin with: L’Rell staged his death to allow him to escape Klingons who doubted his loyalties. I try not to watch teaser trailers for next week because I like the surprise, so I am at a loss of where the story goes next. Is the universe safe from Control? Are we good? Can we give Burnham something to smile about? Please?",The New York Times
2019,"‘Star Trek: Discovery’ Season 2, Episode 7: A Young Spock","‘Star Trek: Discovery’ Season 2, Episode 7: “Light and Shadows” Finally. It took seven episodes, but we get our first extended look at Ethan Peck’s portrayal of Spock. Here are the people who have played Spock so far in Trek history: Leonard Nimoy, Zachary Quinto and several children and young adults who barely had any lines. But Peck will be the first to flesh out a younger version of Spock. In “Light and Shadows,” he is portrayed as either catatonic or repeating the same words over and over again. He also has a beard. And as it turns out, even though Starfleet has apparently placed a high premium on finding the Vulcan, he’s actually able to sneak back into Vulcan undetected. Not even Sarek or Section 31, who are supposed to be keeping an eye out for this kind of stuff, realize this. Peck’s Spock seems to have more personality than previous iterations of Spock. He seems to lean in to his humanity a bit more, whereas Quinto and Nimoy shied away from it, perhaps as a result of playing an older version. Amanda Grayson points out that Sarek is performing a Vulcan ritual called tokmar — which can “bring lost souls back home.” I don’t know if I spelled “tokmar” correctly so perhaps I am a lost soul as well. But the ritual isn’t working. Because Grayson, the mother of Spock and Burnham, knows the truth, which is that Spock is home, hidden in a sacred crypt that apparently no one else on Vulcan is aware of. We see Spock etching the Red Angel into the walls of the crypt. We know, because of Burnham’s personal log at the start of the episode, that it is now believed that the angel is a humanoid being from the future. “But whose future? And why?” Burnham asks. It’s the key mystery of the season, and finally, we’re making some progress in finding out, because we’ve found Spock. The writers of “Discovery” keep hitting the point home that as children, Burnham and Spock were close. There are multiple flashbacks in this episode, which is directed by Marta Cunningham, showing them together. It throws more gasoline on the questions that Trek fans have been asking ever since before “Discovery” premiered: If they were that close as children, why did we never find out about Burnham in any previous iteration of Trek? More on this in a bit. Grayson reveals, in an unusually tense conversation with Sarek, that as children, Spock had a learning disability, which made him an outcast on Vulcan. Sarek responds with dripping condescension. Vulcan gaslighting, one might say. Want exclusive “Thrones” interviews and news, as well as the internet’s best articles on that week’s episode? Sign up for our Season 8 newsletter here. “You never truly respected humanity,” Grayson says piercingly. She has a point, considering the way Sarek looks down upon the way humans act. For a race based on logic, Sarek’s decision to turn Spock over to Section 31 really makes no sense. “Outside of this room, no one is more motivated to heal Spock than Section 31,” Sarek says. Really? The counterintelligence group with advanced technology that counts Evil Georgiou among its ranks and is currently chasing after Spock assuming he’s murdered multiple Starfleet officers? And why does Sarek think not turning over Spock to Section 31 would jeopardize Burnham’s Starfleet career? Of course, Section 31’s intentions aren’t pure. Georgiou, as a good deed, warns Burnham that the group intends on extracting Spock’s memories, which would ruin him. They stage an elaborate fight. Burnham rescues Spock and now they’re on their way to Talos IV, the home of the Talosians and a reference to the first pilot episode of the original Trek. The other story line in the episode is that the rest of the Discovery crew gets caught near a time loop anomaly of some sort. This story line is a bit derivative of some past Trek episodes, like “Cause and Effect” from “The Next Generation.” Pike and Tyler go to investigate, for no real reason other than to serve the plot. The “Discovery” writers seem to be straining to give Tyler things to do this season, but the action sequences within the loop are compelling. Tyler openly defying Pike in a life-threatening situation where time is a factor? Unnecessary. Back to Spock, because it’s no coincidence that the strongest parts of the episode involve him and the Red Angel mystery. This is my wild prediction, based on what we’ve seen so far: We seem to be headed toward some sort of time travel catastrophe that will wipe out entire timelines because of the Red Angel, which will explain why in future Treks, we never hear about Burnham. The “Discovery” writers have consistently showed a willingness to take ambitious risks and Trek has historically had no problem erasing timelines — hello J.J. Abrams! All in all, I’m glad we’ve made some progress on the season’s central mystery.",The New York Times
2019,"‘Star Trek: Discovery’ Season 2, Episode 8: The Mother of All Callbacks","Star Trek: Discovery Talk about callbacks. In the newest episode of “Star Trek: Discovery,” directed by T.J. Scott, we return to Talos IV, where the initial unaired pilot of the original series took place. You might remember, it was called “The Cage,” and featured Pike as the centerpiece of the crew, rather than Kirk, whom we all came to know and love. The episode, shot in the 1960s, was scrapped (although it is now available on Netflix), because it didn’t impress NBC executives at the time. It also was very sexist! At one point, Pike expresses his displeasure with having a woman on the bridge. The original series did return to Talos IV, in a classic two-parter of the original series called “The Menagerie.” In that episode, Spock runs afoul of Starfleet and steals the Enterprise to send it to the forbidden planet. In “Discovery,” Starfleet is on the hunt for Spock again, although for different reasons. “If Memory Serves,” which is a convoluted but absolutely delightful episode, has several bits of catnip for Trek aficionados. The one that I appreciated most was near the end of the episode, when Pike says to Spock, “Is that a smile I see on your face?” In “The Cage,” the original pilot, the episode’s tone was much different and Leonard Nimoy’s Spock is seen smiling, something we rarely, if ever, see again. In “Discovery,” Ethan Peck’s Spock has guided Burnham to Talos IV because the Talosians, a race that can converse telepathically and project images over long distances, can help Spock make sense of what is happening in his mind. Namely, he is experiencing time in a “fluid, rather than a linear construct.” He must free himself from “conventional logic.” I’ll note: the Talosians are a bit more benevolent in this edition of “Star Trek” than the original series, and help the Discovery crew elude Section 31. Vina, the woman who crash landed on Talos IV and developed a deep affection for Pike in “The Cage,” plays a crucial part in reconnecting Burnham and Spock to Pike. Anson Mount does excellent work here when he is startled by seeing Vina again. He has filled the Lorca-role of the charismatic captain quite well this season. This is the first episode in which we really see what kind of Spock we are going to see in “Discovery.” Peck’s Spock is clearly bitter toward Burnham and not afraid to flash anger, certainly more so than the adult versions of Spock we have become used to. It’s revealed that Spock’s anger toward Burnham is a result of Burnham telling him, as a child, that he is a “half-breed” and mocking his ancestry, in a misguided attempt to escape home to keep the family safe from Vulcan extremists. It seems like an odd reason for them to have fallen out for all these years, especially given that they both end up in Starfleet. Also, Spock didn’t murder anyone from Starfleet. He neck-pinched a doctor and knocked out a couple security guards. So Starfleet is engaged in a cover-up of a decorated officer, as Spock shows in a flashback. The most concrete knowledge we have of the Red Angel, at this point, also comes from Spock: He or she is a human intent on changing the timeline we are all living in, which ends with the destruction of all sentient beings. No biggie! By the end of the episode, the Discovery, as Saru puts it, is “the most wanted ship in the galaxy.” So now, the rogue ship will go on the run, promising no shortage of unusual hijinx for the rest of this season.

I had a bit of trouble following the episode, mostly because I don’t understand why Starfleet sees Spock as such a threat. One unidentified member of the brass says at the beginning of the episode that “Spock’s foreknowledge of these signals appearing around the galaxy and his interactions with the Red Angel constitute vital intelligence.” O.K., so why treat him as a murder suspect? Why not work with him to learn more? I won’t delve too much into the B-storyline of the episode: Namely, sulking Hugh Culber. The former ship’s doctor is angry at the world, and particularly angry at Stamets, although he doesn’t really know why. This plotline felt distracting. I was especially baffled when no one stepped in to break up the fight between Culber and Tyler, but I couldn’t get too angry about it — the “Discovery” writers don’t seem to know what to do with either character. The members of the Discovery bridge crew grow unusually antagonistic to Tyler, eventually confining him to quarters, accusing him of sabotage. Tyler’s presence on the ship has been strange and toothless to me from the start, so again, this was a plotline I couldn’t get invested in. But overall, now that we’re finally moving forward with the season’s central mystery, the episode worked for me. Peck is acquitting himself just fine as Spock. It’s clear that the Vulcan loses faith in the human side of himself as he gets older, and the underlying anger in Peck’s portrayal is subtle but clear.",The New York Times
2019,"‘Star Trek: Discovery’ Season 2, Episode 9: Angry, Illogical Spock","Star Trek: Discovery “I refuse to take this posturing seriously,” Burnham says to Spock at the midway point of this week’s episode. “It’s entirely out of character.” She might as well have been speaking for the audience at that point because the writers for “Star Trek: Discovery” have penned a version of the “Star Trek” franchise’s most famous Vulcan as one that is totally unfamiliar to Trek audience: Ethan Peck’s Spock is someone who is perpetually angry, rude and quick to cruelty. Every sentence he speaks drips with disdain for those around him, particularly for his sister, Burnham. Instead of the endearing Vulcan curiosity Spock personified in previous iterations, we have tantrums now. He chalks it up to the angry emotions he feels about being connected to the Red Angel and the lack of answers he has about its existence. O.K., sure. But he has an entire ship trying to help him solve the mystery. The logical thing would be for him to, you know, chill out. The central point of Peck’s portrayal seems to be that as a young man in his early days of Starfleet, Spock was way more tapped into his human side — hence, the emotional outbursts. But as Kirk, McCoy and the other Enterprise crew members show Spock often, being human is about more than anger, and I find it hard to believe that even a younger version of Spock would let himself get like this, even under extreme duress. The real highlight of this episode is Hannah Cheesman’s performance as Airiam. We learn that she is augmented, a term she uses, which seems to mean cybernetic — a result of some terrible shuttle accident in her past. A quick note here: In Season 1 of “Discovery,” Airiam was played by Sara Mitich, who now plays Nilsson. “Project Daedalus” is the rare episode focused on a peripheral character in “Discovery,” and Cheesman absolutely delivers. She perfectly conveys, as best as a cybernetic life-form can, her affection for friends like Tilly. And in typical “Discovery” fashion, she dies a horrifying death at the end of the episode. The writers deliver a lot of information about Airiam in one episode, enough that I did get attached to the character and was sad to see her die. One problem: The “Discovery” writers have too often played with the emotions of their audience by killing off characters and bringing them back. Georgiou, Tyler and Culber are the prominent examples. This season, Saru was on his deathbed. So when Airiam was blasted out into space in order to save the Discovery, whatever emotion I felt from Cheesman’s performance quickly dissipated. We’ve been here before. I bet Airiam comes back in some way, shape or form. And if she doesn’t, the writers did a disservice to her character with all the previous false alarms, limiting the impact of this one. Airiam’s death scene didn’t quite make sense to me either. When Airiam was beseeching Burnham to open the airlock, why didn’t Pike beam over a couple crew members to assist Burnham in rescuing Airiam? And why not just beam Airiam to the Discovery once she was ejected into space? I understand that Airiam was not in charge of her body at that point, but at least beam her to the brig and give her a chance. As for the main plot of the episode — in which the crew of the Discovery attempts to infiltrate Section 31 headquarters — the fight scenes featuring a possessed Airiam taking on Burnham and Nhan were exquisite, and a credit to the Trek veteran Jonathan Frakes, who directed the episode. We learn that this is the point in Trek lore when Section 31 begins to turn rogue. The higher-ups in charge of the group haven’t responded to Cornwell in weeks, and their threat assessment system (something called Control) has locked her out. Cornwell comes to the Discovery secretly to inform Pike that a fellow admiral, a Vulcan who happens to be a logic extremist, has lobbied for all Starfleet decision-making to be turned over to Control. Leaving out how a Starfleet admiral is able to go anywhere by herself without being tracked, Cornwell’s role here is a bit confusing, given that she seemed totally onboard with Section 31 earlier this season and never mentioned the logic extremist. Section 31 has framed Spock for the murders that Starfleet has accused him of, having created fake holographic images that depict the violence. But the endgame is unclear here. The Discovery crew seems to have deduced that Section 31 wants the knowledge of the probe that came back from the future. That would give the group a permanently unbeatable tactical advantage. This is the Section 31 that made for such a compelling story line on “Deep Space 9”: out-of-control, with its own agenda. This was an uneven episode, but Cheesman was the strong point. It would have been nice to have spent more time with her over the course of the season — although I suspect we will be able to again. One note: What happened to Tig Notaro’s character? Her ingenuity would serve the Discovery really well in some of these moments. And I’d love to see her deal with Cranky Spock.",The New York Times
2019,‘Sunset’ Review: Discovering a Dark Past and a Cataclysmic Future,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. Juli Jakab, the star of “Sunset,” has remarkable eyes. The way she holds a gaze suggests not just defiance but potentially supernatural powers of perception. Her character, Irisz Leiter, gazes at many grand and grave things in this film set in 1913 Budapest. It’s the second feature from the director Laszlo Nemes. And as in his first film, the scarily accomplished and provocative “Son of Saul” (2015), which took place in a German death camp (and which Jakab also acted in), the camera most frequently follows its lead character around from behind. These shots are the longest, and they are always elaborately choreographed; the reverse angle reaction shots are mostly static. It’s the cinematic equivalent of what fiction writers call close third-person: not entirely subjective, but substantively immersive. That style applied to the endless horrors depicted in “Son of Saul” made it sometimes unbearable to watch, which was the point. Here, the technique is applied to an allegory of nearly suffocating self-seriousness, to much less powerful effect. (The screenplay is by Nemes along with Clara Royer and Matthieu Taponier.) Irisz is the daughter of the founders of Leiter, a high-end millinery. But she never knew her parents; the store had burned down years before, and the girl was raised in an orphanage. Now an adult, she goes to the store seeking a job. Oszkar Brill (Vlad Ivanov), the new owner who revived the store’s fortunes after tragedy, rebuffs her gently but firmly, sending her to spend the night in the seedy house where other store employees live. Before her first night is through, she’ll hear of a brother she never knew she had. He is described to her as a radical, a killer, a mystery man who has not been seen publicly in years. She is told not to seek him out, so of course she does. She finds him at the end of a tram line, in a compound full of hostile, angry men. As happened at Leiter, she is told this is not a place for her, and the warning is not hollow. Irisz is advised not to do something and then does it anyway so frequently in this film that it almost generates dark comedy. But no humor is intended here. And while Nemes’s near-subjective technique can generate genuine tension, it more often yields anxious tedium. In one scene, a character walks away from Irisz to speak to someone about 30 feet away, and he goes out of focus. The shot holds as the man speaks to the other person. He then walks back to Irisz — that’s 10 seconds there — and in so doing comes back into focus. He tells Irisz what he was just told. This is, in part, why the movie is a good chunk over two hours. The final shot, taking place some time after the main action, seeks a character rather than follows one and is shamelessly on the nose in the allegory department.

2019,"‘Super Deluxe’ Review: A Tamil Film, With a Cosmic Indie Vibe","When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. “Got porn, Madam?” That’s what the high school boy known variously as Milk Carton and Egg Muffin asks a DVD store clerk after some stammering feints in the Tamil movie “Super Deluxe.” And, yes, Madam has porn. But, surprise: When Egg Muffin and his pals start to watch it, one of them becomes enraged. That’s his mother onscreen. This sets off a chain of mostly comic events that are, by turns, ominous, bloody and cosmic. And that’s just one plot strand. In another, a married woman’s ex-boyfriend dies in her bed, setting off a chain of comic, ominous events. In a third, a little boy pines for his father to return, and the father does — but now transformed into a woman. (Another chain ensues.) The director Thiagarajan Kumararaja, who also had a hand in the script, takes his time setting all these shaggy, laconic story lines in motion. Part of the movie’s pleasure in its early going is figuring out whether and how they will all merge. Another pleasure is visual. Colors pop off Kumararaja’s palette (the cinematographers are P.S. Vinod and Nirav Shah), and there’s always something to look at in his Chennai. This isn’t gleaming, ascendant India; it’s the lived in one, crumbling around the edges, a little romanticized but recognizable in its narrow alleys and concrete stairwells and power outages. “Super Deluxe,” Kumararaja’s second feature, has been a while in coming after “Aaranya Kaandam” (2010), which was a critic’s darling. No wonder — Kumararaja’s work is stylish and wry, with an indie-cinephile sensibility. (It’s no accident that “Kill Bill” and “Gangs of Wasseypur” posters hang on the DVD store’s wall.) Part of that sensibility is a frankness about sex that’s still unusual in Indian movies, especially commercial ones. Though nothing explicit is shown, all the story lines in “Super Deluxe” have a little sexual motor, and there’s plenty of frank, off-color language, too. Kumararaja also elicits some wonderfully deadpan performances from his actors. The teenage boys have a believably nerdy-raffish rapport And Samantha Akkineni, as the cheating wife, builds a character of unexpected depths. “Super Deluxe,” though, runs three hours, and Kumararaja loses his way in the draggy, overlong second act. It includes not one, but two drawn-out scenes of threatened rape. (We know the ugly outcome of one, though it happens off camera.) That these scenes, with their leering Bollywood-ish villain, verge on the cartoonish doesn’t save them. They’re part of a tonal problem — what was mostly delicate and offbeat tips into something cruder and messier. They also serve as a reminder: Cinematic sexual liberation for (and by) men can be punishing for women.

2019,‘Survival Math’ Opens Some Personal Wounds but Leaves Others Hidden,"Books of The Times When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. All literature is literature in translation. There is no mother tongue. All of it migrates out of the body, out of a tangle of sensations and intuitions, obscure rancor and desires; we hunt racks of ready-made language for words that might fit. Mitchell S. Jackson is the author of a sharply drawn novel, “The Residue Years,” and a new memoir, “Survival Math.” Questions of translating his experience have long preoccupied him. “I’m not writing for white people, to inform them on black lives,” he has said. Nor does he want the reader to be dazzled by the instability and violence of his childhood and miss the “bounteous love” that is as much his legacy. Jackson’s work is set in Portland, Ore., one of the whitest big cities in America, scarred by a long history of racist violence and intimidation. The black community Jackson grew up in was small and straitened, hit hard by years of redlining. He writes about a lifetime of losses and near escapes, his mother’s crack addiction and his own drug dealing. It’s an American story Jackson tells, nesting his own among others — that of the first black man thought to set foot in Oregon (Markus Lopius) and those of the friends and relatives whose lives Jackson depicts in interspersed “survivor profiles.” He includes poems woven out of lines lifted from the Declaration of Independence and the Emancipation Proclamation. Exuberant maximalism is his mode. The digressions have digressions. There are pages of garrulous footnotes. Every story veers off into a lesson — on the history of the Bloods and Crips, the invention of whiteness and crack cocaine, the composition of plasma and the cultivation of apple trees — some sections only tenuously knitted into the narrative. The detours recall the hectic narrative nonfiction of the ’90s and early aughts, by writers like Dave Eggers and David Foster Wallace. I’d forgotten how much I didn’t miss it. Jackson tells us so much, but it’s the omissions that are deafening. There are patterns in his reticence. He begins a personal story, he opens a wound — and when we expect emotion, he floods us with information. The elaborate architecture of the book can feel like an exercise in misdirection, especially when Jackson turns to his treatment of women. He introduces his concept of “The Men on the Scale” — players, users of women. He has been such a man, he says, but he alludes only vaguely to how he harmed them. Instead he includes “victim statements,” testimonies of his behavior from five former partners. They describe being cheated on and lied to, coerced into abortions, feeling too traumatized to date again. “I blamed me,” one writes. “I wasn’t pretty enough. I wasn’t light enough.” These stories shimmer with pain. But Jackson doesn’t linger on them. He’s impatient to talk about victimology instead. He wants to discuss Don Giovanni, Lord Byron, the writer Chantal Thomas, Steven Pinker, Frantz Fanon, Picasso, Simone de Beauvoir, the psychologist Grazyna Kochanska — all in two pages. He wants to tell us about history’s great Lotharios. There have been a slew of new books that have reckoned powerfully with manhood and masculinity and their intersections with race and sexuality. Among the best I’d rank “How to Write an Autobiographical Novel,” by Alexander Chee, “Air Traffic,” by Gregory Pardlo, “Amateur,” by Thomas Page McBee, and “Heavy,” by Kiese Laymon. They are very different books, but all exhibit the two qualities that Orwell said made him a writer: “a facility with words and a power of facing unpleasant facts.” Jackson has the facility, but what does he force himself to face? Too often, a strong protective instinct takes over. He writes, of the men he grew up with, some who dealt drugs or pimped women: “Though their foibles weren’t the crux of what I used to compose, best believe not a single man I mentioned has existed in my life beyond critique. And that’s all sorts of apropos, since I too am a flawed human striving, striving.” The syntax turns knotty and tortured here; it trips over itself. It’s as if Jackson has remembered he’s being overheard, and by readers who might summarily condemn these men. He retreats to a safer bank — aren’t we all just imperfect human beings? On other occasions he takes cover behind the abstractions of the pulpit. “Ours is a revolutionary era of gender fluidness and sexual equality and same-sex parents and girls doubtless need fathers, too,” he writes. “However” — however!— “this is my beating heart: Boys need fathers. Boys need fathers — period, exclamation point.” This is stale writing — period, exclamation point. It is beneath Jackson. Not only because it so casually dismisses same-sex and single parents, but because it misses the pungency and wisdom of the scenes, the richness and beautiful uncertainties of the voice he inhabits, when he seeks to depict and not merely sermonize. The retelling of his first foray into drug dealing is indelible. “I kept faith, stood out in the shadows among others determined to clock a dollar. It was frightening and exhilarating all at once. It was near ineffable seeing that world demystified, witnessing firsthand the landscape, which by that time my mother had been roaming for years. There was also a part of me that half hoped I’d see her.” He does, eventually. I will never forget their encounter. What a book this might have been had he stayed in this register a little longer, had he stayed with all that is “frightening and exhilarating,” and let us truly encounter him.",The New York Times
2019,‘Swat the Kaiser’ and Stork Stands: The History of Army Physical Fitness,"at war Few tasks in American soldiers’ lives are judged as deeply as their performance on the Army’s required semiannual physical-fitness test: Push-ups, situps and a timed two-mile run are used to gauge physical readiness and also, supposedly, readiness for combat. But that long-predictable standard will soon change — radically. By October 2020, all soldiers will instead take the new Army combat-fitness test — a six-event exam that includes heavy deadlifting, a backward medicine-ball toss and dragging a 90-pound sled. “This fitness test is hard — no one should be under any illusions about it,” Gen. Mark Milley, the Army chief of staff, said last October, as information about the new examination ricocheted through the service’s ranks. “We really don’t want to lose soldiers on the battlefield. We don’t want young men and women to get killed in action because they weren’t fit.” The exam emphasizes conditioning specific to combat as well as practical fitness designed to prevent injuries. Its introduction is a critical move for the Army, which in 2018 failed to meet its recruiting goals, partially because of the dwindling pool of potential new recruits who can meet the physical standards. The scoring scale, not yet finalized, is expected to make no age or gender distinctions. Passing scores will vary based on a soldier’s specific job or unit and its physical demands. [For more stories about military history, sign up for the weekly At War newsletter.] To some, the combat-fitness test, which has been in development since 2013, represents a sharp transition toward a more forward-thinking approach to practical physical training for soldiers. But much of the same has been said at the unveiling of new fitness standards throughout the Army’s history — standards that, viewed in retrospect, often seem to have arisen from a hodgepodge of cultural pressures, traditions and fitness fads. Throughout most of the 19th century, the Army’s attitude toward physical training, beyond the basics of marching and close-order drilling, was haphazard at best. One reason was that regular soldiers were expected to participate in frequent assignments requiring hard physical labor, like digging ditches or laying rail ties. Such “fatigue duty,” as it was called, was not intended as exercise, but it made outside physical conditioning seem superfluous or even dangerous. Even in the early years of the 20th century, many believed that excessive training could inflict permanent injuries on the heart, make soldiers “muscle bound” at the expense of agility or wear the fighters out before they got to combat. “Underdoing is rectifiable,” West Point’s physical training manual asserted; “overdoing is often not.” A shift was already underway by the turn of the century, when Theodore Roosevelt became president and advocated “the strenuous life” to Americans, in the service of progress and empire. In 1908, after a short speech at the Army War College on “the desirability of officers keeping in fit condition at all times,” he invited the distinguished attendees — including the secretary of the interior and the Army’s top-ranking general — to “join him on a stroll.” That stroll stretched into a double-time march for miles across dense forested hills, through a rushing creek and up a 200-foot crag. There were no stragglers, The New York Times reported, but many “shivering walkers finally went home in cars to wonder about rheumatism and pneumonia.” When the United States entered World War I, the Army opened training camps where the influx of draftees were introduced to a regimen of calisthenics and mandatory sports. Group exercises had the explicit aim of keeping new inductees busy, tired and far from alcohol and prostitution. Organized calisthenics became common by 1919, but the exercises were suggested rather than mandated, and involved as little as 30 minutes of exercise twice a day. Most of a recruit’s day consisted of other kinetic activities: marches and tactical instruction. Unit cohesion and team-building, which received lengthy treatment in 20th-century training manuals, were taught through outdoor games like dodge ball or “swat the kaiser,” recognizable today as duck, duck, goose. Some fitness-related matters got more attention than others. Even at the height of World War II, instruction in “posture” and “bearing,” terms often used interchangeably, received earnest coverage in Army manuals. (“You wouldn’t build your house in a zigzag manner,” recruits were told in the 1943 Women’s Army Corps training text. “Neither is it wise to let your body fall into a zigzag shape.”) The correct alignment of body carriage, it was believed, would improve organ functioning, boost a soldier’s morale and visibly inspire other comrades. In emphasizing “grace” and “poise,” the Women’s Army Corps manual prescribed something called “stork stand” as a measure of physical fitness for servicewomen; it timed how long a woman could stand on one foot. The parade of varying approaches reflected the mores of the time but also revealed a wide-ranging and inconsistent understanding of Army fitness goals. To really standardize physical training, the Army needed a standardized physical test. The Army first experimented with fitness tests (as well as intelligence tests) to help sort new soldiers during World War I, and soon afterward settled on an exam that reflected the rigors of trench warfare. It consisted of a 100-yard sprint, a grenade throw, a running broad jump, a wall climb and an obstacle course — tasks that were essential to combat in that conflict and could mean the difference between life and death for field troops. Unit leaders used the test primarily to determine if their charges needed more physical conditioning, but poor performance didn’t result in soldiers being judged unfit for service or promotion. The Army’s first real attempt to enforce baseline physical standards came during the Cold War, when the looming Soviet empire made military action feel imminent and unavoidable. In 1959 the service mandated that each soldier take a physical-fitness test and meet a minimum score. The initial implementation was a little rough: The policy permitted either of two fitness tests, and it didn’t set minimum passing marks for individual events; a soldier could conceivably fail multiple events but achieve a high enough overall score to pass. In the years that followed, tinkering with the scoring to better account for scientific research, job requirements, the motivational effect of high or low scores, age and gender became a main preoccupation of Army fitness policy. For another two decades, a motley assortment of fitness evaluations and standards proliferated throughout the Army. At various points in time there were specialty tests for combat and support forces, as well as indoor and outdoor exams. Women, who still served separately in the Women’s Army Corps, didn’t have a fitness requirement, but could “self test,” while soldiers over 40 didn’t test at all. Running wasn’t held in high esteem — until a mile-long run was added in 1959 most soldiers didn’t sprint more than 300 yards in a test, and even then, running in place was an acceptable variation on some versions — and women did push-ups on their knees. When the current Army physical-fitness test was introduced in 1980, unifying the service under a single mandatory examination, it replaced no fewer than seven specialized physical-fitness assessments. Its creation was in part a reaction to radical social shifts: In 1978, Congress dissolved the Women’s Army Corps and integrated women into noncombat units in the regular Army. The test became the Army’s first physical-fitness assessment with scoring adjusted for gender as well as age. Commanders were warned not to allow the test to completely dictate their training regimens. It was designed to reflect the baseline conditioning a soldier needed to begin tactical training, not to be a total fitness program. But the Army steadily increased the minimum and maximum scores, tying promotions to high scores and prescribing involuntary discharges for repeat failures. Tactical training, like road marches and obstacle courses, slipped as graded events took priority. Leaders gave their soldiers every opportunity to succeed in their careers, even if it hurt combat readiness. By 1985, soldiers didn’t even have to wear their field fatigues and combat boots to their fitness tests — a standard that had been in place since the Cold War-era test in 1959. This was largely in response to America’s jogging craze. In 1974, Nike began selling its groundbreaking Waffle Trainer, which opened up running to new body types and popularized running as a fitness activity for everyone. American soldiers clamored to take advantage of the new “go fasters,” which were hyped with claims that they prevented injuries and lowered running times by minutes. The move to sneakers and shorts melded well with the tracksuit era, but it further distanced the test from the battlefield. Multiple iterations of “physical-fitness uniforms,” standardized exercise attire, rolled out across the Army starting in 1986, when the garish yellow “banana” jogging suit was added to the uniform regulations. By 1998, testing in “boots and utes” was no longer allowed. The measure of a soldier became less about their participation on a functional team and more about running two miles in 16 minutes. After three decades in thrall to a physical-fitness test that had little to do with the rigors of deployment, the Army set out to build its newest fitness test on a foundation of data and experience. Six years of research and development have already been devoted to making it more strenuous and reflective of combat. The two-mile run remains a part of the evaluation, but five new events will now test 10 “components of physical fitness” that include power, speed, agility and balance, along with the muscular and aerobic endurance that are the focus of the test the Army is replacing. Combat-related tasks, like hauling ammo cans and dragging a wounded platoonmate to safety, will be practiced with kettlebells and weighted sleds — a sort of middle ground between the trench-warfare exercises of World War I and the general fitness that has dominated the Army’s evaluation for so long. In spite of all the science and seriousness, the new combat-fitness test is not immune to the influence of cultural attitudes and fads. Just as past training regimens reflected their eras’ enthusiasm for group calisthenics or college athletics, the new test reflects the principles of CrossFit and rucking — equipment-based, practical-fitness activities popular with service members and social-media mavens. The shared ingredients include the emphasis on movements with weights, a variety of exercises and their value for building a sense of purpose and camaraderie. The key difference, of course, is that encouraging someone to excel at the gym or out on a course may not be the same as preparing them to excel in combat. The military has not settled on what to do with soldiers who fail the test, although Army Secretary Mark Esper indicated that involuntary separation wasn’t off the table. “If you can’t pass the Army combat-fitness test, then there’s probably not a spot for you in the Army,” he told reporters in August. “At the end of the day, we need soldiers who are deployable, lethal and ready.” Of course, it’s hard to predict what a soldier on the battlefield in 2030 or 2040 will need to be “lethal and ready” — as hard as it would have been for a Cold War-era Army fitness planner to anticipate long asymmetric conflicts supplanting major wars and kipping pull-ups replacing jumping jacks. We know that the Army combat-fitness test will be a challenge for an Army population full of older troops who are strong and seasoned from deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan, but who also have a lot of injuries and might find the new test a tough adjustment. It will also make it harder to attract and retain new recruits from a civilian population that’s more sedentary than ever. We know that the test will remain an individual crucible, with scores tied to career progression. We know that soldiers who have tried out the new test generally agree that it’s comprehensive and requires serious preparation. But we don’t know how long it will be before a medicine-ball throw, in its turn, looks like a faddish fitness anachronism, ill suited to what soldiers actually do. Perhaps the most valuable purpose the combat-fitness test serves is to show how the Army wishes to see itself in the coming years: strong, yes, but flexible enough to meet whatever missions remain unforeseen for a force that has churned through two decades of inconclusive war. The next decade and its conflicts will tell us which portions of the Army’s new test save lives — and which ones, like the stork stand, end up as historical oddities.

2019,‘Tell Your Husband to Leave Me Alone’,"Modern Love A woman discovers that understanding infidelity from within can be the key to forgiveness. I was tossed back into the online dating pool by a Facebook message that arrived on the first day of a family vacation with my partner, David, and our young son. After a frantic morning of preparation, we were filling the car with gas, headed to the beach, when I settled in to check messages. One from an unfamiliar name stood out, a simple command: “Tell your husband to leave me alone.” I felt struck by cognitive dissonance: I did not recognize this man’s name, nor were David and I married. Was this a mistake? Then it dawned on me. I felt the chill of cortisol spreading through my body from a point between my ears, my worst fear being realized, just starting our vacation with our son in the back seat. The message was from a woman whose nickname is also a man’s name, and she told me that she and David had been having a mostly online affair after meeting at an out-of-state convention nearly two years earlier. Something had clearly upset their relationship, prompting her audacious message. When David got behind the wheel, I silently handed him my phone. He froze as he read the words. “It’s not as bad as it looks,” he said quietly. No. It’s usually worse. I know, because I said the same thing 15 years earlier to the man I was committed to at the time. I had cheated on him and then, worse, tried to deny it. To this day, he understandably wants nothing to do with me and he remains the only important person from my past with whom I have no contact. Yet his silent judgment of me pales in comparison to the punishment I administered to myself for being a selfish, weak person who hurt another. It took me a long time to forgive myself. David and I tried counseling, but, for me, any small bits of traction we gained each time were gone by the following day. After one particularly clarifying realization that our efforts were futile, I let go of the fantasy of staying together just so our son could have two parents in one home, and instead I focused on a plan for the dissolution of our relationship. David seemed confused by my refusal to walk back the threats we had made, which was what I had often done in the past. Then he began dating with a vengeance, as if replacement were his only goal. Within a month, he was dating someone exclusively. Not long after, I decided to try dating again after an 11-year break. Technology had changed so much, and I was curious to see what it was like to go from websites with clunky messaging systems to smartphone apps requiring just the swipe of a finger. Yet the premise remained the same: We were browsing a human library, judging the books by their covers. I decided my only expectation would be to meet new people. I had no desire to find a long-term partner. I wanted to have fun and I wanted attention — male, sexual attention, which had been missing since our son was born. Soon enough I connected with a man, and our communication quickly turned sexual, despite my saying I wasn’t interested in virtual sex. Jens said he lived in Norway, had been separated for six months, traveled a lot for work and was in my area every two months or so. He was here right now, in fact, and he wanted to meet. But I wasn’t available, and he had to fly out. We stayed in touch, and soon photos and lascivious flirtations were streaming back and forth. He told me I was beautiful, attractive, desirable — things I hadn’t heard in years. It didn’t matter that we were typically 4,000 miles apart; the distance and the anticipation worked in tandem to magnify the desire. I often would hear from him around dinnertime, which was his bedtime. More than once I found myself texting racy thoughts while putting a pot of pasta on the stove. His thing about visiting every two months became a joke to us as the two months stretched to three, then four. Finally, he sent a text saying he would be visiting in a week. “Really??” I texted. “Really really,” he replied. After he arrived, his proximity fired up the sexual tension. He would be in town for three nights. The first night he had a work dinner, the second we were supposed to get together but he canceled without a reason, and the third he also canceled, without an excuse: “I’m sorry, but I can’t meet you. I can’t explain why. I’m so sorry.” I was stunned yet also surprised that I could feel crushed by someone I had never physically met. When you’ve shared so much intimacy online, does a physical presence become superfluous? Parsing the situation with a friend, we leaned toward the wife as an explanation. “Maybe he lied about being separated,” she said. “You know most men online are married.” “Possibly. Probably,” I said. I had decided early on that I would default to believing what men told me unless or until I had a reason not to. The alternative — assume everyone is lying — didn’t seem like a positive attitude when embarking on such a personal journey. “If they choose to lie, that’s on them,” I said to my friend. I’m fairly certain she thought me a fool, but she refrained from saying so. Communication with Jens dropped off to nearly nothing. A couple of “How are you?” texts punctuated weeks of silence. To one of them I replied, “Where are you?” “In the U.S.,” he said. “Really.” “Really really.” “Are you going to ask me out?” “I will,” he said. “Are you ready to tell me what happened?” “Not yet.” But he didn’t ask me out. We chatted over text but I was tentative, drawing a line so it wouldn’t become sexual or even flirtatious. I’d had a couple of promising dates with a sweet man named Marc, yet it was still so new and fragile. I feared Jens had the ability to sweep him out of my head, and I wanted to give Marc a chance. Jens left town without us meeting. He texted a month later to tell me he would be returning soon on what was likely his last United States trip for a long time; his company was focusing on other markets. And he was ready to explain why he had canceled on me. He had indeed still been married, and his wife had learned of his online exploits around the same time we were supposed to meet, hence the cryptic cancellation. They tried to reconcile but were unsuccessful. “That’s unsurprising,” I said. “The fact that you were still communicating with me suggests your heart wasn’t exactly in it.” Maybe not, he admitted, but now he was free. And ready to meet me. I was conflicted. I was still seeing Marc, happily so, but I was unsure of where it was going. My friends couldn’t understand why I would even consider meeting a person who had lied to me, who was willing to cheat on his wife with me. “I feel like we have unfinished business,” I said. Eight months had passed since Jens and I first texted. I knew it could go nowhere, but I was curious to meet the person whose attention had buoyed me during difficult times. More important, I realized that when I had finally decided to forgive myself for cheating on a partner 15 years earlier, that forgiveness came with an added responsibility: I must forgive everyone who has ever been unfaithful, because to judge others for something I had done would be the height of hypocrisy. Which is why I forgave David, too. I know why he sought attention from other women because I had been there, in a similar place, frustrated yet feeling as if there were no other way to keep the life I thought I wanted while exploring the excitement I knew was missing. I understand it. The fear, the passion, the risk and the excitement. I understand all of it. Understanding someone’s bad behavior is both a blessing and a curse. The blessing is that understanding precludes judgment. The downside is that I sometimes find myself defending people who have acted shamefully. But to remain righteously indignant of others takes more energy and is far more caustic to one’s soul, a price I’m not willing to pay. I did not meet Jens during his last trip. Marc and I had a turning point in our relationship — we had been seeing each other casually, but then he deleted his Tinder profile for me. With that in mind, meeting Jens would have made me feel dishonorable. Marc deserved the best me there is. So I texted Jens one last time to say goodbye, and then deleted our entire text history with the swipe of a finger. Karen Loeschner is a research analyst in Washington D.C.

2019,‘That’s Correct’,"daily crossword column Zhouqin Burnikel gets us to agree with her. MONDAY PUZZLE — Well, it finally happened. We have a lovely, smooth puzzle by Zhouqin Burnikel and I enjoyed solving it very much. It’s exactly what you might want in a crossword that opens our solving week. But I finished it without understanding what the theme was. I can’t believe I did that. Did I mention that this was a Monday puzzle? Maybe you missed it, too. It turns out that I solved around the revealer clue without really seeing it because I solved using the crossings. Then I stared at my finished grid for a while, trying to get it out of my head that we might be seeing the first themeless Monday ever. There is definitely a theme there, and the revealer gives a good hint at it, especially if you say the theme entries out loud. But if you missed it? C’est la vie. There’s always Tuesday. With some constructors, solvers can find several clues that are gimmes or gettable, but the overall solve doesn’t feel smooth. One of the things I love about Ms. Burnikel’s puzzles is the “start and don’t stop until you’re done” aspect of her puzzles. This puzzle was no different. 65A: While it might be named that way, the “Terrible TWOS” is something of a misnomer, and most people don’t find that out until their child turns 3. Or 15. Some of you might not appreciate that, but there are parents out there who are nodding their heads. 28D: You’ve forced my hand. It’s not like I can just solve an entry like LARCH without posting the Monty Python sketch: The revealer clue at 61D is “‘That's correct’ … or a hint to the ends of 17-, 28-, 45- and 59-Across, in different languages,” and the answer is YES. So what does that have to do with the seemingly arbitrary theme entries? As I mentioned above, try saying them out loud. Go ahead, I’ll wait right here. Still not getting it? Click below to get the answer: Theme reveal The ends of all the answers are the word YES in different languages. From top to bottom, they are: Spanish (SEE = ""Si""), Russian (DAH = ""Da""), Japanese (HIGH = ""Hai"") and French (WE = ""Oui"") I sent in this puzzle last April without much hope. I feared the theme might be too light for Will and his team, with only 38 squares, but I could not find one more workable theme entry. I was so happily surprised to get an email with a ""Crossword — Yes"" subject line. Almost finished solving but need a bit more help? We’ve got you covered. Warning: There be spoilers ahead, but subscribers can take a peek at the answer key. Trying to get back to the puzzle page? Right here. Your thoughts?",The New York Times
2019,‘The Aftermath’ Review: Illicit Passion in Postwar Hamburg,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. “The Aftermath” opens in 1945 and could easily have been made then, too. An old-fashioned wartime romance whose plot highlights are recognizable from outer space, this gleaming dollop of prestige comfort food is neither logically coherent nor emotionally satisfying. It is, though, stunningly pretty as Rachael (Keira Knightley), a resentful British Army wife, arrives in bombed-out Hamburg to join her high-ranking husband, Lewis (Jason Clarke). “It’s chaos out there,” Lewis remarks as they drive through perfectly scattered rubble, yet this stolid, stagy movie transmits no sense of destabilization. As if to remedy that, we meet Stephan (Alexander Skarsgard, resplendent in a series of snazzy woolen jumpers), the lonesome German widower whose luxurious home Lewis has requisitioned. Stephan and his troubled daughter (Flora Thiemann) might have obligingly moved into the attic, but that won’t stop him from doing some requisitioning of his own. Few can smolder like Skarsgard, yet his inevitable affair with Rachael has little heat. Each has a heartbreaking reason to distrust the other; but instead of exploring the wary psychological dance between victor and vanquished, grief and acceptance, the director, James Kent (working from Joe Shrapnel and Anna Waterhouse’s adaptation of Rhidian Brook’s 2013 novel), leaps from hostility to adultery with preposterous speed. While the cinematographer, Franz Lustig, conjures gauzy flashbacks and glowing glamour shots, promising subplots — like Stephan’s possibly murky past and his daughter’s dalliance with a dangerous young Hitler sympathizer — are hastily snuffed out. Had Kent (who excelled in 2015 with the World War I drama “Testament of Youth”) diverted a fraction of the cost of his lavish production design to beefing up the screenplay, this corny melodrama might have had a chance of pleasing our minds as much as our eyes.

2019,‘The Brink’ Review: Considering the Unlikely Charm of Stephen Bannon,"Critic’s Pick When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. At the beginning of “The Brink,” Stephen K. Bannon appears, as he often does, wearing two shirts and wielding two cellphones. In the course of this fast-moving, tightly packed, at times unnervingly entertaining documentary (directed by Alison Klayman), he wears a number of metaphorical hats, some of which are knocked off his head. Bannon flies around the United States, meeting with and campaigning for Republican candidates loyal to President Trump, including Roy Moore in Alabama. He flies around Europe, meeting with members of far-right parties, including France’s National Rally (formerly the National Front) and the Brothers of Italy. Given his walking papers by the White House in the wake of the murderous Charlottesville, Va., “Unite the Right” rally, Bannon is eventually dumped from Breitbart News and cut loose by prominent financial backers. The New Yorker disinvites him from its festival. None of that seems to faze him much. A monster to his ideological foes and an occasional embarrassment to his allies, Bannon possesses a curious kind of charisma. “The Brink,” which made its debut at Sundance in January, is the second documentary about him to emerge from the festival circuit in the past year. (The other one, Errol Morris’s “American Dharma,” has yet to secure distribution in the United States.) Bannon likes attention, and journalists and filmmakers like to give it to him. This is partly because, in spite of his frequent statements of contempt for “lefties,” “the opposition party” and “the fake news” — more or less synonyms in his lexicon — he clearly enjoys the company of these adversaries. He’s always game for a debate or a bull session. The only times he loses his cool are when underlings or colleagues disappoint him. Klayman, whose previous subjects include the Chinese artist Ai Weiwei and the Cuban-American painter Carmen Herrera, spent more than a year filming Bannon in the air, on the road and in his Washington townhouse. She captures a lot of interviews with reporters (from publications that include Politico, The Guardian and The New York Times), in which Bannon is friskily combative but almost never hostile. He gives good quotes. He contradicts himself. He spars over facts and semantics, generally in gruff good humor. After an appearance on British television, he is almost giddy at the toughness of the questions he faced. “This movie is going to crush me,” he says with a smile, referring to the fact that it frequently shows him, an avowed populist class warrior, on private jets and in five-star hotel suites. Bannon’s sometimes ironic demeanor and perpetually rumpled appearance may be temperamental attributes, but they are also tactics. He looks like he’s having fun, while his opponents appear humorless in their indignation. Depending on who he’s talking to, he can be coy about some of his views and alliances. He adamantly denies that attacks on George Soros or nefarious “globalists” are anti-Semitic code, and denies that some of his European confreres are really the heirs to Fascism they resemble to the naked eye. He may seem to treat politics as a grand game, but there is no doubt that he takes himself and his beliefs seriously and that he has weaponized his own personality in the service of what he views as a revolutionary cause. “The Brink” is a movie that people who hate Bannon may embrace — they are surely the intended audience — but that doesn’t mean Bannon himself will hate it. It both exposes and flatters his vanity. His ego is the film’s ostensible subject and connective tissue, but also something of a red herring. In a little more than 90 minutes, Klayman races through hundreds of news cycles from 2017 and 2018, inducing an especially acute version of the information whiplash that characterizes the Trump era. Horror alternates with grim comedy. Events you may have forgotten about collide with others you can’t believe took place so long ago, or so recently. Bannon harks back to earlier moments — Hillary Clinton’s “deplorables” speech; the scandal he calls “Billy Bush week” — as if they were Civil War battles. In a sense, they are. The war as he understands it extends beyond particular battleground states or congressional districts, though he pays close attention to those. What Bannon calls the nationalist-populist movement — there are other, more precise names for it — has scored victories in Hungary, Poland, the Philippines and Brazil, and his current project is to knit together like-minded, far-flung rightists in an antiliberal, anti-immigrant counterglobalism. There is a lot of money behind this, and it would be interesting to know whose. But money is one topic around which Bannon insists on discretion, shooing Klayman away when terms are being talked. He is otherwise remarkably transparent about his goals and theories, as if he has nothing to fear from exposure. Which is, frankly, terrifying.

2019,‘The Burial of Kojo’ Review: A Dazzling Modern Fable,"Critic’s Pick When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. When musicians turn to film directing, it doesn’t always work out. Ask anyone who’s seen Bob Dylan’s nearly-five-hour musical romance “Renaldo and Clara” (although that oddity does have its wary admirers). But it more than works out with “The Burial of Kojo,” written, directed and scored by Blitz Bazawule, a Ghana-born musician now based in New York who traveled back to his birth country to make this dazzling modern fable. The movie opens with a simple, striking shot, that of a Volkswagen Beetle on a beach, burning as the tide laps its tires. The film’s narrator, Esi, speaking in English (the dialogue itself is mostly in Twi), talks of her father, and of a “dream that is not a dream.” She guides the viewer over a village built on water, with wooden stilts holding up the houses. She says that her birth “was supposed to bring prosperity and good fortune to my family.” “The Burial of Kojo” shows Esi as a child — played with an impressive quietude by Cynthia Dankwa — trying to live up to expectations. The action around her is enigmatic and fraught with mysticism. She is entrusted, by a blind old man, with the care of an ostensibly sacred white bird. But at night she dreams of a crow, or rather, a man in a crow costume, first seen upside-down. These ancient symbolic elements are contrasted with a blurry telenovela (created especially for this film) that Esi sometimes watches idly with her mother, whose presence in the family is irregular. The loose narrative becomes tighter when Esi’s uncle enters the family’s life and tries to tempt her father with a get-rich-quick scheme. The brothers look with disdain and fear at Chinese businessmen and laborers now exploiting the underground riches of their land. But that’s about the only thing that the brothers see eye-to-eye on. The movie thrives on the juxtaposition of timeless and modern imagery — the burning car on the shore, a real crow perched on a cellphone tower, and more. The frames are often suffused with monochromatic light, washing the characters in red or purple. And while overhead drone shots are becoming a too-easy convention in contemporary film, their use here is refreshingly different, capturing almost surrealistically colorful landscapes. The family-conflict story line brings to mind Charles Burnett’s “To Sleep With Anger.” The director loves the faces of his actors as much as the documentarian Khalik Allah (“Black Mother”) loves the faces of his subjects. And the movie’s bold colors sometimes recall those of the African visionary Djibril Diop Mambéty (“Touki Bouki”). But these are more affinities than echoes. Bazawule has a cinematic voice of his own, one with a very direct relation to musical rhythm. The way he will establish a view with one shot and then cut into a tighter view of the same shot has the poise of a great dance move. The movie’s rare but crucial instances of violence have a heart-skipping impact achieved through a perfect meshing of staging and editing. The cutting is complemented by the music, which has flavors of Afrobeat and hip-hop but also more conventional cinema scoring. “The Burial of Kojo” is a near-virtuoso work, a feast of emotion, nuance and beauty, and a startling feature directing debut.

2019,‘The Chaperone’ Review: A Matron and a Movie Star Take a Jazz-Age Journey,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. “The Chaperone” is about a woman who abandons her literal and figurative corsets and discovers her bliss. The year is 1922, the woman is a genteel Presbyterian wife named Norma (Elizabeth McGovern), and the starchy setting is Wichita, Kansas. To sell this heavy-handed foundation-garment metaphor, the director Michael Engler and his screenwriter, Julian Fellowes (working from the book by Laura Moriarty), wrap it in the stardust of the larval silent film star Louise Brooks (Haley Lu Richardson), who, as a precocious 15-year-old, is chaperoned by Norma to Manhattan to study dance. “Men don’t like candy that’s been unwrapped,” Norma admonishes her furiously flirting charge, a wild child with a yen for booze and barflies. Yet despite a thoroughly modern central character, this impeccably costumed, wishy-washy period piece feels like it emerged from a PBS storage trunk, wrapped in tissue paper and reeking of mothballs. McGovern is a lovely actor, but she’s too gentle and self-effacing to convince as a Prohibition-supporting scold or provide an effective foil for a teenage tearaway. Most of the time she’s simply repurposing her performance as the mild-mannered Lady Cora in “Downton Abbey.” Dull and wooden, the men who circle Norma’s libidinal and feminist awakening mostly disappear into the furniture. Caught indulging a bliss of his own, her husband (Campbell Scott) barely musters a change of expression. Geza Rohrig fares better as the sweet German handyman who fixes her right up, even helping her solve a childhood mystery. The whole enterprise, though, has a made-for-TV patina and tonal primness that drain the melodrama. And though Richardson is a delight, her verve and sexual confidence only highlight the dreariness around her. A light goes out whenever she’s offscreen.

2019,‘The Dirt’ Review: A Badly Bewigged Bummer,"Streaming Movie Review When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. Mötley Crüe’s first gig, as dramatized in Jeff Tremaine’s Netflix adaptation of the band’s memoir, “The Dirt,” does not go well. The drummer, Tommy Lee, knocks over a cymbal before anyone plays a note; the crowd’s heckling turns into a full-on brawl. But when that fight is over, a guy in the back punctures the silence to scream, “[Expletive] yeah, Mötley Crüe!” And that sentiment is an apt summation of the approach and complexity of this tepid, incompetent biopic. The book version, attributed to all four members and the writer Neil Strauss, was a notorious tell-all, reveling in the group’s bad behavior and self-mythologizing. But Tremaine and the screenwriters Rich Wilkes and Amanda Adelson have sanded it down to a junior varsity “Bohemian Rhapsody,” complete with many of the same crude devices: embarrassingly bad wigs, hilariously on-the-nose needle drops (the band plays “Take Me to the Top” as they go … to the top) and declamatory, subtext-free dialogue. As with “Bohemian,” the result is the kind of paint-by-numbers storytelling that “Walk Hard” should have smothered in its crib over a decade ago. Tremaine’s staging is as convincing as an ’80s-themed party at an insurance office, and the film is shot with all the visual punch of a period Bud Light commercial. The nonstop preening and partying of the first half is exhausting, but the comedown, in which Tremaine attempts to rearrange the film into a serious character drama, is downright painful. The filmmakers try desperately to have it both ways, flipping from cheerful hedonism to “Reefer Madness”-style moralizing. The complexities of addiction seems out of their grasp. Biopics love to dazzle us with their try-hard verisimilitude, and this one gives us nearly 10 minutes of end-credit split-screen comparisons between the real Crüe and the movie Crüe, presumably so we can marvel at the skill of the duplication. But that’s cosplay, not moviemaking. Until then, “The Dirt” plays like an ill-advised remake of “This Is Spinal Tap” — one in which all the laughs are unintentional.

2019,‘The Eyes of Orson Welles’ Review: An Idiosyncratic Look at an Enigmatic Master,"Critic’s Pick When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. The American writer Robert Warshow famously said that movie critics were obligated to convey their “immediate experience” of a picture. The documentarian Mark Cousins clearly feels similarly. Cousins, whose best known work is the 15-hour television documentary “The Story of Film: An Odyssey,” can be seen as the anti-Ken Burns. While Burns’s explorations of history and culture aspire to standards of objectivity, Cousins is unabashedly, unapologetically personal. Cousins’s new film, “The Eyes of Orson Welles,” takes his own approach to a new level. The narration is framed as a letter from Cousins to Welles. Cousins opens with shots of today’s Times Square while observing that “the despots you were fascinated by are gaining ground.” He wonders if there’s anything new to say about Welles before opening a box from an archive that contains a stash of the filmmaker’s paintings and drawings. The movie intersperses observations and speculations on Welles’s life and work with long looks at his graphic pieces. These are fascinating. Movie lovers under the impression that Welles owed his visual sense of cinema entirely to his work with the “Citizen Kane” cinematographer, Gregg Toland, will find ample correction to that here. When Cousins has the ghost of Welles offer an answer to his letter, some Welles enthusiasts, and maybe some atheists, are likely to bristle. But Cousins is smart, passionate and searching to the extent that he has more than earned the right to experiment. His sharing of his immediate experience of Welles is very likely to enrich your own.

2019,‘The Highwaymen’ Review: Grumpy Old Men on the Trail of Glamorous Killers,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. To call “The Highwaymen” revisionist — or even reactionary — would be an understatement. This retelling of the Bonnie and Clyde story is not content to posit that those two Depression-era outlaws got what they deserved when they died in a hail of bullets on a Louisiana back road. It has a sackful of bones to pick with the modern world as a whole. Violent criminals are a problem, yes, but so are movies, airplanes, car radios, women in politics, newspapers — you name it. If Grandpa Simpson could figure out how to get himself a Netflix subscription, this movie would be the whole algorithm. I’m here to say I didn’t entirely hate it. As Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow rampage across a half-dozen states, the governor of Texas, Miriam “Ma” Ferguson (Kathy Bates), is persuaded by her head law enforcement honcho, Lee Simmons (John Carroll Lynch), to bring a couple of old Texas Rangers out of retirement. The governor has disbanded the Rangers and brags about raising taxes to replace them with a more up-to-date police force. J. Edgar Hoover is doing the same thing at the federal level, and while we never see Hoover’s face we do hear him called a “high-flying sissy” by one of our heroes. Hoover’s men are smug, citified so-and-sos in trim suits who set great store by fancy crime-fighting techniques like fingerprint analysis, wiretaps, two-way radios and aerial surveillance. The ex-Rangers, reclassified as highway patrolmen for their new mission, prefer to rely on horse sense and cowboy folk wisdom. “Outlaws and mustangs always come home,” says Frank Hamer (Kevin Costner), the older, gruffer one. He reckons that Bonnie and Clyde will circle back to the Dallas neighborhood where they grew up. He’s mostly right, but the feds and other busybodies keep getting in the way. The plan is not to take the fugitives alive. Before he sets out in pursuit — and before he’s joined by his erstwhile partner, Maney Gault (Woody Harrelson) — Frank purchases a small arsenal at a Lubbock gun shop. Even though he’s a bit rusty on the draw, Frank is a professional, and he takes the job personally. Barrow and Parker’s slaughter of police officers enrages him, and he’s disgusted by the aura of Robin Hood chic that has gathered around them. Graffiti on a rural water tower reads “Go Bonnie and Clyde!” Young women sport berets in imitation of Bonnie’s signature look. “Coldblooded killers who are more adored than movie stars” is Lee Simmons’s assessment. Directed by John Lee Hancock (“The Blind Side”) from a script by John Fusco, “The Highwaymen” offers itself as a corrective to one of the most famous — and in its day controversial — products of 1960s Hollywood. “Bonnie and Clyde” magnified the mystique of ’30s bank robbers by refracting it through the lens of counterculture revolt. This movie opposes that one with every fiber of its ornery being, including by its insistence on procedural tedium over cinematic excitement. It’s no less violent than “Bonnie and Clyde,” but it’s in a much worse mood. “They aren’t human anymore,” Frank says, referring to the gun-crazy kids he’s determined to bring down. The filmmakers support this thesis by keeping Bonnie and Clyde’s faces offscreen until the very end. They’re meant to be monsters, but also ciphers and symbols of a world gone wrong. Frank and Maney carry their own share of metaphorical baggage. American movies vacillate endlessly between the worship of lawmen and the romance of outlaws, but few are as dogmatically one-sided as this one. With all respect to Harrelson and Costner, they aren’t about to compete with 1967-vintage Faye Dunaway and Warren Beatty in the sex-appeal department. Hancock compensates by eliminating sex appeal altogether, replacing it with stubborn, grouchy belligerence. This can be kind of touching — the spectacle of old guys muttering and wheezing can have that effect — and kind of fun, too. Frank, superfluously described as a “grump” by one of his wife’s genteel friends, lives in comfortable retirement with said wife (Kim Dickens, too briefly) and his pet javelina. Maney has it rougher, living in a shack on foreclosed land with his daughter and her family, with no job and a taste for liquor. He’s the drinker. Frank, a crumpled pack of Luckies in his shirt pocket, is the smoker. Frank is the alpha: stern in his morality, steady in his judgment, slow to smile. Maney is the sidekick: jokey, annoying, troubled by his conscience and haunted by the memory of men he has killed. He doesn’t like the idea of shooting a woman, or gunning down a man without warning. His sensitivity provides a foil for Frank’s unbending righteousness, and also an alibi for bleeding-heart viewers who might find themselves enjoying this tale of rough justice in spite of themselves. Costner and Harrelson generally give pretty good value. This isn’t an especially good movie — it’s too long, too drenched in Thomas Newman’s cloyingly eclectic score, too full of speechifying and self-regard — but it is a coherent one, with the courage of its vengeful, murderous, politically terrifying convictions.

2019,‘The Hummingbird Project’ Review: They’re Running Cable and Chasing Money,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. For “The Hummingbird Project,” a sturdy, involving thriller set in the financial realm, the writer-director Kim Nguyen has cited heady inspirations like Michael Lewis’s book “Flash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt” (2014) and a Wired magazine article from 2012 on high-speed trading. But strip away the topical trappings and what is left is another variation on the obstacle course tension and male bonding of “The Wages of Fear” — or a dark variation on marathon road-trip goofs such as “It’s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World” and “Death Race 2000.” Vincent (Jesse Eisenberg) and his cousin Anton (Alexander Skarsgard) want to run a fiber-optic cable from Kansas to stock exchange servers in New Jersey, securing a millisecond advantage over other algorithmic traders. To maximize the gain, the cable must run absolutely straight, through property, mountains and water, a colossal engineering job for which they have hired Marc (Michael Mando, from “Better Call Saul”). But their boss (Salma Hayek), soon to be former, spends heavily to stall the private-works effort. “The Hummingbird Project” may be too committed to its popcorn mechanics to double as a truly brainy exposé, but it pays other dividends. Eisenberg adds unexpected shades of humanity to his lizard persona from “The Social Network,” while a bald, unrecognizable Skarsgard pulls off the difficult feat of being sympathetically antisocial as a coder driven batty by his work. As the geological, financial and personal barriers the cousins face grow increasingly absurd, the movie works up a satisfying sweat.

2019,"‘The Irishman,’ ‘Dark Phoenix’ and Other Notable Clips This Week","This year’s Oscars are finally over, so it’s time to move on to … next year’s Oscars. An early peek at a film that’s expected to be a contender leads the lineup of this week’s best and worst trailers. Netflix didn’t even wait for this year’s Academy Awards telecast to finish before rolling out a teaser for the director Martin Scorsese’s much-vaunted return to the mob genre, which reunites him with “Goodfellas” alums Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci and teams him for the first time with “The Godfather” veteran Al Pacino. The 45-second spot features zero footage, only a few snippets of cryptic dialogue (including “I hear you paint houses,” not coincidentally the title of the book that inspired the film). A spinning bullet casing cleverly forms the ‘i’ in the names of the filmmaker and his cast, which also features another frequent Scorsese collaborator, Harvey Keitel (“Mean Streets”). The promo ends with the words “In Theaters This Fall,” perhaps indicating a wider big-screen release than the one that may have hobbled “Roma” in its best picture race against “Green Book.” The second trailer for the latest installment in the “X-Men” franchise gives off a serious “Venom” vibe, as young Jean Grey (Sophie Turner) grapples with an alien force inside her that causes her to wreak havoc. It’s up to her fellow mutants to help rid her of this cataclysmic force — without taking her life in the process. O.K., Magneto (Michael Fassbender) wouldn’t mind killing her, but Professor X (James McAvoy) and the rest of the gang seem to be on the side of saving her. This exhilarating clip taps into the dark side of the female-empowerment theme that will be explored this month in “Captain Marvel.” Not to be confused with the actual Steve McQueen biopic “Chasing Bullitt” (due March 5), this fact-based heist thriller follows a Bullitt wannabe (Travis Fimmel, formerly of TV’s “Vikings”) who leads a ragtag band of thieves on a job to steal $30 million in illegal campaign contributions to Richard M. Nixon’s 1972 re-election fund. The trailer for this crime dramedy from the director Mark Steven Johnson (“Ghost Rider”) owes a whopping debt to Quentin Tarantino, but it is a treat to see such an array of fine character actors, like William Fichtner, Forest Whitaker, Rhys Coiro and Louis Lombardi. After a confusing initial trailer released in November, the live-action/animation hybrid returns with a follow-up promo that explains the film’s premise a bit more clearly. The titular pocket-monster P.I., voiced by Ryan Reynolds, wakes up with amnesia and seeks out his missing partner’s son (Justice Smith) to figure out … wait, I got confused again. A film noir spoof with both human and inhuman characters, this could be the next “Who Framed Roger Rabbit” — or the next “Happytime Murders.” Either way, it’s a mystery to me.",The New York Times
2019,‘The Island Always Brings You Back’: Finding a Caribbean Home,"A writer never knew her family’s house on St. Thomas, in the U.S. Virgin Islands, but discovering it, and her history, became an obsession. Here is everything I knew about Mafolie before I went to the Caribbean island of St. Thomas in January: It was one of the original hilltop estates, given to my grandparents by my great-grandfather as a wedding present in 1936. The views, of Magens Bay to the north and Charlotte Amalie harbor to the south, were supposedly among the most-acclaimed in the Caribbean. When my father was a child, the estate was 42 acres, but when his parents divorced, he returned to the mainland with his mother and didn’t go back, or see his father, for 25 years. When he did return, in July 1973, he had a Ph.D., a wife and a baby daughter, and the estate had been subdivided. My grandfather had managed to keep the original house, the Great House and two acres. We went back the following summer, when I was 3, and that is the last time any of us saw Mafolie. My father is a university professor, a scientist skeptical of what he calls my “humanist love of place.” And yet he was the one who kept a framed pair of maps of St. Thomas, one of the biggest of the U.S. Virgin Islands, on the wall behind his dining room chair all the years I was growing up. He is the one who said the view from Mafolie had been described as the “eighth wonder of the world,” and told me about my grandfather playing horseshoes in the evening, his cocktail in a glass the shape of a bud vase so it could be slipped into his shirt pocket. I share my father’s deep love of his second landscape, the Connecticut River valley, but this first, tropical place was a mystery to me. The name Mafolie is from the French and means “my madness, my obsession.” What is a daughter who grows up to be a writer to do but go and see for herself? I stayed at the Mafolie Hotel which was built precipitously into the hillside below the original 42-acre estate when my father was little. It’s a compact place, more vertical than horizontal, with rooms and terraces across five levels, all beautifully landscaped, and a view of Charlotte Amalie harbor as magnificent as the one from the private houses above it. The hotel came through the hurricanes of 2017, Irma and Maria, relatively intact, and for months afterward housed relief workers and members of the Army Corps of Engineers. It has now fully reopened to tourists. The first thing I did after checking in was spread the map of St. Thomas my father had given me on the bed, smoothing out the wrinkles from the suitcase, as if preparing for the final leg of a treasure hunt. In a way I was. I was painfully aware of how little I knew about my grandfather, Frederick C. Dixon. A Quaker from Pennsylvania, he had settled on St. Thomas in 1930 after a few years working aboard a ship. He became a teacher, the principal of St. Thomas High School, and then director of education in short order. He was white, on an island where three-quarters of the population is black. Given the colonial history of the island, I was uncomfortable not knowing what his views on race had been. Also, the Mafolie Great House was gone. When my grandfather died in 1989, the Great House and remaining two acres became the property of his second wife. When she died in 1995, she left the property to her daughter from a previous marriage, and no one in my family knew what had become of it. I had only recently discovered that in 1977 my grandfather applied to have the house listed on the National Register of Historic Places, an application that was approved in 1978. The listing describes Mafolie as once being part of Catherineberg, a sugar plantation. It was also listed on the Virgin Islands Inventory of Historic Places. But we knew the Great House was gone because when it was leveled, sometime in the early 1990s, a neighbor gathered some things from the rubble and sent them to my father. Among the items: a leather address book, my grandfather’s Humane Society of St. Thomas membership card, some old photographs and an empty black wallet. Whatever stood there now, I wanted to see it. At the Mafolie Hotel, the friendliness of the staff was infectious. First names were shared and remembered immediately and I very quickly felt as if I’d known everyone — staff and other guests — much longer than I had. This charming warmth and the beautiful view make the hotel the kind of place where even locals come to have a drink at the bar. The first night I met two of them, Lucy Serge and Diane Holmberg. “Oh, the island always brings you back,” they said when I told them why I was there. I thought it was a quaint idea. Lucy told me she would contact a friend of hers who might be able to help me with my research. That would be great, I said, if it worked out. But I really thought it wouldn’t. I spent the next morning exploring Charlotte Amalie. Everyone I talked to mentioned how good it was that the island was green again and that tourism was returning — four to five cruise ships in the harbor every day — but if you looked carefully the signs of devastation weren’t hard to see. Mangled gates and broken walls and steel-reinforced columns holding up nothing. There were piles of debris here and there, and many trees had the dead branches of other trees wedged into them, blown there by the hurricane-force winds. St. Thomas 4 miles Magens Bay Mafolie Charlotte Amalie Street data by OpenStreetMap British Virgin Islands Atlantic Ocean CULEBRA ST. JOHN Puerto Rico ST. THOMAS U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS Vieques Caribbean Sea ST. Croix 15 mileS By The New York Times That afternoon Lucy’s friend, Juliette Creque Scobie, called me. Her father’s family’s history on the island went back hundreds of years and her mother had owned an old house in Misgunst, the estate right next to Mafolie. Juliette offered to help me find my grandfather’s property. At one time she’d worked for the Chamber of Commerce and had shown journalists and others around the island. But this was something she hadn’t done in more than 30 years. “This is interesting to me,” she said. “The island is obviously in your blood.” She picked me up that evening and we drove up the road from the hotel. At the top of the hill on the right, there are two gates for Estate Mafolie, north and south. I didn’t know which property had been the site of the Great House, so we were at a loss and we were fast losing the light. We tried the Lower Road through the south gate first, but the views didn’t align with the photographs I had, a few from my father’s childhood in the 1940s and some from our visits in the 1970s. We drove back to the entrance and took the Upper Road through the north gate. The vegetation was lush and the houses stood back from the road, sometimes behind their own gates, so it was not an easy neighborhood to navigate. We hadn’t gone very far when I saw a house on the left in ill-repair and so overgrown it seemed like it could have been abandoned. It looked a little bit like the house in my photos and for a moment I wondered if Mafolie hadn’t been knocked down after all. Juliette parked and we went up to the gate, which was not very big or grand. It was also unlocked. Determined to solve the mystery, I rather uncharacteristically pushed it open and stepped onto the property. I was walking around the front of the house when Juliette called, “Inside! Inside!” which is, I learned after my heart stopped racing, a typical way of approaching a house on the island. A man called, “Who is it?” from an open window, and I tried to explain why I was trespassing. “I’ll be right out,” the voice said, and a few minutes later, Bill Demetree came outside and asked me to repeat my grandfather’s name. “I knew him,” Bill said. “It was a travesty when they knocked the Great House down.” He said travesty with great force. I asked him if he could show me where it had been and Bill walked us slowly, on somewhat unsteady legs, to the edge of his property. He pointed to a gate slightly up the road and off a spur to the right. “That’s number 8,” he said. “Where your grandfather lived. But if you look through it now you won’t recognize anything.” I ran up there while Bill and Juliette chatted about hurricane-related insurance problems. This gate was much bigger than Bill’s, with proper stone columns and wrought iron, and lots of signs announcing that the area was under 24-hour surveillance. It was dusk now, but I snapped a few pictures anyway. If they were dark and mysterious, it seemed appropriate. With the sounds of a tropical night all around, Bill told us that the Great House was knocked down soon after my grandfather died, but years passed before two buildings housing several multimillion dollar condos were built on the site. “How?” I asked. Bill shook his head. He said at least the developers had left some of the old trees. The next afternoon, Juliette drove me to Magens Bay, where my young parents had taken me swimming as a toddler and afterward we went to a restaurant called Hook, Line and Sinker for lunch. We were waiting for our food when suddenly Juliette stood up to hug two women who’d come in. One was Lillia King, the daughter of Cyril E. King, the second elected governor of the island for whom the airport is named. The other was Cleone Creque, Juliette’s half sister who had served as a senator in the territorial legislature of the Virgin Islands. They marveled at the coincidence of bumping into each other just now and Juliette explained why I’d come to St. Thomas. Cleone said, “Frederick C. Dixon?” “Yes,” I said, very surprised. “The commissioner of schools?” “Yes.” “What did the C stand for? I always wondered.” “Charles,” I said. “Oh, that’s pretty,” she said. Cleone and Lillia sat down next to us for lunch and here are some of the things Cleone said about my grandfather: “He was very popular. He was one of us, very quickly.” “He proposed a number of improvements to the educational system.” “He was a breath of fresh air. He cared about the black children.” “He is not forgotten.” And then she looked at Juliette and said that their father and my grandfather had been good friends. While my grandfather was trying to improve the public schools (he helped establish the first teachers institute on the island), their father was responsible for giving the school bus contract to a nonwhite person for the first time. Juliette and I looked at each other and ordered another drink. “This was meant to be,” she said. My last morning in St. Thomas, I woke up early. I knew so much more about my grandfather, but I was still haunted by a dream I’d had of Mafolie the night I’d made my reservations for the trip. I was sitting on bleachers over a beautiful turquoise bay when suddenly the seats rose up and became a roller coaster. I don’t like roller coasters and so closed my eyes against the feeling. But with my eyes closed I couldn’t see the landscape. In the dream I was there but not there, unable to see what I’d come to see. My flight home wasn’t until the afternoon, and though I didn’t know how I was going to get in, I decided that last morning that I had to try and see the place where the Great House had been, No. 8 Mafolie Estates. I walked up the road staying as close to the shrubbery as I could. You don’t see many walkers on the hill roads because they’re narrow and there are no sidewalks — I’d been warned against it — but I was determined. When I came to the Estate Mafolie gates I punched in the code. I followed the Upper Road to the gate Bill had shown me and as I stood before it, I heard a hummingbird thrum past. I found it hovering near a red flower just inside the gate where it stayed a moment before flying on. In Connecticut, my grandmother and I had both loved hummingbirds. This seemed like — a sign? I sat down. When a BMW appeared at the top of the drive, the gate started to open. The driver lowered his window, and I explained what I was doing there. He said I could look about the place, but the gate had closed behind his car, so he gestured at the foliage and said, “Just go around.” He drove off and while I was trying to figure out what he meant, a woman came walking up the road. Her name was Susannah, and she turned out to be the BMW driver’s housekeeper. She said I could follow her, and so I did, into the foliage around the pillar on the right side of the gate. We stepped over uneven rocks and had to push back branches; this was her path to work. I told her there should be a proper path and she laughed. Susannah went inside one of the grand, two-story pale yellow buildings and I walked around the hilltop for a while. Then I sat down on the grass, my back to the buildings, my face to the Caribbean. Here is what I wrote in my notebook: “I am on a terraced slope of lawn high above Charlotte Amalie harbor. There are old mahogany trees dotting the property that must have stood in my grandmother’s time. I’ve put my hand on them and said hello. A very old banyan tree stands on the north side, where the view is of Magens Bay, so that must have been there, too. The air smells of sun and jasmine. There is a constant wind, a little more insistent than a breeze. You hear it in the mahogany leaves. Every now and then a seaplane takes off over the harbor, sounding exactly as Dad described it. Every time one starts up, I hear his impression in the hum. I must have known that sound, too, as a small child here. An occasional rooster and the echoes of construction over the island are the only other sounds. I found Mafolie.” My grandmother spent all the years I knew her trying to grow tropical plants in Connecticut. My scientist father admitted the sound of a seaplane taking off is wonderful to him in a way he can’t quite explain. And islands have always had a hold on me that my mainland childhood doesn’t quite account for. Mafolie. In the taxi to the airport I looked back at the ridge line above Charlotte Amalie one last time and realized I could tell where the Great House had been by the trees, the old and twisted mahoganies left at the edge of the terracing.

2019,‘The Juniper Tree’ Review: A Young Björk Enchants in Her Film Acting Debut,"Critic’s Pick When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. “The Juniper Tree,” a 1990 film made in Iceland, received spotty distribution in the United States after competing in the Sundance Film Festival. It’s best remembered for featuring the film acting debut of the art-pop star Björk (billed here by her full name, Björk Guðmundsdóttir). In watching a newly restored version, I was struck not only by Björk’s distinctive charisma at 24 years old but also by the talent of the film’s writer, director and editor, Nietzchka Keene. This was Keene’s first feature, and she would die of pancreatic cancer in 2004 with just a couple of other directing credits to her name. This film is adapted from a tale by the Brothers Grimm — one of the gnarly unexpurgated ones, not the bowdlerized kind long served to American kids. Two sisters, Katla (Bryndis Petra Bragadóttir) and the younger Margit (Björk), find themselves homeless after their mother is burned as a witch. They wander, and in an environment far-flung from their former dwellings, Katla enchants a young widower, Johann. The sisters set up in his home, and while the childlike Margit gets along well with Johann’s young son Jonas, the kid has real problems with Katla. Especially after he walks into a room and catches her practicing some sorcery. The tension of the situation resolves itself in a shocking way, as Margit’s burgeoning powers of “vision” prove useless in affecting fate. Shot in powerfully stark black and white, the movie has a style that doesn’t partake of the anticipated influences — you might expect resonances of Ingmar Bergman or Carl Dreyer, but “The Juniper Tree,” which was shot in English, has a voice all its own. This restoration was backed in part by the University of Wisconsin, where Keene taught until her death at 52. It’s a fitting tribute to a filmmaker gone far too soon.

2019,‘The Kid’ Review: A Wild West Showdown Spurs a Coming-of-Age Dilemma,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. Starting as violently as it plans to continue, Vincent D’Onofrio’s “The Kid” drops us into a savage altercation as Rio (Jake Schur), 13, kills his abusive father before slicing the face of his scummy uncle, Grant (Chris Pratt). Primed by the boy’s affectless narration (here, when characters aren’t practicing brutality, they’re talking about it), we intuit that what will follow for Rio and his older sister, Sara (Leila George), is unlikely to be pretty. Set in the American Southwest in 1879, “The Kid” feels less like an actual movie than a table-napkin idea for one. A fateful encounter with Billy the Kid (Dane DeHaan) and his nemesis, Sheriff Pat Garrett (Ethan Hawke), lands the siblings in Santa Fe and back in Grant’s clutches. For Sara, that means the brothel, where Grant seemingly has a season pass; for Rio, it means deciding which of his two new acquaintances he can trust to rescue her. Having set up a lofty coming-of-age choice between good and evil, Andrew Lanham’s screenplay — as fuzzy as the legend from which it sprouts — caves beneath unlikely coincidences and well-worn stereotypes. Sturdier by far is Matthew J. Lloyd’s painterly photography: though at times squintingly dark, his New Mexico scrub and skylines are distractingly pleasing. While marquee names wrestle with characters as insubstantial as holograms, Lloyd gives us a reason to keep watching. Lacking a robust narrative, D’Onofrio desperately spackles over gaps with hackneyed close-ups of faces well versed in romancing a camera. “I don’t know where the good in you two comes from,” Garrett tells Rio and Sara at one point. “But I know there’s plenty of it.” He must know a lot more than we do, then. An earlier version of this review, using information from publicity materials, incorrectly referred to Vincent D’Onofrio’s feature film directing debut. It was “Don’t Go in the Woods,” released theatrically in 2012, not “The Kid.” When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.",The New York Times
2019,‘The Last’ Review: A Revelation Leaves a Family Shattered,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. “The Last,” written and directed by Jeff Lipsky, begins on the first day of Rosh Hashana. In a park, a close-knit family performs a prayer ritual. Two characters in their early 30s, Josh (AJ Cedeño) and Olivia (Jill Durso), are soon to be married. Josh is a Modern Orthodox Jew, and Olivia has converted from Catholicism to Judaism. Josh’s father, Harry, is a sardonic agnostic. Claire, Josh’s great-grandmother, stays mostly silent but is clearly full of affection. After the marriage, Claire meets Josh and Olivia on a beach outing and makes a startling confession. She initiates it indirectly, by showing them photos that she’s been holding in a safe deposit box. It’s an odd place to keep one’s past, but Claire has very good reason to have hidden hers. Not only is the beloved matriarch not a Jew, she was herself a member of the Nazi Party in World War II Germany. Claire, who remains an anti-Semite but nevertheless also continues to insist that she loves her Jewish children, has brain cancer. She wishes to travel out of New York for an assisted suicide. Some of her family members believe her life deserves a different resolution: They’d like to see her make restitution for her deceptions. This is not a thoroughly polished movie. Its look has a high-end video sheen that, combined with the mostly flat lighting, is somehow more neutral than what the material warrants. The sound mixing is odd, too. There’s a scene in which Olivia speaks to Josh on a cellphone, and he sounds as if he’s standing directly next to her. Still: the harrowing outlandishness of the dramatic situation is almost sufficient to emotionally concuss the viewer. And the movie is quite accomplished in the most important respects. Its peculiar rhythms, in which certain characters conduct nearly uninterrupted monologues of over 10 minutes, seem entirely deliberate, as does the sometimes plain affect of the performers. As the impossible Claire, the longtime character actor Rebecca Schull (a 90-year-old playing 92) is spectacular. Her character is lucid in her awfulness, and she almost never shuts up, relating endless anecdotes that don’t just force her family to face awful truths, but rub their noses in them. The movie’s finale is both satisfying and shame-inducing about their situation, which is wholly apt.

2019,‘The Legend of Cocaine Island’ Review: Florida Man’s Silly Odyssey,"Streamiing Movie Review When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. Theo Love’s documentary “The Legend of Cocaine Island,” now streaming on Netflix, chronicles the harebrained execution of a preposterous scheme. As fans of the “Florida man” meme may have sussed out, the story takes place in that state. Love chronicles a hapless, middle-aged nincompoop’s efforts to recover a stash of cocaine with a mix of interviews and re-enactments, and in a flashy, colorful style that lands between “Pain & Gain,” Michael Bay’s tale of inane Sunshine State swindlers, and “Fargo” with gators. The director (2014’s “Little Hope Was Arson”) can lay it on thick with the comic scene setups and James Bond-like soundtrack. Then again, this underlines the silliness of Rodney Hyden’s odyssey. A contractor in Central Florida, Hyden was hit hard by the 2008 recession. Needing cash, he eventually set out to retrieve the bags of coke an eccentric neighbor claimed he had buried on Culebra, an island off Puerto Rico. (The documentary was presented at the 2018 Tribeca Film Festival as “White Tide: The Legend of Culebra.”) Since Hyden had no idea how to either get the drugs or sell them, he hooked up with a Z team that included a doped-up goofball and a mysterious operator named Carlos. “I just liked that guy,” Hyden says. Carlos reminds him of Tony Montana, and unfortunately, Hyden has watched “Scarface” a lot. Love is not judgmental about Hyden, and lets him be his sunny, deluded self — down to a willful obliviousness about the realities of drug trafficking and use. Charged with intent to distribute cocaine, Hyden got 60 days in prison, a year of home detention and community service. It’s hard not to ponder what the verdict would have been had he not been white.

2019,‘The Mustang’ Review: Where the Wild Things Roam. And Sometimes Break Out.,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. There are two furious beasts in “The Mustang,” one a hulking man in a jumpsuit stamped with the letters D.O.C., and the other the wild horse of the title. The man is an inmate in a Nevada prison set against desert and mountains, but he hasn’t been able to enjoy the scenery lately, having been condemned to an isolation that is at once literal and figurative. He’s an archetypal solitary man of fiction, one of those troubled souls with clenched fists who must be coaxed, at times thrust, into the world — it’s a given that his re-entry won’t be easy. It will be appealing, though, partly because of the gray-brown mustang with a dark mane and tail that is being rounded up as the story opens, a helicopter swooping overhead like an aerial cowboy. The mustang is part of a feral herd that’s been captured for a rehabilitation program meant to keep the animal population humanely in check while helping prisoners like Roman (the Flemish actor Matthias Schoenaerts) reintegrate into society. The men gentle the horses, and they, in turn, gentle the men. That’s the optimistic idea, at any rate, as well as the bold, obvious metaphor that shapes this seemingly impossible, seductively heartfelt male melodrama. [Read our interview with Matthias Schoenaerts.] It shouldn’t work — none of it — not the metaphor, not the wild horse, not what it all means for the wild man at the center. It does. That’s partly because redemption stories exert their own magnetic pull, but also because the French director Laure de Clermont-Tonnerre goes all in, embracing simplicity and sincerity without hesitation or self-consciousness. (She shares script credit with Mona Fastvold and Brock Norman Brock.) “The Mustang” is direct and almost perilously familiar — it draws from both westerns and prison movies — yet it is also attractively filigreed with surprising faces, unusual genre notes and luminous, evanescent beauty. The story tracks Roman as he reluctantly joins the rehab program (his resistance being a narrative given), goaded by his unfailingly patient psychologist-counselor (Connie Britton). The program is run by another professional instigator, Myles, a classically cantankerous old man with a hard crust and 24-karat core who once upon a time would have been played by a grumbling, muttering Walter Brennan. The patent now belongs to Bruce Dern, who grumbles and mutters and squints into the sun in a performance that is as recognizable as the cover of a favorite song. You know every beat and lyric, and it’s pleasurable to watch Dern interpret each one anew. There’s no John Wayne, the sun around which Brennan sometimes orbited. Even so, Schoenaerts here brings to mind one of those Wayne swaggerers, the kind who tower over movies and other men. Schoenaerts — who excels at hard-body men who yield, to hurt, tenderness and love — affects a slight bob and weave, suggesting a life in the ring. Unexpectedly, Roman often seems beaten down. He has the hunched shoulders and bowed head of the defeated, though sometimes he looks like a boxer heading into the next fight. Even a bowed head can carry a threat, as everything that we have been taught about men and violence reminds us. By the time the mustang arrives, Roman is about halfway through his 11-year sentence. Theirs isn’t an easy match, partly because it verges on a romantic meet cute that strains narrative credulity and your tolerance for stacked decks. The horse, locked in a shed, is furiously kicking, pounding out a rhythmic S.O.S. that the curious Roman answers. Soon, the two are warily circling each other in a corral under the tutelage of Henry (the winning Jason Mitchell), one of the program’s successes. Roman and the horse — he names him Marquis, pronouncing it Marcus — don’t take to each other, but after a brutal exchange and some more time in solitary for both, they reach an understanding that opens into love. Now and again, a European filmmaker heads to the American West to re-explore (and of course reconquer) it, often to grim and grimly obvious ends. De Clermont-Tonnerre, by contrast, takes on the western as a milieu and a genre with an appreciable lack of cynicism. Some of her storytelling can be shaky. A predictable death and a resentful teenage daughter (a fine Gideon Adlon) nearly help push the story over the melodramatic edge; and a drug subplot with its easily breached medicine cabinet is distracting. Yet de Clermont-Tonnerre has an eye for beauty, for swirling dust and resonant silences, and she taps into the soul of this place and its inhabitants even as she reminds you of its terrors. Like Marquis, Roman can sometimes seem like too facile a symbol of the terrifyingly primitive, but he is also never less than effortlessly alive.

2019,‘The Old Drift’ Is a Dazzling Debut Spanning Four Generations,"Books of The Times When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. Namwali Serpell’s audacious first novel, “The Old Drift,” is narrated in small part by a swarm of mosquitoes — “thin troubadours, the bare ruinous choir” — who declare themselves “man’s greatest nemesis.” They’re a pipsqueak chorus, a thrumming collective intelligence, a comic and subversive hive mind. They are here to puncture, if you will, humanity’s pretensions. “The Old Drift” is an intimate, brainy, gleaming epic, set mostly in what is now Zambia, the landlocked country in southern Africa. It closely tracks the fortunes of three families (black, white, brown) across four generations. The plot pivots gracefully — this is a supremely confident literary performance — from accounts of the region’s early white colonizers and despoilers through the worst years of the AIDS crisis. It pushes into the near future, proposing a world in which flocking bug-size microdrones are a) fantastically cool and b) put to chilling totalitarian purposes. [ This book was one of our most anticipated titles of March. See the full list here. ] Serpell’s mosquitoes observe the dozens of wriggling humans in this novel, and they are distinctly unimpressed. We were here before you, they imply. We will be here long after you are gone. In the meantime, thanks for the drinks. The reader who picks up “The Old Drift” is likely to be more than simply impressed. This is a dazzling book, as ambitious as any first novel published this decade. It made the skin on the back of my neck prickle. Serpell seems to want to stuff the entire world into her novel — biology, race, subjugation, revolutionary politics, technology — but it retains a human scale. It is filled with love stories, greedy sex (“my heart twerks for you,” one character comments), pot smoke, comedy, inopportune menstruation, car crashes, tennis, and the scorching pleasure and pain of long hours in hair salons. Serpell is a Zambian writer; she was born in that country and moved to the United States with her family when she was nine. She teaches literature at the University of California, Berkeley. There’s a vein of magical realism in her work — one woman cries almost literal rivers, another has hair that covers nearly her entire body and that grows several feet a day — that will spark warranted comparisons to novels such as Salman Rushdie’s “Midnight’s Children” and Gabriel García Márquez’s “One Hundred Years of Solitude.” Serpell does not try to charm her readers to death. Her men and women are not cute (except, sometimes, to each other), and they are not caricatures. Even the most virulent racists in “The Old Drift” aren’t one-dimensional. Serpell is a pitiless and often very funny observer of people and of society. She describes polo as “that strange game that seems like a drunken bet about golf and horse riding.” A man on a leather sofa is commended for “expertly unlocking that complex apparatus — a clothed woman.” She offers this definition of “history”: “the word the English used for the record of every time a white man encountered something he had never seen and promptly claimed it as his own, often renaming it for good measure.” Here she is on a young white woman in Zambia: “She seemed both weak and imperious, helpless yet haughty. In a word: British.” This is a matrilineal epic. It is packed with grandmothers, mothers, daughters. They are hardly placed on pedestals or lit by false, ennobling, autumnal light. They’re all struggling. Some drop out of school, steal or dabble with skin-whitening creams. Some open businesses, others turn to prostitution. Still others turn to protest. Nearly all are hoping to find love and, in the interim, to avoid being raped. This book is intensely concerned with women’s bodies. Dissertations will surely be written about the multiple meanings of hair in this novel. We’ve learned too much from male writers about what it’s like to walk the planet guided and plagued by one’s reproductive apparatus. This novel, with wit and sensitivity, flips and revises that familiar script. One young woman gets her period on her wedding day. Her friends, her family, the many guests — they’re all here. “All she wanted,” Serpell writes, “was to be at home in bed, curled in a ball, alone and quietly bleeding.” Serpell is keenly interested in olfactory information. She lingers on people and places and scent. In one scene, a blind woman smells eucalyptus and knows she is nearly home. In another, a mother dislikes her daughter’s “new teenagery smell,” described as “a melony-lemony-biscuity scent that Adriana found both puerile and daunting.” The plot of “The Old Drift” is not simple to unpack. The book begins, at the start of the 20th century, at a colonial settlement on the banks of the Zambezi River called the Old Drift. A dam is being constructed that will change many lives, a dam that some will wish to bring down. The first women we meet, beginning around 1940, are: Sibilla, a white girl so unusually hirsute that at one point later in life she will be referred to as “an NGO for hair”; Agnes, a “pale, mad” and blind British girl who marries a black professor and engineer; and Matha, a bright girl whose prospects collapse after she becomes pregnant. She is this novel’s copious weeper, “the heartbreak queen of Kalingalinga.” We get to know their daughters. One operates “Hi-Fly Haircuttery & Designs Ltd” (and perhaps a shadier business); another is a stewardess who once had artistic ambitions. One of these daughters has a long affair with a doctor who is working on a vaccine for H.I.V. About a potential vaccine, we get shrewd snippets of dialogue like this one: “‘Beta version,’ Naila scoffed. ‘They should just say black version. They’re testing it on us.’” The third generation goes on to work on microdrones, on further AIDS research and on political protest, seeking redress for the wrongs of history. One character also works on the vexing future of wearable technology — digital beadlike chips, implanted into the skin, that with the help of permanent tattoos of conductive ink turn one’s hands into approximations of smartphones. “Government is controlling us,” one character says near the end of the novel. “And the worst part is — we chose this. We held our hands out to them and said PLEASE BEAD US!” Serpell carefully husbands her resources. She unspools her intricate and overlapping stories calmly. Small narrative hunches pay off big later, like cherries coming up on a slot machine. Yet she’s such a generous writer. The people and the ideas in “The Old Drift,” like dervishes, are set whirling. When that whirling stops, you can hear the mosquitoes again. They’re still out there. They sound like tiny drones. They sound like dread.",The New York Times
2019,‘The Photographer of Mauthausen’ Review: An Unwilling Propagandist Fights Back,"Streaming Movie Review When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. Mar Targarona is a tricky filmmaker, and in the middle stretch of her Spanish-language concentration camp drama, “The Photographer of Mauthausen” (now on Netflix), she pulls something of a bait and switch. The opening scenes provide what we’ve come to expect from these stories: an inventory of barbaric rituals, the dramatization of heartbreaking separations and moments of sudden, bloody brutality. We meet Francesc (Mario Casas), a Spanish communist prisoner who has made himself useful as assistant to the camp photographer (Richard van Weyden). He does this work to stay alive but knows he is complicit in a propaganda operation. When he is ordered, in the last days of the war, to destroy the camp’s photos, he and his fellow prisoners realize they must protect them as evidence. Their carefully coordinated attempts to smuggle those negatives out of the camp is closer to “The Great Escape” than to “Schindler’s List,” resulting in deceptions, distractions, close calls and a suspense sequence with a hidden film strip that’s downright Hitchcockian. But just as the viewer relaxes into such genre-adjacent pleasures, Targarona wallops us with a pair of chilling scenes, dramatizations of pure evil, served up as reminders that the horrors of this time and place cannot, and will not, be trivialized. Such tonal shifts aren’t always easy to sustain, and occasionally Targarona lets the picture get away from her (particularly the ending, which lays it on a little thick). But she builds her beats well, and the cinematography is striking: Taking cues from the photographs in question, she uses a muted color palette to hint at the desaturation of those black-and-white images. Targarona began as an actor before becoming a producer and, finally, a director. “The Photographer of Mauthausen” is her second feature, but if feels like the work of an old pro — vivid, involving and frequently terrifying.

2019,‘The Place Is Extraordinary’: Well-Preserved Artifacts Are Found Under Maya Ruins,"In a cave under the ancient city of Chichén Itzá, Mexican archaeologists discovered a trove of ceramic artifacts that appear to be over 1,000 years old. Archaeologists announced this week that they had discovered an extraordinary trove of well-preserved Maya artifacts under the ancient city of Chichén Itzá in Mexico’s Yucatán Peninsula. The artifacts were found in a cave called Balamkú, less than two miles from the famed pyramid known as the Temple of Kukulcan, or The Castle, which sits in the center of the site. Guillermo de Anda, an investigator with the National Institute of Anthropology and History, said in a statement on Monday that the remarkable discovery could help researchers rewrite the history of Chichén Itzá, which flourished from roughly A.D. 750 to 1200. The city was built on top of a network of waterways, including sinkholes called cenotes, which the ancient Maya believed were sacred places that provided a portal to the underworld. Its name is sometimes translated as “the mouth of the well of the Itza,” the name of the main ethnic group in the area at the time. Mr. de Anda and his colleagues were exploring that system of waterways when they found the artifacts, which date to around 700 to 1000 A.D., about 80 feet underground. The team has explored about 1,500 feet so far, crawling between various chambers connected by narrow tunnels. “The place is extraordinary,” Mr. de Anda said in a video produced by the institute, speaking as he crawled through a dark, narrow passageway. “Now comes a stage of documentation, protection and conservation of this marvelous and unique place.” Local residents told the authorities about the cave more than five decades ago, but it was not studied extensively at the time, the institute said in its statement. Instead, the archaeologist Víctor Segovia Pinto ordered the entrance to be sealed, ensuring that its contents remained undisturbed. Last year, Luis Un, 68, who as a child was among the residents who had told officials about the cave, led Mr. de Anda’s team to its entrance again. There are at least 200 artifacts, including fragments, ceramic incense holders, containers used to grind food and other items. Researchers expect that tests will show that they contain jade and remnants of seeds and bone that were used as offerings and have been found at similar sites. Some of the incense holders bear the likeness of Tlaloc, the rain god of Central Mexico, who at some point “traveled” to the Yucatán. That could help researchers understand how the relationships between the Maya and other civilizations evolved over time. The quantity of the artifacts and their placement in hard-to-reach parts of the cave could also indicate the site’s importance. Mr. de Anda, who is also the director of the Great Maya Aquifer Project, said the discovery would allow researchers to develop new models of cave archaeology using 3-D mapping and modeling techniques. Mr. de Anda and the project’s co-director, James Brady, a Maya archaeologist at California State University, Los Angeles, said it was the most significant discovery in the area since the nearby cave of Balamkanché was found in the 1950s. In a phone interview, Dr. Brady said that the artifacts at Balamkanché, many of which are similar to those found at Balamkú, were not closely studied because of a rush to develop the cave into a tourist site. He added that the findings indicated that subterranean spaces were more central to life in Chichén Itzá than previously recognized. “We are just moving very slowly as we approach this, to make sure everything is done correctly,” Dr. Brady said.",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | ‘The President … Is Not Above the Law’,"A New York court rules that the Constitution does not shield President Trump from allegations of misconduct before he took office. The case has echoes of Paula Jones’s suit against President Clinton. The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section. The legal travails of President Bill Clinton may soon haunt President Trump. A New York appeals court on Thursday ruled that Mr. Trump, like Mr. Clinton before him, is not protected by the presidency from answering civil charges. The five-judge panel in Manhattan said that the Constitution’s supremacy clause does not bar state courts from hearing claims over “alleged unofficial misconduct” — that is, claims of improper or illegal action before a president took office. The decision expands on the precedent set in Clinton v. Jones, in which a unanimous Supreme Court in 1997 ruled that a federal court had jurisdiction over a sexual harassment lawsuit filed by Paula Jones, a former low-level Arkansas state employee, against Mr. Clinton. Yes, the presidency is important and its occupant may have important duties to attend to other than to produce documents or sit for depositions in a civil suit alleging sexual misconduct and defamation, the court explained, but “the President is still a person, and he is not above the law.” Two judges dissented, observing that the threat of contempt, should Mr. Trump resist the legal process, would put a state court in “direct control” over the president. A former contestant on Mr. Trump’s reality TV show “The Apprentice,” Summer Zervos went public during the 2016 campaign with accusations that Mr. Trump kissed and groped her without her consent. She is suing the president for defaming her shortly after she came forward, calling her charges a “hoax.” She filed her suit days before Mr. Trump took the oath of office. The president’s legal team has vigorously opposed Ms. Zervos’s lawsuit and a separate legal action by the New York attorney general involving Mr. Trump’s foundation. In both cases, judges have rejected the argument that the presidency insulates Mr. Trump from the reach of state courts hearing cases unrelated to his official duties. Mr. Trump’s lawyers said they would appeal the ruling in the Zervos matter. If past is prologue, these lawsuits could be a minefield for Mr. Trump, who so far has avoided, on his lawyers’ advice, a face-to-face interview with the special counsel, Robert Mueller — in no small part because of the president’s tenuous relationship with the truth. After the Supreme Court ruled for Ms. Jones in 1997, President Clinton, like a regular citizen, was questioned under oath by her lawyers, and in the process denied that he had ever had a sexual encounter with a White House intern, Monica Lewinsky. The rest, as they say, is history. George Conway, husband of the White House adviser Kellyanne Conway, played a not insignificant role, both publicly and behind the scenes, in getting the public and the justice system to accept the premise that Mr. Clinton — or any other president, for that matter — shouldn’t be beyond the reach of the courts. Mr. Conway, who was one of the lawyers who represented Ms. Jones in her suit against the president, was among a cadre of conservatives who used a variety of means — including the courts — to hound the Clintons. He was part of what Hillary Clinton termed at the time a “vast right-wing conspiracy.” On Thursday, after learning of the New York ruling, Mr. Conway took a victory lap of sorts. He shared on Twitter a Supreme Court brief he helped ghostwrite in the Jones case. “I stand by these arguments, as applied to any president, of any party,” he wrote.

2019,‘The Twilight Zone’: Here’s Why We Still Care,"“There is a fifth dimension beyond that which is known to man.” With this sentence, Rod Serling introduced “The Twilight Zone” on Oct. 2, 1959. Five seasons, several offshoots and countless imitators later, the beloved and influential anthology series that mixed sci-fi with morality tales has become an indelible part of the cultural lexicon. On Monday, a new generation of viewers will get its own version of Serling’s off-kilter sensibilities when Jordan Peele’s reimagining premieres on CBS All Access. Whether you’ve seen every episode or none, here’s a primer on the enduring legacy of “The Twilight Zone.” In the late ’50s, the screenwriter Rod Serling was experimenting with injecting political commentary into his work. A script he submitted for the anthology series “The United States Steel Hour” titled “Noon on Doomsday” was his response to the murder of Emmett Till. The screenplay was gutted by the network, rewritten to such a degree that most commentary was removed. This experience would lead Serling to fight hard to retain creative control when he later created “The Twilight Zone.” Serling received the opportunity to produce his own series in part because of the positive response to another one of his innovative scripts, which some consider to be “Twilight Zone”’s unofficial pilot. Run as a part of “Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse” in 1958, “The Time Element” stars William Bendix as a man with a recurring dream about failing to stop Pearl Harbor. The next year, “The Twilight Zone” premiered, running from 1959 to 1964 and producing 156 episodes, most of them written by Serling himself. The series quickly developed a core of expertly juggled recurring motifs, including American history, technology, nostalgia and its trademark cautionary tales. (Serling loved a good Faustian parable.) While he hosted weekly visits to other planets and alternate universes, Serling asked his viewers to question authority, innovation and the role of faith in their lives. Serling served in World War II, and that experience impacted his work in episodes like “A Quality of Mercy,” about a gung-ho soldier magically transported into the enemy’s shoes, and “The Purple Testament,” about a man who can look at a man’s face and see that he’s about to die in combat. But Serling didn’t live in the past, often using his platform to comment on his era’s anxieties, especially nuclear proliferation in episodes like “Time Enough at Last,” “Third From the Sun” and “The Shelter.” The costs of living in a world that could destroy itself at any minute was always on Serling’s mind. Another theme that was particularly close to Serling’s heart was time and how one learns the hard way that you can’t go home again (“A Stop at Willoughby,” “Walking Distance”). Yet not every story ended with a tragic monkey-paw twist. Serling knew how to entertain and made sure that several episodes each season kept things light and fun (“The Mighty Casey,” “Hocus-Pocus and Frisby”). While Rod Serling was the face and voice of “The Twilight Zone,” he wasn’t alone. The show was a potent platform for other writers and notable young directors as well, but he had two major partners. Serling, Richard Matheson and Charles Beaumont wrote 127 of the show’s 156 episodes. Classic Beaumont episodes include “The Howling Man” and “Miniature.” Matheson wrote, among others, “Nick of Time,” “The Invaders,” “Little Girl Lost” and “Nightmare at 20,000 Feet.” Other notable voices behind-the-scenes included directors Richard Donner (“Nightmare at 20,000 Feet” and four others), Don Siegel (“Uncle Simon”), Jacques Tourneur (“Night Call”), Ida Lupino (“The Masks”), and Ray Bradbury (“I Sing the Body Electric”). ”Twilight Zone” featured a who’s who of distinguished actors, some of whom were famous at the time, like Ed Wynn, Mickey Rooney and Buster Keaton. Often the stars featured in narratives that played into their well-known personas: Keaton’s episode opened with silent film storytelling techniques, for instance, and Rooney’s featured a jockey who longed to be taller. The show was even better at tapping new and on-the-rise talent, including Charles Bronson (“Two”), Robert Redford (“Nothing in the Dark”), Dennis Hopper (“He’s Alive”), Robert Duvall (“Miniature”), Burt Reynolds (“The Bard”), Leonard Nimoy (“A Quality of Mercy”), Carol Burnett (“Cavender is Coming”) and Peter Falk (“The Mirror”). These episodes, listed chronologically, represent some of the best of what the series accomplished. (All are currently streaming on Netflix, Amazon Prime and Hulu.) “Walking Distance” (Season 1, Episode 5) One of Serling’s most personal screenplays, this episode stars Gig Young as a man who goes back to his hometown and finds he’s traveled back in time. It contains some of the show’s strongest visuals, elevated by a beautiful, original Bernard Herrmann score. “Time Enough at Last” (Season 1, Episode 8) One of the best twist endings in TV history. Burgess Meredith (who appeared in four episodes and the 1983 movie) stars as an antisocial bookworm who finally gets all the time he could ever want to read after surviving a nuclear explosion. Then fate intervenes. “Mirror Image” (Season 1, Episode 21) A woman in an isolated bus station is confused when employees act like they’ve encountered her before. Then she spots someone in the mirror in the other room — her exact double. “The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street” (Season 1, Episode 22) When a neighborhood becomes convinced there is an alien among them, they turn on each other. Serling’s commentary on paranoia and division remains eerily relevant today. “Eye of the Beholder” (Season 2, Episode 6) The story of a bandaged woman worried about her surgery ends with one of the show’s most essential big reveals, representative of Serling’s assertion that perception can be fluid and subjective. “The Invaders” (Season 2, Episode 15) A mostly silent episode stars Agnes Moorehead as a woman troubled by alien invaders. “A Game of Pool” (Season 3, Episode 5) Jack Klugman and Jonathan Winters star in a masterful episode about the price of being a legend and the human need to be the best. It’s a great example of the show’s gift with dialogue, delivered by two of the show’s best performers. “It’s a Good Life” (Season 3, Episode 8) This story of a 6-year-old with godlike powers (later remade for the movie version) remains terrifying. “To Serve Man” (Season 3, Episode 24) Watch in horror as a man learns, just a minute too late, that the word “serve” has multiple meanings. “Nightmare at 20,000 Feet” (Season 5, Episode 3) Fear of flying and fear of not being believed are merged in this harrowing episode starring William Shatner as the only passenger on a plane who knows “there’s something on the wing!” Serling’s series continued to win new fans for decades after its cancellation, making eventual reboots inevitable. Steven Spielberg, Joe Dante, John Landis and George Miller each directed a segment for a 1983 film. (Sadly, the movie is arguably most remembered for the helicopter crash that killed Vic Morrow, Myca Dinh Le and Renee Shin-Yi Chen, a tragedy that changed the industry’s safety standards on sets.) In 1985 came a TV reboot that attracted creators who had been inspired by the original series, including Harlan Ellison, George R.R. Martin, Wes Craven and William Friedkin. Running until 1989, this version has several episodes worth revisiting, especially Craven’s “Shatterday,” starring Bruce Willis. Less memorable was a one-season revival for UPN in 2002 hosted by Forest Whitaker. Up next is Jordan Peele’s take for CBS All Access, with guest stars like Kumail Nanjiani, Sanaa Lathan, Adam Scott and Steven Yeun. One needn’t look only at shows or movies that bear the familiar title to see its influence. It’s been everywhere for the last 60 years, most recently in Peele’s box-office hit “Us,” a film that he’s said was partially inspired by the episode “Mirror Image.” Supernaturally themed anthology shows like “The Outer Limits” and “Amazing Stories” couldn’t hide their resemblance to Serling’s landmark series, and even shows like “Lost” and “The X-Files” frequently found themselves reaching for some of that “Twilight Zone” flavor. Today we live in a world where the words “Twilight Zone” are used as an adjective whenever anyone wants to describe stories (or real-life events) that are fearless, insightful, ironic and just a little bit spooky. And that theme song was killer too.",The New York Times
2019,‘The Women’s War’ Is an Epic Feminist Fantasy for the #MeToo Era,"Fiction When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. THE WOMEN’S WAR By Jenna Glass While feminist science fiction and fantasy books have been around for decades — see Octavia Butler, Ursula K. Le Guin and Anne McCaffrey — tales that reflect recent feminist movements like #MeToo are an essential next step in an ongoing conversation. That’s what makes “The Women’s War,” by Jenna Glass, so noteworthy. The story is set in Seven Wells, an analog for medieval Europe — wimples, kinglets and all. Each of the wells in question produces magical elements around which small nation-states have sprung up. Women can make small potions with the magic, but greater engagement is frowned upon, and the elements bend primarily to the will of men. In Seven Wells and beyond, the men are the power brokers, and the women are the pawns. Alysoon Rai-Brynna, living in Aalwell, is a widowed 42-year-old princess whose own mother, Brynna, was set aside by the king. Such “tainted” women are sent to the Abbey of the Unwanted, where they harness limited magic and work as prostitutes. Frustrated by the status quo, Brynna unleashes a spell that alters the magic of Seven Wells by granting women the power to decide whether or not to become pregnant. “This is women’s magic, and it is subtle,” Brynna writes to her daughter. “The spell will know the difference between true free will and coercion.” In an unanticipated side effect, the spell gives rape survivors access to an element called Kai, which gives them great strength. The effects of the enchantment are felt across the land, including in Zinolm’s Well, where Queen Ellinsoltah is desperately attempting to hold onto the throne as older, more experienced men scheme to wrest it from her. Glass could easily have allowed the spell and subsequent upheaval to transform the plot into a revenge fantasy. But her approach is a more measured examination of societal change. The women in Seven Wells have been oppressed for so long that they do not know how to use their newfound power. As Alysoon’s daughter says, “Few men want to marry a woman who won’t give them children, and few women will give a man children when they are forced into the marriage.” What happens when marriages crumble, when the Abbey is razed, when the very fabric of life is altered? How do people who have never controlled their own fates do so effectively? [ Feminist dystopian fiction is beginning to channel women’s anger and anxiety. ] In answering this question, Glass puts character development over world-building, though she demonstrates skill with both. The multiple points of view transition seamlessly, revealing an astute understanding of human nature — the fear and quiet rage of a widowed mother of two; the insecurity and passion of a young queen. Some of the men, too, are presented as complicated and layered, a blunt reminder that an ally is a powerful asset when a marginalized person is facing off against institutionalized powers. The primary exception to this is Delnamal, Alysoon’s half brother and heir to the throne of Aalwell. Delnamal is small-minded, petty and cruel. Such people exist, of course, but one would hope their inclusion in a book would have an overarching purpose. Some of Delnamal’s sections — like a graphic group rape scene — can be difficult to get through. In a novel that explores and validates the importance of female agency, to present a violation like this through the eyes of a misogynistic male character feels like a misstep. Another is the dearth of intersectionality. For a book that unpacks birth control, body autonomy, feminism and the mind-set of the oppressed, the lack of any lesbian characters was a touch baffling. Glass is at her strongest when she takes us deep into the minds of her characters. “The Women’s War” does what so many classic adult fantasy books do not: It gives us a nuanced portrayal of grown women dealing with a wretchedly unfair society. It is rare to read a fantasy novel with a middle-aged mother as a main character. And it is refreshing to see women becoming heroes in a world that wishes to keep them muzzled.",The New York Times
2019,‘The Woodstock of Fashion’: Remembering Thierry Mugler’s Most Legendary Show,"Friends and collaborators reflect on the designer’s 20th-anniversary spectacular at the Cirque d’Hiver. The ballet dancer turned fashion designer Thierry Mugler has orchestrated many of the most extravagant and gloriously over-the-top moments in fashion history: Think Pat Cleveland dressed as the Madonna descending from the ceiling of Zénith Paris stadium or of a vamping Linda Evangelista in the iconic video for George Michael’s “Too Funky,” which Mugler directed. While his wide-shouldered, wasp-waisted, body-conscious creations helped redefine the female silhouette in the late 1980s, his fashion shows were especially spectacular. They were productions that would break boundaries not just in terms of spectacle and budget but also in casting: The biggest supermodels of the day rubbed shoulders with musical legends, drag queens and even, in the case of Jeff Stryker and Traci Lords, who walked Mugler’s runway for an AIDS charity event in 1992, porn stars. “I never dreamed of being a fashion designer. I wanted to be a director,” Mugler tells T. “But fashion happened to be a good tool. It was a means of communicating.” No show quite compared to Mugler’s fall 1995 haute couture extravaganza — marking his brand’s 20th anniversary — staged at the Cirque d’Hiver venue in Paris. Mugler created a monolithic white set consisting of two runways connected by a spiral staircase with the star-shaped logo of his best-selling Angel perfume as a backdrop. During an hourlong show, Mugler showed an unprecedented 300 looks on a diverse lineup of models from every era, including legends like Carmen Dell’Orefice, Veruschka von Lehndorff and his muse, Jerry Hall, alongside nascent superstars such as Naomi Campbell, Eva Herzigova and Kate Moss. The cast also included some of his favorite actresses, like Tippi Hedren and Julie Newmar, while the socialite Patty Hearst did a striptease. Mugler’s intention was “to show beauty through the ages,” and accordingly, the looks in the show ran the gamut from masterfully cut suits and glamorous evening dresses to a futuristic gold robotic bodysuit worn by Nadja Auermann. The show culminated with a performance by James Brown as confetti rained down and male go-go dancers gyrated. “It was like the Woodstock of fashion,” recalls the model Violeta Sanchez, who walked in the show. And while Mugler — who now goes by his real name, Manfred — may have stepped away from his label in 2002 to concentrate on creative directing projects, his fantastical vision has been embraced by a new generation of pop stars, including Beyoncé and Cardi B, and designers, such as Jeremy Scott and Alexander McQueen, who have cited him as an influence. On the occasion of the designer’s first major museum retrospective, “Thierry Mugler: Couturissime,” which opens at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts on March 2, Mugler and some of his collaborators recall the legendary 20th anniversary show. The show was a challenge, but I liked a grand gesture. I was trying to break the rules! I’m fascinated by human beings who have honesty and authenticity — that’s most important to me. With my castings, I’m very honored and touched to have worked with so many personalities in my shows — they were strong clothes for strong people. On the show, we worked with the best — the best hat designer, Philip Treacy, the best corset maker, Mr. Pearl, so why not the best models? Women like Jerry Hall are traffic stoppers — extremely beautiful living creatures who could really walk. I ended the show with James Brown, the god of soul, Mr. Sex Machine, because it was the right ingredient to balance the haute couture. I didn’t feel it at the time, but soon after the show, I realized it was the end of the era. Afterward, fashion became a branding, marketing thing. The model agencies started controlling the world, and it all became cheesy to me. Fashion was not the same media, the same emotional message between people. It was all about labels. I love a great label, but fashion is an art. For me, beauty comes from the freedom to dare to be different. It’s all about being extremely yourself. Beauty is not used anymore as an emotional link for people, which is not right, because beauty is one of the most important things in life — and the world — if you are taking the time to look at it. Thierry loved women. Only love could grasp and hold all those glamorous iconic Hollywood images and fold them into fabric. He also understood the dark, the unconveyable, the unconscious, and he used it in his creations. He was timeless and ahead of his time. He knew all about gender fluidity and his clothes reflected the heat and sexuality of the late ’70s and early ’80s. I still wear his pencil skirts because they are so much fun! His 20th anniversary show at the Cirque d’Hiver was my personal favorite. It was pure performance art, full of fairy creatures and femme fatales. I liked the way there were go-go men in gold bikinis as our accessories! When I first met Thierry, he was wearing a “Star Trek” outfit. The last time I went to see him, at his Follies show in Paris in 2013, he peeked at me from behind the curtain — he did not want me to see how he had changed. He was still the Wizard of Oz, pulling the strings in the dark. The Cirque d’Hiver show was an extraordinary experience — only in Paris can they put on a production like that. Going to Paris to do the show, I felt like a girl from the farm in Ohio. It was like he was putting on an opera. Everything from his choice in music to having the most beautiful women in the world flown in for the show. My mom would never let me be a model, but, oh, did I appreciate what it takes to do what they do — they were spectacular. He created a rubber lace dress for me, which I later wore in the film “To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar.” He was the only designer who could do sex without making it vulgar. He told me once that when he was doing his designs, I was like the woman he was thinking about when he did his sketches. I felt very flattered, for sure. He adores the femininity of women, but he likes the woman to be in charge of the situation. You always felt very feminine but powerful at the same time in his clothes. His clothes were like architecture for the body — he has a particular way of structuring them to give you the best shape. With the gold robotic outfit I wore for the 20th anniversary, I remember having to do a lot of fittings for it, and at the show, it took a while for me to be sewn into the it. It was not that comfortable! But it was like armor: You felt everyone looking at you because it was so impressive. His shows were a unique universe of its own. He wanted to create his own world — it was a way for him to express his thoughts. In the ’90s, shows were more about dramatic choreography and performing. I was one of those models who liked to perform onstage, and it’s lovely to be part of a show where people can appreciate it. I owe my career in Paris couture to Mr. Mugler. He was my university in all respects, sharing his incredible eye for the finest details. His thirst for the ultimate silhouette still haunts me. One could not help but learn many subtle and refined secrets. He taught me that every detail counts and must be executed to perfection. Mr. Mugler dazzled me with his light. We shared a passion for extreme beauty, pushing the silhouette to the maximum in the world of fantasy. Mr. Mugler always needed to push things beyond, to satisfy his vision of Planet Mugler, where there are no limits. I made two pieces for the Cirque d’Hiver show. The first was for the incredible Jerry Hall and was inspired by Jean Louis’s gowns for Marlene Dietrich. The second piece was for the gorgeous Dianne Brill, inspired by John Singer Sargent’s “Madame X” with a twist of Mae West — an exercise in tight lacing to create an extreme silhouette. The piece was in black duchesse silk satin and embroidered in vinyl, black jet and ostrich feathers. So two very different pieces, both extremely challenging and made in six weeks. His commissions pushed all boundaries in every sense. He was a very generous man, and I am eternally grateful. I was aware of his work from before because I was once a fashion model, so I was hip to the different designers. It was an honor to be asked to be in the show. Walking out in that satin dress with these satin birds on it with all those other models — that was exciting and wonderful. The Cirque D’Hiver show was the fashion equivalent to the premiere of a Las Vegas show or a once in a lifetime rock ’n’ roll concert — the Woodstock of fashion. The presence of all those fantastic creatures that populated our fantasies and pop culture — the original Catwoman, the Hitchcock heroine, Veruschka, Patty Hearst, James Brown himself. This was visionary, a crazy collective dream come true. He was like the Tarantino of fashion. Manfred definitely was, and is, a director. He gave us characters and short stories, moments in a life, scenes from a movie. Like a good director, he had a knack for knowing the right thing to say to the right performer at the right moment. There was a vibrant energy in those shows — we all had a mission to be unforgettable, to be unique, to thrill him by being what he wanted us to be and more. The first time I met him, I was dancing at Webster Hall in New York. He tapped me on the shoulder and said he was going to do a show and would I be in it? If I could pick any designer to come up to me in a club and ask to be in a fashion show, it would have been him! He was the ultimate in fabulousness — his sense of humor and camp was everything that was inspiring to me. I remember he was very kind to me — he called me when Tippi Hedren was having a fitting to come meet her, which was very sweet. Seeing models mix with porn stars and drag queens made it feel familiar to me because that was the world I came from. There was a family atmosphere backstage, but the night before the show you could cut the tension with a knife because there was so much you had to prepare. I remember asking about my outfit to start planning my makeup, and I was told it was all metal and pearls. It took up so much room, but it looked incredible. I remember using all of my willpower not to look down. If I had fallen over, I would not have been able to get up!

2019,"‘There Will Be Changes’ to Gun Laws, New Zealand Prime Minister Says","• New Zealand grappled with grief and horror on Sunday, two days after a gunman opened fire at two mosques in the city of Christchurch, killing at least 50 people. The terrorist attack appeared to have been carried out by a white nationalist who posted a racist manifesto online and streamed live video of the killings on Facebook. • Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on Sunday that the suspect, an Australian, would be tried in New Zealand, and that her government would discuss gun regulation at a meeting on Monday. “There will be changes to our gun laws,” she said. • Minutes before the shooting began on Friday, Ms. Ardern was emailed a copy of the manifesto purported to be from the gunman, her office said. Many news outlets and lawmakers also received the email. • The family of the suspect, identified in court papers as Brenton Harrison Tarrant, 28, has apologized for the attack. In an interview published online on Sunday by Australia’s 9News, his grandmother said the family was “shattered” and denounced his actions as “unrepairable.” Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said Sunday that the suspect charged in the Christchurch shootings, an Australian citizen, would be tried in New Zealand. A 28-year-old man from Australia has been charged with murder and appeared Saturday morning in a Christchurch courtroom. Court papers identified him as Brenton Harrison Tarrant. Ms. Ardern said he would face more charges, but she did not say whether terrorism charges were being considered. She said she was seeking advice on whether Mr. Tarrant might be extradited to Australia, but that his trial would take place in New Zealand. “He will certainly face the justice system of New Zealand for the terror attack he has committed here,” she said. There was no other shooter, Ms. Ardern said. She said one person had been taken into custody as a result of evidence collected during the investigation but that there was no evidence he was linked to the attack. Ms. Ardern said that her government would discuss the New Zealand’s gun laws at a meeting on Monday. “There will be changes to our gun laws,” she said at an afternoon news conference. She also said she would look into reports that there had been a surge in gun sales in New Zealand since the attack on Friday. The shooting has vaulted New Zealand into what could be a divisive political battle over gun control in the country, where many people own weapons, with few restrictions. The authorities say the suspect in the assault used five guns he had acquired legally, including two semiautomatic assault weapons. Many Americans can buy a gun in less than an hour. In some countries, the process can take weeks or months. Within hours of the Friday killings, the prime minister promised changes to gun laws and said regulations of semiautomatic weapons were “one of the issues.” New Zealand’s attorney general, David Parker, appeared to go beyond that statement at a vigil for the victims on Saturday, indicating that semiautomatic weapons would be banned, but he later backtracked. Mr. Parker told Radio New Zealand that had been trying to reflect Ms. Ardern’s comments that “we need to ban some semiautomatics, perhaps all of them.” “Those decisions have yet to be taken, but the prime minister has signaled that we are going to look at that issue,” Mr. Parker told the broadcaster. Licensed New Zealand gun owners pushed back. The Kiwi Gun Blog, a gun-rights online publication, said that one of the assailant’s goals was “to cause the gun rights of responsible New Zealanders to be attacked.” It said “our prime minister is now capitulating with him.” There is no dispute that acquiring a military-style semiautomatic weapon is relatively easy in New Zealand, where guns are plentiful. According to a 2017 small arms survey, there are more than 1.2 million firearms among the population of 4.6 million. Under New Zealand law, anyone 16 or older may seek a firearms license, and anyone 18 or older who has applied for a firearms license can seek a permit to possess a military-style semiautomatic weapon. In the United States, the National Rifle Association, a leading advocate of gun-owner rights, issued its first statement on the attack, denouncing the killer while saying nothing about the weapons used. “It doesn’t matter if these senseless tragedies occur in the United States or abroad, our deepest sympathies are with the victims and their families,” said Andrew Arulanandam, a spokesman for the group. “This was the act of a monster. To the extent the N.R.A. is ridiculed for extending our deepest sympathies to those impacted by this horrific event, we make no apologies for our thoughts, words or prayers.” In an exclusive interview with Australia’s 9News, the family of the suspect condemned the attack and offered an apology to the families of the victims. “We’re so sorry for the families over there, for the dead and the injured,” Terry Fitzgerald, the suspect’s uncle, said. “We can’t think nothing else. We just want to go home and hide.” The suspect’s grandmother Marie Fitzgerald, 81, said: “We are all gobsmacked. We don’t know what to think.” “The media is saying he’s planned it for a long time,” she added. “So he’s obviously not of sound mind, I don’t think.” According to the 9News’s report, Brenton Harrison Tarrant had traveled to Europe after his father died of cancer 2010. The trips came at a time when Islamic extremism was on the rise, it said. “It was only since he traveled overseas, I think, that that boy has changed,” Ms. Fitzgerald said. They first learned that Mr. Tarrant was the suspect in the massacre while watching television, the report said. At first, the uncle said, they couldn’t believe it. But then they saw his photo. “It’s unrepairable,” Ms. Fitzgerald said. Brenton Harrison Tarrant, the man charged in the Christchurch shootings, was a member of the Bruce Rifle Club in New Zealand, the club confirmed on Sunday. The club is about a 35-minute drive from Dunedin, New Zealand, where Mr. Tarrant lived. In a statement, the club said it had about 100 members, all of whom are licensed to own and use firearms. Mr. Tarrant joined the Bruce Rifle Club last February, Scott Williams, the club’s vice president, said in an interview. He said Mr. Tarrant appeared to already have shooting skills and typically went to the range by himself. The club told the police on Friday that Mr. Tarrant had been a member, and the police visited the club on Sunday, Mr. Williams said. He said he could not say how often Mr. Tarrant went to the club because his attendance records had been turned over to the police. Mr. Williams said he had seen Mr. Tarrant at the club with a bolt-action hunting rifle and an AR-15 semiautomatic rifle but didn’t know where Mr. Tarrant got them. He said he and other members had seen no indication that Mr. Tarrant had violent intent. “He was just normal,” Mr. Williams said. “He was polite. He would help put things away. He would help set up. He worked like a Trojan.” The club has been closed until further notice, Mr. Williams said. In a live video on Facebook on Saturday, a former member of the New Zealand military named Pete Breidahl said he had reported the Bruce Rifle Club to the police years ago after a visit because he had “serious concerns about the mental stability of some of those members.” He also posted an image of a comment dated Nov. 20, 2017, about the club, in which he said that at least half the members would be going home to “their mums basement and onto the internet for a night of heroic talk in gun forums.” Mr. Williams declined to comment on Mr. Breidahl’s Facebook video. The airport in Dunedin, the city where the suspect in the Christchurch shootings had lived, was closed Sunday evening after a “report of a suspicious package on the airfield,” the authorities said. “Police are at the scene and specialist teams have been deployed to determine the nature of the package,” the New Zealand police said in a statement. Earlier Sunday evening, an armed police officer stood watch outside the address in Dunedin that was listed in court documents as the home of Brenton Harrison Tarrant, the suspect. About a five-minute drive from the center of Dunedin, the second-largest city on the South Island of New Zealand, the pale blue-gray house had air-conditioning units, wide rectangular windows with open curtains, a satellite dish sitting at the top of a cement stairway and an overgrown yard. The mailbox bore a sticker reading: “NO JUNK MAIL. Thank you!” Several people who lived nearby said they did not know many of their neighbors and had not met Mr. Tarrant. They described the neighborhood in the Andersons Bay suburb of Dunedin as a mix of rented and owned homes. Carl Tainui, who lives nearby, was out walking Sunday evening and said he was “shocked” that such “total hatred” had allegedly originated so close to his home. Over the weekend, the police had blocked off the road in the Dunedin neighborhood while a bomb squad searched the area. The street was shut down from Friday evening until midday Saturday. By Sunday evening, journalists swarmed the area, knocking on doors and filming outside Mr. Tarrant’s house. Amy Hanson, 28, moved into a house across the street from Mr. Tarrant’s last year. She said that she had seen Mr. Tarrant’s address listed last week on a rental site for $280 a week and that her sister’s boyfriend had planned to view the property last Tuesday. She said the listing had since been removed. “He must have planned to move out, knew he was going to go to jail or die,” she said. “The weirdest thing is, he is my age. He is so young. I just don’t get it.” Thirty-four victims of the shootings remain in Christchurch Hospital, 12 of them in critical condition, officials said on Sunday. A 4-year-old girl also remains in critical condition at a children’s hospital in Auckland, where she was flown after the attack. A Christchurch Hospital spokesman, David Meates, said that on Saturday the hospital treated nine new victims of the Friday attack. They arrived with cuts, embedded glass fragments and injuries to their backs, knees and feet. Mr. Meates said the hospital was running seven operating theaters on Sunday instead of the usual three. “Many of these people need multiple surgeries due to the complex nature of their injuries, and the need to provide a number of shorter surgeries in a phased way so patients have the best chance of recovery,” he said. Ms. Ardern said the list of people killed was still provisional and that the families of victims would receive financial assistance. She said families would receive the bodies of victims starting Sunday evening, with all bodies expected to be returned by Wednesday. [Here’s how to help the victims of the Christchurch shootings.] A live video posted to social media appeared to show the attack at Al Noor Mosque, where 42 people were killed.

The airline Air New Zealand said one of its employees, Lilik Abdul Hamid, had died in the attack on Friday. The company’s chief executive, Christopher Luxon, said in a statement that Mr. Hamid had been an aircraft maintenance engineer with Air New Zealand for 16 years. “He first got to know the team even earlier when he worked with our aircraft engineers in a previous role overseas,” Mr. Luxon said. “The friendships he made at that time led him to apply for a role in Air New Zealand and make the move to Christchurch.” Mr. Hamid is survived by his wife and two children, Mr. Luxon said. Later on Sunday, the company PricewaterhouseCoopers said that one of its employees, Areeb Ahmed, had also been killed. In a Facebook post, the company said it had learned of Mr. Ahmed’s death from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Pakistan. “Areeb was a loved and respected member of our PwC family who lived our values every day,” it said. “His smile, warmth, dedication, respect and humor will be deeply missed.” The prime minister also said that Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer of Facebook, had shared her condolences over the shootings, parts of which were live-streamed on the social media platform. On Sunday, Facebook said it had removed 1.5 million videos of the attack that had been posted worldwide, including 1.2 million that were blocked at upload. The company said it was also removing edited versions of the video that did not show graphic content. The police on Sunday said the death toll had risen to 50 as officials discovered another body at the mosque on Deans Avenue, where most of the victims had been killed. Another 50 people were injured. “As of last night we were able to take all of the victims from both of those scenes and in doing so we have located a further victim,” said Mike Bush, New Zealand’s police commissioner. Mr. Bush said a list of victims’ names has been compiled with the help of senior religious leaders and had been shared with family members. He said the list was an informal one, though, and officials would not confirm the names publicly until the bodies had been formally identified. The bodies have not yet been released to the victims’ families, but Mr. Bush said he was conscious that Muslim religious practice requires prompt burial. “We are aware of the cultural and religious needs so we are doing that as quickly and sensitively as possible,” he said. Police officials say it took 36 minutes from when they received the first call about a shooting at a mosque to when the suspect was taken in custody. “That is an incredibly fast response time,” said John Price, commander of the district police. “You have a mobile offender across a large metropolitan city, and I am very happy with the response of our staff.” “I can tell you that within six minutes of police being called, on 111, within six minutes armed police staff were on the scene,” Mike Bush, New Zealand’s police commissioner, said on Sunday. “Within 10 minutes, our armed offenders squad were on the scene, and within 36 minutes, we had that mobile offender in our custody.” Officials said the gunman arrived at a second mosque, where he continued his rampage, seven minutes after leaving the first. The suspect was later arrested in a car, which was carrying improvised explosive devices, by two police officers. Mr. Bush said the officers prevented further deaths. “Those two police officers acted with absolute courage,” Mr. Bush said on Sunday. “I’m so proud of what they’ve done. They have prevented further deaths and risked their lives doing so.” Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said that nine minutes before the attack, her office was among more than 30 lawmakers and news organizations that received a manifesto purported to be from the gunman. In accordance with protocol, her office forwarded it to parliamentary security within two minutes of receiving it, she said. Had the manifesto provided details that could have been acted on immediately, Ms. Ardern said, her office would have acted on them. She said she had read parts of the manifesto, which she called “deeply disturbing.” Abdul Aziz, 48, was in the Linwood mosque praying with his four sons when he heard gunshots. He immediately knew something was wrong. Rather than running from the sound, he ran toward it and grabbed the first thing he could find — a credit card machine — and flung it at the attacker. He tried to distract the attacker in a move that many fellow worshipers have described as heroic, weaving through cars in the parking lot, attempting to draw the gunman’s attention away from the mosque. Latef Alabi, the acting imam of Linwood, told The Associated Press he believed the death toll would have been far higher at the mosque without Mr. Aziz’s actions. Mr. Aziz said he saw the attacker drop one of his guns and managed to grab it but when he pulled the trigger, the gun was empty. When the gunman went to his car, presumably to grab more ammunition, Mr. Aziz said he threw the gun at the assailant’s windshield, shattering the glass. The assailant sped away. Mr. Aziz remained humble, saying in an interview with The New York Times that anyone in his position would have done the same. “I was prepared to give my life to save another life,” he said. Originally from Kabul, Afghanistan, Mr. Aziz lived in Australia for 27 years after having fled the violence of his home country. He moved to New Zealand a few years ago, describing it as a beautiful country.",The New York Times
2019,‘They’re Going to Boo Me.’ Jimmy Butler Prepares for His Return to Minnesota.,"On Pro Basketball The rare N.B.A. star willing to lean into his role as a villain, Butler, briefly back in the city he scorned, is ready to absorb fans’ anger. Jimmy Butler knows what’s coming on Saturday night in Minneapolis. He understands, relishes and even encourages the looming prospect of the chilliest welcome any visiting N.B.A. player is bound to receive this season. “They’re going to boo me,” Butler said of the Minnesota fans who watched him force his way out of town via a trade to the Philadelphia 76ers in November — months after Butler led the woebegone Timberwolves to their first playoff berth in 14 seasons. “I would boo me, too. I’m not going to lie to you.” Now a key member of what is widely regarded as the most potent starting lineup on the N.B.A. map outside of Golden State, Butler will be back at Target Center for the first time since the trade turmoil that captivated the league for the first two months of the season. Butler insisted he was unfazed by what awaited him, and went on to suggest that a number of his Philadelphia colleagues, as well as some longtime friends who plan to be in attendance, will partake in the inevitable hostilities. “I might actually join in on the boos,” Butler said. Those who have spent any time around the rugged swingman surely don’t doubt it. At a time when N.B.A. Commissioner Adam Silver openly frets about player happiness — and when standouts such as Boston’s Kyrie Irving and Golden State’s Kevin Durant routinely rail against the approach of some of the news media — Butler is the rare star who savors the game’s edgy side and has embraced his portrayal as a villain. “I love it,” Butler said in a phone interview, repeating the phrase three times — including once with a profanity for emphasis. “Who wants to be loved all the time? “It’s O.K. It’s fine. I don’t need everybody to like me. I know who I am. I can’t say that enough. I know what I’m about. I know where my heart is. People will say, ‘He’s this way, or he’s that way,’ but nobody knows except for the people around me every day. Ask them and they’ll tell you differently.” Elton Brand, the 76ers’ general manager, certainly falls within that category, describing Butler as “a caring person” who has quickly endeared himself “not only to his teammates but to our whole business operations staff and in the community.” As a first-year general manager, Brand had his own reservations before going through with the first major move of his tenure, having watched chaos engulf the Timberwolves from afar — with no shortage of the noise coming from Butler himself after news leaked of the mid-September trade request he made in private. But when Brand did his research, consulting former coaches and executives who had worked with Butler, along with former players he knew well who had firsthand knowledge, such as Nazr Mohammed and Mike Dunleavy Jr., he received little in the way of dissenting feedback. “Even with the story that was reported, that wasn’t a big deal,” Brand said, referring to an ESPN report in January that asserted Butler “aggressively challenged” Philadelphia Coach Brett Brown. “He didn’t curse. He wasn’t loud. It was his reputation following him.” Butler, 29, admitted in a recent interview with Yahoo Sports’s Chris Haynes that he is a “confrontational” teammate, but that he is also trying to be more selective in showing his blunt nature as he gets older. It should be noted that, as Brand found, Butler has also been a largely popular teammate in his stints with the Chicago Bulls and Team U.S.A. — and, frankly, with numerous Timberwolves apart from the All-Star center Karl-Anthony Towns. Butler took a hit in some precincts after informing the since-fired coach with whom he’s so closely associated — Tom Thibodeau — that he was no longer interested in trying to nurture Towns and Andrew Wiggins and wanted out of Minnesota. One example of the damage: Butler is one of the top 12 players in the Eastern Conference, but East coaches snubbed him as a reserve for the All-Star Game in February. Yet Butler plays on, insisting he would “do nothing over” in Minnesota and reveling in the knowledge that for the first time in his career, he’s on a team capable of getting to the N.B.A. finals. “I will tell you that we’ve got a lot of talent,” Butler said. The Sixers haven’t established the required consistency to earn the label of East favorites, going 11-6 since the All-Star break with middling placement in both offensive (18th) and defensive (12th) efficiency in that span. Butler, though, is doing what he can to make it work, sacrificing in a manner that would seem to invalidate some of the criticism. Philadelphia followed its trade for Butler on Nov. 12 by acquiring Tobias Harris from the Los Angeles Clippers on Feb. 6, giving Brown two All-Star-caliber players to team with the dynamic duo of Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons and the shooter extraordinaire J.J. Redick. In the first 20 games since, when those five players share the floor, Butler has scaled back more than anyone, taking fewer shots (46) than the other four — with Embiid by far in the lead (95 shots). Of course, in fourth quarters, Butler has emerged as the most reliable offensive option of the quintet, shooting 12 for 18 when all five play together, highlighted by last week’s game-winning jumper against Boston after the Celtics had won six of the teams’ seven previous meetings. The natural drop in Butler’s per-game averages this season, playing for such a loaded team, tends to overshadow the fact that he still ranks 16th in the league in a category (Real Plus-Minus) strongly associated with team success. “He’s a special talent at closing and winning games — and not just offensively,” Brand said. “He’s just a winner.” An indication of Butler’s true standing in the game will come July 1, when he becomes an unrestricted free agent for the first time. Brand has said repeatedly that he hopes to keep Philadelphia’s new core four together, but Butler is expected to attract serious interest from both Los Angeles teams as well as the Nets. The Clippers’ special adviser Jerry West, to name one prominent fan, is said to be a longtime admirer of Butler’s two-way impact. Not that Butler is prepared to discuss much about the future. He brushed off free-agency talk in our conversation and claimed that he didn’t even know Minnesota was on this week’s calendar until I told him. He stuck mostly to peripheral subjects. Those include Butler’s devotion to playing dominoes and Uno, his friendship with “the best soccer player in the world” — Paris St.-Germain’s Brazilian star Neymar — and the trusty American football he travels around with. Butler said he plans to toss the football with other 76ers with greater regularity during the playoffs. “I’m telling you — it takes away some of that pressure,” Butler said. Thibodeau still lives in Minneapolis in the wake of his Jan. 6 firing, but politely declined to comment about Butler’s visit. Butler, for his part, continues to refer to Thibodeau as “my guy.” He said they maintained regular contact. Although Butler remains unwilling to dig deeply into the reasons he pushed so hard for an exit so soon after the dramatic impact he had in his lone full season with the Wolves, give him this: He is prepared to take whatever pent-up frustration has been stored up for him in the Twin Cities. Rather than ask for forgiveness from the locals, or even civility, Butler said: “I did what I did. I’m cool with it. I’m in a good place.” He has only one request for the basketball public: Pick someone else to win the East besides the up-and-down Sixers. “Don’t pick us,” Butler said. “I hope people say we’re going to lose in the first round.

2019,‘They’re Leaving Us With Nothing’: Cuts of 150 Teachers Threaten Troubled N.J. City,"[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] More than 200 education jobs cut, including 150 teachers and 23 vice principals. Class sizes would balloon. Art and music classes would be erased. The budget proposed by the school board in Paterson, the third largest city in New Jersey, offered a staggering package of cuts. Officials said they have no choice but to make the cuts that stand to undo years of gains by the long-struggling school district. The board’s recent vote has plunged this economically distressed city into a wrenching debate about how its schools are funded, who controls the education of its nearly 29,000 public school children and what it will finally take to lift Paterson — a once-thriving industrial center — from its bleak past. “The upsetting thing about it is the district was in a rebound,’’ said Rosie Grant, the executive director of the Paterson Education Fund, a nonprofit advocacy group. “They have put in early reading programs, math programs, different interventions, and we were seeing some results from that. “All that will be erased.” Paterson is one of four poor-performing districts that were taken over by the state starting in 1989, after officials determined that the school systems had fallen into educational bankruptcy with dismally low test scores and poor high school graduation rates. Newark and Jersey City have since regained control of their schools, but Camden and Paterson are still under state oversight. Despite the worry that has gripped Paterson, some officials questioned whether the district’s threatened cuts were meant to try to force the state to provide more financing. Two years ago, the school board said it would lay off about 96 teachers, according to reports, but ultimately 25 teachers ended up losing jobs. Last year, Paterson and the state entered into a two-year agreement that would return the schools to local control provided it met specific benchmarks, such as improved scores on standardized state tests and higher graduation rates. The move, education advocates said, was in part a recognition that state control of districts should not be an open-ended process and that local school leaders are in the best position to understand the needs of students. By some measures Paterson has succeeded: Almost 85 percent of students graduate from high school, up from a 46 percent graduation rate 10 years ago. The positive trajectory comes in spite of the high number of children from families that are below the poverty level; 97 percent of Paterson’s students qualify for free or subsidized school lunches. But the formula New Jersey uses to distribute school aid has left many local districts underfunded. Over the past decade, Paterson officials said the city’s 54 public schools have accrued a $280 million shortfall in state aid, forcing the district to cut more than 500 education positions between 2010 and 2017. As part of the deal to regain control of its schools, Paterson had to agree to balance its $526 million budget, prompting the school board’s 6-to-3 vote in favor of the proposed cuts. In addition to the loss of 150 teachers and 23 vice principals, the board has also proposed the elimination of 11 support staff members, 29 supervisors and five school directors. Another 44 positions that are vacant would not be filled. The layoffs would save an estimated $22 million, and reduce the number of teachers by about 6 percent, officials said. “I’m worried,” said Kieanna Pace Jr. 17, a junior at the city’s Eastside High School. “They’re leaving us with nothing.” Officials and advocates said it was unfair for students’ education to suffer because of a lack of state funding. “We’ve been underfunded for a very long time,” said Oshin Castillo, the president of Paterson’s board of education. “The fear is that if we continue at this rate, it is going to end up taking local control away. We can’t educate our students if we continue to cut teachers.” Gov. Phillip D. Murphy, a Democrat who campaigned on a promise to fully fund the state’s public schools, has slowly raised local aid since he took office last year. He has proposed another increase in the new budget. “There are few higher priorities than ensuring a high-quality education for all New Jersey students,’’ said Alyana Alfaro, a spokeswoman for Mr. Murphy. “This is just the beginning of a process that over the next several years will ensure that public school districts throughout New Jersey receive school aid based on objective criteria.’’ The superintendent of Paterson’s schools, Eileen Shafer, who was appointed by the board last year, said part of the challenge is that much of the funding the district does get from the state is directed to charter schools. That leaves little money for students in the rest of the city’s schools, which Ms. Shafer said “get scraps.’’ While charter schools play an important role, she said the way money is disributed “has to change.’’ Cutting educators to meet budget goals as part of Paterson’s effort to regain control of its schools could backfire, said Matt Frankel, a consultant to districts across the state, including Newark, which regained control of its schools last year. “There is a very strict point of view by the state of what a school district has to do, both when it comes to the economics and their ability to teach kids,’’ said Mr. Frankel. “That is a big part of the state’s decision to return them to local control.’’ “But how you do it matters, too,’’ he added. “Creating draconian cuts — cuts that are going to have deep effects on kids — or money that is going to be taken away from classrooms, would be a significant issue.” Standing outside Eastside High School, Christopher Capellan, 16, a sophomore, praised his teachers and said he feared what might happen if the proposed budget is adopted. “For students,” he said, “it’s not going to be good.”",The New York Times
2019,"‘This Egg Has United People,’ Teenager Says of Protest Against Bigotry","SYDNEY, Australia — The Australian teenager known as “Egg Boy,” speaking publicly to the news media for the first time since he cracked an egg on a far-right politician’s head, acknowledged, “I understand what I did was not the right thing to do.” “However,” the teenager, Will Connolly, 17, said in an interview with Channel 10, an Australian television channel that aired on Monday evening, “this egg has united people.” Mr. Connolly, who has become an international symbol against bigotry because of the encounter, added that the episode had been used to raise tens of thousands of dollars for the families of those killed in the March 15 terrorist attack in Christchurch, New Zealand. [Want more Australia coverage? Sign up for the weekly Australia Letter here.] That money is from a fund-raising page that was set up for the teenager and initially intended to help cover Mr. Connolly’s legal fees and to buy “more eggs.” By Monday, it had raised almost 80,000 Australian dollars, about $56,000. A law firm has said it would represent Mr. Connolly pro bono, allowing all funds raised through the page to be donated toward victims of the Christchurch attacks. Mr. Connolly’s abrupt transformation from anonymous Australian teenager to international sensation began one day after the Christchurch shootings, when Fraser Anning — a far-right Australian senator who blamed Muslim immigration for the attack — gave a news conference in Melbourne. Mr. Connolly, a resident of the city, crept behind the senator and smashed an egg on his head. Mr. Anning then struck the teenager twice in the head, and the teenager was tackled by the senator’s supporters. The egging, captured on video, raced through social media. In the days since, thousands of people around the world have embraced Mr. Connolly’s actions, and the teenager has been offered concert tickets for life, captured in street art, and honored by basketball players and talk show hosts. Mr. Anning has not apologized for his comments, and said the teenager deserved what he got. A lawyer for Mr. Connolly, Peter Gordon, said last week that there was “no indication” that Mr. Connolly would be charged with a crime, and added that his client had no plans to take legal action against Mr. Anning. The worldwide reaction to his act has seemed to surprise Mr. Connolly, and the teenager said in the interview that the last week had been an overwhelming whirl of emotions, from stress to happiness. “It’s blown up completely out of proportion to the point where it’s embarrassing,” he said. Explaining how the egging had come to be, he said that given the tragedy in Christchurch, when he saw Mr. Anning’s statement he was “just flat-out disgusted.” Still, the teenager said that he had listened to Mr. Anning speak for an hour at the news conference to see whether he would change his mind. “In my mind I wanted to forgive him,” Mr. Connolly said. But as the senator’s continued his comments, the nature of them “empowered me to egg him.” In the days since, he said, he hasn’t had time to process all of the free offers he has received, but he is sure of one thing: “I’m officially off from eggs now.”",The New York Times
2019,‘Tigerland’ Review: Conservation Documentary Lacks Claws,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. According to “Tigerland,” Kailash Sankhala, a noted conservationist from India, believed that to save the tiger it was important to give the public a sense of its beauty. This documentary, directed by Ross Kauffman, at least partly illustrates that principle. You leave with an appreciation for the movements and instincts of an animal of which there are fewer than 4,000 left in the wild, The New York Times wrote in October. But “Tigerland” falls into a common trap of advocacy documentaries, which is to inform on an urgent issue — preserving a species — without a particularly urgent cinematic narrative to match it. Hopping between India, where the film explores the legacy of Sankhala and his descendants, and Russia, where it follows another conservationist, Pavel Fomenko, the movie gives a sense of these advocates’ passion but little more. As relayed here, the sociological history — how killing tigers was seen as a symbol of power in colonial India; how the fall of the Soviet Union led to a rise in the exploitation of natural resources, with poaching a part of that — helps to steer the movie away from generic uplift, as does Fomenko, who emerges as the most interesting subject. Shown in an early moment examining a dead tiger to determine whether it was killed illegally, Fomenko spends the bulk of the movie trying to rescue a mother tiger and her two cubs and relocate them farther from humans. (The mother has attacked pet dogs.) His thread includes one of the few developments that captures the tiger at its fiercest.

2019,‘Triple Frontier’ Review: Men on a Mission? Possible!,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. The tough-guy chatter and feelings in “Triple Frontier” are somewhat more rarefied than in the usual grunting action flick. That’s the idea, at any rate, in this slickly enjoyable, bankrupt take on a fail-safe formula, one that celebrates an ethos even more enduring than patriotism: old-fashioned American greed. And so, once again, rugged he-men with sensational skills, character arcs and Michelangelo musculature set off on a mission deemed impossible. Tom Cruise’s career suggests that these operations are entirely possible, as does every other movie about rakish charmers facing hopeless odds. Sometimes these prickly and smooth charmers are ex-cons; on occasion they’re soldiers (“The Dirty Dozen”) or veterans (the original “Ocean’s Eleven”). Their mission takes different forms but is generally goal-oriented whether the objective is sabotage or a fat payout. The American vets in “Triple Frontier” come in the usual flavors, including a gruff top dog, faithful second in command, wild card and so on. All are easy on the eyes. The top dog delivers a St. Crispin’s Day-style throat-catcher and as usual tells the recruits they’re free to leave, no hard feelings. No one does. Then it’s game on with guns and ammo, followed by squabbles, screw-ups and a terrible sacrifice — honorable, of course. The director J.C. Chandor sells used goods with verve. (His movies include the superior “All Is Lost.”) “Triple Frontier” takes off with a banging overture loaded with the familiar sights and sounds of a phalanx of police vehicles breaching enemy lines, a helicopter swooping overhead. In a generic country that I’ll call South Americaville, the police descend on a drug-gang lair and bad guys and good point, shoot, fall, die amid a hailstorm of bullets that’s topped by a cataclysmic explosion. After the smoke clears, the cool American number apparently running the show, Santiago (Oscar Isaac), turns his back on the police who summarily execute detainees, suggesting that he isn’t the story’s heavy. No one is here except the generic drug lord (Rey Gallegos) who’s in Santiago’s sightlines because, well, drug lords are evil. In the fairy-tale world of action movies, even one that pretends it has a few ideas, malevolence is often a matter of individual bad agents rather than of, say, countries, politics and policies. So, the drug lord is bad, as are at least some on the police force in South Americaville. Santiago and his United States cohort, by contrast, are good and unfailingly patriotic, yet they’re also struggling back home in the civilian world. Tom (Ben Affleck) is a commander turned failing real estate agent in dad pants; the sensitive Ben (Garrett Hedlund) gets smacked around in wrestling cages. After the slamming opener, the movie’s worldview becomes clearer. Santiago seems to be some kind of freelance military adviser for the South Americaville police (or military, whatever). The title refers to the border shared by Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay; I believe there’s a border sign for Brazil in one scene. But the country is really just an attractive, putatively exotic backdrop and as generic as it is in most mindless action blowouts. The difference is that this movie tries to rationalize both its violence and its characters’ behavior, which shifts dramatically when Santiago suggests that he and his buddies rob the drug lord, who’s bunkered in an Amazonian Fort Knox. Chandor handles the action scenes smoothly, making it easy to gloss over what the movie is saying, trying to say or accidentally saying. He maintains the kind of accelerated pace that gives your eyes a workout, and pads the story with an inviting camaraderie that brings you into the group. He also lays on texturizing details, like the Glock pistol logo worn by William (Charlie Hunnam), another member of this soulful brotherhood. Pedro Pascal plays the fifth member, the helicopter pilot tasked with the getaway, so all in all they’re fairly irresistible. And then Santiago appeals to their avarice, souring things. After fighting for the flag for years, he says, they have “nothing to show for it.” The other guys react with the requisite hemming and hawing; someone probably scuffs his boot in the dirt. These are, after all, honorable men, or so the movie repeatedly insists, despite the mounting evidence to the contrary. (They’re thieves.) Working from a script that he rewrote, Chandor struggles to make the story’s contradictions gel. They never do. (The original is by Mark Boal, who’s best known for his collaborations with Kathryn Bigelow.) That’s the case even when the other unsurprising villain emerges, its entrance underscored by Bob Dylan’s Vietnam-era song “Masters of War” that revs up on the soundtrack to point a singular damning finger: “You put a gun in my hand.” When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.",The New York Times
2019,"‘Triple Threat’ Review: Fighting, Fighting and More Fighting","When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. “Triple Threat” unites three stalwarts of contemporary martial arts cinema: Indonesia’s Iko Uwais (“The Raid”), Thailand’s Tony Jaa (the “Ong-Bak” trilogy) and China’s Tiger Chen (who did stunts on “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon” and the “Matrix” movies). Their characters’ alliance proves as stable as it could, given that the film’s reason for existing is to pair the stars off against each other — and others. Those others — the ones they team up to fight — are assassins for hire whose leader (Scott Adkins) is sprung from captivity in an early sequence that results in the death of Uwais’s character’s wife and leaves the trackers played by Jaa and Chen for dead. Everyone vows revenge. But time — and a vicious underground mixed martial arts bout, not quite to the death, between a body-flipping Chen and Uwais — passes before that information is shared. Jaa and Uwais tangle early, in a sequence spoiled by Jaa’s wearing a face-obscuring camouflage hat. Still, the director, Jesse V. Johnson, takes the generally sound approach of deferring the best action. This leaves, unfortunately, longueurs for considering leaps of logic in the plot, which involves a Chinese heiress (Celina Jade) working to loosen the grip of organized crime on the fictitious Asian country where her father grew up. At times, the film’s demand for teamwork precludes satisfying payoffs. It would be more fun to watch Uwais take down the much-larger Michael Jai White (as one of the assassins) without an assist, for instance. Also, asking Adkins to take on Jaa and Uwais simultaneously just seems unsporting. But your scorecard will be full, which is the point.

2019,‘Two Plains & a Fancy’ Review: Searching for the Perfect Hot Springs,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. The year of “Two Plains & a Fancy” is 1893. The place is an unspecified section of Colorado, near mountains. The people are neither pioneers nor lawbreakers, but three seekers of some satisfactory hot springs. There’s Alta Mariah Sophronia (Marianna McClellan), who almost immediately admits to the man who rented her a horse that she’s a con woman, and that the stone she’s given him in payment does not have magical powers. There’s Ozanne Le Perrier (Laetitia Dosch), a French geologist who will prove to have a different, more European conception of nude bathing than her companions do. And finally, there’s the dandy, Milton Tingling (Benjamin Crotty), who for his journey has packed a truly staggering number of neck scarves. It is from his repository of fashion wisdom that the film’s title derives. Shot largely with hand-held camera on 16 mm film, the movie was directed by Lev Kalman and Whitney Horn (they also collaborated on “L For Leisure” in 2015). It has a casually handmade quality that is sometimes at odds with its arch scenario. “I usually avoid American cigarettes because of the way they make my hair smell,” Milton informs his friends during a smoking interlude. You can imagine overhearing a line like this, and others, in a Brooklyn bar or a San Francisco coffee shop today. But while at times this movie seems like a cross between “Meek’s Cutoff” and “The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie,” it’s not too deeply invested in skewering social classes of the past or the present. The mode of humor is close to cliquish anticomedy, and viewers not attuned to it may feel like there’s a joke they’re missing.

2019,‘Us’ Opens as an Even Bigger Horror Hit for Jordan Peele,"Jordan Peele is holding a new mirror up to society, and this weekend proved just how many moviegoers want a look at its reflection. Universal’s “Us,” the latest politically resonant horror movie from Peele, sold an estimated $70.3 million in tickets over the weekend, easily leading the domestic box office and more than doubling the opening-weekend ticket sales of $33.4 million for Peele’s smash-hit directorial debut, “Get Out.” It makes sense that audiences were primed to see “Us”: When “Get Out” was released, Peele was still best known for sketch comedy, not directing horror movies. The runaway success of “Get Out” (it went on to gross around $175 million) was a product of euphoric reviews and strong word-of-mouth as the movie dominated the cultural discussion in the days and weeks after its release. [Read how Lupita Nyong’o created that creepy voice.] Even so, few predicted this level of success for “Us.” Analysts expected its first-weekend ticket sales to land closer to the $40 million mark. The movie stars Lupita Nyong’o, Winston Duke, Shahadi Wright Joseph and Evan Alex as a family tormented by their evil, scissor-wielding doppelgängers. The film’s generally strong reviews (it holds a 94 percent fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes) likely helped sustain excitement going into this weekend; many critics said the movie is both scarier and more ambitious than “Get Out,” although perhaps lacking that film’s clarity. [Read our critic’s review of “Us.”] The promise of Peele’s scares-with-a-message was more than enough to deliver “Us” the No. 1 spot. It unseated Disney’s “Captain Marvel,” which landed in second place with about $35 million in its third weekend, according to Comscore, which compiles box-office data. Both “Us” and “Captain Marvel” are diverse movies, with the former led by black actors and a black director and the latter starring a female superhero, the first Marvel Cinematic Universe film to do so. Third place went to Paramount’s animated “Wonder Park,” which sold $9 million in tickets. And CBS Films and Lionsgate’s romantic drama “Five Feet Apart” came in a close fourth, with about $8.8 million. Both of those movies were in their second weekends.",The New York Times
2019,‘Us’ Reflects a Mirror Image of ‘The Twilight Zone’,"Major spoilers for “Us” (and some decades-old episodes of “The Twilight Zone”) are ahead. In Jordan Peele’s horror hit “Us,” Adelaide (Lupita Nyong’o), a wife and mother of two, is haunted. During a visit to the Santa Cruz, Calif., pier as a child, she was briefly separated from her parents and stumbled upon an eerie funhouse — and her doppelgänger, Red. She hasn’t been the same since. Now, as an adult returning to that same beach on a vacation with her husband, Gabe (Winston Duke), and two children, her fears have returned. Stirred by the memories of that fateful night, Adelaide confesses what she saw to Gabe. “My whole life I feel like she’s still coming for me,” she reveals. A disbelieving Gabe cracks a joke, but moments later, Red (also Nyong’o) and the counterparts of the entire family descend on the house, determined to claim what they believe is rightfully theirs. “Us” is awash in cultural references and cinematic nods, but perhaps more than anything else, it feels like “The Twilight Zone,” the classic TV series that Peele is reviving next month on CBS All Access. In creating Adelaide and Red, Peele has reimagined a classic character and trope found in that anthology series: the protagonist forced to reckon with another version of him or herself, and the desperate need to be someone else. The twisted path that connects “The Twilight Zone” to “Us” leads most readily to the Season 1 episode “Mirror Image,” which Peele has cited as an inspiration for his film. In it, Millicent Barnes (Vera Miles) waits at a bus station, and realizes she has crossed paths with her doppelgänger. Only she can see the curious figure; no one else at the depot believes Millicent’s claim, and she slowly begins to unravel. Millicent explains to Paul, a man waiting for the same bus, that there must be a parallel universe and each person has a counterpart. For unknown reasons, the two worlds can converge, allowing the counterparts to enter our realm. “In order to survive,” she continues, “it has to take over — replace us, move us out, so that it can live.” The doppelgängers in “Us” aren’t explicitly described as coming from parallel universes, but Red calls her connection to Adelaide a “tethering,” an unshakable bond — and the movie makes it clear that once the two meet for the second time, as adults, they cannot coexist peacefully. A version of this conflict between selves plays out heavily across many other “Twilight Zone” episodes. Season 5’s “Spur of the Moment,” for instance, follows Anne, an 18-year-old engaged to a stuffy but father-approved investment banker, who encounters an older woman in black while horseback riding. The woman, also on horseback, screams at Anne and chases her before losing ground. By the end of the episode, it’s revealed that the miserable woman is Anne 25 years later, trying to stop her younger self from making the mistake of marrying the wrong man. And in “Nightmare as a Child,” a young girl suddenly appears outside Helen’s apartment door; the girl turns out to be her younger self, there to remind her of a long-buried trauma that occurred when she was a child, and to warn her about how it will come back to haunt her in the present. [Read our interview with Jordan Peele about his relaunching of “The Twilight Zone.”] Throughout “Us,” Adelaide shares with those “Twilight Zone” characters and others a psychological unraveling — there are flashbacks to her childhood soon after the hall-of-mirrors encounter, in which she overhears her parents confessing their worries about her to a therapist. At the beach, Adelaide’s eyes dart uncomfortably as she tries to maintain a dull conversation with the vapid Kitty (Elisabeth Moss), and she has an anxiety attack when she briefly loses track of her son. On the other side of the mirror, Red’s motivations echo facets of “Twilight Zone” conundrums, too. There are traces of the Tethered in “Five Characters in Search of an Exit”; the Major — like Red — is not content to remain trapped in a giant cylinder, and is desperate to rally the others to escape. “The After Hours,” in which department-store mannequins institute a rotation where one of them gets to live along humans for a month at a time, gets at the same how-the-other-half-lives ideas as “Us.” Both episodes approach those yearnings for a better life in a decidedly more elegiac fashion than “Us,” which uses violence to demonstrate the overthrow of the ruling class. When Red and the others attack Adelaide’s family at the house, she pointedly describes Adelaide as having a shadow that lives a much less cushy lifestyle. While Adelaide had celebrated happy Christmases, married a “handsome prince” and had lovely children, Red’s existence was the opposite: cold, empty, sad. Later, in their final showdown, Red expresses even more bitterness. “You could have taken me with you,” she grunts, referring to their first encounter in the funhouse. But Adelaide didn’t. Instead, as we learn in the movie’s twist, Adelaide is actually Red, and Red is actually Adelaide — just as Millicent is ultimately replaced by her doppelgänger in “Mirror Image.” (Paul has her arrested for her erratic behavior.) This reveal brings more questions than answers: What are we to make of the fact that Red swapped places with Adelaide, and we’ve been unwittingly rooting for her all along? Is there a class below the Tethered, waiting to overthrow them next? Are any of the characters, whether Tethered or not, actually good? Whatever the conclusion, it’s meant to unsettle us, like the best of Serling’s “Twilight Zone” episodes. As Peele told The Times’s Dave Itzkoff, “I love human beings as the monster, as the horror.”",The New York Times
2019,‘Us’ Review: Jordan Peele’s Creepy Latest Turns a Funhouse Mirror on Us,"Critic’s Pick When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. Jordan Peele’s new horror movie, “Us,” is an expansive philosophical hall of mirrors. Like his 2017 hit, “Get Out,” this daring fun-until-it’s-not shocker starts from the genre’s central premise that everyday life is a wellspring of terrors. In “Get Out,” a young black man meets a group of white people who buy — at auction — younger, healthier black bodies. What makes “Get Out” so powerful is how Peele marshals a classic tale of unwilling bodily possession into a resonant, unsettling metaphor for the sweep of black and white relations in the United States — the U.S., or us. “Us” is more ambitious than “Get Out,” and in some ways more unsettling. Once again, Peele is exploring existential terrors and the theme of possession, this time through the eerie form of the monstrous doppelgänger. The figure of the troublesome other — of Jekyll and Hyde, of the conscious and unconscious — ripples through the story of an ordinary family, the Wilsons, stalked by murderous doubles. These shadows look like the Wilsons but are frighteningly different, with fixed stares and guttural, animalistic vocalizations. Dressed in matching red coveralls and wielding large scissors (the better to slice and dice), they are funhouse-mirror visions turned nightmares. The evil twin is a rich, durable motif, and it winds through “Us” from start to finish, beginning with a flashback to 1986 at a Santa Cruz, Calif., amusement park. There, a young girl (the expressive Madison Curry) and her parents are leisurely wandering the park. The girl is itsy-bitsy (the camera sticks close to her so that everything looms), and she and her parents maintain a chilly, near-geometric distance from one another. She’s clutching a perfect candied apple, a portentous splash of red and a witty emblem both of Halloween and Edenic forbidden fruit. Movies are journeys into knowledge, and what the girl knows is part of the simmering mystery. The Wilsons, a family of four headed by Adelaide (a dazzling Lupita Nyong’o) and Gabe (Winston Duke), enter many years later, introduced with an aerial sweep of greenery. The bird’s-eye view (or god’s-eye, given the movie’s metaphysical reach) evokes the opener of Stanley Kubrick’s “The Shining,” a film Peele references throughout. A true cinephile, Peele scatters “Us” with nods and allusions to old-school 1970s and ’80s movies including “Goonies,” “Jaws,” “A Nightmare on Elm Street.” (One disturbing scene suggests that he’s also a fan of Michael Haneke.) But “The Shining” — another story of a grotesquely haunted family — serves as his most obvious guiding star, narratively and visually. [Read about Lupita Nyong’o and her work on the movie.] Peele likes to mix tones and moods, and as he did in “Get Out,” he uses broad humor both for delay and deflection. There’s a cryptic opener and an equally enigmatic credit sequence, but soon the Wilsons are laughing at their vacation home. It’s a breather that Peele uses for light jokes and intimacy (Duke’s amiable performance provides levity and warmth) while he scatters narrative bread crumbs. There’s a beach trip with another family, this one headed by Kitty (a fantastic Elisabeth Moss) and Josh (Tim Heidecker), who have teenage twin girls (cue “The Shining”). At last, the movie jumps to kinetic life with the appearance of the Wilsons’ doubles, who descend in a brutal home invasion. The assault is a master class of precision-timed scares filled with light shivers and deeper, reverberant frights. Working within the house’s tight, angled spaces — soon filled with fluid camerawork and bodies moving to dramatically different beats — Peele turns this domestic space into a double of the funhouse that loomed in the amusement park. After much scrambling and shrieking, the Wilsons and their weird twins face off in the living room, mirroring one another. Adelaide’s shadow, Red (the actors play their doubles), takes charge and splits up the Wilsons, ordering her husband, daughter and son to take charge of their terrified others while she remains with Adelaide. [Read Jason Zinoman’s essay on why this is the golden age of grown-up horror.] A vibrant, appealing screen presence, Nyong’o brings a tremendous range and depth of feeling to both characters, who she individualizes with such clarity and lapidary detail that they aren’t just distinct beings; they feel as if they were being inhabited by different actors. She gives each a specific walk and sharply opposite gestures and voices (maternally silky vs. monstrously raspy). Adelaide, who studied ballet, moves gracefully and, when need be, rapidly (she racks up miles); Red moves as if keeping time to a metronome, with the staccato, mechanical step and head turns of an automaton. Both have ramrod posture and large unblinking eyes. Red’s mouth is a monstrous abyss. The confrontation between Adelaide and Red testifies to Peele’s strength with actors — here, he makes the most of Nyong’o’s dueling turns — but, once Red starts explaining things, it also telegraphs the story’s weakness. “Us” is Peele’s second movie, but as his ideas pile up — and the doubles and their terrors expand — it starts to feel like his second and third combined. One of the pleasures of “Get Out” was its conceptual and narrative elegance, a streamlining that makes it feel shorter than its one hour 44 minutes. “Us” runs a little longer, but its surfeit of stuff — its cinephilia, bunnies of doom, sharp political detours and less-successful mythmaking — can make it feel unproductively cluttered. Peele’s boldest, most exciting and shaky conceptual move in “Us” is to yoke the American present with the past, first by invoking the 1986 super-event Hands Across America. A very ’80s charity drive (one of its organizers helped create the ’85 benefit hit “We Are the World”), it had Americans holding hands from coast to coast, making a human chain meant to fight hunger and homelessness. President Reagan held hands in front of the White House even while his administration was criticized for cutting billions for programs to help the homeless. In “Us,” the appearance of unity — in a nation, in a person — doesn’t last long before being ripped away like one of the movie’s masks. Peele piles on (and tears off) the masks and the metaphors, tethers the past to the present and draws a line between the Reagan and Trump presidencies, suggesting that we were, and remain, one nation profoundly divisible. He also busies up his story with too many details, explanations and cutaways. Peele’s problem isn’t that he’s ambitious; he is, blissfully. But he also feels like an artist who has been waiting a very long time to say a great deal, and here he steps on, and muddles, his material, including in a fight that dilutes even Nyong’o’s best efforts. Early on, Peele drops in some text about the existence of abandoned tunnels, mines and subways in the United States. I flashed on Colson Whitehead’s novel “The Underground Railroad,” which literalizes the network of safe houses and routes used by enslaved black Americans, turning it into a fantastical subterranean passageway to freedom. In “Us,” Peele uses the metaphor of the divided self to explore what lies beneath contemporary America, its double consciousness, its identity, sins and terrors. The results are messy, brilliant, sobering, even bleak — the final scene is a gut punch delivered with a queasy smile — but Jordan Peele isn’t here just to play.

2019,‘Us’ Review: Jordan Peele’s Creepy Latest Turns a Funhouse Mirror on Us,"Critic’s Pick When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. Jordan Peele’s new horror movie, “Us,” is an expansive philosophical hall of mirrors. Like his 2017 hit, “Get Out,” this daring fun-until-it’s-not shocker starts from the genre’s central premise that everyday life is a wellspring of terrors. In “Get Out,” a young black man meets a group of white people who buy — at auction — younger, healthier black bodies. What makes “Get Out” so powerful is how Peele marshals a classic tale of unwilling bodily possession into a resonant, unsettling metaphor for the sweep of black and white relations in the United States — the U.S., or us. “Us” is more ambitious than “Get Out,” and in some ways more unsettling. Once again, Peele is exploring existential terrors and the theme of possession, this time through the eerie form of the monstrous doppelgänger. The figure of the troublesome other — of Jekyll and Hyde, of the conscious and unconscious — ripples through the story of an ordinary family, the Wilsons, stalked by murderous doubles. These shadows look like the Wilsons but are frighteningly different, with fixed stares and guttural, animalistic vocalizations. Dressed in matching red coveralls and wielding large scissors (the better to slice and dice), they are funhouse-mirror visions turned nightmares. The evil twin is a rich, durable motif, and it winds through “Us” from start to finish, beginning with a flashback to 1986 at a Santa Cruz, Calif., amusement park. There, a young girl (the expressive Madison Curry) and her parents are leisurely wandering the park. The girl is itsy-bitsy (the camera sticks close to her so that everything looms), and she and her parents maintain a chilly, near-geometric distance from one another. She’s clutching a perfect candied apple, a portentous splash of red and a witty emblem both of Halloween and Edenic forbidden fruit. Movies are journeys into knowledge, and what the girl knows is part of the simmering mystery. The Wilsons, a family of four headed by Adelaide (a dazzling Lupita Nyong’o) and Gabe (Winston Duke), enter many years later, introduced with an aerial sweep of greenery. The bird’s-eye view (or god’s-eye, given the movie’s metaphysical reach) evokes the opener of Stanley Kubrick’s “The Shining,” a film Peele references throughout. A true cinephile, Peele scatters “Us” with nods and allusions to old-school 1970s and ’80s movies including “Goonies,” “Jaws,” “A Nightmare on Elm Street.” (One disturbing scene suggests that he’s also a fan of Michael Haneke.) But “The Shining” — another story of a grotesquely haunted family — serves as his most obvious guiding star, narratively and visually. [Read about Lupita Nyong’o and her work on the movie.] Peele likes to mix tones and moods, and as he did in “Get Out,” he uses broad humor both for delay and deflection. There’s a cryptic opener and an equally enigmatic credit sequence, but soon the Wilsons are laughing at their vacation home. It’s a breather that Peele uses for light jokes and intimacy (Duke’s amiable performance provides levity and warmth) while he scatters narrative bread crumbs. There’s a beach trip with another family, this one headed by Kitty (a fantastic Elisabeth Moss) and Josh (Tim Heidecker), who have teenage twin girls (cue “The Shining”). At last, the movie jumps to kinetic life with the appearance of the Wilsons’ doubles, who descend in a brutal home invasion. The assault is a master class of precision-timed scares filled with light shivers and deeper, reverberant frights. Working within the house’s tight, angled spaces — soon filled with fluid camerawork and bodies moving to dramatically different beats — Peele turns this domestic space into a double of the funhouse that loomed in the amusement park. After much scrambling and shrieking, the Wilsons and their weird twins face off in the living room, mirroring one another. Adelaide’s shadow, Red (the actors play their doubles), takes charge and splits up the Wilsons, ordering her husband, daughter and son to take charge of their terrified others while she remains with Adelaide. [Read Jason Zinoman’s essay on why this is the golden age of grown-up horror.] A vibrant, appealing screen presence, Nyong’o brings a tremendous range and depth of feeling to both characters, who she individualizes with such clarity and lapidary detail that they aren’t just distinct beings; they feel as if they were being inhabited by different actors. She gives each a specific walk and sharply opposite gestures and voices (maternally silky vs. monstrously raspy). Adelaide, who studied ballet, moves gracefully and, when need be, rapidly (she racks up miles); Red moves as if keeping time to a metronome, with the staccato, mechanical step and head turns of an automaton.

2019,‘Us’ Took Hands Across America and Made It a Death Grip,"On May 25, 1986, something happened in the United States that — in this divisive American moment — sounds utterly bonkers. It was a Sunday, around 3 p.m. on the East Coast, when millions of people held hands with strangers for 15 minutes in a human chain that was meant to stretch from New York to California. It was an effort to raise money for organizations fighting hunger and homelessness, and it was called Hands Across America. A Washington Post headline later suggested that it “might have been the most Eighties thing to happen in the 1980s.” Hands Across America has largely been stored in the Gen X memory box along with its feel-good, cheese ball music video, which features cameos by Barbra Streisand, Robin Williams and other celebrities. Toto was the backing band. Memories of the occasion are now resurfacing — through a sinister lens — thanks to “Us,” the new hit horror film written and directed by Jordan Peele. [Read our interview with Jordan Peele, who is also relaunching a version of “The Twilight Zone,” here.] In the movie, Lupita Nyong’o plays a mother haunted by a traumatic encounter she had as a girl in 1986. Her life is violently upended when a wicked version of her family shows up to hatch plans that, according to Peele, imagine “the dark side of Hands Across America.” The family first appears standing hand-in-hand like paper dolls, as did Hands Across America’s participants. That formation is a motif in the film’s advertising and a recurring, nefarious force in the story. Peele “draws a line between the Reagan and Trump presidencies, suggesting that we were, and remain, one nation profoundly divisible,” Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The Times. For Katy Shrout, 9 at the time and now a 42-year-old eighth-grade English teacher in Atlanta, Hands Across America was a joyful moment “of epic significance.” With a mixtape booming in her boombox, Shrout joined hands with her parents, sister and her sister’s Cabbage Patch Kid, Iva, along a roadway in St. Louis. “I was really pumped about it,” said Shrout. “I thought that when we were holding hands, I was holding hands with people in California and New York.” (The line actually had gaps in some areas; states not on the route organized their own similar events.) [Read the review of “Us,” watch how Jordan Peele builds suspense in the film and find out why Lupita Nyong’o’s voice sounds so creepy.] In an interview, Peele said that as he was writing “Us” he stumbled across a commercial for the event and “got this really eerie feeling.” A Hands Across America commercial of the director’s own making plays at the beginning of the film. “There’s something cultlike about the imagery that makes me think of the Manson family singing folk songs as they leave the courtroom,” said Peele, who was 7 when the nationwide gathering happened. “There’s like an insistence that as long as we have each other, we can walk blindly past the ugliness and evil that we may be a part of.” By infusing Hands Across America with malevolent power, Peele is cinematizing one of the main criticisms it faced in 1986: that it was “a superficial gesture that offered no long-term solution to poverty in the United States,” as The Times described homeless advocates’ objections in a front-page article the day after the event. Eventually, the initiative distributed about $15 million to various charities, lower than its target of at least $50 million. In his “satirical poke” at Hands Across America, Peele said he wasn’t calling into question the “well intentioned, good people” behind it. “I don’t think the notion is an evil one,” he explained. Yet as he reflected on it these years later, Peele said it struck him as an event “more for the people who are holding hands to cure hunger than for the people who are hungry themselves.” There is no dark side to Hands Across America for Ken Kragen. A former talent manager whose clients included Kenny Rogers and Lionel Richie, Kragen was the event’s main organizer. Now 82 and a business consultant in Los Angeles, he considers it the “biggest accomplishment” of his professional life. That’s in addition to his role as president of U.S.A. for Africa, the organization behind the song “We Are the World,” a 1985 hit featuring Michael Jackson, Tina Turner and other megastars that, according to Rolling Stone, raised over $63 million in humanitarian aid for organizations in Africa and the United States. (U.S.A. for Africa is still around and hands out money to groups in Africa, in part from royalties from “We Are the World” downloads, according to Kragen, now a board member of the operation.) Kragen said he wasn’t aware that Hands Across America was featured in “Us.” Not a horror movie fan, he remarked: “My wife’s going to see it.” He said he was “delighted” that the film might encourage a new generation to learn more about an event that, while it may not have solved the issue of hunger, “made a difference.” “Putting 5.5 million people across the country was completely impossible, and we did it without the benefit of the internet,” he said. “That’s one of the most amazing things. The more younger people are aware that we pulled this off, the more likely they may create something that will help pull the country back together.” Could Hands Across America happen again? Would a theme song with the lines “See those people over there/They’re my sister and brother” last a second without being annihilated by Twitter? Not likely, said Abby Aronson, who was 16 when she participated in Hands Across America in New Jersey. “Today people always have something in their hands,” said Aronson, now 49 and a foreign service officer. “You would break the chain. You’d either have to participate or document. It’s harder today to be in a moment 100 percent.” For Kragen, there are political roadblocks. “With this administration, and particularly a leader who wants to divide people, it’s hard to find anything that everybody can agree on,” he said. “With the encouragement of the alt-right and the Nazis and the white supremacists, the chance of the line getting attacked are very real.” Peele isn’t hopeful either. “Unless Beyoncé is leading the charge,” he said.",The New York Times
2019,‘Veep’ Toasts Its Final Season,"And the Metrograph art house cinema celebrates its third anniversary on the Lower East Side. 10 Photos View Slide Show › “New York always had wonderful small independent theaters, and we went to them all the time,” Patti Smith, the writer, performer and 1970s icon, said at the Metrograph cinema on Ludlow Street on Thursday night. “The first independent cinemas were, like, 42nd Street theaters where you paid 50 cents,” she added. “You could watch Fellini and Bergman movies all day long, but without subtitles.” Ms. Smith was among the dozens of creative luminaries who celebrated Metrograph’s third anniversary and its new distribution arm. Founded by Alexander Olch, a designer with a boutique nearby, it is a symbol of both the gentrification and creative regeneration of the Lower East Side, a neighborhood that has the been the crucible of artistic movements as diverse as Yiddish theater and punk rock. As heavy rain pounded the tenement buildings nearby, the two-story theater became a mosh pit of cross-generational bohemians. There were celebrated filmmakers (Baz Luhrmann, Kenneth Lonergan, Griffin Dunne, Darren Aronofsky, Whit Stillman and Paul Schrader), actors (Justin Theroux, Tavi Gevinson, John Turturro, Sienna Miller, Isabelle Huppert) and musicians (Marky Ramone and Jack Antonoff, who became famous 30 years apart). The art house theater even managed to snag blue-chip artists (Cindy Sherman and Anh Duong) and billion-heir scenesters (Harry and Peter Brant Jr.). Guests nibbled on miniburgers and other hors d’oeuvres, and popped into theaters screening short works by Tatsuo Sato, Kenneth Anger, Barbara Rubin and other cineastes. For a moment, it felt like a New York of a different era, before Hudson Yards, “Sex and the City” and Giuliani. “The overbuilding is depressing, and it’s depressing that the whole city is a construction zone,” Ms. Smith said. “There’s a lot of things to be upset about, but I love this place and I’m grateful for it.” Turns out, one of the jokes too outré to make the seventh and final season of “Veep” was a Robert Caro reference. Julia Louis-Dreyfus plays the presidential candidate Selina Meyer in the show, which began its valedictory run with a party at Lincoln Center on Tuesday night. She was joined by the entire cast including Tony Hale, Anna Chlumsky, Matt Walsh, Reid Scott and Tim Simons, as well as Armando Iannucci, who created the show. The first episode of the final season contains impolitic jokes about two fictional mass shootings. After the recent shootings in New Zealand and the second apparent suicide of a survivor of the Parkland, Fla., school shooting, did the joke go too far? “We’re always pushing the limits on our show, we’re always going to extremes,” Ms. Louis-Dreyfus said, before she seemed to switch into character. “And I’m a big proponent of serious gun legislation and control. Get the N.R.A. out of our politics!” After a screening of two episodes (spoiler alert: There is copious cursing), guests repaired for a buffet of grilled salmon and red, white and blue Dippin’ Dots ice cream. The starry crowd included Lena Dunham, Zosia Mamet, Ilana Glazer, Abbi Jacobson, Kieran Culkin, Stephen Colbert and John Oliver. The new season contains blink-and-you’ll-miss-’em jokes about obscure figures like Billy Carter, the troublemaking brother of former President Jimmy Carter, and Clyde Tolson, the reputed lover of J. Edgar Hoover. But David Mandel, the showrunner, said he nixed one gag about a well-known presidential biographer. Mr. Mandel paraphrased the line: “‘Selina would like Robert Caro to write a tumor-sized biography about her that nobody reads.’” “I love that joke more than life itself, but we couldn’t fit it in,” he said.",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | ‘We Are Either a Team or We’re Not’,"How much does Nancy Pelosi have to worry about a left-center split? Mr. Edsall contributes a weekly column from Washington, D.C. on politics, demographics and inequality. There is a larger story behind the bitterness expressed inside the House Democratic caucus last week after 26 moderate Democratic members defied the leadership to support a Republican proposal to require reporting undocumented immigrants who try to buy guns to immigration authorities. Two key wings of the congressional Democratic Party have divergent political interests — on one hand the ascendant progressives led by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, many of whom have proudly declared themselves democratic socialists, and on the other the band of moderates who flipped most of the 41 districts that went from red to blue in November. The progressives are committed to an ambitious and expensive set of proposals, including a Green New Deal and Medicare for All, policies they have promised to promote unrelentingly. This agenda, and the attention it gets, has put the fear of defeat in 2020 front and center in the minds of newly elected House moderates. They see their progressive colleagues shaping an image of a Democratic House leaning so far to the left that it endangers the future of the current House majority. A story published Feb. 24 by my Times colleagues Catie Edmondson and Emily Cochrane described the agony of the moderate wing. At a town hall last month in a suburb of Salt Lake City, Ben McAdams, one of the moderate freshman Democrats, faced constituents questioning him about the “socialism” and “anti-Semitism” they had read about. “How long do you intend to ride that train with those people?” one voter asked. Another wondered whether McAdams would be “corrupted” by his service in Congress. McAdams’ answer captured the bind he and other centrists find themselves in: “There have been some articles about this, a little bit of tension on the Democratic side: Are we going to veer to the far left or are we going to stay in the center? I don’t know where the Democratic Party will go, but I tell you what, I will stay in the center. People are going to have to take it or leave it.” The question for McAdams and others is, will such declarations of independence insulate them on Election Day? Some evidence suggests that they will not. Let’s first examine the specific issue that brought intraparty Democratic tension between moderates and progressives to a boil: a seemingly bland parliamentary gambit called a “motion to recommit” — known in Congressional jargon as an M.T.R. Under House rules, the motion to recommit is one of the few mechanisms granted to the out-of-power party to shape legislation. “Controlling the Congressional agenda really is the sine qua non of a successful majority party,” Sarah Binder, a political scientist at George Washington University and a senior fellow at Brookings, told me. If there is one thing that sets Nancy Pelosi apart from other Democratic speakers, it is her ability to maintain control of the Democratic majority on key votes. It is no wonder, then, that she was outraged when these 26 moderate Democrats supported a Republican motion to recommit on Feb. 27 — explicitly designed to thwart progressive Democrats who adamantly oppose reporting undocumented immigrants to authorities. To Pelosi, the motion was an aggressive attempt on the part of House Republicans to undermine her leadership, and moderate Democratic members who supported it were seeking political cover at her expense. “We are either a team or we’re not, and we have to make that decision,” she declared at the Democratic caucus meeting. “This is not a day at the beach. This is the Congress of the United States.” In recent decades, “the motion to recommit has been weaponized,” Tom Mann, a senior fellow at Brookings, wrote me by email. “Like almost every effort on the floor by the minority party in the face of majority control of the agenda in the majoritarian House, it is an electoral weapon used to divide and weaken the majority.” Jason Roberts, a political scientist at the University of North Carolina, provided a brief history of the motion in an email. “It was made into a minority right in 1909. It did not really become controversial until the 1970s. Before then, most bills were considered under open rules” that allowed anyone from either party to offer amendments. In the 1970s, Roberts explained, the Democratic majority “began using more restrictive rules that limited or closed off amending opportunities.” This left Republicans with only one alternative to force a vote on an amendment: the motion to recommit. Both parties have made considerable use of the motion when in the minority, but historical analysis demonstrates that it has been a far more effective tool for Republicans than for Democrats. From 1995 to 2006, according to Roberts, Democrats, then in the minority, used it 262 times — but successfully only 1.1 percent of the time. In contrast, from 2007 through 2010, Republicans, then in the minority, forced votes on 181 motions to recommit and won 21.5 percent. Then, from 2011 through 2018, the Democratic minority offered 380 motions to recommit and every one of them failed in the face of united Republican opposition. During the current session of Congress, Republicans successfully won approval of a motion to recommit on legislation requiring universal background checks on all gun sales, including those conducted privately and at gun shows. The motion — passed with the support of the 26 Democratic defectors who infuriated Pelosi — amended the legislation to require notification of Immigration and Customs Enforcement when an undocumented immigrant fails a background check. Almost all of the 26 Democrats who joined Republicans to support the motion represent moderate constituencies, many of which had, until recently, been held by Republicans. Twenty three are on the 2020 National Republican Congressional Committee target list. There are two key factors that explain why Republicans in the House have been far more successful than Democrats in using the motion to recommit to divide the opposition. The first is that the concentration of Democratic voters in urban districts means that in order to win and maintain a House majority, Democrats must be victorious in highly competitive districts, many of which tilt to the right. These Democrats, in turn, are the ones who are the most cross-pressured between loyalty to the leadership and fear of losing support from center-right constituents. “There are more Democrats representing Republican-leaning districts than there are Republicans representing Democratic-leaning districts,” Frances Lee, a political scientist at the University of Maryland, wrote me in an email. In 2018, she continued, “Democrats carried a larger share of districts where members have to be careful not to antagonize their Republican-leaning constituents.” The second reason Republicans rarely provide even token support for Democratic motions to recommit is straightforward: a vast array of local and national conservative media is more than willing to denounce a turncoat. And anyone viewed as disloyal to the Republican Party is likely to face a primary challenger. Matthew Green, a political scientist at Catholic University, has studied the use of motions to recommit and describes the partisan difference as follows: “First, Democrats are more ideologically diverse than Republicans. Second, Democratic Party leaders are more divided on strategy than Republicans.” This is a serious problem, Green continued, “especially if Democrats want to maintain their control of the legislative agenda and keep peace in the family.” In the past, moderate and conservative Democrats sought to separate themselves from the more liberal national party by building a personal brand that their local voters would recognize. This worked when Tip O’Neill’s famous adage, “All politics is local,” was an effective principle in congressional elections. “Old-timers like me remember the 40-year span during which Democrats maintained control of the House through a coalition of liberals, moderates and even a few conservatives,” Gary Jacobson, a political scientist at the University of California-San Diego, recalled in an email. “They did so by tolerating defections if that was the price of re-election: ‘Vote your district first’.” Liberals still “have to be reminded that there are simply not enough liberals out there to form a majority,” Jacobson added. The problem now is that the politics of congressional elections are no longer local. In the years since O’Neill retired as speaker in 1987, American politics have become nationalized. If a conservative or moderate Democrat is running in a Republican-leaning district, he or she must persuade a segment of the electorate to split their tickets, to vote Republican for president, for example, and vote Democrat for the House. The reality is that split ticket voting is steadily disappearing as more and more voters cast uniformly partisan ballots. The accompanying chart, a version of which appeared in a paper by Alan Abramowitz and Steven Webster, political scientists at Emory and Washington University in St. Louis, “Negative Partisanship: Why Americans Dislike Parties But Behave Like Rabid Partisans,” demonstrates this trend. It shows that the percentage of voters splitting their tickets has fallen from 41.3 percent in 1980 to just over 14.3 percent in 2016.

Webster, Washington University in St. Louis The result is that the number of Democrats and Republicans representing districts that lean to the opposite party has fallen from 132 in 1974 to fewer than 23 in 2018, as the second chart shows.

Jacobson, University of California, San Diego The near elimination of cross-party districts has, in turn, been particularly harmful to Democrats, who held roughly 114 of these districts in 1974, but only 23 in 2018. More specifically, these trends point to the consistent re-election difficulties faced by both Democrats and Republicans who are swept into office during wave elections like 1994, 2010 and 2014 (Republican) and 2006 and 2018 (Democratic). Their prospects are governed by the accounting principle “last in, first out.” All of which leads to the very real problem facing the House Democratic Majority. Tom Mann puts it this way: The nationalization of politics, the rise of intense negative partisanship, and the demise of split-ticket voting mean that the electoral fate of Democrats representing marginal districts now depends much more on the party brand than the candidate brand. E. J. Dionne, Jr., my longtime colleague at The Washington Post, wrote earlier this week that House Democrats will eventually resolve the problem of Republican motions to recommit by working out a better disciplined system of granting a limited number of “free passes"" on especially tough votes while preventing wholesale defections. In Mann’s view, efforts by moderate Democrats to create an identity separate from their party by voting against their leadership will likely prove futile, because “Republicans will always attack them as liberals however they vote on these gotcha procedural motions.” In that light, maintaining party cohesion becomes more important: The keys to holding and increasing their 2018 gains in 2020 lies in the relative standing and unity of their party relative to Trump and his Republican enablers and the nomination of a presidential candidate who can keep the enthusiasm of the resistance alive and not scare away weak partisans and independents with outlandish policy proposals. Frances Lee raised another problem for moderate Democrats going into the 2020 elections: The resurgent far left of the party has received media attention out of proportion to its share of the party. The reason Democrats have a majority in the 116th Congress is that they carried so many suburban seats. These suburban members are not going to be blazing the trail for social democracy! But they get very little national media attention compared to the more ideologically strident members. David Hopkins, a political scientist at Boston College, shares Lee’s view: We’re also in a moment when a fair amount of news coverage is suggesting to the American public that the Democratic Party is in the midst of a socialist revolution that is pulling it sharply to the ideological left. The truth is that most newly-elected Democrats in Congress resemble Mikie Sherrill and Abigail Spanberger much more than they do Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez or Rashida Tlaib, but that isn’t the message that reporters and commentators are currently transmitting to their readers and viewers. Both Sherrill and Spanberger are moderates. A report by the centrist Democratic think tank Third Way demonstrates the crucial role moderate Democrats played in the 2018 takeover of the House. Third Way examined the Democratic victors in seats that had previously been held by Republicans — the victories that gave Democrats the majority — and found that none of them were part of or endorsed by the progressive mobilization led by the Justice Democrats, Brand New Congress and Our Revolution. In contrast, 33 of the House candidates endorsed by the moderate New Dem PAC won in districts that had been represented by Republicans. The Third Way report, in combination with the comments from Mann, Lee and Hopkins, suggests that House Democratic strategists — and Democrats generally — should find ways to counter the voices on the party’s left. Such an effort, however, could easily result in the alienation of the progressive wing that has brought grass roots energy to the fore, energy that would be critical to a 2020 Democratic presidential victory, as well as to House or Senate victories in battleground states across the county. The reality is that the Democratic Party is a diverse entity, racially, ethnically and ideologically. It is burdened — some would say blessed — with the problems of varied, often conflicting, interests. The struggle to come to terms with these tensions is constant and inescapable. Even shared hostility to President Trump and his Republican Party will not paper over the conflicts. The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

2019,Opinion | ‘We Are Grown-Up Now and Can Choose for Ourselves’,"One thing is clear in Thailand’s very messy election: Traditional elites of all persuasions are losing touch and traction. Mr. McCargo is a political scientist and a Thailand specialist. Thailand’s election last Sunday — the first in eight years and since the military deposed a democratically elected government in 2014 — was expected to be a tough fight. But the high-stakes contest has also turned out to be exceptionally fraught and dramatic, and the fallout promises to be as well. On Sunday night, after the polls had closed, the election commission first released inconsistent results — before it stopped releasing results altogether. Then it repeatedly delayed making a further announcement. Based on partial, preliminary returns, the junta’s proxy party claims to have won the most votes. But Pheu Thai, the leading pro-democracy party, says it has won the most seats in the 500-member House of Representatives. Yet the real winner of the election — in terms of both immediate surprise and long-term significance — is the brand-new, youth-oriented Future Forward, which cast itself as the party of liberal values and political dissent. It appears to have come in third. And perhaps for just that reason, it may soon be in trouble. On March 17, in a leafy corner of a university campus close to the royal palace in Bangkok, a tall and skinny 40-year-old man with short, spiky hair was surrounded by fans clamoring for selfies and autographs. This was no Korean pop star; it was Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit, a billionaire claiming to stand for the 99 percent, who has become Thailand’s first social-media celebrity politician — a combination of heartthrob and giant-slaying hero. During the campaign, Mr. Thanathorn deployed surprisingly assertive, progressive rhetoric. He called for ending conscription and reducing the military budget and the number of generals. During a live TV debate with the leaders of four other parties recently, he challenged the chief of the army by name, asking him if he would dare to storm the House of Representatives. “Would you shoot us, all 500 of us?” he asked. Thai politicians do not usually talk like this. A leading member of Future Forward told me last year that the party had been set up “to oppose hierarchism.” And Mr. Thanathorn’s outspoken but carefully calibrated defiance has struck a chord, especially, it seems, among younger voters. Of the 52 million Thais eligible to vote on Sunday, an estimated 7 million were first-timers. Since 2001, elections in Thailand have essentially been titanic clashes between, on the one hand, parties associated with the military and the traditional elite, notably the Democrat Party, and, on the other hand, parties linked to the controversial former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra — a telecommunications magnate who has managed to dominate the political scene even since going into self-imposed exile over a decade ago, after a conviction on corruption-related charges. The first camp appeals to the more affluent areas around Bangkok in the south, while pro-Thaksin parties are most popular in the poorer, populous north and northeast. This year again, the main showdown was between Pheu Thai, a descendant of Mr. Thaksin’s own party, and Palang Pracharat, a pragmatic alliance of conservative politicians and military officers widely seen as a vehicle to keep Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, the leader of the 2014 coup, in power. Yet the more significant outcome of the election may be its secondary results: the old-time Democrats’ very poor showing and the fledgling Future Forward’s unexpectedly good returns. Familiar forces may continue to dominate the political landscape, but it also has resolutely changed. Traditional elites of all persuasions are losing touch, and traction. In early February, another, smaller, Thaksin-linked party, Thai Raksa Chart, nominated the king’s older sister, Ubolratana Rajakanya Sirivadhana Varnavadi, as its candidate for prime minister. A firestorm of speculation erupted on social media about why and at whose urging — until King Maha Vajiralongkorn Bodindradebayavarangkun declared that any royal involvement in politics was inappropriate. Ms. Ubolratana promptly withdrew her candidacy and Thai Raksa Chart was dissolved — a turn of events that weakened Pheu Thai, which had joined forces with Thai Raksa Chart and agreed not to compete with it in some constituencies. Mr. Thaksin hit back with an astonishing piece of showmanship. Just two days before the election, he hosted in Hong Kong a ritzy wedding party for his youngest daughter that featured Ms. Ubolratana as guest of honor. Photos showing Mr. Thaksin and Ms. Ubolratana together promptly circulated online. The following night — the eve of the election — King Vajiralongkorn issued another royal statement. Quoting his late father, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, he urged Thais to select “good people” to rule Thailand, in the name of “harmony, national security and the people’s happiness.” The message was widely interpreted as a rebuke of Mr. Thaksin and an implicit call to endorse parties aligned with the junta. A hashtag that translates as “We are grown-up now and can choose for ourselves” soon went viral. The establishment had chastised the young, and now the young were pushing back against paternalism. On the morning of the election, in Ubon Ratchathani, a midsize city in the northeast, a first-time voter told me, grinning, that he did indeed plan to vote for “someone good” — meaning, Mr. Thanathorn. The face of Thailand’s next government is likely to remain unclear for a while. On Wednesday, seven pro-democracy parties, including Pheu Thai and Future Forward, announced that since the “democratic front” they form had won a majority of the lower house, it should get to select Thailand’s next leader. (The prime minister is chosen by a majority vote of the full Legislature, with includes the 500 elected members of the House of Representatives and 250 military-appointed senators.) The election commission released partial results on Thursday, but only for 350 of the 500 seats contested; the remaining 150 are to be allocated according to a complicated formula based on each party’s showing overall. No final, complete results are expected until after King Vajiralongkorn’s coronation in early May. More legal challenges could soon engulf the pro-democracy parties. The police have accused Mr. Thanathorn, and two of his colleagues at Future Forward, of “spreading false information online” — a charge that carries a sentence of up to five years in prison. A lawsuit could endanger his entire party. But whatever happens next to Future Forward, its showing in this week’s election was remarkable. And that performance has laid bare yet another fracture in an already very divided political scene: a major generation gap. Any attempt by the establishment to suppress the youthful idealism of Thailand’s new voters could be a dangerous miscalculation.

2019,‘We Are Not Going Anywhere’: Progressive Methodists Vow to Fight Ban on Gay Clergy,"WASHINGTON — Chet Jechura was 12 years old when he first felt called to preach, but for years he put off ordination. He knew himself, and he knew the official rules of the United Methodist Church: Homosexuality was “incompatible with Christian teaching.” And so he left the denomination. Then four years ago, he discovered Foundry United Methodist, a church that has carved a different path. He could sing the hymns of his childhood, be fully supported as a gay man, and finally become a candidate for ordination. This week, a decision at a global conference for Methodists threatened to upend a lifetime of dreams, with the church voting to strengthen its ban on same-sex marriage and gay and lesbian clergy. At an impromptu prayer service on Wednesday, as Mr. Jechura helped serve communion, he broke out in sobs, his body convulsing, barely able to stand. The emptiness grew louder with every wail. Friends held him up, wrapping him in their arms. For several minutes, they stood there as he wept at the altar, draped in a rainbow stole. Across the country, progressive United Methodists are reeling from Tuesday night’s vote. As their conservative brethren celebrate, churches like Foundry are faced with difficult decisions. Next month, they may learn if they will be able to keep their property and assets, and if their gay and lesbian colleagues will be tossed out. Pastors and lay people are already debating if they should start a new denomination — or if, in a move perhaps more threatening to those who voted them out, they should refuse to leave. Nationwide, these high stakes are playing out in the blur of grief. The day after the vote, Foundry felt like it was in mourning. An assistant pastor made almost 50 calls to counsel and comfort parishioners. Neighbors from the Jewish Community Center came by with a box of tarts for the office, remembering how the pastors had brought them ice cream the day of the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting. “I was numb,” said the Rev. Ginger Gaines-Cirelli, Foundry’s pastor, her voice raw as she described the moments after the vote. Yet in the swirl of confusion, Foundry is also resolute. A schism may be on the horizon, but it has not happened yet, leaders point out. The new rules do not go into effect until January, and the Methodist judiciary must decide if parts of the new rule are constitutional. Shortly after the vote, Ms. Gaines-Cirelli joined a conference call with like-minded church leaders to start to plan their next steps. “We are not going anywhere,” she said in an interview. “If someone wants to come for me, for us, then bring it.” For decades, the stone church on 16th Street, a few blocks north of the White House, has been one of the most prominent religious institutions in Washington. The Clinton family called it home for years. It has also made religious rights for L.G.B.T. people core to its ministry. Foundry’s pastors have married same-sex couples and hired gay clergy. One retired minister surrendered his credentials in protest when a lesbian member’s ordination was blocked. Foundry was one of the first large churches to join a Methodist network that supports L.G.B.T. people, 30 years ago. Today, the church has more than 1,000 members, with most of its new growth coming from young people. Foundry may be at the vanguard, but it is among hundreds of Methodist churches that have believed that one day, their religious views about sexuality would prevail. Nearly two-thirds of American Methodists say homosexuality should be accepted. And United Methodist bishops had supported a plan at the conference that would have embraced L.G.B.T. clergy. For months, Foundry prepared for the looming vote. Last summer, the church dedicated a special altar in the narthex for people to pray. Progressive Methodist coalitions from around the country met at Foundry to organize in the fall. At the conference, on the floor of a former football stadium in St. Louis, Ms. Gaines-Cirelli juggled seven WhatsApp chat groups to coordinate strategy with advocates. Above in the stands, more than 35 Foundry members stood each day, singing hymns and holding strands of Tibetan-style, handmade rainbow prayer flags. But conservatives in the United States and Africa were equally fervent, arguing that a change in the teaching would oppose historical church teaching. They had spent decades preparing for this moment, and many of the conservative churches were far larger, and with far more financial means. “The debate cannot continue forever,” one of the main conservative groups, the Wesleyan Covenant Association, said in a statement after the vote. “We recognize irreconcilable differences exist.” After the vote, one of Foundry’s assistant pastors, the Rev. Will Ed Green, 31, slept for just an hour and half. He remembered being 6 in Hope, Ark., when he had watched his pastor break the bread for communion, and had told his mother, “I want to feed people like that.” But he was outed when he sought ordination, so he moved to Illinois, where bishops were more willing to receive queer candidates. Later, he was hired by Foundry. “You have people for whom the Methodist Church has become everything,” Mr. Green said. They say, “this church saved my life,” he said, “this church is where I found Jesus.” At the prayer service on Wednesday, as worshipers walked in from the night, Mr. Jechura urged them, “Be not afraid.” Together they read Scripture: The Lord will deliver you from the snare of the fowler. At the front of the sanctuary hung a tall orange banner that read, “Sacred Resistance.” April Young, 34, a lifelong United Methodist from a more conservative congregation in Texas, joined Foundry just two weeks ago. She twisted the ring on her finger as she sat in her pew, struggling to describe why she came to pray. “I just thought, if there is anything I can do, listen, anything … ” Her voice trailed off. “My church is really hurting.” Across the aisle sat Lenny Wrigley, 30, who grew up as a United Methodist but now goes to a Baptist church in Virginia. He will soon go to seminary to become a military chaplain, but has decided not to pursue Methodist ordination because he is openly gay. “This is not a time to be excluding people,” he said. “This church is seeing a decline.” Despite the risk, Mr. Jechura remains committed. In two years, he will graduate from seminary. “I am not going to allow the church to stand in the way of God’s call on my life,” he said. “I can do nothing else.”",The New York Times
2019,The 1969 Mets Now: ‘We Are a Band of Brothers’,"Ask Rod Gaspar what moment he remembers most from the Mets’ 1969 season, and the backup outfielder with the powerful arm points to a head-spinning game in San Francisco at the end of August. And why not? It was a game in which he and Donn Clendenon combined to throw out three Giants runners at third base and home plate in the eighth and ninth innings before the Mets won it in the 10th. Or, as Gaspar put it: “Typical Mets.” Ask Ron Swoboda the same question and he graciously overlooks his famous catch in the World Series and instead cites a September game against the Chicago Cubs, with first place on the line. In the bottom of the first inning, the Cubs knocked down the Mets’ invaluable leadoff hitter, Tommie Agee. Swoboda takes it from there: “In the top of the second, Jerry Koosman throws a rocket right at Ron Santo’s coconut and he put an arm up. You want to play this game? I don’t think so. He hit Santo in the arm. Koosman was a warrior, he was an assassin. They threw at Agee, that’s all Koosman needed. “After they knocked down Agee, I remember Tom Seaver yelling in the dugout, ‘You don’t want to do that.’ Koosman took care of the rest.” Ask Koosman who or what stands out most 50 years later and he is quick to cite Gil Hodges, the manager behind the Mets’ miracle. “Gil was the man — there was a lot of quiet management that went on,” he said. “Gil talked a little bit in code, but you knew what he meant. You knew where he stood and what he expected of you. And it worked great. We won, didn’t we? At 100-to-1 odds in Vegas before the season, and we end up winning.” Ed Kranepool, who played 18 seasons for the Mets, remembers what it was like to be a platoon player in the World Series. In the five games it took for the Mets to upend the favored Baltimore Orioles, Kranepool and three other left-handed hitters — Art Shamsky, Ken Boswell and Wayne Garrett — were in the starting lineup just once, for Game 3. “Did the left-handers want to play in the World Series?” he said. “Yeah, but you had to respect Gil and what he was doing. We did get to face Jim Palmer in Game 3 and we knocked him out. The next day, we sat down again. So we sat there, but we were winning.” Jim McAndrew, who was in the back end of the 1969 starting rotation, was on the postseason roster and didn’t get to play a single moment. But he almost did. “I was scared to death because Seaver gave up that leadoff homer in the first inning of the World Series, and Hodges immediately had me up in the bullpen,” he said. Still, he didn’t get into that game or any other in the Series. “But you can’t gripe,” he said. McAndrew, Gaspar, Swoboda, Koosman and Kranepool spoke to The New York Times early this month in connection with the 50th anniversary of one of the most remarkable moments in baseball history — the sudden ascent of the Mets to a championship after the team’s previous life as a laughingstock. The five spoke with pride of what they accomplished, but with some sadness, too. Fifty years is a long time, and a half-dozen players from that team have died. Others have serious medical issues. It is a somber scorecard that also includes Hodges, who died of a heart attack before the 1972 season, and the death of three of his four coaches. And Seaver, 74, the best player on that 1969 team, has advancing dementia. The disclosure of Seaver’s condition was made shortly after the former Mets had spoken with The Times. But they were all aware that Seaver had been struggling with the effects of Lyme disease for years. More than anything, they were aware of how relentless time is. “Casey was right when he said you get old very quick,” said Kranepool, referring to Casey Stengel, who was the Mets’ manager when Kranepool joined the team as a teenager. Now Kranepool is 74 and in need of a kidney transplant, although he remains intent on being part of the 1969 reunion the Mets will stage at Citi Field in June. “It’s frustrating,” he said. “You would like to see everybody, but it doesn’t work that way. I don’t think I’m going to be around for the 100th, so I’m glad we’re doing this.” Swoboda, who is also 74, said: “I don’t know where the 50 years went, but we are a band of brothers. Very few of us were involved in anything else of that magnitude.” “It’s no fun seeing our guys go down,” said Gaspar, who is 72. “I hope we can have 15 of us at the reunion.” Koosman said he planned to be there. He is 76, the oldest of the five, but still doing back-and-forth bantering with Swoboda. Except now it’s via email instead of in the clubhouse. And what do they jab each other about? “Politics,” said Koosman. Swoboda, he said, is too liberal. “Tell him to get a life,” he said, joking. “Tell him to quit watching MSNBC and reading The New York Times. Tell him to read the sports section and stop there.” Told what Koosman had said about him, Swoboda laughed. ‘I love the guy,” he said, “but he sends me all this stuff from the blogosphere.’’ McAndrew, amused by all of this, was willing to volunteer that he views himself as “socially compassionate, fiscally responsible.” Swoboda, he added, “is a non-backing-off lefty.” A lefty who, in 1969, played right field, and not always that well. Hodges would take him out of games for defensive purposes and insert Gaspar, “which drove me crazy,” Swoboda said. “I wanted to be good enough for Hodges not to have to do that,’’ he added. “And eventually, I was. Eventually, he left me alone.” Right through the top of the ninth inning of Game 4 of the Series, when Swoboda’s do-or-die catch of Brooks Robinson’s line drive kept the Orioles from taking control of the game. “Clendenon,” Swoboda noted sardonically, “called it the stupidest catch he ever saw because I went for it.” Clendenon. Alert, tough, college-educated. A veteran voice in the clubhouse. And a central figure in that wild August game in San Francisco that Gaspar so vividly remembers. Here’s how he tells it: “It’s the bottom of the ninth, tie score, one out, Bob Burda is on first, Willie McCovey is up and we have the McCovey shift on. Everyone is pulled over to the right. I’m playing left, but I’m almost in center. Tug McGraw is pitching and McCovey sticks out his bat and hits a high, nine-iron shot down the left-field line. I chase after the ball, pick it up and throw blindly toward home plate. “I knew it was the game right there. I figured Burda was going to score easy. But you know what? I threw a rocket to Jerry Grote, all the way in the air, and Burda was out by 15 feet. And Grote was so stunned he rolled the ball back to the mound even though there only two outs. And McCovey, who had reached second, sees this and takes off for third. And Clendenon, who was always paying attention, picks the ball up and throws to third. Double play. “The next inning, Clendenon hits a home run and we win the game.” McAndrew said: “Clendenon could strap you on his back and get those big hits to drive in runs for a week or 10 days. All the low-scoring games, we won them.” And all the crazy games — the Mets won them, too. Some mystical combination of talent, toughness, luck and magic conquered everything in its path. For one season. “The next year,” Swoboda said, “we tried to make it happen, rather than let it happen. Something was missing. All it does is add more mystery to 1969 in my book.” A magical, mystical mystery, actually. One that, 50 years later, still endures.",The New York Times
2019,"‘We Have to Get this Right.’ A Conversation With U.S.C.’s Incoming President, Carol Folt.","California Today Good morning. (Here’s the sign-up, if you don’t already get California Today by email.) Yesterday, in the midst of the fallout from the latest in a line of recent scandals to roil the University of Southern California, its leaders introduced a new president. Carol Folt, who most recently served as the chancellor of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, will take the helm on July 1, becoming the first woman to permanently be U.S.C.’s president; she follows Wanda Austin, who served in an interim capacity. Ms. Folt is a native of Akron, Ohio, but she first came to California for college, where she went to Santa Barbara City College and then transferred to U.C. Santa Barbara. Later, she earned her doctorate at U.C. Davis. Her first jobs as a professor and university administrator were at Dartmouth. But her time at U.N.C. has drawn the most attention until now. During her tenure there, Ms. Folt grappled with two controversies that drew national scrutiny: an academic scandal involving student-athletes, and the fate of the Confederate monument known as “Silent Sam.” (The athletics controversy began before Ms. Folt’s stint as chancellor, but the university faced the fallout while she was in office.) The monument provoked years of acrimony at U.N.C., where protesters toppled part of it last August. She later announced her resignation — and the removal of the monument’s remnants. I talked to Ms. Folt yesterday about what she had learned from those past experiences and how she planned to rebuild trust in a troubled institution. Our interview has been edited and condensed for length. How does it feel to be coming back to California? My husband and I came and we went up to Griffith Park, and you’re having this phenomenal flower bloom in California that I have taught about in the past, so getting to go up there, looking out over the whole area, seeing some of these blooms and some of the greenest foothills I have ever seen. We went, O.K., it’s great to feel at home. You’re coming in on the heels of the admissions scandal and a series of other challenges. Do you think U.S.C. has a systemic corruption problem and if so, how would you address that? When I look at U.S.C. I see so much that is opportunity. I see the $320 million in grants-in-aid, one of the largest financial aid pools in the country. I see incredible faculty, with Nobel laureates and Genius awards, making discoveries that are changing health care, and I see a student body that is outstanding. I look at that and I’m thinking we are a large, complex organization and we have challenges. Every campus president has to handle tough issues because every university has them. I look at it in that context and I say, O.K., we have to get this right. Now what has really been encouraging to me is there hasn’t been a person I have met who has not said we have the ambition to get this right. You can have all the great things in the world, but if you’re not ready to face change and make changes that are necessary, you won’t succeed. Are there any specific transparency changes that you’ll make right off the bat? I’m a scientist and a researcher so I’m going to do what I have always done: I’m going to gather the facts. So it can’t be any faster than it takes to make thoughtful decisions. I did learn at U.N.C. that when people came together to make reforms, they have such a stronger likelihood of being successful. There is nothing more compelling to people than being part of a solution exercise that really works. You do that once, it’s easier to do that a second time and a third time. What would you say to any student — and I’m thinking particularly of students from less represented groups on campus — what would you say to reassure them that the admissions process is fair? I think what we have to say is we’re doing everything we can to make sure that process is really fair. We’ve been raising as much funding as we can to make sure we can become affordable. The diversity of the undergraduate body is fantastic — that includes first-generation, Pell Grant, students that are veterans — and we want to see that even grow. Having come from a community college in California and transferring to a university, I am so excited about the capacity of this university to bring students to transfer in is so strong and I want to make sure every one of those transfer students has the exact same opportunity as every other student. These are some things that we want to do and I would love to go and talk to students about it. Every student should be reassured that a degree from U.S.C. remains extremely valuable and is very positively viewed in the world. But that doesn’t mean that we are where we want to be and we can’t make changes. (We often link to sites that limit access for nonsubscribers.

2019,‘We Know Them. We Trust Them.’ Uber and Airbnb Alumni Fuel Tech’s Next Wave.,"SAN FRANCISCO — Riley Newman, a former head of data science at Airbnb, set out in mid-2017 to raise a venture capital fund that would invest in a multitude of tech trends. But he quickly realized that potential investors were not interested in that kind of fund. Instead, all they wanted to hear about were his former Airbnb colleagues and whether they might start their own companies. “It was, ‘Yeah, all that stuff is fine, but Airbnb, right?’” Mr. Newman, 36, said. “Airbnb was where we had a competitive edge on the market.” So Mr. Newman and his partners at Wave Capital adjusted their pitch: They said they were creating a fund to invest specifically in Airbnb employees who were planning to leave the company to become entrepreneurs. It worked. He and his partners quickly secured $55 million and now are preparing to make a flood of investments after the $31 billion home rental start-up goes public sometime in the next year and employees cash out their shares. “We know they are planning to start companies,” Mr. Newman said of Airbnb employees, adding that in the last week alone he had heard from four who left to pursue their entrepreneurial dreams. Everyone else in Silicon Valley seems to know it, too. As Lyft, Pinterest, Postmates, Slack and Uber — among some of this decade’s most prominent start-ups — get ready to list on the stock market, investors are preparing to write checks to a new generation of companies created by their workers. It’s part of Silicon Valley’s often-incestuous circle of life. The start-up world projects a meritocratic image, but in reality, it is a small, tightknit club where success typically hinges on whom you know. In this model, employees of tech start-ups frequently leave the companies once they have been enriched by their firms’ initial public offerings. Then networks of alumni from these companies — called mafias — support their peers’ new businesses with hiring, advice and money. The cycle goes back to at least the 1950s, when Fairchild Semiconductor, one of Silicon Valley’s earliest successes, was started by a group of disgruntled Shockley Semiconductor employees called the Traitorous Eight. Decades later, early employees of PayPal, known as the PayPal Mafia, are more famous for their successes after leaving the company — many of which they collaborated on with one another — than for their initial breakthrough in digital payments. The group includes Elon Musk and Peter Thiel, as well as the creators of YouTube, Yelp and LinkedIn. Silicon Valley is now anticipating new mafias connected to Uber, Airbnb and their brethren after the companies go public. “It’s going to trigger a massive explosion in entrepreneurship,” said Howard Lindzon, an entrepreneur in Phoenix who invests in five to 10 venture capital funds a year. He said he particularly wanted to put money into funds with connections to the Uber and Airbnb networks. Venture capital firms are already hiring former employees from Uber and other I.P.O.-ready companies to get a foothold in their networks. Some of the fiercest recruiting has been of Uber executives, with venture firms including Sequoia Capital, GV, Javelin Venture Partners and Redpoint Ventures all adding former employees from the ride-hailing firm to their ranks. One recruit was Andrew Chen, who worked at Uber as head of rider growth and left the company last year. He has since joined the venture firm Andreessen Horowitz as a general partner and hosts quarterly dinners for Uber alumni turned founders. Mr. Chen, 36, estimates that two dozen venture-backed start-ups have come out of Uber so far. Andreessen Horowitz has recently invested in two, which have not been announced. “Those are the prime start-up investing opportunities,” Mr. Chen said. The problem is that venture firms might create a brain drain from the likes of Airbnb and Uber if they keep luring the companies’ workers to start new companies. Talent, after all, is a precious commodity in Silicon Valley. Jonathan Golden, who worked as a director of product at Airbnb and who joined the venture firm NEA last year, said Airbnb was fine with his plans to invest in former employees. He said he had discussed his intentions with Airbnb’s chief executive, Brian Chesky, before he left the company in 2017. “I’m not actively trying to have people leave Airbnb,” Mr. Golden said. “But if someone is going to leave, I want to be supportive of them, and Brian is supportive of them as well.” Nick Papas, an Airbnb spokesman, said, “We’re always sad when talented people move on, but it’s been great to watch so many of our former colleagues succeed.” Uber declined to comment. In February, Annie Kadavy, a former Uber executive who is now a venture capitalist at Redpoint, announced an investment in Ike, a self-driving truck company created by — who else? — ex-Uber employees. Ms. Kadavy, 33, who left Uber last year, said her network of former ride-hailing colleagues would help her find and vet deals. In addition, it would help find talent to bring to other start-ups that Redpoint has invested in. “If you’re a person leaving a company, who are you going to ask about what company to join next?” she said. “Your friend who works at a venture firm, because their job is to have a point of view on a bunch of different businesses.” In February 2018, Dan Hill and Michelle Rittenhouse, longtime Airbnb employees, felt the entrepreneurial itch and quit. They had a general idea to start a company that would make it easier for people to donate to charity, but not much else. The details didn’t matter to Wave Capital, which wanted to invest in them. “These are people we know can build great products,” said Mr. Newman. “They know us, they trust us. We know them, we trust them.” Within a few weeks of leaving Airbnb, Mr. Hill and Ms. Rittenhouse had secured $2 million — including from Wave Capital — for Alma, their newly formed company focused on philanthropy. Entrepreneurs typically make dozens of pitches over several months to raise financing. But Mr. Hill said the relatively quick fund-raising for his start-up was not a surprise. “We already had a strong relationship,” he said. “So when we pitched the idea for Alma and our initial plans, it was an easier conversation.” It’s a common story among former employees of hot start-ups. Andrew Chapin, who previously worked at Uber, also said it wasn’t hard to round up $3.75 million last October for Basis, his new mental health start-up, thanks to his reputation among the Uber crowd. “When you look at V.C., there is a lot of pattern matching and trying to act on that, so if you worked at Uber, you must be O.K.,” Mr. Chapin, 31, said. “I didn’t have to do a lot of pitching.” It helps that many of his former colleagues are now millionaires, having cashed out their shares in private stock sales. A syndicate of several hundred former Uber employees are even investing in start-ups together. Josh Mohrer and William Barnes, early Uber employees who left in 2017, said they used a private email list to manage the syndicate’s deal selection, adding a few new people to the list each week as they “graduate” from the company. The group has backed around a dozen start-ups at a pace of around one a month, they said. To stay on top of all the new companies emerging from Uber, Mr. Mohrer and Mr. Barnes said, they have organized reunions of former employees in cities around the world, using a Facebook group with more than 1,000 members. The pair also plan to raise an investment fund dedicated to backing Uber alumni under the banner of Moving Capital, according to three people familiar with the project, who asked to remain anonymous because the details are private. How will Silicon Valley’s new mafias be different from those in the past? The Uber and Airbnb networks are part of a generation that pioneered the on-demand “gig economy” and everything that came with it. That means many fought real-world policy issues in cities, as opposed to primarily dealing with the digital world. “There are just not that many places to find people who have seen that kind of scale,” said Ryan Graves, Uber’s former senior vice president of global operations and a member of the company’s board. Each city that Uber, Airbnb, Lyft or Postmates expanded into created a new set of operational, regulatory and business challenges. Regulators balked. Rival business operators resisted. Neighbors protested. And people abused the platforms, over and over. Uber managers ran each city like a mini-start-up. “If you were the general manager of San Francisco or of Atlanta, you were the C.E.O. of your region,” Mr. Chen said. “It led to a really entrepreneurial approach from everyone.” The thorniest challenge for Uber alumni may be showing that they have learned from the company’s ugly 2017, when its toxic culture of harassment, discrimination and ethical lapses was exposed. Blaine Light, a former Uber employee, said he had taken the importance of creating an inclusive culture to heart. Half of the employees at Qwick, a 20-person start-up in Phoenix that he joined as a co-founder in 2018, are women, and the staff includes a mix of races, backgrounds and sexual orientations. Mr. Light said he emphasized a culture of humility. “Uber people, in general, are looking to take what we’ve learned and make something better this time,” he said.

2019,‘We Will Always Live in Fear’: What Life Is Like for Civilians in Kashmir,"KAMALKOTE, Kashmir — On Friday morning, Mohammed Reyaz Khan, a farmer in the disputed region of Kashmir, crawled out of a bunker in his village and went to check on his sheep. As he was walking, a mortar shell exploded nearby and a chunk of shrapnel ripped through his leg. Scrambling to get him help, his family ran down a hillside carrying him on their shoulders, his lower body soaked in blood, a piece of white bone poking out. “Our lives depend on the mood of the soldiers,” said his cousin Muneer Ahmad Khan. “We will always live in fear.” In the decades-old enmity between India and Pakistan, one place almost always suffers: Kashmir, the beautiful but cursed Himalayan valley that both nations claim. It happened again this week, as tensions between the countries exploded. Warplanes screeched across the sky dropping bombs, and thousands of soldiers mobilized in Kashmir, bringing the two countries to red alert. [For more coverage of the experiences and costs of war, sign up for the weekly At War newsletter.] Things were calmer on Friday, despite the shelling at the border and the suffering of people like Mr. Khan. Pakistan released a fighter pilot it had shot down and captured, in the part of Kashmir that Pakistan controls. Pakistan’s prime minister, Imran Khan, called the pilot’s release a good-will gesture, and with the United States, China, Russia and many other countries urging both sides to de-escalate the crisis, India — though somewhat humiliated — seemed willing to pause. Pakistani officials brought the pilot, Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman, to the Wagah border crossing in northwestern India, where hundreds of people had gathered to receive him. Wagah had turned into a blur of orange, green and white Indian flags, and many people wore patriotic gear. One man’s baseball cap read in large block letters: “I LOVE MY INDIA.” A simple guide to the roots of the conflict and what could happen next. Strong jingoistic currents have swept across India since Tuesday, when the air force sent warplanes into Pakistan to bomb what the Indian government said was a terrorist training camp. India has long accused Pakistan of supporting Kashmiri separatist groups, and the airstrike was in response to a Kashmiri suicide bomber’s attack on an Indian military convoy, which killed more than 40 troops. It was the most devastating attack in Kashmir in decades. Pakistan, which denies any connection to the Kashmiri militants, struck back on Wednesday, downing the Indian fighter jet. Both countries have nuclear arms, and the spiraling crisis put the entire region on edge. But by Friday, Western diplomats in New Delhi, who have been holding countless meetings and working to defuse tensions, seemed much more relaxed. Their hopeful refrain was: The worst is over. Several diplomats said that India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, would look like the aggressor at this point if India staged more strikes, and that Mr. Khan had no incentive to push things further. Mr. Khan’s priority has been to revive Pakistan’s listing economy, and so far he seemed to have won this case in the court of world opinion. His forces had captured an Indian fighter pilot, the pride of India’s military. And his calls for restraint and peace, even if driven by self-interest, seemed to play well around the world, even in India. “Whatever Pakistan’s role has been in the Kashmir conflict, Imran Khan, the prime minister of Pakistan, has acted with dignity and rectitude,” the leftist Indian author Arundhati Roy wrote in an opinion piece published in HuffPost. As for Mr. Modi, she called his actions “unforgivable,” alluding to the always-present possibility of a nuclear conflict between the states. “He has jeopardized the lives of more than a billion people and brought the war in Kashmir to the doorsteps of ordinary Indians,” Ms. Roy wrote. Many Indians, though, are sticking by Mr. Modi. In recent days, several Indians said in interviews that they believed his government’s claims that the initial strike on Tuesday had been a success, and that Indian forces had vanquished hundreds of dangerous terrorists. So far, India has offered no proof of that. Instead, reports from the rural area in Pakistan where the bombs fell cast doubt on the Indian claims. Witnesses said that the bombs fell in a mostly empty forest and that the only person hurt was a 62-year-old villager who suffered a small cut above his eye. “What terrorists can you see here?” he asked, according to Reuters. In Kashmir, people don’t know what to believe. Every evening, those who live along the disputed border, known as the Line of Control, cram into small, cavelike bunkers, overwhelmed by the bitter winter chill and the very real possibility of sudden death. In the morning, they crawl out to gauge the destruction caused by the machine guns and artillery that are fired regularly during the night. Even before this crisis, Pakistani and Indian troops constantly shelled each other across the Line of Control. There are tens of thousands of troops dug in, facing each other. The rationale almost always given is that the other side started it. Many times the artillery or mortar shells sail over the soldiers and land in villages, maiming or killing civilians. Still, for centuries, Kashmir has been renowned for its beauty. It stretches between high white Himalayan peaks, and in the summer, the meadows are carpeted with wildflowers. In the winter, there is excellent skiing. But Kashmir is a depressed place, with little development, few good jobs and a sense of hopelessness. It has been down for decades, ever since its people began chafing for independence. Most of the area is controlled by India, a smaller slice by Pakistan, and a small but dogged insurgency has been fighting against Indian rule. Religion partly fuels the divide: Kashmir is predominantly Muslim, like Pakistan; India is overwhelmingly Hindu. Western officials say that Pakistani intelligence services used to work closely with the Kashmiri militants, and that several of the armed groups still receive money, weapons and expertise from across the border in Pakistan. Life on the India side is often disrupted by militant attacks, street protests or government crackdowns. Soldiers are everywhere: on the roads, in the apple orchards, standing with their guns behind giant coils of barbed wire. Schools shut down frequently. So do stores, roads and the cellphone network. Some young Kashmiris call their homeland “the world’s most beautiful prison.” The Kashmiris who get out are often discriminated against. After the Indian convoy was hit in mid-February, hundreds of Kashmiri college students at universities in India were chased off their campuses. Many were terrified; some were beaten up. Even in New Delhi, the capital, where many people from different parts of India live, some Kashmiris were thrown out by their landlords for one reason: They were Kashmiri. “Whenever India and Pakistan fight, we are the first ones to suffer,” said Mr. Khan, the cousin of the wounded farmer. Aijaz Ashraf Wani, a professor of political science at Kashmir University, said Kashmir had become the major source of tension between India and Pakistan. “We are the grass that suffers in the fight between two elephants,” Mr. Wani said. “But,” he added, “we are also the biggest reason these two elephants are fighting.”",The New York Times
2019,"‘We’d Had a Few Drinks,’ Australian Party Official Says About Gun Lobby Tape","It was the liquor talking, apparently. Two officials from an anti-immigrant political party in Australia said on Tuesday that an undercover recording of them explaining the political influence that money from the American gun lobby could potentially buy was not what it seemed. Their comments, they said, were just small talk made over rounds of scotch. In the recording, James Ashby, the chief of staff for Pauline Hanson, leader of the One Nation party, is heard to say that his right-wing party could “own” the Australian Senate and House of Representatives with a $20 million donation from the American gun lobby. The recording — by a reporter for Al Jazeera — was made in the United States during a trip last year, just weeks before an Australian law banning foreign political donations took effect. The recording was revealed on Monday in the first part of a two-part Al Jazeera documentary, “How to Sell a Massacre,” for which the Australian reporter Rodger Muller posed for years as a gun-rights advocate. Through the guise of a fake organization called Gun Rights Australia, Mr. Muller introduced Mr. Ashby and Steve Dickson, the One Nation party’s Queensland leader, to representatives from the National Rifle Association and Koch Industries during a trip to the United States in September. On Tuesday, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Twitter that reports of One Nation officials soliciting donations from the American gun lobby “to influence our elections & undermine our gun laws that keep us safe are deeply concerning.” Mr. Morrison, the leader of Australia’s Liberal Party, also accused One Nation of trying to “sell Australia’s gun laws to the highest bidders,” and said the revelations were another reason Australians should not vote for the One Nation party in general elections expected in May. Bill Shorten, the leader of the opposition Labor Party, accused One Nation of a “betrayal of the Australian political system.” “The idea of One Nation political party operatives going to the United States, seeking millions of dollars, promising to water down gun law protection in Australia — that was absolutely horrifying,” Mr. Shorten said. But Mr. Ashby told reporters on Tuesday that the meetings with the N.R.A. had been about sourcing technology and gaining “an understanding of how they operate.” He said they were never about requesting $20 million, and that he and Mr. Dickson had traveled to the United States on a fact-finding mission. “The conversations that have been recorded where there is talk of $10 and $20 million dollars — I’ll be the first to admit, we’d arrived in America, we’d got on the sauce, we’d had a few drinks,” Mr. Ashby said. “And that’s where those discussions took place,” he continued. “Not with any potential donors. No one but Rodger Muller, Steve Dickson and myself.” Many Americans can buy a gun in less than an hour. In some countries, the process can take weeks or months. Mr. Dickson said that Mr. Muller, the journalist, had “seemed to be a very reasonable guy” — an impression he said was bolstered by Mr. Muller’s Akubra bush hat, akin to an American cowboy hat. He said the conversation was merely a product of “having scotches for three or four hours.” “I never, ever, suspected in my wildest dreams that that guy was employed by a Middle Eastern country, by Al Jazeera, as an Australian spy to interfere in Australian politics,” Mr. Dickson said. Al Jazeera, a satellite network based in Qatar and owned by that country’s government, said in a report on Tuesday that the documentary “provides a rare inside view of how the N.R.A. deliberates over mass shootings and seeks to manipulate media coverage to push its pro-gun agenda.” In an email, Jennifer Baker, the director of public affairs for the N.R.A., called Al Jazeera a “state-owned anti-gun” network and said, “At no time did the N.R.A. contribute funding to any Australian political party or Gun Rights Australia.” The Australian government introduced some of the world’s toughest gun laws in 1996, after a gunman with a semiautomatic rifle killed 35 people in the town of Port Arthur. The rate of intentional gun deaths in Australia had fallen about 33 percent from 1986 to 1996, the year of the Port Arthur massacre. But the decline accelerated after the new gun control measures were enacted, with the rate dropping about 60 percent from 1996 to 2006. President Barack Obama later cited the laws as a potential model for the United States. One Nation’s website says that the focus of its firearms policy is to “move away from trying to criminalize firearms ownership to punishing criminals for the use of firearms to commit crimes.” Among other measures, the party’s platform calls for reducing waiting periods for handgun purchases. In response to the new documentary, One Nation said in a statement that its members always complied with the law. It also called Al Jazeera “a state owned propaganda arm of the Qatari government that supports Islamic extremist groups and are not a legitimate media organization.” In 2017, Ms. Hanson, the party’s leader, sparked controversy by walking into the Australian Senate wearing a burqa as a way of drawing attention to her party’s push to ban full-face coverings in public. The move drew strong criticism from other senators.",The New York Times
2019,"‘We’re in the Last Hour’: Democracy Itself Is on Trial in Brexit, Britons Say","LONDON — This week, as two members of Parliament interrupted a debate on Brexit to rib each other about the elite boarding schools they attended four decades ago, 23-year-old Eve Alcock looked on with deep disgust. The whole world of Britain’s Parliament — its effete codes of conduct, its arcane and stilted language, its reunions of Oxbridge school chums — seemed impossibly remote from the real, unfolding national crisis of Brexit, the process of extricating the country from the European Union. “We’re in the middle of a national emergency, and you have schoolboys squabbling about who went to the best school in the House of Commons,” she said. “It’s almost as if they are operating in this complete alternate reality.” Over the past weeks, as factions within the British government have grappled for control over the country’s exit from the bloc, the mood among voters has become dark. Those Britons who wished to remain are reminded, daily, that a risky and momentous national change is being initiated against their will and judgment. More striking is the deep cynicism among those who voted to leave, the group that Prime Minister Theresa May is trying to satisfy. They are now equally bitter and disillusioned, as the government’s paralysis has called into question whether Britain will ever leave. Parliament’s rejection of Mrs. May’s withdrawal plan on Friday — for the third time — means the turbulence will continue. transcript In interviews, many Britons expressed despair over the inability of the political system to produce a compromise. No one feels that the government has represented their interests. No one is satisfied. No one is hopeful. It has amounted to a hollowing out of confidence in democracy itself. “I don’t think the central institutions of government have been discredited like this in the postwar period,” said William Davies, who teaches political economy at Goldsmiths, University of London. “There’s a fin-de-siècle sense that modern British politics has run out of road,” said Mr. Davies, author of “Nervous States: Democracy and the Decline of Reason.” “Maybe the best thing to come out of this is the recognition that the political elites — people just want them to get off the stage. I don’t know who they want to replace them. But there’s a sense that a reboot would be something people would be in favor of.” It was barely seven summers ago that Britain presented itself to the world as a confident, outward-looking, post-imperial country. The opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympics — featuring a flock of sheep, a snippet of the Sex Pistols’ music and a skit about a skydiving Queen Elizabeth — suggested a country unburdened by longing for its more orderly, homogeneous past. It’s hard to conceive of that now. The referendum question has divided Britain into warring tribes, unable to settle on any shared vision of the future. An ancient, robust democracy is groaning under the weight of conflicting demands — on the executive, to carry out the will of the people; and on the members of Parliament, to follow their conscience and to act in what they believe to be the people’s interest. In such a situation, the country might have united in its resentment of the European Union, which had vowed to make Britain’s withdrawal painful. But that has not happened. Britons are blaming their own leaders. “I think people have totally lost confidence in democracy, in British democracy and the way it’s run,” said Tommy Turner, 32, a firefighter. He was perched on a stool at the Hare & Hounds, a working-class pub in Surrey, where nearly everyone voted to leave the European Union. Among his friends, he said, he sensed a profound sense of betrayal that Britain was not exiting on March 29, as promised. “You’ve got egotistical people in politics, and they want to follow their own agenda,” he said. “They don’t want to follow what the people have voted for.” Asked how he felt about the approaching Brexit deadline, Mr. Turner said, “worried.” “We’re in the last hour,” he said. “I’m wondering: What does more damage? Leaving without a deal? Or the total annihilation of faith in democracy?” Polling has borne out his worry. Britons’ assessment of their leaders is scathing, with 81 percent saying that Britain has handled Brexit badly, and 7 percent saying it has handled it well, according to data released recently by NatCen Social Research, an independent agency. (Two years ago, the numbers were 41 percent negative and 29 percent positive.) Particularly drastic, researchers said, is the souring of Leave voters in the past six months, as Mrs. May concluded her negotiations on the withdrawal agreement and shared the terms of departure with the country. Expectations that Brexit would have concrete effects — by lifting the economy or slowing immigration — have diminished sharply, the data show. Neil Bligh, 45, who sat by Mr. Turner at the Hare & Hounds, could dimly recall the buzz of triumph he felt in 2016, when he discovered that his side had won. But that feeling has long since dissipated, replaced by a gathering sense of gloom and mistrust as the promised reward of a free-trading Britain recedes further and further. “Now, it’s like an ache,” he said. “That’s the best way to describe Brexit, as the remnant of a hangover. It’s just always there. A lot of people, if they could go back and make it all not happen, they would.” The bartender, Chauntelle Hartley, known by her clientele as “Squid,” said the process was so maddening that she could no longer focus on it for long periods. “It was on the telly earlier, and I watched ‘Friends’ on my phone,” she said. “I want to listen to it; I realized that it was on. But I think I only made it 40 seconds.” Views on Brexit were almost diametrically opposed at The Highbury Barn, a pub in North London that offers haddock from the fishmonger across the street and provides pans of water for visiting dogs. In this neighborhood, Islington North, in the constituency of the opposition Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, the number of signatories on a petition asking the government to revoke Article 50, the part of the European Union treaty that lays out the terms of Britain’s exit, reached one-quarter of the population. But people here took an equally dismal view of the government’s performance. Aidan Hughes, 58, who works in finance, was waiting for a cab in the back of the bar. “What we’re seeing is that the process the government’s involved in has been effectively hijacked by an even smaller segment of the ruling government, the right-wing element of the party,” he said. He blamed the first-past-the-post voting system, which tends to increase polarization between two large parties and exaggerate geographical divides, setting up stark conflict between sections of society. He said it was time for Britain to move toward a system of proportional representation, common to democracies that evolved later than Britain’s, which allows smaller parties to enter Parliament more easily. “We would then have people with different views coming together to compromise, to find a way forward,” he said. “Whereas whoever wins an election now can currently push their views, irrespective of support.” Geoff Peddie, 46, a high-school English teacher, was waiting for a friend as the evening wore on and the pub quieted down. He was angry that such a slim majority had triggered a national act of this magnitude and permanence. “I don’t feel that I’ve been listened to, or that nearly half the population have been listened to,” he said. “The majority has essentially been pandering to the worst elements in our society.” A sense of impotence and paralysis now colors Britain’s image abroad. This was given visual form recently when a Bulgarian diplomat posted a photo on Twitter of senior European officials in a cluster as they conferred in a corridor. No Briton was present. “Britain is forced out of the room while other countries make decisions about its future,” said Mark Leonard, director of the European Council on Foreign Relations, a research institute. As Mrs. May stalled for time, keeping her plans tightly hidden from the public, Brexit sucked so much oxygen from the government that it left no time for anything else. “There is a parochialization as Britain loses ambition in anything bigger than itself; it’s a shrinking of horizons and a self-obsession,” he said. He compared it to the Suez crisis, the Egyptian nationalist uprising that signaled the end of the British and French empires. “The thing has been humiliating; there is a sense of no one being in the cockpit,” Mr. Leonard added. “Britain was a different country after Suez, and that’s where we are now. I don’t think there is any way back if we go ahead with Brexit.” In a landscape of pervasive gloom, Mr. Hughes, the finance worker, did see one reason for hope: That Britons, young and old, were passionately engaged, as never before, in the inner workings of their own government. Even if it was because they were so angry. “This is starting to drag people into an interest in what’s actually happening,” he said. “Clearly it’s a total mess and it’s been handled appallingly by the government. Be that as it may, at least it’s gotten people animated in talking about these topics.”",The New York Times
2019,‘What Does It Take?’: Admissions Scandal Is a Harsh Lesson in Racial Disparities,"KANSAS CITY, Mo. — They studied into the wee hours and agonized line by line over their personal essays. They took standardized tests three, four, five times to increase their scores. And last fall, after years of preparation and anxiety, the students at Ewing Marion Kauffman School, a predominantly black school in Kansas City, submitted their college applications, hoping all their hard work would pay off. The students at Kauffman saw their charter school as something of an equalizer. The shiny, sprawling campus opened in 2011 on the city’s mostly black and economically disadvantaged East Side. Nine out of 10 students receive free or reduced lunch. But this week, the students there, and at high schools across the country, were reminded by the nation’s largest admissions scandal that there is nothing equal about the process. [Read more on the Justice Department’s largest ever college admissions prosecution.] Students at Kauffman had their sights set on some of the same schools that wealthy parents are accused of using bribes to get their children into. It’s what the students call a harsh lesson in the limits of meritocracy. “It’s frustrating that people are able to obtain their opportunities this way,” said Khiana Jackson, 17, a senior at Kauffman who has been accepted to the University of Chicago, but is waiting to hear from her top choices. “We can put in work from fifth grade to 12th grade, every single day, come in early, leave late, and it’s still not enough.” “What does it take? You work every day, they still find a way,” she said. The case underscored the racial and economic disparities that plague access to higher education. With an expansive network of pricey college preparation courses and counselors at their disposal, wealthy students find themselves with a leg up in the increasingly cutthroat competition for the limited slots at the most prestigious universities. [The college admissions scandal has raised a lot of questions. We’ve answered them here.] In an effort to diversify their student bodies, universities are recruiting students of different racial and economic backgrounds. But those opportunities can come with a backlash. For students of color who have found their qualifications questioned when they arrive at elite campuses, the case was dispiriting. “This scandal exposed the fact that there is a misplaced emphasis on so-called affirmative action inequities, rather than privilege,” said Mark Stucker, an educational consultant who hosts a weekly podcast called Your College-Bound Kid, which focuses on access and equity in education. “That is the big travesty of college admission. People of means are able to tilt the system in their favor,” he said. [Read more about how the authorities say the scheme worked, from bribes to doctored photos.] At Kauffman, all 39 of the seniors have already been accepted to college. But many are waiting to hear from their dream schools, and there’s a feeling that the deck may be stacked against them despite all their hard work. Ms. Jackson is still waiting to hear from her top choices, Princeton and Yale. If she does not make it to the Ivy League, it would be hard to say whether something like the admissions scandal played a role. But just knowing that “some people did get in based on how much money they could hand somebody, it’s not fair,” she said. On Wednesday, seniors at Kauffman discussed their experiences and the fallout of the scandal. The obstacles that they had to overcome were things that the children of the parents who bribed their way into schools could never imagine, they said. Da’Shona Martin, 18, has had to work at Panera Bread to help her family pay the bills. She sometimes has to leave school early to make it to work on the bus. And when she works, she often does not make it home until late at night, and may not get to bed until 3 a.m., she said. transcript That left little time for homework, said Ms. Martin, who planned to attend Clark Atlanta University. “Just knowing that due to circumstances outside of school, you do give your best in all that you can, but you also have to kind of balance being an adult,” Ms. Martin said. “To know that these parents are throwing money at all of these people and being like, ‘Can you do this for my child,’ it’s kind of discouraging. Some of us will probably have to work our whole lifetime to see money like this.” Jennifer McReynolds and her husband prepared their son, Leonard, a senior at a Massachusetts prep academy, for college. Their son applied to six universities, including Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania. He took the ACT six times to increase his score and spent last summer studying for the test. Ms. McReynolds and her husband, owners of a financial education company based in Atlanta, have drilled a message into their son: as an African-American student, you have to be better. [For more coverage of race, sign up here to have our Race/Related newsletter delivered weekly to your inbox.] “Over and over we have told him that to be positively recognized, you have to have an incredible work ethic and you have to be above reproach,” Ms. McReynolds said. “You often hear talk about pulling yourself up by your bootstraps and that college admission is based on merit. What this story tells me is that the playing field is not level based on race and wealth.” In some cases, parents have been put in jail for lying about their residency so that their children can get into high-performing schools. Getting into college is just one challenge for many students of color and their families. Paying for it is another. Kielan Watson, 17, who plans to attend Vanderbilt University, said his father told him at a young age that he would have to pay for college on his own. With that in the back of his mind, Mr. Watson said he has been seeking scholarships, which have application processes that are even more rigorous than college admissions, he said. Mr. Watson is a finalist for a Gates Scholarship, which would be a full ride, but applying for it has been demanding. “There’s been a lot of nights where I was up thinking, ‘Is this the best version of myself that I can put in here?’” he said. The fact that some students have to scrape by while the wealthy parents listed in the indictment threw around money to get their children access disturbed the students at Kauffman. “I was mad at the fact that parents spent millions of dollars to pay these counselors to falsify test reports and in the meanwhile, I know everyone in here is figuring out how to come up with hundreds of thousands of dollars to pay for the rest of our college education,” said Jacob Esquivel, 18, who plans to attend the University of Miami. But in a strange way, the advantages of wealth and privilege that some students may bring with them to college could make Ms. Jackson feel more confident when she arrives on a campus this fall, she said. “I’m not going to feel like I’m at a disadvantage compared to them because I know that I have character, I have values that they haven’t had to develop,” she said. “They’ve had things handed to them. Having things handed to you versus having to earn the things you have, they create two different characters.” OpinionRachel L. Harris and Lisa Tarchak",The New York Times
2019,‘What Is That?’ Seeing the City as Abstract Art,"Gretchen Grace’s street photographs reveal a maze of shape and color within the city’s orderly grid. The color red, Gretchen Grace said, is catnip for street photographers. “It’s just low-hanging fruit,” she said. “It’s like the default alert. It’s the strongest color, the one that gets your attention.” New York’s colors are like the city’s architecture: random, cacophonous, equal parts ego and vision, ornaments for a city that throbs in black and white. Amid the chromatic din, red makes a statement. “The afternoon light just makes it electric,” Ms. Grace said. “When you see something red, it’s hard to pass up.” Ms. Grace, 56, who lives in Brooklyn and works mostly in New York, calls these images street abstractions, a nod to her background in sculpture and design. They’re not photographs of things so much as photographs of light on things. Which means that even though they are immobile objects, the moment they capture is as fleeting as that of a sports photograph. Snap now and the light takes one form; wait a minute and the light is different. There’s that instant just before sundown when the light bathes everything like a “pink cloud,” she said. “It’s so fast, and you try to capture it and maybe you don’t. It’s so fast that it’s possible to think we didn’t really see that, or, How can that be real? “You get a moment of satisfaction, and then you’ve got to do another one to prove to yourself that it’s really out there.” Ms. Grace shoots with a cellphone and includes enough in the frame to convey something about the scene without letting the setting take over the image. Her image of a blue truck dusted with snow (below) does not look like it is going anywhere. The question she asks is, “How much needs to be there in order to still tell a story?” For Ms. Grace, the season’s lengthening days and this weekend’s change to Daylight Saving Time are good news. They mean longer afternoons, which means more afternoon light. “Late-afternoon light is the most sherbety and fun light,” she said. “So, go, light.”",The New York Times
2019,‘What We Do in the Shadows’ Revisits a Tale That Refuses to Die,"AUSTIN, Tex. — Some ideas refuse to die. When Jemaine Clement and Taika Waititi wrote and directed the mockumentary “What We Do in the Shadows,” they, along with Jonathan Brugh and Ben Fransham, played centuries-old vampires in Wellington, New Zealand, struggling with their unending lives and the quotidian frustrations of modernity. It’s a comedic conceit these New Zealand natives had been toying with for ages, long before Waititi (the director of the Marvel blockbuster “Thor: Ragnarok”) and Clement (who, with Bret McKenzie, formed the comic music duo Flight of the Conchords) had any Hollywood standing — going back to the late 1990s, when they became friends at Victoria University of Wellington. After it opened — in 2014 in most of the world, and in 2015 in the United States — the film received some supportive reviews and gained a cult following. But its modest ticket sales seemed to drive a stake through the heart of any further possibilities for it. Now Clement and Waititi have a new FX series, also called “What We Do in the Shadows.” It debuts on March 27, and follows a different crew of vampires and their struggles to settle down in Staten Island. On a March night, surrounded by the decadent revelry of the South by Southwest festival, Clement, who created, wrote and directed on the FX series, and Waititi, who directed several episodes, gathered with Paul Simms (“Atlanta,” “NewsRadio” and “The Larry Sanders Show”), one of their executive producers. They met here in an ornate chamber at the Driskill, a Romanesque-style hotel that opened in 1886. Amid the spooky atmospheric elements — some intentional, some accidental — they spoke about their affection for the undead and the creation of the new show. These are edited excerpts from that conversation. So FX showed me the first few episodes —— [the lights in the room begin to flicker] TAIKA WAITITI What happened there? PAUL SIMMS It’s a vampire room. JEMAINE CLEMENT I don’t know, because my eyes were closed. I was relaxing. I was saying —— [lights flicker again]. It seems to happen whenever I talk. CLEMENT It’s your power. WAITITI Stop talking. I was worried I’d miss your original film characters in the TV version of “What We Do in the Shadows,” but I’m glad to say I didn’t. CLEMENT You didn’t? WAITITI It’s a little bit of a Roman dagger in my back. CLEMENT We thought about that movie for a long time, over years and years. But the actual movie, we only shot for four or five weeks. WAITITI I really wanted to make a mockumentary thing because I’d just tried to make a short one about police dogs. But the dogs were played by people. This was like 2002, 2003, and I thought that was the easiest way to shoot stuff. Just leave the camera on — you really didn’t have to try. Where did vampires enter into it? CLEMENT We had played this thing on stage one time. Taika, Bret and I all went to Calgary, to do a show, where one of us was on stage playing a vampire, doing vampire jokes. The only one I remember is like [exaggerated Slavic accent]: “I just flew from Transylvania, and boy are my arms tired. Because they were wings, and I flew all the way.” I think that was Taika doing that, and then I’d get up from the audience, dressed as a vampire, too, and I’m heckling him. WAITITI “You’ve been heckling me for 250 years!” CLEMENT “You heckled me in Vienna in 1563!” WAITITI “And then I chopped your head off!” “Ah, you have a new head, my friend.” CLEMENT I forgot that joke. “Yes, I have a different head.” WAITITI “Ah, but I remember the voice. And the heckles.” When we first met in Wellington, nothing was really open late at night except for video-game parlors. We would hang around, playing air hockey and doing those kinds of characters. “Ah, my old rival.” Just keep the stupid thing going on for ages. Were vampires part of your cultural upbringings? CLEMENT I remember waking up at 5 years old, and my parents were watching a horror movie. It was “Scars of Dracula.” There’s a skeleton lying on a stone tomb, a bat flies in and drops blood on it, and it becomes Dracula again. It’s ridiculous, but back then, it was like, whoa. I had nightmares about vampires after that for years. WAITITI I grew up in a tiny, tiny, tiny, little fishing village on the East Coast of New Zealand. Basically, the place where you’d take marlin to get weighed was in this shed, down on the pier. And they’d turn it into a cinema for three or four months. So when I was 7 or 8, I saw George Hamilton in “Love at First Bite,” in this shed, projected on a sheet. CLEMENT Working with Paul and the other writers in the writers’ room, not everyone knew about vampires. Taika and I know a lot about vampires. SIMMS Definitely, none of us knew as much as Jemaine. CLEMENT A lot of the ideas in the first week, I’m just going, “No. You can’t do that.” [laughs] “Vampires can’t do that.” SIMMS I wrote a fantastic joke where they were having appetizers that were leeches full of blood. CLEMENT Well, they can’t eat solid food. SIMMS That’s my point, still — they could just chew the blood out. The writers’ room was a lot of arguments. Was it bittersweet for you that the original “Shadows” movie was not more widely seen? WAITITI How dare you! My mom saw it and she loved it. That’s all I care about. CLEMENT I had the opposite experience because the idea came from when we weren’t professionals at all, and it’s really us joking around with a bunch of our friends. It surprises me how many people have seen that movie. WAITITI Our production designer took the discarded green screens from “The Hobbit” and built a house out of it. And they were just going to throw it away and burn it. CLEMENT If you peel back the old wallpaper, you’d see the green. The movie generated a previous TV spinoff, “Wellington Paranormal,” which started running in New Zealand last year. When did you start thinking about this series for FX? CLEMENT We didn’t. Scott Rudin saw the film and then started harassing us until we did it. WAITITI I was in Hawaii, about to have my second kid. It’d be like three or four in the morning, the phone would ring, and it would be him. CLEMENT [American producer voice] “Taika. We’ve got to do this show. When is this show happening? We’ve got to get it rolling. I know it can go.” WAITITI When it’s like three or four in the morning, the only thing you can say to get rid of people is like: “Yeah, yeah, totally, just do it. O.K., we’re doing it. Bye.” And the show happened. CLEMENT The thing is, in the movie, we were the bosses and we never had to take notes. Now we have to take notes from the network. WAITITI Take notes on something you created and you know everything about. CLEMENT And a lot of the notes are like, “In the movie … ” Oh, man. We know. We did the movie. Did you ever consider reprising your movie roles in the TV show? WAITITI They encouraged us to do it. “It’d be really cool if you guys were in the show, at least one of you.” Well, I’m not going to do it if he’s not going to do it. Neither of us really wanted to do it. CLEMENT In TV, there’s just so much to do. WAITITI It’s hard enough listening to your own voice while you’re editing. And then also listening to your own voice while you’re directing. And acting. Doing a stupid accent and then stopping and giving a note. You’re just talking all day long. SIMMS I think Jemaine thought that it was going to be easier than it is by not being in it. WAITITI We were doing night shoots in Toronto — when I say “we,” I had it easy. I came in for like the last three weeks. It was like coming to a battlefield in France in World War I. They were so haggard and tired and half dead. CLEMENT It took Taika about three days to get that way. WAITITI When I was outside, I was wearing two Canada Goose jackets. Then I’m hanging out inside this drugstore where we had put the monitors, going: “I’m not going out there to give them direction. They can come in here if they want direction.” I think we wrapped at like 7 a.m. and Jemaine was still going on another set. I turn up and Jemaine is curled up in a ball, half asleep, looking at this monitor, going, “Mmmm. Uhhh.” Like, mumbling. CLEMENT [weakly] “More energy.” You’ve worked with Paul, going back to the “Flight of the Conchords” HBO series. How did he fare in these conditions? CLEMENT You’re quite vampiric yourself. SIMMS I did not mind the night shoots at all. That’s my natural schedule, anyway. WAITITI We’d nap all the time. I’d see a couch and be like, “There’s my couch.” Matt Berry is also a huge napper. On the sets, we’d scope out the beds. And I’d be, “Oh, that’s mine.” And then I’d come in and Matt would be in it. CLEMENT Usually when you have a house set, there’s bedrooms with beds. But there’s no beds on this, because it’s coffins. There’s nowhere to sleep. So everyone’s got to really search: “Ah, now that human character has a bed.” WAITITI The college bedroom on the pilot, me and Matt were fighting over that bed all the time. CLEMENT But there was a sign on the door: “No sleeping.” WAITITI And then in smaller letters: “Unless you’re Taika.” What, if anything, has the experience of making the show further taught you about vampires? SIMMS The show is funny and silly, but it is about the sadness of eternal life. CLEMENT There is a sadness about not letting go. WAITITI Humans are so [expletive] stupid and boring and lazy, that given the gift of immortality, you’d never get around to doing anything. You’d just put off everything. People that have been alive for 5,000 years, going: “I’ve got forever to learn how to play violin. Why start now?” Humans, they still carry on human nature into being an undead creature. All those hang-ups stay with you.",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | ‘What Would I Have Done if I Would Have Killed Her That Night?’,"Opinion Ten months in a class for men who hit women. CreditCreditPhotographs by Lauren Justice Ms. Justice is a freelance photographer. MADISON, Wis.— I started working at a domestic violence shelter in October 2015 in part because of my own history. I’d been in an abusive relationship when I was younger; I wanted to help women who were in situations like mine, but I also wanted to understand domestic violence better — how unhealthy dynamics of power and control come to exist in relationships, and how they can be stopped. Which is why for 10 months in 2017, I spent part of my time at the shelter and part of my time attending state-certified batterer intervention classes for those who perpetrate abuse. Batterer intervention classes have been around since the late 1970s and emerged from what was then known as the battered women’s movement, said Michael Paymar, a co-author of the Duluth Curriculum in the late 1980s, which is one of the most widely used curriculums in batterer intervention programs today. They were part of an effort, Mr. Paymar said, to answer the question, Why do men hit? “What was the intent behind the violence? What was the belief system that guided that violence?” Today experts estimate there are 1,500 to 2,000 classes across the country that call themselves batterer intervention programs, though their methods vary. These programs can be controversial. Evidence for their effectiveness is mixed, and many argue that money should go toward initiatives that support and protect victims directly. Worse, some worry that these classes can contribute to a sense of false hope for victims, who may stay in their relationships as a result. But at their best, they aim to fundamentally alter the dynamics of power and control. I went to my first class in early January. When I walked in, there were seven men sitting around the room. One man, Jake, then 40, who I would come to know, said he had tried to kill his partner; some said they’d been charged with disorderly conduct. Almost everyone in attendance was there because a court ordered it: Each man entered the room on the first day in denial about his need to attend the classes. Each blamed his partner, minimized his behavior and compared himself favorably with other abusers. “I had grabbed her by the throat and punched her on top of the head. After that there was some arguing and fighting and I grabbed her by the hair and drug her out in the field towards the swamp. I had intentions of killing her and burying her. I mean, it was pretty serious. And then I pulled the knife out of my pocket, told her I was going to cut her throat, which I didn’t. And that’s basically what went down. It took place over about an hour. It was quite a long, drawn-out deal. Not good at all. And my kids saw it too. Pretty bad.” — Jake Over the course of the program — 24 classes in total — the men completed various exercises. They wrote letters to show that they understood their partner’s perspective, then read them out loud. They did trust walks, in which they were blindfolded and guided around by two other men. They talked about privilege, masculinity and their own childhoods. Dominick, 27, talked about his abusive mom and how he related to his girlfriend’s feeling of embarrassment after he’d spit on her. Teddy, 21, asked for examples of ways he could respond that were healthy instead of hitting his girlfriend, saying it was the only thing he knew. During his time in the program, Teddy was arrested again, that time for third-degree sexual assault. “What do you think about guys who hit women?” he asked me, on multiple occasions. “I grew up hard, you know, and it’s not an excuse that I grew up that way — that’s why I did the crimes I did and stole stuff — because it’s not right, you know? My sister she grew up the same way as me and she didn’t do none of that. She never stole nothing. So it’s not an excuse, you know. So. I don’t know. But my mom, she’s a horrible person. Like if I had to describe her, she is worse than any person I have ever met in my life. “I don’t really tell too many people about it either. Because it is kind of like, embarrassing, you know? Just like when my girlfriend said in the police statement that it was embarrassing I spit on her and I kind of felt how she feels, you know? … To be embarrassed for someone doing something wrong to you.” — Dominick “When I was a kid, you know, when I talked back, when I did something wrong, I got hit, you know? I said this in class before — I got beat, so that’s the only thing I know. That’s my really big problem. That’s like pretty much one of my only problems that I have. And I tried asking about it in class one day and I brought it up but she couldn’t really explain what else I could do. So like if she could explain what else I could do, instead of that, then like one of my biggest problems would be solved. Because that’s a really big problem.” — Teddy The class involved a lot of talk about children. Jake had noticed that his son, who was 2 years old at the time, had started calling his mom a bitch because he had heard Jake use that word. Attending the courses was challenging. I would go in after a hard day at the shelter spent listening to terrifying stories of survival, hear these men’s minimization and denials, and feel hopeless and angry. Other times, I’d see them admit responsibility and talk about their own actions instead of what she did wrong or how she provoked them. I’d see breakthroughs: Victor, 35, would work to pull the class’s attention back to domestic violence when the conversation veered off course; Tyler, 26, would tell newcomers how his attitude toward the class had shifted over time, from dismissive to appreciative. I would see men who had been in the classes for longer calling out new arrivals for using curse words or inappropriate language to talk about their partners. “In the military, I was in charge of seven soldiers and I was direct, brutal. It’s how you’re trained to be. So this doesn’t, like, translate though, in the civilian world, especially with someone you love. And I learned slowly with my son. You know, I’m very direct to my son, but I sugarcoat it. And I use tact. And empathy. Things that I never used with this girl. Or with my ex-wife. You know, it wasn’t until this class that I realized how verbally abusive I’ve been my entire life to every girl I’ve ever been with. Incredibly verbally abusive.” “My definition of a man has completely changed in the last year. And I’m not sure if I’m a man yet based off that definition.” — Tyler “As soon as the argument is done, I feel horrible. I don’t win by calling anybody names. I don’t win by being physical with anybody. You know, it’s a lose-lose situation. And I get very upset. I’m still trying to learn things. I’m willing to learn and take these classes that I’m in now to become better. But I can’t blame everything on my stepfather or my mom because ultimately I make my own decision and nobody should be able to make me angry no matter what the situation is. I make myself angry, and I can’t control nobody but myself.” — Victor Seven men in total agreed to be photographed and interviewed. (I’m not using their full names here to protect the privacy of their victims.) Most who agreed said they did so because they wanted their words to reach younger men. Rodney, 51, said he would be receptive to hearing advice only from someone who had been through the experience himself. His message? “If you’re in that kind of relationship, man, you’ve got to get out. Out immediately, out before something bad happens — you know, you kill somebody.” At least two of them, at the time of our interviews, implied they were afraid of being in a relationship because they were afraid of being abusive again. “If I get mean again, can I control my tongue?” Tyler wondered. He was initially accused of strangulation and battery, but maintained that he had only ever been verbally abusive, and his charges were dismissed. Last summer, however, he again faced abuse-related charges — involving a different partner — and this time, he pleaded no contest. Domestic abuse is a choice. Every time these men called their partners names, hit them, or used intimidation, they were making a choice to do so. And yet some of them feared they wouldn’t be able to stop making those choices. “If you’re in that kind of relationship, man, you’ve got to get out. Out immediately, out before something bad happens, you know, you kill somebody.” “What would I have done if I would have killed her that night?” — Rodney I had to make a conscious effort to be open to these men’s experiences while also maintaining a grasp on what their partners experienced; in my interviews and photographs, I wanted to understand them, but not valorize them. Working at the shelter was a counterbalance to the class. It was hard to carry both truths: This man, typically, experienced violence at home as a child; he has created violence at home as an adult, and one does not excuse the other. The counselor who worked with the men, Kerry Jung, herself an abuse survivor, told me that she’d had to work through hard assumptions before she began to understand that working with an abusive man meant she was also helping his partner. “I’m helping an entire family, and then another generation after that if I can stop the children — the boys from being abusive and the girls from entering into relationships where they become victims,” she said. “If you’re changing him, you’re helping her and you’re helping the kids. And that clicked with me. So I’m really helping, not just him, I’m helping an entire family, and then another generation after that if I can stop the children — the boys from being abusive and the girls from entering into relationships where they are victims.” — Kerry The effectiveness of these sorts of programs can be complex to evaluate, said Dr. Ed Gondolf, a longtime researcher on batterer intervention efforts. Men sometimes drop out partway through or fall out of contact with researchers seeking follow-up interviews. His own research has indicated that about 49 percent of men who had participated in one of these programs — though not necessarily completed them — had reassaulted after four years. But the same research showed that a high proportion of those assaults had taken place within the first six months, perhaps before the interventions had had time to take effect. At the four-year follow-up mark, around 90 percent had not physically abused their partner in the previous year. “At the end of the day, I feel guilty because now my son has to deal with this.” “I sit there and I think, well, did I ever treat her bad in front of him? And I’d like to say no. But then you always have to question yourself: Maybe I did say something and he heard it. Or he’s going to think of his mom in a different way because he sees Daddy treated her different at one time.” — Dakota Over the course of reporting this story, I heard conflicting perspectives: Jake’s partner, who re-entered the relationship after a few years apart, said Jake has never downplayed what he did to her. She sees a difference in the way he carries himself today. “You can tell that he was taught a different way on how to handle himself through that class: ‘Here’s the tools of how to not get there, and if you do, here’s what you do,’” she said. But another woman, who is no longer in her relationship, said that she hadn’t seen a positive change, that her partner remained both abusive and manipulative after completing the class. One thing seems to be consistent among those researching and facilitating these programs: They are still working as advocates because they have seen men make progress and believe change is possible. They have heard victims say they feel safer. They have heard men express empathy. It can be harmful to think this will be the case for every man; there are some who do not have it in them to change. The advocates agree, however, that there is a need for a space to teach healthy behaviors and develop a sense of accountability. What would happen if men were encouraged to challenge their belief systems about women and relationships, power and control before they were forced to by a 911 call?

2019,‘Whose Side Are You On?’: Harvard Dean Representing Weinstein Is Hit With Graffiti and Protests,"The graffiti showed up on the door of a Harvard University building last week: “Our rage is self-defense,” and “Whose side are you on?” The unexpected target was Ronald S. Sullivan Jr., who is an accomplished lawyer, the director of Harvard’s criminal-law clinic and the first African-American to be appointed as a faculty dean. Earlier this year, Mr. Sullivan joined a team of lawyers representing the Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, who heads to trial in June in Manhattan on rape and related charges. The move set off protests and intense debate at the Ivy League campus, where a small, but vocal, group of students have called for his resignation as dean of Winthrop House, one of Harvard’s residential colleges for undergraduate students. Some students said they did not believe Mr. Sullivan was fit to serve as a dean of a residential college and at the same time represent Mr. Weinstein, who has been accused by more than 80 women of sexual harassment and, in some cases, assault. In his first public remarks, Mr. Sullivan said in a phone interview on Monday that he did not anticipate the level of backlash he has received. He has a long history of taking on high-profile and, at times, controversial clients, as well as representing students who have been victims of sexual assault, he said. “Lawyers are not an extension of their clients,” Mr. Sullivan said. “Lawyers do law work, not the work of ideology. When I’m in my lawyer capacity, representing a client, even one publicly vilified, it doesn’t mean I’m supporting anything the client may have done.” Some students disagree. Dozens of protesters, some with tape over their mouths, protested last month in front of the administration building, holding signs that said “Remove Sullivan” and “#MeToo.” About 270 people have signed an online petition calling for him to resign from his faculty dean position. “Do you really want to one day accept your diploma from someone who for whatever reason, professional or personal, believes it is O.K. to defend such a prominent figure at the center of the #MeToo movement?” one student, Danu Mudannayake, wrote in the petition. In the past week, the doors of Winthrop House were spray-painted with graffiti and had fliers posted on them that included an illustration of Mr. Sullivan that some students described as “racially insensitive.” The fliers, which were also distributed throughout the campus, included images of Mr. Weinstein and Roland Fryer Jr., a Harvard economics professor who has been accused of sexual harassment. Protests regarding Mr. Sullivan’s representation of Mr. Weinstein have erupted at the college, and members of the Association of Black Harvard Women said in a public letter addressed to Mr. Sullivan: “You have failed us.” But many of Mr. Sullivan’s colleagues have come to his defense. Dozens of law professors from the university sent a letter to the college on Feb. 14 in support of Mr. Sullivan. On Feb. 28, The Chronicle of Higher Education published an article by Randall Kennedy, a Harvard law professor, who wrote: “Those calling for Sullivan’s resignation or dismissal as a faculty dean solely because he is serving as Harvey Weinstein’s lawyer in a rape prosecution are displaying an array of disturbingly widespread tendencies. One is impatience with drawing essential distinctions such as that between a lawyer and his client. Another is a willingness to minimize or dispense with important safeguards like fair trials. Yet another is a tendency to resort to demonization.” The dean of Harvard College, Rakesh Khurana, said in a statement on Feb. 20 regarding Mr. Sullivan that the right to a vigorous defense is a cornerstone of the justice system. Yet he also announced last week that the college would conduct a “climate review” of how students at Winthrop House viewed Mr. Sullivan’s representation of Mr. Weinstein and “take action as appropriate,” according to The Harvard Crimson. “It is not lost on me that I’m the first African-American to hold this position,” Mr. Sullivan said. “Never in the history of the faculty dean position has the dean been subjected to a ‘climate review’ in the middle of some controversy.” A spokeswoman for the university declined to comment. Mr. Sullivan has had other controversial clients. He defended Aaron Hernandez, the former New England Patriots player, at his second murder trial, when he was acquitted of murdering two men in Boston. Mr. Sullivan also represented the family of Usaamah Rahim, a man shot by the Boston police who had been accused of being a terrorist. Mr. Sullivan has largely built a career helping to overturn wrongful convictions, and he designed an indigent defense system in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina that resulted in the exoneration of thousands of people falsely convicted of crimes. The Brooklyn district attorney’s office tapped Mr. Sullivan in 2014 to design a conviction integrity unit to identify wrongfully convicted people; it has become a national model. In 2017, he also helped the family of Michael Brown, a man killed by the police in Missouri, obtain a reported $1.5 million settlement from the City of Ferguson after the family had filed a wrongful-death suit. Ms. Mudannayake, a design editor at The Harvard Crimson, said that students’ quarrel with Mr. Sullivan was not that he took on a controversial, high-profile client. But she said that faculty deans like Mr. Sullivan are responsible for setting the tone and culture in their houses, and students in Winthrop House felt that Mr. Sullivan’s representation of Mr. Weinstein disrupted the safe atmosphere of their community. “Everyone on this campus knows what #MeToo is and who Harvey Weinstein is,” she said. “And it’s just shocking that it’s been brought quite literally to some students’ doorsteps.” Mr. Sullivan wrote in an email to Winthrop students in January that all defendants, even the most disliked, have “basic due process rights.” On Monday, he said the students’ concern was genuine, but misplaced. Mr. Sullivan called the controversy “a teachable moment,” and expressed concern that the climate review could have a chilling effect on faculty who engage in work that may be unpopular. One former student, whose name is being withheld because she is a survivor of sexual assault, said she had no problem with Mr. Sullivan representing Mr. Weinstein. Mr. Sullivan, she said, has been a staunch advocate for victims and had represented her with her case. She said she had trusted only two people to tell about the attack, and one was Mr. Sullivan. The woman, who went on to become a sex crimes prosecutor, said in an interview on Monday that one unfortunate effect of the #MeToo movement was a tendency for the public to rush to judgment when someone is accused of sexual assault “without affording any sort of due process.” Diana L. Eck, a longtime faculty dean at Harvard, said that it seemed students in Winthrop House felt Mr. Sullivan’s outside work as a defense lawyer was “fracturing that sense of community” and making it harder for students in Winthrop House to discuss sexual assault openly. “There’s nobody that would think that every single person doesn’t deserve the best possible legal representation in court — of course we believe that,” Ms. Eck said. “It’s just, you know, to what extent does that commitment to legal representation in a very high-profile case like this collide with the responsibilities of being a community leader at Harvard?”",The New York Times
2019,"‘Women Here Are Very, Very Worried’","news analysis Afghan women used to be championed by almost everyone. Now they’re all but forgotten. Ms. Chira is a senior correspondent and editor on gender issues for The New York Times. It was once a prominent and bipartisan cause: the liberation of Afghan women from the tyranny of the Taliban. These women were championed by an array of strange bedfellows: feminists like Eleanor Smeal, celebrities like Lily Tomlin and stalwarts of a conservative administration like Laura Bush and Dick Cheney. In the early days of the invasion, the world heard vivid stories of the changes the war had brought. Women could walk freely outside their houses and put on makeup; girls could go to school. It was a narrative that helped buoy public support for the fight in Afghanistan and deflect criticism about American empire. In November 2001, as American troops were fighting to drive Al Qaeda out of the country and topple the Taliban government, Mrs. Bush was given the megaphone of the president’s weekly radio address. “Only the terrorists and the Taliban forbid education to women,” she said. “Only the terrorists and the Taliban threaten to pull out women’s fingernails for wearing nail polish.” Nearly two decades later, Afghan women are all but invisible to an American public thoroughly weary of the war. The future of Afghan women was not on the American agenda for its peace talks with the Taliban — they have been limited to core security issues of terrorism and American military presence. And there is agreement among many Democratic presidential candidates about leaving Afghanistan. Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gillibrand and Amy Klobuchar joined male presidential hopefuls in voting against a Senate rebuke of President Trump’s plans for swift withdrawal from Afghanistan and Syria. In 2004, Nasrine Gross, an Afghan women’s rights activist, was among those fighting to include a clause on women’s equality in Afghanistan’s Constitution. Today she wonders whether all the support she thought Afghan women had from America was just a fig leaf, a way to make military intervention more palatable to the American public via photographs of girls going to school. “How angry I am, how anguished I am,” Ms. Gross said last month. She predicted an expansion of Taliban control and a return to past atrocities like stonings and whippings. “Where are these American women?” It may seem that American priorities have changed and that past concerns for all the girls who couldn’t go to school simply dissipated as the war dragged on. But it’s also worth noting that years of well-publicized Taliban repression of women in Afghanistan did not prompt the American invasion; Sept. 11 did. Afghan women were never at the heart of American strategic interests, said Barnett Rubin, an Afghanistan expert at New York University who worked on Afghan issues in the Obama administration. Military goals came first. “You do things for people in order to get a permissive environment to help your military operation,” he said. Still, many in the administration did support the idea of expanding rights for women, and the United States, along with European governments and nongovernmental organizations, allocated substantial aid toward that end. The aid has made a real difference. In the 17 years since the invasion, education for girls has spread; today they make up about 40 percent of the country’s elementary school students and about 35 percent of its middle and high school students, according to the Feminist Majority Foundation, a Virginia-based organization led by Ms. Smeal that has been an advocate for Afghan women for more than two decades. Women now make up nearly a third of civil servants, according to the foundation, and have been encouraged to become police officers and judges. And a network of women’s shelters has been established across the country. Yet very conservative attitudes prevail in many areas outside Kabul, the capital, and women who enter men’s worlds like law enforcement have often been attacked or threatened. In the current peace talks, the United States wants a Taliban promise not to shelter terrorist groups like Al Qaeda in exchange for a military withdrawal. It is leaving other issues like women’s rights to separate talks, not yet even agreed to, between the Taliban and the Afghan government, which pledges to preserve women’s progress. Signals from the Taliban have been discouraging. In interviews, diplomats speak about a group that seems emboldened. Mariam Safi, director of the Organization for Policy Research and Development Studies in Kabul, said she was told that during talks in Moscow with Afghans who are not part of the government, the Taliban said women could go to school and hold political office but not become judges or president. They regard the Constitution, with its commitment to women’s equality, as illegitimate and imposed by America. Afghan women are speaking up, at home and abroad. They are insisting they be at the negotiating table during future talks; more than 700 gathered recently to urge that the peace they desire not come at their expense. “The talks are behind closed doors — it’s not transparent,” said Sima Samar, chairwoman of the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission. “We’ve heard nothing about the discussion of women. The Taliban keep saying we will give women rights based in Shariah. Women here are very, very worried and I think we are all united in saying we are not going back.” Both Ms. Smeal and Mrs. Bush have continued to speak out about Afghan women over the years, but Ms. Smeal said the absence of women’s rights from the talks’ agenda so far has infused a new sense of urgency. “Now we’re all waking up to the problem,” she said. Ms. Smeal said she was talking to members of Congress, bringing up the issue at the United Nations and trying to reignite bipartisan alarm, including signing a letter objecting to the withdrawal plans along with a scholar from the conservative American Enterprise Institute. Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire and the only woman on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, was among several Democrats who wrote a letter urging that the Trump administration ensure that women’s rights are protected during withdrawal negotiations. But neither the public nor the Trump administration seems to be listening — at least not so far. Ms. Safi and Dr. Rubin pointed out that Afghan women have been victims of 40 years of war — killed during Taliban attacks and American and Afghan troops’ night raids or bombings. Dr. Rubin believes a political settlement between the Afghan government and the Taliban is the only answer because the Taliban are not going away; he argues for a gradual withdrawal to ensure the Taliban live up to their commitments. “Don’t think the U.S. is going to protect you from your own fellow Afghans forever,” he said. “The best fight for women’s rights is not to wage wars that cost hundreds of billions of dollars. It’s not like war is good for women.” Afghan women do, indeed, long for peace. But the Taliban’s track record leaves them wary, and they fear that the United States, like other great powers, sided with them only when convenient and is all too ready to abandon them when it is not. “Women were pawns in the game in 2001,” Ms. Safi said. “And now they are again.” The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

2019,‘Wonder Park’ Review: An Animated Amusement Park Adventure Stalls Visually,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. In the amiable animated feature “Wonder Park,” a child’s imagination can power an amusement park. Unfortunately, the movie falls shy of providing the same sensory thrill ride. June (voiced by Brianna Denski) is an 8-year-old who displays an unusual aptitude for engineering. She’s developed her talent through conversations with her mother (voiced by Jennifer Garner), who talks June through her plans for a park called Wonderland, where animals run the rides and carousels are mounted with fish that really fly. But when her mother falls ill, June abandons the blueprints for her park, trading her imagination for worry. Having abandoned her daydreams, June is shocked when she wanders into the woods after escaping a trip to camp and finds Wonderland fully realized. The park is now haunted by a dark vortex that has damaged the rides. With the help of her park’s animal crew, June must conjure up solutions to fix the damage. “Wonder Park” thrives when it emphasizes the practical pleasures of creativity. The movie visualizes the gears and pulleys of June’s creations, producing exciting action scenes that make fantasies function efficiently. (Its uncredited director, Dylan Brown, was removed from the film after allegations surfaced of what The Hollywood Reporter and other outlets described as “inappropriate and unwanted conduct.” Brown disputed the allegations.) But when these sequences fall back to accommodate the narrative, the shabbiness of the visual design drains energy from the screen. The characters are unexpressive and generic, making it difficult to connect to their emotions, and murky colors dim the fantasy. Although its protagonist is blessed with a gift for engineering the impossible, “Wonder Park” is a film where faulty execution betrays a healthy imagination.

2019,‘Working Woman’ Review: Plumbing a Toxic Work Environment in Israel,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. Despite its surface-level placidity, the Israeli feature “Working Woman” unfolds like a psychological thriller — a procedural that, as it tightens its grip, captures how workplace sexual harassment slowly takes over one woman’s life. The movie, directed Michal Aviad, opens with Orna (Liron Ben Shlush) emerging from a successful job interview with Benny (Menashe Noy), a prominent property developer who was her commanding officer in the army. Even though Orna has no experience in real estate — she feels as if Benny is giving her an unusual chance — she demonstrates a knack for the business and an ear for what customers want to hear. It doesn’t take long for Benny to reveal less altruistic intentions. He makes comments about Orna’s hair and clothes and, one night, kisses her. She rebuffs him, and he apologizes — but it’s clearly not the end of the matter, and only the beginning of a toxic push-pull dynamic in which he will pretend to be interested in her well-being while finding ways to exert control over her, and to insinuate that she owes him. Orna appears afraid to speak out, but for the most part Aviad doesn’t directly verbalize her reactions, relying on Ben Shlush to express her pain in ways not detailed in dialogue. Orna does not tell her husband, Ofer (Oshri Cohen), about the kiss, seemingly out of shame, confusion and perhaps an impulse to protect his pride. He is struggling to get a new restaurant off the ground, and she is effectively the breadwinner. The couple’s financial situation, too, is something that Benny is able to leverage against Orna, using his connections with the municipal government to secure Ofer a business license, even though neither Ofer nor Orna has asked him to. (There is a squirm-inducing scene at Ofer’s restaurant, where Benny insists on having lunch one day. Aviad holds a shot of Benny sampling Ofer’s cooking and talking with Orna about a business trip to Paris for an uncomfortably long time.) What is notable is that Benny isn’t a mastermind. On the contrary, the film suggests that his predatory techniques — including subtly turning the spouses against each other, affecting their home life — are all too common. Shots in which Aviad follows Orna with a hand-held camera owe something to the Belgian filmmakers the Dardenne brothers (“The Unknown Girl”), whom the director has cited as an influence, as does the way she draws out pent-up anguish for suspense. There are times when the film risks heavy-handedness. (At a party hosted by the lecherous Benny, Orna and Ofer dance to the Bee Gees’ “If I Can’t Have You.”) But as “Working Woman” winds its way to a satisfying conclusion, it is an effective, generally gripping chronicle of how Orna’s difficulties compound, leading her to isolate herself mentally even as Benny’s harassment escalates. It also illustrates how targeted harassment can have collateral victims.

2019,‘XX’? But I Hardly Know Her!,"noted Don’t worry, the colleague you’ve never met isn’t trying to kiss you over email. Valentine’s Day is over, but we’re still receiving an endless stream of kisses: passed along in emails and texts like months-old mints nestled at the bottom of our bags, doled out inconsequentially to our tax guys and the work colleagues we’ve never actually met. Symbolized by two lowercase X’s or a lone capital at the close of a message, kisses have become the trivial signoff du jour for a subset of Americans, a spicier take on “All best.” Hugs, their more sober partner, written simply as “o,” have been kicked aside after failing to make it big in the merciless world of internet parlance. Ending digital notes with these shorthand kisses is especially popular today among people who work in industries like fashion or public relations, which lean female and are, perhaps, less likely to be navigating the muddy waters of #MeToo. The x’s manufacture closeness and soften bad news. To leave them out is to risk coming across wooden and cold, if not a psychopath. Dana Schwartz, the co-founder of the Hours Agency, a fashion public relations firm in New York, has long been a proponent of signing work-related emails with “xx,” finding that it makes the messages more friendly and conversational. In the last few years, she’s noticed more and more people in her orbit using “xx,” too. “Email itself has changed, with shorter and less-structured notes back and forth becoming more common,” Ms. Schwartz said. “This has allowed quick expressions like ‘xx’ to gain popularity and take on new meaning,” more gratitude than romance. But how did we land here? Sending virtual kisses to people with whom we’d never really want to lock lips? Apparently, we have the Brits to thank (or blame, depending on your viewpoint). The author Ben Yagoda, who tracks Britishisms entering the American lexicon on his blog Not One-Off Britishisms, first noticed the trend trickling over to the States in 2011. According to his then-college-age daughter Maria, all of her friends who had studied abroad in England were suddenly using “xx” in their digital messages in an effort to sound more British and, thus, cooler. By 2014, the trend had grown significant enough in Britain to warrant a study on its popularity. Lynne Cahill, the head of English language and linguistics at the University of Sussex surveyed roughly 600 people (90 percent of whom lived in the U.K.) aged 15 to 71 and found that 95 percent of them used “xx” in text messages, emails and instant messages. British people have used kisses to sign off their letters and greeting cards as far back as 1763, according to Ms. Cahill. Winston Churchill was an early proponent, closing one letter he sent in 1894 with: “Please excuse bad writing as I am in an awful hurry. (Many kisses.) xxx WSC.” Why the letter X, long a way illiterate people signed their letters, was picked to represent kisses is unclear — some linguists believe it was because its pronunciation sounds similar to the word “kiss” — but it spread quickly to adjacent countries and former colonies like Australia. Mark Liberman, a professor of linguistics at the University of Pennsylvania, said he has received “bises,” which French-English dictionaries translate to “x” or “xx,” from some of his closer French colleagues since at least the 1980s. “It’s been a thing my whole life,” said Alice Bugeja, a fourth-year student at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland. She grew up in Chichester, in Southeast England, but spent a few years as a child living in Ohio. “When I lived in America and sent messages to my friends, it came off as really unfriendly that they didn’t respond with an ‘x,’” she said. But it’s Americans, of course, who have taken x’s to the nth degree, and are now using them in the workplace and even with unlikely recipients like their doctors or lawyers. Gretchen McCulloch, a linguist who is writing a book on internet language, has received emails from strangers seeking career advice that feature the once intimate signoff. She attributes its unexpected usage to our sheer boredom with the other options on offer: “Best” sounds robotic, and “Thanks” isn’t always relevant. Known as phatic expressions, these closing niceties are used more for their social function than their literal meaning, Ms. McCulloch said, like asking someone “How are you?” because it’s the polite thing to do, not because you’re interested in a detailed breakdown of their mental health. “You need these kinds of signals in text conversations because they can otherwise seem abrupt,” Ms. Cahill said. In that sense, “xx” is not really about kisses at all, but simply a friendly parting gesture, the letter equivalent of a smiling emoji. Which, let’s face it, is even worse.",The New York Times
2019,‘Yardie’ Review: A Gangland Thriller with a Shot of Reggae,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. Straddling the intersection of drug dealing and the music industry, “Yardie,” the big-screen directing debut of the actor Idris Elba, struggles to carve a path between warring gangs and reggae beats. Leaping from 1970s Jamaica to 1980s London, the story follows D (Aml Ameen), a drug courier and aspiring music artist who arrives in Hackney with a package for Rico (the reliable Stephen Graham, whose queasily hilarious performance of cultural appropriation is mitigated by his Jamaican heritage). But D, in a pointlessly stupid move that endangers his newly rediscovered childhood sweetheart (an excellent Shantol Jackson) and their young daughter, decides to give his package to the Turks instead. That’s only the first in a string of imbecilic choices that D, consumed by the desire to avenge the years-ago murder of his brother, makes as he knocks around the Hackney club scene and precipitates a gang war. Neither likable nor remotely worthy, the character is a huge problem for the movie, as is Brock Norman Brock and Martin Stellman’s scattered screenplay (adapted from Victor Headley’s novel), which leans much too heavily on D’s voice-over narration. At the same time, “Yardie” (the title is Jamaican patois for a gang member) has something to say about the way immigrants can become trapped in the loyalties and vendettas of their homelands. Elba grew up in Hackney, and his familiarity with the community is visible in the movie’s evocation of a tumultuous world suffused with lowlife scheming and thumping tunes. John Conroy’s cinematography hustles and heaves, straining to inject a vitality that the story too often lacks. Yet whether in the kaleidoscopic warmth of Jamaica or the gray chill of London, “Yardie”’s sunlight-filled songs will make your toes twitch.

2019,"‘Yelling, Screaming, Almost Fisticuffs’ ...Over House Paint?","The abstract artist Sean Scully has striped his canvases in yellows from palest omelet to warning flare. His choices have been uncontroversial — his paintings have sold for more than $1 million each — until last summer, when he went a shade too far on one of his own homes. Mr. Scully, 73, specified Gold Zinger paint (from Valspar) for his turreted house built in the 1980s in Snedens Landing, an enclave in the hamlet of Palisades, N.Y., on the Hudson River’s western shore about 20 miles north of Manhattan. In an oversight, his team did not file for paint color approval permits required by the local government’s Historical Areas Board of Review. At the board’s December meeting, some emotions ran high as the public debated whether Gold Zinger should be allowed to remain on the house. Opponents deemed the color “over the top and jarring.” Mr. Scully’s team defended it as “bold, beautiful and uplifting,” suited to a woodsy neighborhood known as “eclectic, unique, artsy and individualistic.” (Celebrity inhabitants have included Orson Welles and Scarlett Johansson.) The board nonetheless concluded that Gold Zinger had to go. This spring, it will yield to Semolina, a creamier yellow from Benjamin Moore. Mr. Scully, in a recent interview, fumed over what he called “Pottery Barn” tastes among the locals who spurned Gold Zinger. Thomas Jefferson had applied a similar shade in Monticello’s dining room, he said, and it brought a cheerful note to his wintry leafless property. But he accepted Semolina as a compromise: “I don’t want war.” Color battles like these have grown common. Historic district administrators and other neighborhood design watchdogs have gained power over growing urban and suburban territories. Homeowners in aging subdivisions brave disapproval as they try to update association covenants, to brighten obsolete dark palettes while maintaining visual cohesiveness. Blog posts have drawn attention to extreme colors and suggested boundaries of good taste, while social media has made for open season on people’s house paint choices. Tantrums, lawsuits and nit-picking have ensued. Regulations in Palm Coast, Fla., forbid “fluorescent, loud, clashing or garish colors or ANY SHADE of purple, fuchsia, magenta and orange that does not meet the pastel requirement.” In Wellington, Fla., homeowners have struggled to persuade authorities to add mouthwatering paint colors called oregano spice and cocoa berry to the official rosters of permitted hues. In Gaithersburg, Md., homeowners have landed in court for using excessively pale trim in a predominantly earth-tone subdivision — the house that generated the controversy is on Happy Choice Lane. In Cody, Wyo., rule-breaking owners have spewed expletives while painting their home’s exterior in bands of “cafe gray, maroon rust, walnut bark and cinnabark,” the Powell Tribune reported. There are reports of a Louisiana resident’s yellow house being painted gray by neighborhood objectors while the owner was out of town. People have ranted online against the subjective judgments and excessive power of the “color police.” A petition arose to abolish homeowner associations, partly because of the threat of color dictatorship. John Hammersmith, a community associations expert who owns Hammersmith Management in Colorado, said that board discussions of paint choices had been known to devolve into “yelling, screaming, almost fisticuffs.” He quoted a common saying in real estate: “You just don’t want to live next to a pink house.” Pink walls, however, do sometimes win hearts. In Brooklyn’s Park Slope neighborhood, there is nostalgia for a Victorian rowhouse formerly known as Pinkstone, at 233 Garfield Place. An owner had kept it coated pink for decades. Solange Knowles posed on its steps in a music video. Subsequent buyers have returned it to its original brown. (In Pinkstone’s memory, the Brooklyn-based accessories maker Dear Martian offers a “pepto pink cotton” bow tie named 233 Garfield.) In East Harlem, the designer Karim Rashid’s team has slathered a bubble gum shade across cantilevered concrete terraces on a new apartment house at 329 Pleasant Avenue. Mr. Rashid’s original proposal had called for incorporating turquoise bands into the mix, but that high-contrast idea ended up shelved amid neighborhood outcry. In a recent interview, Mr. Rashid lamented widespread fear of brightly colored buildings. When we see unexpected shades, he said, “That’s when we feel alive.” Mr. Scully and his wife, the artist Liliane Tomasko, have recently expanded their real-estate portfolio with a sprawling 1920s house called Shadowcliff in Upper Nyack, N.Y. Its three-story wood and brick shell, trimmed in white neoclassical details, contains 37 rooms. Walter Aurell, an architect who has worked on several projects for the couple (including the Snedens Landing house), said that renovations at Shadowcliff were expected to begin in early summer. Discussions about the selections of exterior paint, he said, are ongoing. Mr. Rashid says he foresees his afterlife in a place where palettes are infinitely expansive and gray walls very rare. “There’s a planet out there, I believe, that’s all so colorful,” he said, “and that’s where I’m going when I die.”",The New York Times

2019,"‘You Are Safe Here’: In a Border Courtroom, a Migrant Woman Confronts Her Biggest Fear","MCALLEN, Tex. — She trembled as she sat on the witness stand. She kept her head down and avoided looking at the man at the defense table only a few feet away. In the blue-carpeted courtroom in the Texas border city of McAllen, she was identified only by her initials, M.M.U.T. She had come from Honduras, she told the court, and the smugglers who helped her cross the border had placed her with about a dozen other migrants at a stash house near McAllen. The man in charge was known as El Gordo — the Fat One. When one of the migrant women escaped one morning, El Gordo forced M.M.U.T. to go with him in his truck to search for her, she testified. He drove her to an unoccupied trailer some distance away. “He raped me,” she said. It was a small, nearly whispered moment one day in 2017 in one of the busiest federal courthouses on the southwest border. It was also a #MeToo moment for a category of women whose long history of sexual assault has gone largely unpunished for decades. Undocumented women rarely get the chance to face their accused rapists in court. Attacks are most often never reported, and if they are, the perpetrators are often never found. [Read: The Hidden Nightmare of Sexual Violence on the Border] This case was different. The woman had agreed to testify, and the man she said attacked her was in custody, facing sentencing on a different charge: Adan Hernandez-Nunez sat facing his accuser in court. One other thing was different: The federal judge hearing the case was a native of the Texas border region, a woman, and the daughter of migrant farmworkers. “I wanted more than anything else for her to feel that the court had listened to her as a human being,” Judge Micaela Alvarez said later, in an interview. The federal prosecutor, Alexandro Benavides, urged M.M.U.T. to go on with her story. “While that was happening, did he tell you anything?” he asked. “He told me that if I ever said this, that he would kill me,” she said. She stopped talking. “I’m afraid,” she said softly. [Read the Newsletter: Yes, There Was Duct Tape: The Harrowing Journeys of Migrants Across the Border. Sign up for Crossing the Border here] Judge Alvarez reassured the witness that federal marshals were in the courtroom to keep everyone safe. This judge had seen several cases like this. Before being nominated to the bench in Texas’ Southern District by President George W. Bush in 2004, Judge Alvarez had been a social worker for the state’s Child Protective Services. She is a native of the nearby border town of Donna and, out of hundreds of federal judges around the country, one of only 29 Latinas on the federal bench. “You can take as much time as you need,” Judge Alvarez told the witness. “I can assure you that you are safe here.” When the witness was ready, Mr. Benavides, the prosecutor, asked her if she saw the man she knew as El Gordo in the courtroom. “That’s him,” she said as she pointed at Mr. Hernandez-Nunez. And then she said, again, “I’m afraid.” She began crying. Judge Alvarez stepped down from the bench, walked to the witness stand and crouched down next to her. She called Mr. Hernandez-Nunez’s lawyer over so he could hear. She said later that it was the first time in her 14 years as a federal judge that she had left the bench to console a witness. Mr. Hernandez-Nunez had already pleaded guilty to harboring an undocumented alien and was headed to federal prison; the question at the sentencing hearing that day was for how long. Prosecutors hoped for a stiff sentence because of the rape accusation. But Mr. Hernandez-Nunez, now 32, denied the attack, and investigators were unable to locate either the stash house where M.M.U.T. said she was held, or the trailer where she said the rape occurred. Norman E. McInnis, the federal public defender, reminded the judge that investigators had declined to pursue sexual assault charges against his client in state court. “If they really felt like this was injustice, then they could have pursued other charges,” he said. Judge Alvarez, having heard the arguments from both sides, started speaking. She found the victim to be credible, she said. And she said the woman was not alone — she had seen a number of migrant women coming forward lately with allegations of sexual assault, beginning to break a silence that has long been part of the price of crossing illegally into the United States. “I don’t know if it was because those instances have increased, or maybe the victims are more willing to step forward now because, you know, they’ve lost some of that fear,” she said in the courtroom. “Certainly the victim here, you know, demonstrated a lot of fear.” Judge Alvarez said she found the penalty recommended under the federal sentencing guidelines, about two and a half years, to be too short. She sentenced him to four.",The New York Times
2019,‘You Can’t Put It Behind You’: School Shootings Leave Long Trail of Trauma,"PARKLAND, Fla. — Kelly Plaur is still having nightmares almost every night. In the mornings, she recounts them to her mother, though the theme is usually the same: the horror she witnessed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School last year when a gunman opened fire in her classroom, killing two students and injuring four others. A few weeks ago, Ms. Plaur, 18, had to withdraw from the paramedic training program she had started after she was overcome with anxiety while transporting a gunshot victim. Even the sight of certain window blinds can put her on edge, reminding her of the bullet holes that pierced the classroom blinds on the day of the rampage. “Little things trigger me that I wouldn’t think would trigger me,” she said. For young people like Ms. Plaur, more than a year after the school massacre in Parkland, Fla., that killed a total of 17 people, life remains fraught with traumatic memories, an enduring byproduct of the nation’s epidemic of gun violence. For many, the worries emerged again last week when two teenagers who attended Stoneman Douglas took their own lives within a few days of each other. Then, on Monday, the father of a little girl killed in the 2012 shooting in Newtown, Conn., also died in what authorities ruled was a suicide. Experts warn that the motivations behind suicide are complex, and the recent deaths remain under investigation. But the three highly publicized losses over 10 days in two towns defined by tragedy laid bare the painful emotional injuries that can persist long after the gunfire has stopped. Years later, many survivors of mass killings say they continue to struggle. Loud noises make them jumpy. The popping sounds come back in dreams. Talking about gun violence can lead to sudden back spasms. They face these flashbacks, by and large, alone. In the immediate wake of the attacks, schools and communities come together and offer comfort, counseling and therapy. Students feel a cocoon of empathy from fellow students and teachers. Everyone asks if they are O.K. Then time passes. Hollan Holm was 14 when on Dec. 1, 1997, a fellow student opened fire at a prayer circle at Heath High School in West Paducah, Ky. Three students died and five others, including Mr. Holm, were injured. The bullet scraped his skull but did not penetrate it. He developed extreme sensitivity to certain sounds, like firecrackers and balloons popping. But he did not accept counseling, convinced he should just get on with his life. Now 36, Mr. Holm still avoids sitting with his back to the entrance of a room. At church, he said, he is “hyper-aware” of people he does not recognize. When he enters any space, he tends to conduct a threat assessment of his surroundings. Last year, 21 years after the shooting, he went for several months to a trauma specialist. “You can’t let the shooting define your whole life,” he said. “But you can’t put it behind you.” Each person handles trauma differently. Factors such as age, proximity to the gunman, or whether or not someone suffered injuries or saw someone get shot influence the ability to rebound. “The immediate acute response may resolve over time; the symptoms may decline,” said Rochelle F. Hanson, a psychologist who specializes in trauma treatment at the Medical University of South Carolina. “What we worry about is people three or four months out who are still experiencing trauma-related symptoms. Those raise red flags,” said Dr. Hanson, who is also a director of training at the National Mass Violence and Victimization Resource Center. School shootings can affect hundreds or thousands of people at once, including students, teachers, parents and emergency personnel. In Parkland, Stoneman Douglas alone has more than 3,000 students. “It is difficult, getting out of bed and going back to school every day,” said Alex Wind, 18, a senior. The freshman building where the shooting took place still stands, fenced off, on campus. “It’s so hard walking by it every day.” Right after a tragedy, schools flood campuses with counselors, therapy dogs and activities to help children cope. But if victims are in shock, it might be too soon to process what they have been through. By the time the shock wears off, services might no longer be as readily available. “It’s kind of like a hurricane: Everyone wants to help as soon as it happens,” said Sarah Franco, the executive director of a South Florida charity running a new health and wellness center in Parkland. “Now, a year later, we have to take a step back and look at how we are doing. Are people accessing all of these services? And the answer is no, they’re not.” The apparent suicides of Sydney Aiello, a 19-year-old Stoneman Douglas graduate, and Calvin Desir, a 16-year-old sophomore, prompted local leaders to rush to open the new center, which is funded by a Department of Justice grant and had been scheduled to begin its work in about a month. Similar programs were put into place after the school shootings at Columbine High School in Colorado, and in Newtown, where Jeremy Richman, 49, who lost his 6-year-old daughter, Avielle, in 2012, was found dead on Monday. On Monday, the Parkland center opened at a strip mall near Stoneman Douglas. Fliers stacked at the front door urged parents to ask their children if they had thought of suicide and especially whether they had gone as far as planning how they might kill themselves, a sign of high risk. “We wanted to know if I could get therapy or something to help me,” one girl asked, her mother in tow. Seeking help can be a difficult step for survivors to take. Lisa Hamp, now 32, was in a computer class her junior year at Virginia Tech when a gunman burst into the building. Afterward, as she was safely escorted outside, “I saw everything, dead bodies,” she recalled. Having emerged physically unscathed from a shooting that left 32 people on campus dead, Ms. Hamp felt that she did not need to take up mental health counselors’ time. She built a hierarchy in her mind of those who deserved help: People who had lost loved ones were at the top, followed by the wounded. “We put ourselves, the physically uninjured survivors, at the bottom,” she said. “We think we should just suck it up and move on.” But she never quite managed to move on. Ms. Hamp graduated with a degree in mathematics and went on to obtain master’s degrees in operations research and applied economics. Privately, she suffered from severe anxiety. “I was constantly prepared for the second shooting in my life. What if an intruder broke through the window?” She channeled her stress into an obsession with exercise and weight, which eventually led her to develop an eating disorder. It took several years before she sought psychological counseling, which she said helped. “Unfortunately, the most traumatized people, I don’t think we’ll ever see,” said Janelle Perritte, a licensed clinical social worker and Stoneman Douglas alumna. “They work to try to isolate themselves.” As a 17-year-old junior at Columbine at the time of the 1999 shooting, Andy McDonald remembers going to a counseling session and concluding that therapy was not for him. Instead, he kept a journal, he said. “I was really fortunate to get connected with different people in the aftermath, where I could go around and kind of share my story to different schools and different places around the country,” said Mr. McDonald, now a 37-year-old middle school teacher in New Hampshire. “Being able to talk about it, for me, was extremely helpful.” He still struggles when other shootings happen, or when major Columbine anniversaries near. It will be 20 years on April 20. “There’s not a day goes by that I don’t think about it in some capacity,” he said. Randee Gregory was a third grader on Sept. 26, 1988, when a young man entered Oakland Elementary School in Greenwood, S.C., and began shooting. Though a girl sitting across from her died in the shooting, Ms. Gregory, now 39, cannot recall the gunfire. “I remember being pushed out the door and running down the hall. But I blocked out the shooting part,” she said. “I assume it is a survival mechanism.” Everyone soon returned to school. There was no counseling of any kind — which Ms. Gregory does not hold against anyone. “School shootings were not a regular occurrence back then,” she said. To this day, Ms. Gregory, who works as a state tax auditor, tries to sit facing the exit. Sometimes, she still dreams that someone is chasing her and trying to shoot her. Her 5-year-old daughter, Rylee, is starting school next fall. “It terrifies the death out of me,” Ms. Gregory said. “I am not sure that schools are any safer now.” Neither is Jordan Gomes, 15, who was 9 and in fourth grade at Sandy Hook when a young man killed 20 children and six adults on Dec. 14, 2012. “Nothing can fix what that day broke inside of me and in every child in that school,” she said. “My biggest fear walking into school every day is not the homework or the tests. It is the fear that I will not live to leave at the end of the day, or that if I do, my friends will not. I cannot bear the thought of burying my friends.” Ms. Plaur, the young woman who recently left her paramedic training, said a counselor at Stoneman Douglas told her shortly after the shooting that she would have to “get over it.” It felt dismissive, she said, and it contributed to her decision to finish high school at another school. Soon, Ms. Plaur thinks, she might want to try therapy. “I’m ready now,” she said. An earlier version of this article gave an incorrect date for a school shooting in Greenwood, S.C..

2019,‘You Have to Pay With Your Body’: The Hidden Nightmare of Sexual Violence on the Border,"MCALLEN, Tex. — It was dark in the stash house where they kept her, the windows covered so no one could see inside. At first, the smugglers had her cook for the other migrants who had recently crossed illegally into the United States. Then they took her to a room upstairs, locked the door and began taking turns with her. It was the summer of 2014, and Melvin, a 36-year-old mother of three, had just completed the journey from her native Guatemala, crossing the Rio Grande on a raft before being led to the house in the Texas border city of McAllen. For weeks in that locked room, the men she had paid to get her safely to the United States drugged her with pills and cocaine, refusing to let her out even to bathe. “I think that since they put me in that room, they killed me,” she said. “They raped us so many times they didn’t see us as human beings anymore.” On America’s southern border, migrant women and girls are the victims of sexual assaults that most often go unreported, uninvestigated and unprosecuted. Even as women around the world are speaking out against sexual misconduct, migrant women on the border live in the shadows of the #MeToo movement. [Read: In a Border Courtroom, a Migrant Woman Confronts Her Biggest Fear] The stories are many, and yet all too similar. Undocumented women making their way into American border towns have been beaten for disobeying smugglers, impregnated by strangers, coerced into prostitution, shackled to beds and trees and — in at least a handful of cases — bound with duct tape, rope or handcuffs. The New York Times found dozens of documented cases through interviews with law enforcement officials, prosecutors, federal judges and immigrant advocates around the country, and a review of police reports and court records in Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California. The review showed more than 100 documented reports of sexual assault of undocumented women along the border in the past two decades, a number that most likely only skims the surface, law enforcement officials and advocates say. In addition, interviews with migrant women and those working with them along the border point to large numbers of cases that are either unreported or unexamined, suggesting that sexual violence has become an inescapable part of the collective migrant journey. [Read the Newsletter: Yes, There Was Duct Tape: The Harrowing Journeys of Migrants Across the Border. Sign up for Crossing the Border here] President Trump has used the threat faced by migrant women to make his case for a border wall. “One in three women are sexually assaulted on the dangerous trek up through Mexico,” he said in January — an estimate that appears to have originated from some limited surveys, one of them by Doctors Without Borders, of women traveling through Mexico. But less understood is that the violence that befalls migrant women happens not just during the perilous journey through Mexico: Much of it happens after women reach the supposed safety of the United States. In July, a 23-year-old Honduran woman told the authorities that she was sexually assaulted in a bedroom closet by a smuggler who had helped her and her sister cross into the South Texas city of Mission. The following month, a sheriff’s deputy in San Antonio was charged with sexually assaulting the 4-year-old daughter of an undocumented Guatemalan woman and threatening to have her deported if she reported the abuse. In 2017, a guide leading a group of migrants through the Tohono O’odham Nation’s reservation in Arizona raped a woman from El Salvador twice during a seven-day desert hike, threatening to leave her stranded if she resisted. “I hope I leave you pregnant so you have one of my kids,” he said, the woman told the authorities. In 2016, a migrant woman fled a stash house in the South Texas city of Edinburg, where she said she had been raped by a smuggler who brandished a machete. In West Texas that same year, two teenage girls reported that they had been sexually assaulted by a Customs and Border Protection officer, who they said forced them to strip, fondled them, then tried to get them to stop crying by offering chocolates, potato chips and a blanket. In an unusual turn, the girls filed legal claims against the federal government, which settled the case in 2018 for $125,000. At least five of the women who were assaulted — in one case, bound with duct tape, raped and stabbed — were attacked not by migrant smugglers, who are often the perpetrators, but by on-duty Border Patrol agents and Customs officers. Experts say the actual number of sexual assaults is almost certainly much higher than those documented by prosecutors and the police, because most attacks are never reported. And such attacks don’t end at the border. Women have reported being assaulted in immigration detention facilities, and the federal government over a recent four-year period has received more than 4,500 complaints about the sexual abuse of immigrant children at government-funded detention facilities. The Times interviewed eight migrant women from Central America who were sexually assaulted between 2013 and 2016 — women still struggling with nightmares, depression and in some cases, thoughts of suicide. One reported that she was attacked in Mexico; six said they were assaulted in South Texas. One said she was attacked in both Mexico and South Texas. The oldest victims were in their early 40s when they were attacked; the two youngest were 14. Most of their attackers were never prosecuted or identified, and The Times was not able to independently verify the women’s accounts. But all eight women either gave sworn testimony or submitted statements under penalty of perjury to the federal government in order to qualify for visas, and cooperated with the police in the investigation of their cases. They described a netherworld of fear that coexists with the bustling life of American cities up and down the border. One woman told of being held prisoner in a house that had been turned into a makeshift brothel in McAllen, a city of 143,000 in the Rio Grande Valley. “Nueva carne” — new meat, the smugglers said as she and other migrant women were led into the house, said the woman, Lucy, 45, a migrant from Honduras who, like others interviewed, did not want her last name used. She said a series of men came into the house over the next several days and raped her. “Because I didn’t want to let them, they tied my feet together and my hands behind my back,” Lucy said. Gladys, 45, a mother of four from Guatemala, said she was kidnapped by armed smugglers after crossing the border and jumped out of a car to escape, but was captured again. For days, she was held prisoner at a stash house in McAllen and forced to have sex with six men. “I thought it would be better if I died when I fell from the car,” she said. Law enforcement officials on the border said they had made arrests in many of the cases brought to them and would pursue more if they could. But the majority of women who have been assaulted do not report it, often because their attackers threaten to expose their immigration status — or worse — if they do. One woman, raped repeatedly at gunpoint in a stash house in Phoenix in 2005, said her attacker threatened to sell her 3-year-old daughter if she reported him. Those who do go to the authorities may not know the names of their attackers, or even where the assault occurred. Smugglers make sure their clients are unsure of their whereabouts; if they are detained by Border Patrol, they won’t be able to pinpoint where they were held. [Read: Open Wounds, Head Injuries, Fever: Ailing Migrants Suffer at the Border] The women are powerless by almost any measure. Most of the eight interviewed now live in the United States after receiving the victim-related visas. They work in stores, restaurants and factories, most barely making a living. Their English is limited. Many of them have not even told their families what happened. “They don’t have many defenses,” said Jesus R. Romo Vejar, an Arizona lawyer who has represented many migrant women victimized by sexual assault. “Undocumented women and children are the most unprotected of human beings.” Here are some of their stories. Lucy, 45, was raped while being forced to work at makeshift brothels, first in Mexico and then in McAllen. When we got to the house, there were many women. It was a big house. I couldn’t see everybody’s face, but there were different women in different rooms for prostitution. I wanted to flee but I was afraid they were going to kill me. They just told us, “You guys don’t have money, so you have to pay with your body.” When we crossed the river, there was a man waiting, a white guy with tattoos. He was in a truck. We got into the truck. He brought us into a house in McAllen. When we got there, the guy started talking and he said that I was new meat. When they wanted to have sex with me they had to tie me up because I wasn’t cooperative. They tied my feet together and my hands behind my back and then they’d have sex with me from behind. Before, I could not talk about this. I would have panic, really serious panic. I didn’t want to leave the house. I didn’t want to talk to anybody. I thought that everyone in the world saw me as a prostitute. I come from a poor family but a very decent family. It has affected me, yes. But not anymore. I’m kind of enraged. Those guys have mothers and daughters. What they did to us is what they did to women. Melvin, 36, was raped and forced into prostitution in a locked room at a stash house in McAllen. I lost count of how long I was there for. It wasn’t me anymore. I think that since they put me in that room, they killed me. They have no mercy. They don’t care that you’re a mother, that you have family. They see someone who doesn’t matter to them. And I still remember while I was with them there, it was my birthday, and I didn’t want to, not that day. And I remember that he grabbed me and at one point bit me, and when I arrived at the detention center, I still had the bite marks. I told them that it was my birthday. And according to them, the rape that day was for my birthday. I tried to commit suicide three times. Because you can’t live with all of that. And every time I closed my eyes, the men would appear. You’d shower. You’d close your eyes. They were there. I didn’t want to live with that in my head anymore. But here I am. J.E., 19, and two other migrants were kidnapped in South Texas by a Border Patrol agent, Esteban Manzanares, when J.E. was 14. He raped her in his apartment in Mission, Tex., and later committed suicide. He took me and tied me up to a tree. He said he would come back. I was thinking about my little brother, who’s in Honduras, and I’d never see him again. He was about 10, I think. It was hours. He undid me from the tree and put me in the car. In the apartment, there were two beds on top of the other, children’s bunk beds, and ropes there, too. They were shoelaces. For my wrists and my feet. My mind was blank. I was trying to understand everything. I didn’t know what to do. My feet were tied up. I would look at him and he had a gun. And that frightened me. I asked him why, and he answered me that he was doing this to me because I was the prettiest one of the three. There are people who sort of discard you when they know what happened to you. But the majority of my girlfriends do know so they can understand what I went through, and they support me. V.E.M.L., 39, was raped in the South Texas brush by a smuggling guide. She was apprehended, detained at the Hutto detention center in Taylor, Tex., and later deported. I knew that they were the ones who were going to take me across, so I knew that I had to stay with them. I never learned his name. I felt nervous about him. He was very strange. I wasn’t sure if he was on drugs. He always stood up and sat down, and stood up and sat down. The older one walked ahead. The younger one said, “Come with me.” I said, “Where are we going?” And he said, “We’re going to catch up with them ahead.” He bit my mouth so I could not cry out. I was scared that it might occur to him to kill me. Afterwards, he told me to hurry up or he would leave me there on the ground. The guys in the group start saying, “Immigration! Immigration!” I ran toward Immigration. I wanted to get away. But then when they took me and put me in the car, I felt frustrated and alone. I just felt like I couldn’t stop crying. They were all men agents. They kept asking me why I was crying and I couldn’t explain. When they brought me to Laredo, I told a doctor what happened. He said, “Don’t feel like you’re the only one that this happened to. This has happened to many other women.” Cindy, 26, and her son Samuel stayed at a stash house in Mexico while waiting to cross the border. She and another woman were raped by a smuggler, and she learned after being apprehended by Border Patrol that she was pregnant. Samuel is now 8. His little brother, to whom Cindy gave the biblical name of Adonai, is 2. When he entered the room, he had the gun. He took the children out. He had the gun and he pointed the gun at my head when he was attacking us. First he abused me and then he abused her. We’re in his power and we feel like we’re disposable. We can’t do anything because it’s like they tell us, they can kill us and nobody will say anything. It wasn’t until that test that I knew I was pregnant. In that moment, it was like I had been marked. I had been marked because of what had happened to me, that violation. I wanted to kill myself. Going to the psychologist, that’s what helped me heal. She told me that we had to talk about it, we had to think about it, and we had to learn to live with our lives moving forward, even with what happened. My son, I realized he was an innocent bystander in this situation and that it wasn’t his fault. My motivation to keep going in life are my two kids. I thank God because everything that I suffered, they’re the happiness that came out of that.",The New York Times
2019,‘You’re Not Supposed to Betray Your Race’: The Challenge Faced by Black Women Accusing Black Men,"When Meredith Watson decided to publicly accuse Virginia’s lieutenant governor of raping her, she knew she would face a backlash — most women who accuse powerful men of sexual assault do. But she also feared that as a black woman, she would face added scrutiny because the prominent politician she named, Justin E. Fairfax, was African-American, too. “You’re not supposed to betray your race,” Ms. Watson, 39, said in her first interview since she accused Mr. Fairfax last month of assaulting her when they were in college together at Duke University nearly two decades ago. Mr. Fairfax has denied her allegations. The #MeToo movement has brought into the open the challenges all women face when they say they have been sexually assaulted. Their accusations are disbelieved. Their motives are questioned. Their pasts are examined. But black women can face added blowback, including suggestions from other African-Americans that they are being disloyal to their race by calling out prominent men among them. The allegations against Mr. Fairfax have spurred fresh conversations about how society treats black women who say they have been sexually assaulted. Similar discussions have flared around an entirely separate case involving the R&B singer R. Kelly. Mr. Kelly was charged with 10 counts of sexual abuse last month, allegations he has denied. Though the two cases have little in common, they both highlight the challenges facing black women. Mr. Fairfax, who maintains that he had a consensual sexual encounter with Ms. Watson, said in a statement that it was also important to consider the injustices that black men have been subjected to in America. “As a matter of general principle, no one should challenge the fact that African-American women have been marginalized regarding sexual assault claims,” Mr. Fairfax said in the statement. “Nor should anyone challenge the fact that African-American men have been the targets of false allegations of sexual assault, whoever the accuser. We need a justice system that treats both accusers and the accused fairly and affords both due process.” Ms. Watson said she came forward in part as an act of solidarity with Vanessa Tyson, another black woman, who has accused Mr. Fairfax of sexually assaulting her during an encounter at the Democratic National Convention in Boston in 2004. (A spokeswoman for Dr. Tyson said she was unavailable to comment. Mr. Fairfax has denied her allegations.) Ms. Watson said that she has received some support, but the condemnation has stung. After she came forward, Ms. Watson said that a black male friend told her that he could not believe that she was “going to do this to a black man.” On social media, strangers described her as opportunistic, dismissed her as a pawn to take down Mr. Fairfax and equated her to the white woman who falsely accused Emmett Till of flirting with her, leading to his lynching in 1955. “I feel like I’ve been torn apart the most by my own community, quite frankly,” Ms. Watson said. “As black women, we shouldn’t have to keep going through this and bearing it in silence and just feeling like these things can happen to us.” There are a variety of underlying reasons for this desire to sometimes give black men a break, experts say. Distrust in the criminal justice system is part of it. So is the acknowledgment that black men face considerable hurdles on their way toward success. The underlying sentiment is similar to the hesitancy of some black residents to call 911 on other black people: Will they get a fair shake? “Coming forward against a black man who is liked by his community, I don’t know if anything is as difficult as that in terms of a situation a survivor can be in,” said Saida Grundy, an African-American, women’s and gender studies professor at Boston University who has written about the subject. Successful black men are seen as exceptional, she said, and so “tarnishing them with allegations is somehow a betrayal to black people who have made it.” Mr. Fairfax, a Democrat, has called for a law enforcement investigation to clear his name, asserting that Ms. Watson was part of an effort to prevent him from succeeding Gov. Ralph Northam, who faced pressure to resign after admitting to wearing blackface. Ms. Watson said she would testify at a public hearing. Leaders in the Republican-controlled Virginia Legislature have said they would hold a public hearing, but it is not clear when. One of those standing by Mr. Fairfax has invoked the ugly history of black men being falsely accused as a reason to question the accusations against him. “There have been just too many false charges filed against black men,” said Marty Jewell, a former Richmond, Va., city councilman who, along with other older black civic leaders, criticized what he felt was a rush to judgment against Mr. Fairfax. “We do know that women, through their scorn, have made false charges against men to get even.” Those types of attitudes and the suggestion that black women have a responsibility toward black men have made Aliyah Young, a Chicago activist who works at A Long Walk Home, an organization focused on empowering black women and girls, hesitant to publicly discuss her own experience of being sexually assaulted by a black high school classmate, she said. She said she has cut short family dinners and blocked people on social media when they started to blame black women for their own victimization in the R. Kelly case. Ms. Young often protests police abuse against black people, which factored into her decision not to call out her own attacker. “If I’m about the black agenda, I can’t go against black people,” said Ms. Young, 17, now a freshman at DePaul University. More than four in 10 black women experience physical violence from an intimate partner during their lifetimes, according to a report by the Institute for Women’s Policy Research. Yet research suggests that black women may be less likely to report being sexually assaulted to the police because of negative experiences with law enforcement; prosecutors may be less likely to bring charges when sexual assault victims are black in certain situations, and jurors may be less likely to convict, studies suggest. Roughly 20 years ago, Lisa VanAllen, 38, accused Mr. Kelly of coaxing her into group sex when she was a minor. She was the prosecution’s main witness against Mr. Kelly during the decade-old trial in which he was acquitted of child pornography charges. During that time, Ms. VanAllen said, most criticism came from other black people. “No one was checking to see if I was O.K.,” she said. “I got no compassion.” That was an attitude that needed to change, said Ms. Grundy, the Boston University professor. “We have to ask ourselves, if the cost of not bringing a good brother down is always silencing the black woman, then what the hell kind of racial progress is that?” she said. “You don’t make progress on half the race.” Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the timing of a trial in which the singer R. Kelly was acquitted. It was a decade ago, not decades ago.",The New York Times
2019,#WhatsMyName Stresses Safety for Uber Riders,"in her words A South Carolina student was murdered after getting into a car she mistook for her Uber, underscoring the safety risks of ride-hailing apps. You’re reading In Her Words, where women rule the headlines. Sign up here to get it delivered to your inbox. Let me know what you think at dearmaya@nytimes.com. “It has to be automatic, like putting on a seatbelt. You have to ask, ‘What’s my name?’” Marci Josephson, whose daughter Samantha was found murdered hours after she got into a car that she mistook for her Uber #WhatsMyName. That hashtag has been gaining ground on Twitter, part of a safety campaign started by University of South Carolina students, who are grappling with the murder of a fellow student. They’re imploring riders of Uber and Lyft to ask their drivers, “What’s my name?” before getting into a vehicle. The effort is in response to the death of Samantha Josephson, 21, who apparently got into a car she believed was her Uber in a busy downtown area of Columbia, S.C., late last month. Her body was found in the woods 70 miles away, and a 24-year-old man was quickly arrested on charges of kidnapping and murder. On Monday, Josephson’s parents introduced the website Whatsmyname.org to “educate the world on ride-share safety and the simple precautions one can take to ensure no other family has to suffer this unspeakable tragedy.” A week after the attack, three women who say they were raped by men posing as Uber drivers filed a lawsuit against the ride-hailing app, claiming that Uber knew fake drivers were targeting women but did not warn its customers. [READ MORE: They Thought It Was Their Uber. But the Driver Was a Predator.] Across the country, at least two dozen women have been attacked in recent years after making a mistake similar to Josephson’s. (In Connecticut, a man was recently arraigned on charges that he kidnapped and raped two women who thought he was their driver. In Chicago, prosecutors said a man who posed as an Uber driver sexually assaulted five women.) And a 2018 CNN report found that 103 Uber drivers and 18 Lyft drivers had been accused of sexual assault or abuse. Uber and Lyft have been criticized for not sufficiently evaluating their drivers and not prioritizing passenger safety, prompting some cities to place temporary bans or restrictions on the services. Both companies say passenger safety is their top priority and have stood by their background-check processes. After the attack on Josephson, Uber re-upped its public safety awareness campaign called “Check Your Ride,” first introduced in 2017, urging users to take certain precautions: Match the license plate, car make and model to what the app displays, and check the driver’s photograph before getting in. Of course, as critics put it: The onus should not be on women to vigilantly create safe spaces for themselves — and yet often it is. Here are a few safety tips I always abide by. ______ Ask the driver’s name. In addition to asking the driver for your name, ask your driver for his or her name and look closely to make sure the photo on the app matches. If the driver’s phone is mounted on the dashboard, look to see if it’s displaying your name. ______ Share your status. Share your trip details with friends through the sharing option on the app. By adding your destination and sharing through a text, others can watch your ride, in real time, on a map. Uber and Via monitor drivers’ routes, sending alerts to their staff if the cars go off course. ______ Match the light. Some Uber and Lyft vehicles have illuminated windshield icons called Beacon and Amp that change color to match a hue on a passenger’s app. If this is available to you, make sure the color matches. Lawmakers in South Carolina have proposed a law, named for Samantha Josephson, that would require it in all such vehicles. [READ MORE: Taking Uber?

2019,$2 and Some Pancakes Went Far at the 1969 Boston Marathon,"Essay Fifty years ago, in April 1969, I ran my first road race, and it was no local fun run or 5K. I decided to run the biggest road race there was: the Boston Marathon. I had no idea if I could finish the 26.2-mile grind, but I thought I should at least give myself a big challenge. I chose Boston in part because I didn’t know any better, and mostly because the world of running was very different back then. There were few runners and fewer races — only a handful of marathons across the country. Back then, Boston did not require runners to meet a qualifying standard. I was 34, and to run Boston you only had to send the race organizers $2 and a physician’s letter stating that you were healthy enough to run 26.2 miles. Since my longest training run had been 13 miles, I’m not sure how my doctor established my readiness, but he did. I had begun running less than a year earlier. In April 1968, I was a part of a small group that started New York magazine in a fourth-floor walk-up on 32nd Street, with writers such as Tom Wolfe, Jimmy Breslin and Gloria Steinem. We all put in long hours and six- or seven-day work weeks. Because of the late nights and too much junk food, I soon had to let my belt out a notch or two. That’s when I decided to start running, something I had not done since college. Each day, with stopwatch in hand, I ran around the block as fast as I could. Back home, I recorded my time in a diary. The next day, I tried to run faster. The entire workout took less than four minutes. One morning, I encountered a rare site: another runner. He was moving much slower than I was, but he explained that he was a long-distance runner who ran a half-dozen miles or more at a time. This was an entirely new concept to me. His name was Vince Chiappetta, and we soon began getting together for easy-pace runs. He told me he was president of something called the New York Road Runners Club (I would eventually be the organization’s chairman). He said he and several other club members ran the Boston Marathon every spring. In fact, he claimed that normal people like me could run Boston. He encouraged me to think about it. I was skeptical but got advice from two writers at Sports Illustrated who finished the 1968 Boston Marathon and who eagerly shared their expertise and enthusiasm with me, including a letter with instructions for a prerace breakfast: a bowl of oatmeal, an English muffin and a stack of pancakes washed down with orange juice and coffee. There was also this cautionary note: “When you drive out to the start at Hopkinton, do not drive over the actual course,” Walt Bingham and Andy Crichton wrote. “If you do, you will not want to return by foot.” Several weeks before the marathon, I called a mail order running outlet in Wellesley, Mass., to order a pair of Onitsuka Tiger Marathons, shoes with soles so thin you could step on a dime and tell “heads” from “tails.” I was ready, or so I hoped. Still, that Monday morning in Hopkinton seemed to last forever. The race began at noon, and at the starting area, as I milled about with more than 1,000 runners, I felt my anxiety rise. Finally, the starter’s pistol sent us on our way. The early miles seemed easy; they are mostly downhill at Boston. After the halfway point, I was in uncharted territory, farther than I had ever run before. What had I gotten myself into? Why hadn’t I trained more? Boston has four infamous hills between 16 and 21 miles, just where you don’t need them. The last is the dreaded Heartbreak Hill. I trudged up the first three, fearful about Heartbreak just ahead. Then I was on it, leaning steeply into the slope. Near the top, I heard a police officer on a bullhorn exhorting the runners. Suddenly, he was speaking directly to me: “No. 622, at the crest of the hill, you have five miles to go, and it’s all downhill.” I’ll never forget his next words: “Your achievement is superb and you have my fullest admiration.” I knew then that I would finish the Boston Marathon. And tears welled up in my eyes. The next evening, back in New York, I attended a dinner party. When someone said, “George ran the Boston Marathon yesterday,” all other conversation seemed to stop. David Susskind, the television talk-show host, started peppering me for more information. An hour later, as the party was breaking up, he had one last question for me: “George, do you know anyone else who ran yesterday and is a good talker?” Several nights later, I was on his show with Chiappetta, Crichton and a New Jersey cardiologist named George Sheehan. “Tonight’s guests all ran the Boston Marathon this week, all 22 miles of it,” Susskind said, and none of us corrected him about the distance. I have run a number of Bostons over the years, but this year my plans included running the accompanying 5K in downtown Boston on Saturday morning. Come Monday, I’ll be following the marathon closely — the winners, the midpack runners and the women, who now make up nearly 50 percent of the field compared with the handful who ran unofficially in 1969. I would advise them to skip the pancakes on marathon morning.",The New York Times
2019,"$3,000 to Rent a Movie? Bringing the Theater Home for the 1 Percent","WEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. — Fred Rosen, the retired Ticketmaster tycoon, was eating a melted ham-and-brie sandwich at the exclusive San Vicente Bungalows and spouting forth about belts. Yes, what people use to hold up their pants. You can buy one at Walmart for $4, he noted. Or you can get one at Gucci for $1,500. “Every product I can think of has a luxury version, which got me thinking,” Mr. Rosen said. “Why not movies?” It’s an idea that has captivated one entrepreneur after another over the years: For a high price, allow tech billionaires, Wall Street titans, professional athletes, Russian oligarchs and other ultra-wealthy people to rent movies — as soon as they come out in theaters — for viewing at home. Think of it like Netflix for one-percenters. But such upstarts have always sputtered, including one backed by Best Buy in 2013 that charged $500 per movie on top of $35,000 in setup costs. Film studios, fearful of angering theater chains, have been reluctant to participate. Piracy has also been a concern. Mr. Rosen, 75, and a septuagenarian golfing buddy, Dan Fellman, who is Hollywood’s foremost film distribution expert, may have finally figured out how to make it work. They have quietly founded Red Carpet Home Cinema, which rents first-run films for $1,500 to $3,000 each. Red Carpet has contracts with Warner Bros., Paramount, Lionsgate, Annapurna and Disney’s 20th Century Fox and Fox Searchlight divisions — resulting in some 40 movies annually, including blockbusters like “Aquaman” and “A Star Is Born.” Those partnerships reflect entertainment-industry relationships that Mr. Rosen and Mr. Fellman have cultivated over decades. Most studios do not see them as disrupters from Silicon Valley, something that has stalled start-ups like Screening Room, which has tried without success since 2016 to speed first-run movies to homes for a premium price. (Sean Parker of Napster and Facebook fame is behind that one.) Red Carpet also arrives at a time when the movie industry is undergoing sweeping change — not the least of which involves the manner in which Netflix is challenging the traditional way that films are released. For the most part, theater owners insist on a three-month period of exclusivity to play new films. Netflix has started to chip away at that practice, offering theaters an exclusive window of three weeks or less for films like “Roma” and “Bird Box.” Most studios see broader distribution change as inevitable, noted Harold L. Vogel, author of the textbook “Entertainment Industry Economics.” “Consumers want to have more control,” Mr. Vogel said. Even so, studios are treading carefully. None of the film companies that have signed on as Red Carpet partners would discuss the venture publicly. Several major movie operations, including Universal, Sony Pictures and Disney’s other labels, are Red Carpet holdouts. They also declined to comment. “I feel pretty comfortable that we can gain more studio partners,” Mr. Rosen said. “We are a niche offering — I’m too old for disruption — but even if a studio makes $25 million to $50 million annually from us, that’s found money.” Theater owners, in the meantime, seem to be taking a wait-and-see approach to Red Carpet. “I have no take on that,” said Adam Aron, chief executive of AMC Entertainment, the dominant theater chain in the United States. In contrast, Mr. Aron has readily criticized start-ups like MoviePass, the subscription ticketing service. The folksy Mr. Rosen, who took over Ticketmaster in 1982 and helped turn it into a goliath, and Mr. Fellman, who started his studio career in 1964, worked out details for Red Carpet over rounds of golf at the well-to-do Hillcrest Country Club in Los Angeles. The luxury service operates a bit like a private club. There is a rigorous application process, and participants must have a credit card with a limit of at least $50,000. Those who become customers must buy a $15,000 box that connects to a home theater system (installed by a technician) and comes loaded with piracy protections. Prices for rentals are set by the participating studios, with higher fees for blockbuster-style movies like “Shazam!” and lower costs for dramas like “The Shape of Water.” Each rental allows for two viewings in a 36-hour period. How big could Red Carpet get? There are more people who can afford it than you might think. Nearly 46,000 Americans have annual income of more than $2 million, according to Social Security Administration data from 2017. Mr. Rosen and Mr. Fellman, however, insisted over lunch in mid-March that they were not interested in size. “We’re not even looking for 10,000 people,” Mr. Rosen said. With fewer than 4,000 customers, Red Carpet could have $300 million in annual revenue, according to Mr. Fellman’s projections. Red Carpet, which counts Sherry Lansing, the former chief executive of Paramount, as an investor, has been operating in about 25 homes as part of a beta test since December. “I’m recommending the service to my friends,” the Red Carpet website quotes Ms. Lansing as saying. Mr. Fellman added: “I’m not interested in starting a business that is disruptive to the theatrical experience. Maybe we get 400 homes in New York and L.A. Maybe 100 in each of the 30 biggest cities in the United States.” (Celebrities and Hollywood big shots have long been able to see first-run films in their homes — free — as part of something known as the Bel-Air Circuit. Studios allow a limited number of preapproved V.I.P.s to “borrow” copies of new movies.) “We told studios, ‘You set the terms,’” Mr. Fellman said. “They appreciated that. What doesn’t work in Hollywood is going in and wagging a finger and saying, ‘This is how it’s going to be.’”",The New York Times

2019,$7 Million Trump Building Condo Tied to Scandal-Scarred Foreign Leader,"The Trump International Hotel and Tower in Manhattan, near the southwest corner of Central Park, is a 44-story building with a mix of luxury condominiums and hotel suites that go for more than $2,500 a night. Unit 32G, a two-bedroom, 1,767-square-foot apartment with sweeping views of the park, is owned by an entity called Ecree, which bought the condo in 2014 for $7 million in cash. Documents unearthed by the nonprofit group Global Witness show that the purchase was funded by the daughter of the Republic of Congo’s president, a longtime target of anti-corruption investigators. The funds for the all-cash purchase appear to have been siphoned from that country’s government, according to a report by Global Witness. The purchase took place more than two years before Donald J. Trump became president. Owners of units in the building — 1 Central Park West — pay tens of thousands of dollars a year in condo fees to Mr. Trump’s company, the Trump Organization. A spokeswoman for the Trump Organization, Kimberly Benza, said that Unit 32G had not recently been owned by the Trump Organization and that whoever bought it in 2014 purchased it from an unrelated party. She said the condo fees were for building-maintenance purposes “and are not fees paid to Trump for profit.” There is no indication that Mr. Trump or his company broke the law. Less than two years after the condo sale, federal regulators started requiring greater disclosures of purchases of certain high-end New York properties. Mr. Trump’s properties, which he and his family continue to operate, have a long history of serving as home to people with checkered pasts. David Bogatin, a Russian mobster, and Jean-Claude Duvalier, the Haitian dictator known as Baby Doc, both owned units in Trump Tower, the president’s flagship property on Manhattan’s Fifth Avenue. Felix Sater, a felon and former business associate of Mr. Trump’s, formerly had his office in that tower. Denis Sassou-Nguesso, the president of the Republic of Congo, is one of the world’s longest-sitting heads of state, having been in office for the past 22 years. For roughly a decade, he and his family have been the subject of corruption investigations in France. Authorities there have identified more than 60 million euros of luxury goods and real estate that the Sassou-Nguesso family owns in France. The country was a French colony until 1960. The Global Witness report alleges that a Cyprus company belonging to the president’s daughter, Claudia Sassou-Nguesso, bankrolled the purchase of the Trump apartment in July 2014. (The Portuguese newspaper Expresso has previously reported on aspects of the purchase and its connection to the daughter of the president of the Republic of Congo.) A spokesman for President Sassou-Nguesso and a representative at the Republic of Congo’s embassy in Washington did not respond to requests for comment. Global Witness — which is funded in part by the billionaire George Soros’s foundation — followed a money trail that began with a Brazilian company receiving a series of lucrative public contracts from the Republic of Congo’s government. Money from one of those contracts wound up in the bank account of a company in Cyprus, according to the report. Ownership of the company was transferred to Ms. Sassou-Nguesso in July 2013. In January 2014, the Cyprus company received nearly $20 million, apparently in Republic of Congo taxpayer funds, through a contract with the country’s government, according to a Portuguese police report reviewed by Global Witness. Six months later, the Cyprus company paid for Unit 32G in the Trump building on Columbus Circle. A 2006 real estate listing for the corner apartment shows floor-to-ceiling windows with northern and western views, a bathroom with pink marble walls and golden fixtures and “capacious closets.” The building is outfitted with a spa, swimming pool and 24-hour food service. Letters cited by Global Witness and reviewed by The New York Times show that a Portuguese businessman, José Veiga, wrote reference letters on behalf of the president’s granddaughter to the condo association ahead of the sale. He called her “one of my best friends” and said she would be a “valued addition” to the Trump property. It is unclear what sort of background check, if any, the Trump Organization did on the purchase financed by Ms. Sassou-Nguesso. A lawyer for Mr. Veiga, who Portuguese authorities have arrested on suspicion of money laundering, declined to comment. According to New York real estate records, the entity used to make the purchase, Ecree, used a Manhattan address at the law firm K&L Gates. Unlike banks and other financial institutions, United States real estate developers have typically not been subject to rules that require they vet the backgrounds or sources of money of prospective buyers, including looking out for potential money laundering. In 2016, in the wake of a series of Times articles on the suspicious funds behind luxury real estate purchases around the country, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, part of the Treasury Department, started requiring title companies to report all-cash purchases of some expensive residential properties in Manhattan and Miami. Global Witness called on the Trump Organization to clarify whether it was continuing to receive maintenance fees on Unit 32G, “as there is a risk that these companies may be currently enabling money laundering of public funds embezzled by the Congolese president’s daughter and benefitting from those illicit funds.” Peter Jones, one of the authors of the report, called on the Justice Department to join French law enforcement and consider seizing the apartment because it appeared to have been purchased with embezzled money.",The New York Times
2019,"$875,000 Homes in North Carolina, Wisconsin and California","What you Get A renovated 1835 sawmill in Greensboro, a Gilded Age condominium in Milwaukee and a seaside house in Sonoma County. 24 Photos View Slide Show › In the 1920s, Katheryn Pettygrew, a New Yorker with a Southern pedigree, bought an abandoned mill 10 miles east of Greensboro and used salvaged lumber and bits of the original machinery to convert it into a private retreat. After she made it over, the property became known as the Katydid Mill, but she described it as “Grand Central Station” in a 1939 article published in the Indianapolis Star, because of the number of people who dropped by to ogle. The house was also featured in a 1940 issue of American Home Magazine. It is about 25 minutes from Winston-Salem, N.C., 35 minutes from Durham and one hour from Raleigh. Size: 3,700 square feet Price per square foot: $236 Indoors: Extensive stonework, weathered paneling and stair spindles created from plow handles are rustic reminders of the original mill, as are the water wheels on the back of the building and the millrace that runs beneath it. The 900-square-foot living room has pine walls, floors and ceilings. The stone fireplace opposite the front door has a wood-slab mantel. A sliding barn door leads to the 40-foot-long, 13-foot-wide glass-walled dining room and kitchen (formerly the saw room). The step at the threshold is a semicircle cut from an old wooden wheel, and the original mill wheel that drove the machinery still protrudes through the floor. The owners installed the large granite-topped island and replaced the cabinets with custom designs modeled on a 1795 cupboard made in North Carolina. The walls are clad in poplar bark. The master bedroom is behind the kitchen and has three large windows that look out to a dam and waterfall. The en suite bathroom has a shower lined in subway tile, a slipper tub, ceramic-tile flooring resembling brick, a built-in linen cabinet and a washer and dryer. There is also a screened porch. Two additional bedrooms are upstairs. One has whitewashed paneled ceilings and walls, the other barn-wood shiplap walls and a tin ceiling. They share a whitewashed bathroom with double pedestal sinks and the house’s original claw-foot tub. A wooden footbridge over the raceway leads to the entrance (a Dutch door) of the gabled guest cottage. The owners added a river-stone fireplace to the corner of the living room and updated the 90-square-foot kitchen with a Wolf range and Sub-Zero refrigerator. Upstairs are a bedroom and a recently renovated bathroom with a walk-in glass-and-marble-tile shower.

2019,"'White Power’ Symbol Was Found at Site of Fire, Civil Rights Center Says","A social justice center in Tennessee with deep connections to the civil rights movement said that a fire that engulfed its main office last week may have been intentionally set, after a “symbol connected to the white power movement” was found spray-painted in the parking lot. The organization, the Highlander Research and Education Center, which trained Rosa Parks and hosted the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., said it had lost decades of documents and artifacts in the fire at its campus in New Market, Tenn., outside Knoxville. “Because of our history we are not surprised that this space, one where marginalized people working across sectors, geographies and identities show up consistently, has been repeatedly targeted over our 87 years of existence,” Highlander said in a statement this week acknowledging the white power symbol. The Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office and the Tennessee State Fire Marshal’s Office were investigating. A spokesman for the fire marshal’s office said on Wednesday that investigators had not determined the cause of the fire. The sheriff’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Sheriff Jeff Coffey told The Knoxville News Sentinel that the authorities had found graffiti at the scene that looked like a hashtag. The paper published a photo of the graffiti, which the Anti-Defamation League identified as a symbol that originated with the Iron Guard, a fascist movement in Romania in the 1930s and ’40s. It was unclear when the symbol was painted. Mark Pitcavage, who studies hate symbols for the Anti-Defamation League, said the symbol was relatively obscure, but had been resurrected by some right-wing extremist groups. Most recently, he said, the man accused of killing 50 people last month at mosques in New Zealand had the symbol painted on one of his guns. The United States has seen a rise in the number of hate crimes and hate groups in recent years, including a marked jump in the number of white nationalist groups. Most hate groups in the United States espouse some form of white supremacist ideology, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. The uptick has left many on edge, including people at the Highlander center, which said, “Now is not the time to dismiss how scary things are.” Since 2016, the center said, “the white power movement has become more visible, and we’ve seen that manifest in various ways, both subtle and overt.” The center, which was founded as the Highlander Folk School in Monteagle, Tenn., in 1932, originally focused on organizing unemployed and working people and brought union organizers together for interracial workshops. But it soon became an incubator for the civil rights movement. In the 1950s, it developed a literacy program that taught thousands of black people to read and write in an effort to help them register to vote. In 1955, Ms. Parks attended a civil rights workshop at Highlander, just a few months before she refused to give up her seat on a bus, sparking the Montgomery bus boycott in protest of segregated seating. In 1957, with Ms. Parks in attendance, Dr. King gave closing remarks at a conference marking the Highlander school’s 25th anniversary. The unofficial anthem of the civil rights movement, “We Shall Overcome,” also has ties to the Highlander center. The school’s music director learned an original version of the song from tobacco workers and taught it to Pete Seeger, whose adaptation spread around the country. The school’s policies, theories and association with high-profile civil rights figures often drew the attention of the authorities. It was investigated for Communist ties in the late 1950s and later shut down in 1961 by the state of Tennessee for holding integrated classes, among other complaints. The school reopened the next day as the Highlander Research and Education Center, according to the center’s website. It has been at its current campus in New Market since 1972. The Wisconsin Historical Society, which maintains the center’s archives, including audio recordings and photographs, said that a majority of its records were safe in Wisconsin. But the staff at the Highlander center said the “devastating” fire had destroyed “decades of historic documents, speeches, artifacts and memorabilia from movements of all kinds, including the civil rights movement.” Despite the fire, the Highlander center vowed to continue to be a “sacred place” for marginalized groups. “This is a time for building our power,” the statement said. “Now is the time to be vigilant. To love each other and support each other and to keep each other safe in turbulent times.”",The New York Times
2019,"1 in 5 Bus Riders in New York City Evades the Fare, Far Worse Than Elsewhere","[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] The Q65 bus came to a stop along a residential block in Queens and a construction worker stepped onboard. He walked past the farebox without paying. The driver pushed the F5 button on his dashboard. At the next stop, an older woman with a cane climbed on and gave the driver a hearty wave. She, too, did not pay. Again the driver pressed F5. Over two and a half hours, the driver pressed F5 — the button that records fare evaders — at least 50 times, and there was still a half-hour left on his morning route. “It’s getting worse,” said the driver, Luis, who declined to provide his full name because he did not have permission to discuss his job. “How many? On my bus, hundreds a day. Hundreds with an ‘s.’” Transit officials recently announced a remarkable figure: One in five bus riders in New York City does not pay the fare. The statistic stunned even Andy Byford, the leader of the subway and bus system, who said it was “wholly unacceptable” and at least double the rate of other cities across the world. “We look at what other transit authorities are suffering, and this now really stands out as an outlier,” Mr. Byford said. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the agency that oversees the subway and buses, says fare evasion is on the rise on the subway and buses, costing the system $225 million in lost revenue last year. But the problem is far worse on buses, where nearly 22 percent of riders do not pay, compared with 3.4 percent of subway riders. An informal survey on several routes found that fare evasion was widespread and the reasons varied. Riders did not have exact change. They knew they would not get in trouble. And some simply felt no obligation to pay for a transit system plagued by unreliable service and constant fare increases. On a recent morning, a man and two children boarded a BX19 bus in the Bronx through the back door without paying the $2.75 fare. Standing across the street, Charisma Howard said she sometimes skipped the fare, too, and did not feel bad about it. “There have been times when I’m fiddling with my purse or carrying my children, and I walk past the driver,” she said. “Do I feel guilty? No, I don’t feel guilty. The service is so bad on the buses, the train, everything. A lot of people feel the same way.” On the Q65 bus in Queens, Jose Castillo, the construction worker, confessed that he could not afford the fare. “O.K., listen,” he told the driver. “I don’t have any money. I’m just trying to get to work.” The bus driver shrugged. There was nothing he could really do. A confrontation with a rider could hold up the bus — or, worse, lead to violence. Cities across the world are grappling with fare evasion, though it is far worse in New York. In Paris, the fare evasion rate for buses is 11 percent, while in Toronto it is 5 percent, according to the local transit agencies. The Paris transit system has 1,200 staff members dedicated to the problem and hands out about one million fines each year. In London, where riders face fines as high as $1,300, the fare evasion rate on buses is only 1.5 percent. But in Washington, where about 14 percent of bus riders do not pay, the D.C. Council recently went in the other direction, approving lighter penalties because of concerns about targeting low-income riders. In New York, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who controls the transportation authority, has pressed transit leaders to tackle fare evasion as part of his plans to address the system’s financial crisis. On the subway, loud alarms were installed at some emergency exits to dissuade riders who use them to sneak inside. New signs warn: “Fare Evasion Will Cost You.” On city buses, which carry more than two million people each day, Mr. Byford suggested sending police officers onboard to enforce the rules. “The big thing we’re missing is we need cops on buses,” Mr. Byford said at a recent transit board meeting. But his comments drew an immediate backlash from critics, who said the move would “exacerbate the over-policing of communities of color.” Fare evasion arrests have disproportionally targeted black and Hispanic men. Mr. Byford later clarified that he did not want to see more arrests, but that the presence of officers would discourage riders from breaking the rules. “I’d love it if no one actually got caught,” Mr. Byford said. The authority’s new chairman, Patrick J. Foye, said he also did not want to focus on arrests and wanted to find other solutions. He said the rollout of a new fare payment system using smartphones, which starts in May, would make it easier to check if someone paid the fare. “I do not believe in criminalizing fare evasion,” Mr. Foye said at a recent State Senate hearing. Riders who fail to pay the fare can receive a civil summons with a $100 fine. They can also be arrested on a “theft of services” charge, a misdemeanor carrying up to a year in jail, if they have a history of similar arrests or lack valid identification. Transit advocates say the prevalence of fare evasion reflects how many New Yorkers struggle to pay for the basics, like subway and bus fares. After intense lobbying by advocates, Mayor Bill de Blasio introduced a discount program this year that provides half-price MetroCards for poor New Yorkers. But it included far fewer people than expected. For bus drivers, striking the right balance between enforcing the rules and avoiding conflict with riders is difficult and, sometimes, dangerous. In 2008, a bus driver was stabbed to death by a rider who did not pay his fare — the first slaying of a city bus driver in more than 27 years. In response, the authority offered classes to drivers on defusing tense situations and added plastic partitions between drivers and passengers. When a passenger refuses to pay, transit officials say the bus driver should politely say the price. If that does not work, bus drivers are told to press the F5 button and continue boarding other passengers. Luis, the Queens bus driver, said safety was always on his mind. “What if I said, ‘Hey, you’ve got to pay.’ You don’t know if he’s armed with a knife or gun. I have this,” he said, pointing to his partition. “But this isn’t going to stop a bullet or someone from reaching over.” Fare evasion has been far less of a problem on the city’s Select Bus Service routes — faster buses that account for 13 percent of bus ridership, where customers pay before boarding. The fare evasion rate on those buses is only 2.5 percent, a figure that is low partly because M.T.A. employees, known as “eagle teams,” patrol buses to ticket riders who do not pay. The agency is testing using the teams on regular buses. Some transit advocates question the M.T.A. statistics and say officials are inflating the problem. The figures are based on observations along 140 of the 317 city bus routes that are extrapolated for the entire system. The agency does not even use the tally from bus drivers pressing the F5 button — that figure is used only to identify “hot spots” for fare evasion. Back on the Q65 bus in Queens, Marty Ross admitted that he once skipped the fare because he forgot his MetroCard and did not have enough change. “It happens to everyone,” said Mr. Ross, 68, of the Bronx. “Not everyone can pay every day.” But another rider, Kevin Molina, a 23-year-old landscaper, said fare beaters hurt paying riders. “I’ve never done it,” he said. “I pay my fair share. Those who don’t pay make the prices go up for the rest of us.”",The New York Times
2019,10 Dance Performances to See in N.Y.C. This Weekend,"Our guide to dance performances happening this weekend and in the week ahead. ‘DANCING THE GODS’ at Symphony Space (April 27, 8 p.m.; April 28, 7 p.m.). This program of classical Indian dancing offers two separate programs on back-to-back evenings. On Saturday, the Maryland-based Kalanidhi Dance presents “Rasa,” a work inspired by the Sanskrit epic “Ramayana”; it embodies a range of emotions from disgust to wonderment through the South Indian Kuchipudi style. On Sunday, Sujata Mohapatra will perform in the Odissi style, accompanied by live music. The two styles, while sharing similarities, are distinguished by their music, costumes and contrasting physical emphases. Together they provide a look at two facets of classical Indian dance as interpreted by skilled artists. 212-864-5400, symphonyspace.org CHANEL DASILVA, BOBBI JENE SMITH AND MICAELA TAYLOR at Gibney (May 2-3, 8 p.m.; through May 4). Gibney’s new Emerge initiative gives up-and-coming choreographers the chance to create pieces for the Gibney Dance Company. The three artists invited this year are the Brooklyn native DaSilva, a former member of the Trey McIntyre Project; Smith, a fearless alum of the Batsheva Dance Company now making her own engagingly visceral work; and the Los Angeles-based Taylor, who fuses hip-hop and contemporary dance to often startling and surprising effect. 646-837-6809, gibneydance.org DIG DANCE at the 92nd Street Y (April 26, 8 p.m.; April 27, 4 and 8 p.m.). This recurring dance series travels to the Emerald Isle this week with “New Dance Ireland: Choreographers of Nowness,” featuring a handful of choreographers, each of whom explore Irish identity and dance from a different angle. Participants include Jean Butler, Darrah Carr, Sean Curran and John Scott, among others, who are mixed and matched over three programs. For this week’s installment of Fridays at Noon, Scott also curates excerpts from many of these choreographers alongside a panel discussion moderated by Siobhan Burke, a dance critic for The New York Times. 212-415-5500, 92y.org E-MOVES at Harlem Stage (May 2-4, 7:30 p.m.; through May 11). This performance space’s annual dance series celebrates its 20th anniversary with two programs on consecutive weekends focusing on the social potency of hip-hop dance. Program A is anchored by “She’sus,” by the collective FLUXX. The work examines the experiences of black women and appears with a piece by Joseph Webb and Baredu Ahmed, as well as one by Sun Kim and Cein Lockefeller called “Funk in Love.” The following weekend, Program B features two works by Ousmane Wiles, also known as Omari Mizrahi, including a new one that explores the good and bad aspects of relationships. That program is rounded out with pieces by Faustin Linyekula and Moya Michael, as well as a short work about female empowerment by the artist TweetBoogie. 212-281-9240, harlemstage.org JONATHAN GONZÁLEZ at Abrons Arts Center (May 2-4, 8 p.m.). Last week at MoMA PS1, González invited visitors to enter its geodesic dome, one by one, to contemplate larger societal questions of sustainable living and individual ones about identity. That work was “Lucifer Landing I,” and this week, González continues the conversation at Abrons with “Lucifer Landing II,” which also features a geodesic dome. In this iteration, which González calls an opera, he further explores modern blackness, public housing and human-object intersections by drawing from influences as varied as the futurist Buckminster Fuller and the activist collective CHARAS. González is the sole performer, though he is accompanied by a number of live musicians. 866-811-4111, abronsartscenter.org [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] GRUPPO NANOU at La MaMa Theater (April 26-27, 8 p.m.; April 28, 5 p.m.). The annual La MaMa Moves! festival of contemporary dance features local and global artists hailing from China, South Korea and Norway, among other countries. This Italian troupe kicks things off with “We Want Miles, in a Silent Way,” which draws inspiration from three albums by Miles Davis that span more than a decade. Here’s the catch: Davis’s indispensable trumpet has been removed from the scores, which the creators said in press materials allowed them to explore the “perceptive destabilization” that Davis sought. The remaining rhythms and underlying structure provide a blueprint over which the choreographers Marco Valerio Amico and Rhuena Bracci layer free-flowing moves. 212-352-3101, lamama.org LUCY GUERIN INC. AND DANCENORTH at the Joyce Theater (April 29-May 1, 7:30 p.m.). The first of three programs that make up the Joyce’s two-week Australia Festival sees two of that continent’s most prominent dance makers, Lucy Guerin and Gideon Obarzanek, join forces for “Attractor,” an ecstatic fusion of dance and ritual. The Indonesian music pair Senyawa contributes a pounding, propulsive score inspired by the Javanese tradition of using dance to access a trancelike state, which members of the North Queensland-based company Dancenorth achieve with manic abandon. Select audience members will be invited to take part in the freakout as well. 212-242-0800, joyce.org NEW YORK CITY BALLET at the David H. Koch Theater (through June 2). City Ballet begins its spring season with work by living choreographers. A program appearing in two parts, “21st Century Choreographers” includes dances by William Forsythe, Alexei Ratmansky, Matthew Neenan, Gianna Reisen and Justin Peck, the company’s resident choreographer and artistic adviser. For the Spring Gala, on Thursday, Peck introduces a new piece, as does the shrewd and much-in-demand contemporary choreographer Pam Tanowitz — her first for City Ballet. Their works are paired with a Balanchine classic, and those looking for more of him can check out “All Balanchine” on Tuesday. 212-496-0600, nycballet.com SUNDAYS ON BROADWAY at Weis Acres (April 28, 6 p.m.). It’s been five years since Cathy Weis started this intimate series of one-night-only performances, readings and discussions in her downtown loft, bringing together veterans and newer voices. This season begins with the return of Eva Karczag and Vicky Shick, longtime colleagues who danced together in Trisha Brown’s company and here revisit a previous collaboration called “Your Blue Is My Purple.” Weis herself presents “Jury Duty.” The work pairs storytelling with a projected live feed of her dancing from different angles, which adds compelling visual layers to her words. cathyweis.org ‘WORKS AND PROCESS: REID BARTELME AND HARRIET JUNG’ at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum (April 28-29, 7:30 p.m.). The exhibition “Hymn to Apollo: The Ancient World and the Ballets Russes,” which opened at N.Y.U.’s Institute for the Study of the Ancient World (ISAW) in March, connects the dots between antiquity and Sergei Diaghilev’s famed 20th-century modernist ballet troupe. At this iteration of the Guggenheim’s show-and-tell series, in partnership with ISAW, the prolific costume design team of Bartelme and Jung takes inspiration from that exhibition and applies it to designs for two commissioned works by the choreographers Netta Yerushalmy and Christopher Williams. Both use the story of “Daphnis and Chloe” as their point of departure — one literal and one abstract. Bartelme and Jung also perform. 212-423-3575, worksandprocess.org",The New York Times
2019,10 New Books We Recommend This Week,"Editors’ Choice Troubling history lives on, vividly and urgently, in this week’s recommended books. Julián Herbert’s latest book revisits, with “shame and fury,” the massacre of 300 Chinese immigrants in the city of Torreón during the Mexican Revolution. Mark Bowden follows detectives as they crack open a 40-year-old cold case involving the disappearance of two sisters. “The Lions’ Den” examines how thinkers on the left have grappled with the idea and the reality of Israel. And the starkly titled “Hate” is about the history — and the present — of anti-Semitism in France. We also look at one of the year’s most highly anticipated novels, “Normal People,” Sally Rooney’s follow-up to “Conversations With Friends,” and at two debut novels: one comic and one terrifying. John WilliamsDaily Books Editor and Staff Writer NORMAL PEOPLE, by Sally Rooney. (Hogarth, $26.) Rooney’s second novel, following “Conversations With Friends,” was longlisted for the Man Booker Prize. It’s about Marianne and Connell, gifted teenagers from different social classes in Ireland. The book tracks them across four years. They are never quite boyfriend and girlfriend in the conventional sense. They “merely break each other’s hearts over and over again,” our critic Dwight Garner writes. Rooney’s “intimate and pared-down style can be reminiscent of Rachel Cusk’s,” Garner says, and her novels are satisfying “because there aren’t dueling narrators or cat’s cradles of plotlines. You buy Rooney’s ticket, you take her ride.” THE HOUSE OF THE PAIN OF OTHERS: Chronicle of a Small Genocide, by Julián Herbert. Translated from the Spanish by Christina MacSweeney. (Graywolf Press, $16.) The latest by Herbert, a Mexican writer and musician, tells the story of a massacre that took place in the city of Torreón, over the course of three days in 1911, during the Mexican Revolution. Three hundred Chinese immigrants were shot and bludgeoned to death in the streets. The crime has been misunderstood and misrepresented. But it has never been truly forgotten. Our critic Parul Sehgal writes: “The great strength of Herbert’s book, written with such shame and fury, is that it is not framed as epitaph but as dispatch from a live crime scene, attentive to the silences, the still seething resentments, relinquishing nothing to history.” CHARGED: The New Movement to Transform American Prosecution and End Mass Incarceration, by Emily Bazelon. (Random House, $28.) Prosecutors, often hoping for higher office, have embraced a tough-on-crime stance that gives them undue power, according to this riveting argument by a staff writer at The Times Magazine — at once an indictment and a call for reform. Bazelon persuasively indicts prosecutorial excess, arguing that the lawyers who work in the more than 2,000 prosecutors’ offices around the country bear much of the responsibility for over-incarceration, conviction of the innocent and other serious problems of the criminal justice system. THE LAST STONE, by Mark Bowden. (Atlantic Monthly, $27.) In this thoughtful, stirring true-crime tale, Bowden follows cold-case detectives as they crack a 40-year-old case involving the disappearance of two Maryland sisters — a story he covered at the time as a young reporter. Bowden shows how even the most exquisitely pulled-off interrogations are a messy business, in which exhaustive strategizing is followed by game-time gut decisions and endless second-guessing and soul-searching. SAVE ME THE PLUMS: My Gourmet Memoir, by Ruth Reichl. (Random House, $27.) A delicious account of a decade that took The Times’s former restaurant critic from the glory days of editing at Condé Nast to the morning when the office door was closed for good. Tantalizing recipes provide punctuation to her career twists and turns. THE LIONS’ DEN: Zionism and the Left From Hannah Arendt to Noam Chomsky, by Susie Linfield. (Yale University, $32.50.) Linfield tackles the fraught question of how Jewish thinkers of the left, devoted to universal values, contend with Israel, a country founded to solve the particularist problem of Jewish sovereignty. The heart of the book is a series of individual portraits of iconic, midcentury left-wing thinkers who wrote extensively on the idea and reality of Jewish statehood. Linfield is an associate professor of journalism at New York University and her writing combines the storytelling of a journalist with a scholar’s analysis of ideas. HATE: The Rising Tide of Anti-Semitism in France (and What It Means for Us), by Marc Weitzmann. (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, $26.) France has become a difficult place for Jews to live. Weitzmann details a number of recent incidents in which Jews have become the scapegoat in a nationalist moment looking for cosmopolitan, globalized elites as culprits. This impassioned book swirls from personal to historical reflections, setting out to understand the reasons for the scourge and to cut through what he sees as persistent French obfuscation of it. RIVER OF FIRE, by Qurratulain Hyder. (New Directions, paper, $19.95.) This epic novel of India’s partition gushes across more than 2,000 years of the subcontinent’s history. Hyder wrote it in Urdu, then again in English — a process she calls “transcreation” rather than translation. THE ALTRUISTS, by Andrew Ridker. (Viking, $26.) This comic and remarkably assured first novel charts the clash of expectations when a cash-starved widower’s two adult children return to the family home in St. Louis. Ridker’s ambitious blend of global perspective and intimate human comedy seems likely to evoke comparisons to the work of Jonathan Franzen and Nathan Hill. THE ALARMING PALSY OF JAMES ORR, by Tom Lee. (Soho, $23.) In this debut novel, an ordinary man wakes up one day transformed by a grotesque facial affliction. It’s a fresh take on Kafka, highlighting the potential for terrifying change that may lurk in our DNA. Lee explores themes of illness and the almost dystopian alienation that emerges between sufferers and the well, and does so with artfulness and delicious doses of body horror and contemporary British social satire.",The New York Times

The wind is whistling more sultrily as the director Daniel Fish’s seductive deconstruction arrives on Broadway by way of St. Ann’s Warehouse. Starring Damon Daunno and Rebecca Naomi Jones, this production recalibrates the score for a bluegrass band and is mostly, Jesse Green wrote, “audacious in ways that feel dead-on and delightful.”212-239-6200, oklahomabroadway.com ‘PLANO’ at the Connelly Theater (previews start on April 8; opens on April 13).

Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s monologue about a sexually compulsive young Londoner ends its relationship with New York. Maybe you’ve already seen the streaming series it spawned on Amazon, but as Ben Brantley reported, the live event “throbs with a concentrated, combustible vitality that a camera is incapable of capturing, even with pore-probing close-ups.” At this point, the chances of getting tickets are slim, but you can check the website daily for any that become available or wait in the cancellation line that forms at the box office an hour before the show.212-691-1555, sohoplayhouse.com ‘IF PRETTY HURTS UGLY MUST BE A ________’ at Playwrights Horizons (closes on April 5).

2019,10 Works Over 5 Years by Black Playwrights. All Intended to Unnerve.,"Spoiler alert: These 10 plays, presented in New York over a mere five years, intend to unnerve. Oftentimes, the most outrageous of plot twists are what make that happen. [How these black playwrights are challenging American theater | A radical moment in theater | Broadway on race] In an invigorating act of theatrical demolition, Mr. Jacobs-Jenkins resurrected — and exploded — Dion Boucicault’s dusty 19th-century melodrama about a doomed romance on a slaveholding plantation. This artfully layered play uses meta-theatrical monologues, strategic colorblind casting and an avalanche of cotton balls to explore the crippling absurdity of conventional ideas of race, then and now. Four of the white O’Mallery siblings gather by picnic tables for a party that is actually a decoy to the lure the crack addict fifth to an intervention. Ten minutes of low-rent hilarity later, after a blackout, the scene continues, but now the O’Mallerys are black. How that does and doesn’t change our view of them is the first of several detonations set off by this booby-trapped comedy. The show that proposes that we all might need a “safe word” when it comes to discussing race. This production from the innovative Lightning Rod Special begins as a middle school history lesson about the underground railroad. What follows is a boundary-crossing, id-plumbing portrait of an interracial love affair between the class’s teachers — Ms. Kidwell is black and Mr. Sheppard is white — that reminds us that theater still has the power to shock. This haunting, grief-steeped work, inspired by the shooting of 12-year-old Tamir Rice by a Cleveland police officer, imagines an afterlife in which the spirits of young black men try to comprehend how and why they died. The answers do not come easily, if at all. A choral tone poem of a play in which current history becomes an endless, cyclical nightmare. The winner of the 2019 Pulitzer Prize for Drama, this is a play created expressly to discomfort, and turn the tables on, its audience. A show that begins as a domestic sitcom reminiscent of “The Cosby Show” annotates, rewrites and ultimately dismantles itself, while asking acute and troubling questions about how the African-American experience is framed, contained and shrunken by the white gaze. Described by its author as both “an anger spittoon” and a means of creating “a space in the theater that is unrepentantly for and about black people,” this singular work combines song, dance, ritual, satirical sketches and monologues of mourning to conjure the mortal fear and loathing that rule black American lives in the era of Trayvon Martin and Sandra Bland. A jubilant and scary exercise in catharsis. For Moses and Kitch, poor young black men in a modern American city, the warm greeting “Yo, kill me now” is always answered with a reassuring “Bang bang.” That’s no metaphor; death, hovering so closely around them, may be the only thing they can confidently expect to achieve. If their rituals recall Beckett’s tramps in “Waiting for Godot,” they also reference plantation America and biblical Egypt; this is a tragedy too big for any one era to encompass. What at first seems like absurd plantation porn featuring slaves and overseers is soon revealed to be sex therapy role-play for contemporary interracial couples. Though the therapy focuses on the white “blind spot” in which black partners feel they disappear, the play as a whole is looking at something bigger: the dysfunction of the interracial partnership of America. Ralph, who’s white, and Leo, who’s black, have been pals since college, each thinking he is somehow beyond race. But when Leo is assaulted by police officers, hairline cracks in his sense of self gape open. To close them, he makes a shocking suggestion: that he become, for 40 days, Ralph’s slave. The experiment not only revises the relationships between the two men (and also their girlfriends) but our idea of how far past the past really is. Peaches is the boarding agent for African-American Airlines flight 1619 — the one taking all black citizens of the United States on a one-way trip to Africa. The shocker is that the exodus is so eagerly embraced, for reasons demonstrated in this anthology of mostly satirical sketches about racism run rampant. “If you stay here,” Peaches says, “you only got two choices for guaranteed housing, and that’s either a cell or a coffin.”",The New York Times
2019,"10 Years After an Exercise Study, Benefits Persist","Phys Ed The benefits of exercise may last longer than many of us might expect. The workouts we completed years ago may continue to influence and improve our health today, according to a fascinating new study of the current lives and health of people who joined an exercise study a decade before. The findings suggest that the benefits of exercise can be more persistent than many of us might expect, even if people are not exercising to the same extent as they previously did. But the impacts also may depend on the types and amounts of exercise involved. In medicine, lingering health consequences from experiments, known as legacy effects, are common and often commendable. Participants in past diabetes experiments, for instance, whose blood sugar was tightly controlled with diet, drugs or other methods, often had better heart health years later than diabetics outside of the study, even though the volunteers’ blood-sugar levels had risen in the interim. But whether exercise studies likewise produce legacy effects has been unknown, although the issue matters. We know from other science and disheartening personal experience that we lose much of our fitness and associated health benefits if we stop or reduce how much we exercise over the years. But do all of those gains disappear, or might exercise change us in some ways that stick with us? For the new study, which was published this week in Frontiers in Physiology, scientists at Duke University decided to find out. Most of the researchers had been involved a decade earlier in a large-scale exercise experiment called Strride (for Studies Targeting Risk Reduction Interventions through Defined Exercise). In that experiment, which ran from 1998 to 2003, hundreds of sedentary, overweight volunteers between the ages of 40 and 60 had remained inactive as a control group or begun exercising. Their exercise was either moderate, such as walking, or more vigorous, comparable to jogging, and lasted until people had burned at least several hundred calories per workout. Volunteers completed three session of their assigned workout each week for eight months, while scientists tracked changes to their aerobic fitness, blood pressure, insulin sensitivity and waist circumference. In general, each of those health markers improved in the people who exercised and not in the controls. The scientists then said farewell and did not get in touch with the participants again until about a decade later, when they contacted volunteers who still lived near Duke and asked if they would join a reunion study. More than a hundred, representing each of the exercise and control groups, said, sure. These men and women returned to the lab for new tests of their aerobic fitness and metabolic health. They also completed questionnaires about their current medical condition and medications and how often they exercised each week. Then the researchers started comparing results and found telling differences. Most of the men and women from the control group, who had not exercised 10 years before, had larger waistlines now, while the exercisers displayed little if any middle-aged spread compared to their decade-earlier selves. Those from the control group also were less fit now. Most had lost about 10 percent of their aerobic capacity, which is typical of the declines seen after about age 40, when most of us will lose about 1 percent of our fitness annually. But those men and women who had exercised vigorously for eight months during Strride retained substantially more fitness. On average, their aerobic capacity had fallen by only about 5 percent, compared to when they had joined the Strride study, and those few who reported still exercising at least four times a week were more fit now than they had been a decade before. Interestingly, those Strride volunteers who had walked — meaning their exercise had been moderate, not intense — did not seem to have enjoyed the same lasting fitness benefits as those who had exercised more vigorously. Most of them had shed about 10 percent of their aerobic capacity during the past decade, much like the controls. On the other hand, they showed surprisingly persistent improvements in their metabolic health, more so than among the intense exercisers. The walkers from 10 years ago still had healthier blood pressures and insulin sensitivity than they had had before joining Strride, even if they rarely exercised now. They had also had relatively healthier metabolisms than the men and women who had exercised intensely all those years before. Taken as a whole, these results suggest that “exercise is a powerful modulator of health, and some effects can be quite enduring,” says William Kraus, a professor of medicine and cardiology at Duke, who oversaw the new study. But the effects also can differ, depending on how hard someone works out, he says. To build and maintain high endurance, we may have to sweat and strain. But to better our metabolic health, a walk likely will do. Of course, this study does not explain how exercise alters our body in ways that last. We may, in part, be building a physiological reserve, Dr. Kraus says. Raise aerobic capacity or improve insulin sensitivity with exercise, and even as those measures decline later with inactivity and age, we will be better off than if we had never worked out. Exercise also probably leaves long-lasting imprints on our genes and cells that affect health, Dr. Kraus says. He and his colleagues hope to investigate those issues in coming studies, so that we can better appreciate how past exercise might echo through our bodies well into the future.",The New York Times
2019,11 New Books We Recommend This Week,"Editors’ Choice This week we bring you four memoirs and one near-memoir, ranging from a family history of old money (Janny Scott’s “The Beneficiary”) to an immigrant’s account of abuse and displacement (Grace Talusan’s “The Body Papers”), from a queer coming-of-age memoir (T Kira Madden’s “Long Live the Tribe of Fatherless Girls”) to a celebrated biographer’s description of his methods (Robert A. Caro’s “Working”). The near-memoir? That belongs to the timeless Beat writer Lawrence Ferlinghetti, who with “Little Boy” has published an autobiographical debut novel at the age of 100. You’ll also find a couple of environmental books — one about our landscapes and man-made spaces, the other about humanity’s uncertain future — along with poetry, novels new and old, and a story collection from one of Kenya’s greatest living writers. Gregory CowlesSenior Editor, BooksTwitter: @GregoryCowles BABY, I DON’T CARE, by Chelsey Minnis. (Wave, $18.) The poems in Minnis’s fifth collection play with notions taken from Hollywood’s golden era and film noir. (She thanks Turner Classic Movies in her acknowledgments.) It is “one of the most unusual and persuasive books of poems I’ve read in some time,” our critic Dwight Garner writes. “In her direct access to pain and sometimes wit, her knack for absurdity and disturbance, she can resemble poets as diverse as Anne Sexton and Patricia Lockwood.” THE STREET and THE NARROWS, by Ann Petry. (Library of America, $35.) Ann Petry’s first novel, “The Street,” was a literary event in 1946, praised and translated around the world — the first book by a black woman to sell more than a million copies. The Library of America recently published “The Street” in one volume along with Petry’s 1953 masterpiece, “The Narrows,” and a sampling of her critical writing. “Petry wrote unabashed protest art, in the mode of Steinbeck and Stephen Crane,” our critic Parul Sehgal writes. “Her kind of talent will always feel startling and sui generis.” THE BODY PAPERS: A Memoir, by Grace Talusan. (Restless, $22.99.) In this precise, delicately constructed memoir-in-essays, Talusan writes about her experience as an immigrant to the United States, her survival of childhood abuse and returning to visit the Philippines, her native country. “Talusan has the instincts of a storyteller, teasing out her narrative through images and allusion,” our critic Jennifer Szalai writes. The book “doesn’t track a one-way march to triumph from adversity; Talusan’s essays loop in on themselves, as she retrieves old memories and finds unexpected points of connection.” WORKING: Researching, Interviewing, Writing, by Robert A. Caro. (Knopf, $25.) In a collection of pieces that is unusually short for Caro, he offers his observations on his career as a biographer and historian, describing his commitment to getting all the details of a story and relating the lengths he is willing to go to in order to empathize with the people he is writing about. Our reviewer, Harold Evans, calls it an “iridescent” book and applauds the author’s “tenacity, his charm and his investigative genius, no other word for it.” Caro, he says, has “measurably enriched our lives with his intellectual rigor, his compassion, his openness, his wit and grace.” NAAMAH, by Sarah Blake. (Riverhead, $26.) Life on the ark after the Great Flood is filtered through the consciousness of Noah’s wife, Naamah, in this sensual and evocative first novel, a delirious contemporary riff on an Old Testament climate catastrophe. Reviewing it, Joan Silber calls the novel a “wild and superbly intelligent reimagining” that avoids the pitfalls of biblical retellings. “Blake can invoke prodigious events in plain yet properly large terms,” she writes, and “there’s an amused sanity under the gravitas.” THE BENEFICIARY: Fortune, Misfortune, and the Story of My Father, by Janny Scott. (Riverhead, $28.) Scott, a former reporter for The Times, explores the consequences of generations of inherited Main Line wealth as played out in her own family — especially through the lens of her alcoholic father, affectionately and mockingly called “the duke” by his wife and children. “It is often very funny, with some moments paced like a drawing room comedy,” Michael Gorra writes in his review. “Yet the duke inherited something more (or other) than money, and what comes to dominate his daughter’s narrative is her sense of wealth’s ‘misfortune.’” FALTER: Has the Human Game Begun to Play Itself Out?, by Bill McKibben. (Holt, $28.) McKibben, a veteran environmental writer, is never hectoring or hyperbolic; here, he turns the possibility of human extinction (from climate change, artificial intelligence, etc.) into an absorbing analysis with a glimmer of hope tempered by cold realism. “Some people hope that world problems will be solved by advanced new technologies,” Jared Diamond writes in his review. “Considering each such technology in turn, McKibben explains his skepticism about its hoped-for benefits, and his concerns about potential undesirable side effects.” THE ABSENT HAND: Reimagining Our American Landscape, by Suzannah Lessard. (Counterpoint, $26.) Half memoir, half cri de coeur, this book by a former New Yorker writer seeks to understand how our malls, green expanses and urban spaces reflect on our humanity. “Lessard devotes much of the book to exploring what she terms America’s ‘atopia,’ our vast, seemingly unplanned, inchoate, exurban sprawl, which remains to her largely inscrutable and tragic,” Michael Kimmelman, The Times’s chief architecture critic, writes in his review. “She writes about such places from what you might call an exalted literary remove. The mode is epistolary, poetic, occasionally honest to a fault … and moral.” LONG LIVE THE TRIBE OF FATHERLESS GIRLS: A Memoir, by T Kira Madden. (Bloomsbury, $27.) In telling this vast, arresting story of loving addicts, of a queer sexual awakening, of inhabiting a female, biracial body in America, of assault, the author displays her gift for salient detail. “It’s a eulogy and a love song,” our reviewer, Tessa Fontaine, writes. “It’s about girls and the women they become. And it’s all compulsively readable, not just because of those big themes, but because of the embodied, needle-fine moments that make the stories sing.” LITTLE BOY, by Lawrence Ferlinghetti. (Doubleday, $24.) The iconic poet and activist, who just celebrated his 100th birthday, uses this autobiographical novel to recount his life story in a free association of flashes and arias, of high and low culture. Ferlinghetti has the appealing old-fashioned enthusiasm of an autodidact. “No one’s biography has more completely or ardently embodied the visions and contradictions, the achievements and calamities, the social mobility and social animosities, of that life span,” Robert Pinsky writes in his review. “Ferlinghetti has not just survived for a century: He epitomizes the American culture of that century.” MINUTES OF GLORY: And Other Stories, by Ngugi wa Thiong’o. (New Press, $24.99.) The Kenyan writer’s collection of short fiction tackles the absurdities, injustices and fortitude of people testing new ways against the old. “What shines through in Ngugi’s stirring pages is a hopeful message,” Delia Owens writes in her review. “Even after generations of foreign then domestic repression, spiritual confusion, drought and hunger, the resilient spirit — a gathering of real souls — lives on in Africa, no matter whose ghost or god is worshiped.”",The New York Times

2019,"12 Pop, Rock and Jazz Concerts to Check Out in N.Y.C. This Weekend","Our guide to pop and rock shows and the best of live jazz happening this weekend and in the week ahead. TONY BENNETT at Radio City Music Hall (April 13, 8 p.m.). For the better part of a century, this decorated singer from Astoria, Queens, has championed the great American songbook, bewitching audiences with renditions of pop and jazz standards by Cole Porter, Irving Berlin and others. More recently, the 20-time Grammy Award winner introduced himself to younger generations with a series of “Duets” albums, on which he sang alongside contemporary artists like Lady Gaga, John Legend and Amy Winehouse. Bennett still actively tours at the age of 92 and, per the title of his most recent book, is “just getting started.”212-465-6000, radiocity.com LAURA JANE GRACE & THE DEVOURING MOTHERS at Bowery Ballroom (April 18, 7 p.m.). This trio is a side project of Grace’s, whose work as the frontwoman of the Florida punk band Against Me! has highlighted her experiences as a transgender woman, particularly on albums like “Transgender Dysphoria Blues” and “Shape Shift With Me.” Alongside her Devouring Mothers — the drummer Atom Willard (also in Against Me!) and the bassist Marc Jacob Hudson — Grace writes more restrained songs that retain hints of her punkish invective. At this Lower East Side club, the trio will receive support from the New Jersey-based rock group Mercy Union and the Philadelphia-based noise-punk band Control Top. 212-260-4700, mercuryeastpresents.com ‘LIVE FROM HERE’ at the Town Hall (April 13, 5:45 p.m.). The mandolinist Chris Thile had already taken over hosting duties on the weekly radio variety show “A Prairie Home Companion” before its original host, Garrison Keillor, fell from grace. This rebranded program, like its predecessor, is recorded before a live audience, often traveling from its home base in St. Paul to theaters around the country. Among the guests at this week’s taping in Midtown is Sara Bareilles, the pop singer behind radio hits like “Love Song” and “King of Anything.” She shares the bill with the folk duo Milk Carton Kids and the comedian Aparna Nancherla. 212-997-6661, thetownhall.org NATALIE PRASS at Bowery Ballroom (April 17, 8 p.m.). As this singer-songwriter from Richmond, Va., knows, creating art with a political point of view can be risky. Her second album, last year’s “The Future and the Past,” was written largely in response to the 2016 presidential election; finding a label willing to release it took her longer than she had hoped. In the past year, Prass has toured the album tirelessly, as both a headliner and a supporting artist on Kacey Musgraves’s “Oh, What a World” Tour. On this stop, she’ll perform funk-flavored pop songs like “Oh My” and “Short Court Style,” as well as more orchestral holdovers from her 2015 debut. 212-260-4700, mercuryeastpresents.com [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] PRETTY LOU’S THIRD ANNUAL CHARITY CONCERT at Irving Plaza (April 16, 6 p.m.). The New York hip-hop community rallied around the Brooklyn-based D.J., nightlife personality and Fat Joe affiliate Pretty Lou Ortega (not to be confused with the member of the 1990s rap group Lost Boyz, whose moniker he shares) after he learned he had the rare blood condition aplastic anemia, which has since developed into leukemia. In its third year, this annual showcase benefiting leukemia and A.L.S. research will feature Fat Joe and his fellow Terror Squad member Remy Ma, as well as Raekwon and Ghostface Killah of the Wu-Tang Clan, the Diplomats and others. 212-777-6800, mercuryeastpresents.com PRIESTS at Elsewhere (April 16, 8 p.m.). The members of this trio from Washington have long pushed back on the “political punk” label that critics often affix to their work; still, how they earned it is clear. The debut record from these firebrands is colored by brash guitars and the muscular vocals of their frontwoman, Katie Alice Greer, whose lyrics broach subjects like consumerism and free will. Riffing on the name of Thomas Frank’s 2004 book on the rise of populist conservatism, Priests titled their just-released follow-up “The Seduction of Kansas.” This album is similarly concerned with American politics and identity; this time, though, their sound is more polished. elsewherebrooklyn.comOLIVIA HORN EMMET COHEN TRIO at Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola (April 16, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). Cohen, 28, has a breezy, phlegmatic command at the keyboard, and a deep well of historical jazz references at his fingertips. He has worked as a side musician for such luminaries as Christian McBride and Herlin Riley, and has recorded with the elder statesmen Ron Carter and Jimmy Cobb. If he wasn’t already an obvious heir apparent to the neo-traditional jazz mantle, his win at last weekend’s 2019 American Pianists Awards ought to make it official. At Dizzy’s, he will be joined by the bassist Philip Norris and the drummer Kyle Poole. They will draw some of the night’s material from Cohen’s recent trio album, “Dirty in Detroit.”212-258-9595, jazz.org/dizzys MIHO HAZAMA AND M_UNIT at Jazz Standard (April 17, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). The crossbreeding of classical and jazz has a long history, stretching back to the Third Stream movement of the 1960s. And new approaches to this amalgam have been thick on the ground of late: Just try to count how many young jazz musicians are writing for string quartet these days. One of the boldest thinkers and most delightful composers in this vein is Hazama, who studied Western classical music in Japan before making the jump to jazz. Her chamber orchestra, m_unit, blends strings and horns and mallet percussion in service of her resplendent, highly singable compositions. At the Standard, the group will be playing selections from the recently released “Dancer in Nowhere.”212-576-2232, jazzstandard.com BEN MONDER, TONY MALABY AND TOM RAINEY at Public Records (April 17, 8 p.m.). This newly opened music club, cafe and bar in Gowanus, Brooklyn, has a high-fidelity sound setup in two different rooms. In the back, which is laid out like a typical nightclub, electronic and experimental shows run throughout the week. Every Wednesday going forward, the barroom hosts a weekly jazz series. The group playing this Wednesday is a trio featuring three esteemed, New York-based improvisers with a long history of collaboration: the dark-toned, harmonically sophisticated guitarist Ben Monder, the undersung saxophone titan Tony Malaby and the roving, idiosyncratic drummer Tom Rainey.publicrecords.nyc BRANDON ROSS’S PHANTOM STATION at the Jazz Gallery (April 12, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). Ross, a guitarist best known for his work in the jazz-rock power trio Harriet Tubman, doesn’t just play a slew of different instruments (banjo, soprano guitar, regular old electric guitar, etc.), he also ranges freely from sweet and lyrical playing to wavy, confrontational distortion. Phantom Station is not a band; it’s an opportunity for him to embrace his proclivity for newness and change. He performs under this name with a wide variety of collaborators and formations. On Friday, the ensemble will include Graham Haynes on cornet and electronics, J. T. Lewis (also a member of Harriet Tubman) on drums and Hardedge on sound design. 646-494-3625, jazzgallery.nyc STRETCH MUSIC FESTIVAL at Harlem Stage Gatehouse (April 12, 7:30 p.m.). The trumpeter Christian Scott aTunde Adjuah is about to close the book on a three-year residency at Harlem Stage. As part of that, since 2017 he has convened an annual Stretch Music Festival, comprising educational events, discussions of art and activism, and performances. (The event’s title is a reference to the way Scott refers to his own music; it’s an effort to wriggle free from the limitations of genre.) He is coming off the release last month of “Ancestral Recall,” an impressive album on which West African-derived rhythms and whispery synthesizers fortify his bristling trumpet playing and the strident, subversive poetry of Saul Williams. Friday’s festival will include performances by Scott, the saxophonist Logan Richardson and Freelance, a band that fuses contemporary R&B with backpacker hip-hop and jazz.212-281-9240, harlemstage.org JOHN ZORN’S NEW MASADA QUARTET at the Village Vanguard (April 14, 3 p.m.). Last year, Zorn, the eminent alto saxophonist and downtown arts organizer, released “The Book Beriah,” the final portion of his 613-song epic, “Masada,” a collection of experimental, often lovely compositions based in Jewish folk song, klezmer and free jazz (613 is the number of commandments, or mitzvot, in the Torah). As is the wont of this serial collaborator, Zorn featured a different ensemble on each of “Beriah’s” 10 CDs (11, including the bonus disc). Here he plays material from “Masada” in a new quartet featuring three talented improvisers: Julian Lage on guitar, Jorge Roeder on bass and Kenny Wollesen on drums. 212-255-4037, villagevanguard.comGIOVANNI RUSSONELLO",The New York Times
2019,"12 Pop, Rock and Jazz Concerts to Check Out in N.Y.C. This Weekend","Our guide to pop and rock shows and the best of live jazz happening this weekend and in the week ahead. GIRLPOOL at Music Hall of Williamsburg (April 24, 9 p.m.) and Bowery Ballroom (April 25, 7 p.m.). After appearing at this Brooklyn concert hall for a Tidal showcase last month, this duo of Harmony Tividad and Cleo Tucker return to play cuts from their latest record, “What Chaos Is Imaginary.” For about five years, the pair have transformed quandaries in love, friendship and growing up into cathartic singalongs like “123.” On this release, their formerly unison vocals are bifurcated, as Tucker — who recently came out as transgender — sings in a new tenor range across songs that traverse rock, punk and dream pop. The latter is the genre favored by the Australian singer Hatchie, who will open both shows.718-486-5400, musichallofwilliamsburg.com212-260-4700, mercuryeastpresents.com NINA KRAVIZ AND JAMES MURPHY at Knockdown Center (April 20, 10 p.m.). Fresh off two weekends at Coachella, where she debuted a much-anticipated new audiovisual show, Kraviz, a Russian D.J. and producer, will appear in Maspeth, Queens, for this event, which brings together two of electronic and dance music’s biggest names. Her co-headliner will be Murphy, the frontman of the recently revived dance-punk group LCD Soundsystem, who moonlights as a D.J. (as well as a label boss and restaurateur). A pair of side stages at this former glass factory will host acts like Mike Huckaby, a linchpin of Detroit’s house and techno scenes.718-489-6285, knockdown.center [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] LIFTED BY SISTASPIN at Elsewhere (April 20, 11 p.m.). A New York-based D.J. collective dedicated to the work of women, femmes and L.G.B.T.Q. individuals of color, Sistaspin will host the second annual installment of their “420” party at this club in Bushwick, Brooklyn. This year’s event will include a D.J. set by the Queens native Skype Williams and a performance by Quay Dash, the Bronx-based rapper whose debut EP, “Transphobic,” recounts her experiences as a transgender woman. Like all Sistaspin events, Lifted will strive to deliver on the collective’s signature promise of providing a safe space for black and brown bodies.elsewherebrooklyn.com OH LAND at Le Poisson Rouge (April 25, 9 p.m.). This Danish polymath, born Nanna Oland Fabricius, started her performing career as a student at the Royal Swedish Ballet School. Sidelined by an injury, she later turned to music, building rich vocal textures and orchestral synths into quirky electropop songs like “Heavy Eyes” and “White Nights.” Lately, Fabricius has been composing and arranging for ballet, multimedia art installations and the screen, but her return to solo music is imminent. Oh Land’s fifth studio album — her first since 2014’s “Earth Sick” — is due out in May.lpr.com OVER THE RHINE at City Winery (April 19, 8 p.m.). For decades, the songwriters Linford Detweiler and Karin Bergquist have been partners both in life and in music. The Ohio-based folk duo — who take their name from a neighborhood in downtown Cincinnati — craft spacious, gentle acoustic songs about love, death and God, as heard on their most recent release, last month’s “Love & Revelation.” With this new album, and their release show at this SoHo winery and event space, the pair celebrate their band’s 30th year, and their marriage’s 22nd.212-608-0555, citywinery.com/newyork VALLEY MAKER at Park Church Co-op (April 24, 7 p.m.). Beginning with his first, self-titled release — a collection of songs derived from the Book of Genesis — in 2010, this South Carolina-born songwriter has crafted music rich in biblical imagery and moral wondering, most recently on “Rhododendron,” a record produced by Chaz Bear of Toro y Moi. Valley Maker’s supporting act will be Tomberlin, another artist who draws inspiration from faith. Her debut album, last year’s “At Weddings,” documented in hushed ambient-folk songs her split from the Baptist church of her youth. For both acts, this Lutheran church in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, is a fitting setting.adhoc.fmOLIVIA HORN TERENCE BLANCHARD AND THE E-COLLECTIVE at the Blue Note (April 18-21, 8 and 10:30 p.m.). Since his arrival in the 1980s as a member of the Young Lions scene, Blanchard has become one of jazz’s most effortlessly flexible trumpeters and inquisitive bandleaders. He is known for scoring most of Spike Lee’s movies (his music for “BlacKkKlansman” was nominated for an Oscar this year), but his most consistent concern over the past few years has been the E-Collective, a quintet of Blanchard and spry young improvisers who play his explosive original music — often guided by social concerns — and currently include the guitarist Charles Altura, the pianist Fabian Almazan, the bassist David Ginyard Jr. and the drummer Oscar Seaton.212-475-8592, bluenote.net EVAN CHRISTOPHER at Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola (April 24, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). A New Orleans-based clarinetist, Christopher dedicates himself to uplifting the jazz legacy of his hometown, while situating it within the context of other traditional black music of the Caribbean. He has a strong and clear tone, and an ebullient stage presence. He performs here with the pianist David Torkanowsky, the bassist Neal Caine and the drummer Darrian Douglas.212-258-9595, jazz.org/dizzys DAVE DOUGLAS ENGAGE at Happylucky No. 1 (April 19-20, 8 p.m.). Douglas, 56, is good at pulling musicians together in contexts that support their musical voices but sound different from what they typically do. That’s the case with Engage, a new ensemble that features five younger improvisers, each aligned with a different corner of the avant-garde. As Engage, they play low-boil, medium-tempo music soaked in lovely harmonies; it’s not about centrifugal motion or free improvising so much as it’s about depth and connection and body. The group, which recently put out a new disc via Douglas’s subscription-based Greenleaf Music label, will appear in a slightly modified but equally impressive form here: Douglas on trumpet; Anna Webber on alto flute, bass flute and tenor sax; Tomeka Reid on cello; Miles Okazaki on guitar; Nick Dunston on bass; and Kate Gentile on drums.happyluckyno1.com/happenings LARRY GOLDINGS, PETER BERNSTEIN AND BILL STEWART at Jazz Standard (April 19-21, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). Over the past three decades, this trio has been one of jazz’s quiet stalwarts. Goldings’s organ is sometimes frisky, sometimes smoldering; Bernstein plays the guitar more crisply and adroitly than almost anyone in the game; and Stewart’s drum work balances the influences of Tony Williams and Paul Motian into an attack that’s buoyant and tonally sensitive and complex. The group released a charming album last year, “Toy Tunes,” and will likely draw from that material during this weekend run.212-576-2232, jazzstandard.com LAURENCE HOBGOOD at the Rubin Museum of Art (April 25, 7 p.m.). As a pianist and arranger, Hobgood may be best known for his two-decade collaboration with the vocalist Kurt Elling, which came to an end a few years ago. On “tesseterra,” Mr. Hobgood’s new album, he draws upon the textural and stylistic breadth he long deployed as Elling’s musical director; the album finds him combining a jazz trio with a string quartet, playing a mix of thoroughly rearranged classic-rock tunes, jazz standards and a Chopin waltz. Two impressive things stand out: how enormous his arrangements make the string quartet sound, and how fluidly these seven musicians blend together. He will play material from the disc at the Rubin with that hybrid ensemble: Leonor Falcon and Tomoko Omura on violin, Jen Herman on viola, Brian Sanders on cello, Matt Clohesy on bass and Jared Schonig on drums.laurencehobgood.com/rubin-cd-release-concert KASSA OVERALL AND KRIS DAVIS at the Jazz Gallery (April 25, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). Once a month since December, Overall — a drummer, producer and contemporary-music syncretist who recently released a solid album merging jazz and hip-hop — has brought a prominent piano innovator to the Jazz Gallery for a one-night collaboration as part of his continuing “Time Capsule” project. Davis is among the most radical pianists of her generation, a sharply articulate and ruggedly uncompromising improviser; joined by the bassist Stephan Crump, she’ll almost certainly take Overall — who strikes the drums in measured, deliberate gestures, despite his zesty demeanor as a performer — into fresh territory.646-494-3625, jazzgallery.nycGIOVANNI RUSSONELLO",The New York Times
2019,12 Wines Under $12: How Low Can You Go and Still Find Values?,"The Pour The quest for exciting bottles gets trickier as the price drops. But you can still find some gems with a $12 limit. What kind of wines can you buy for $12? More important, what kind of values will you find? The relationship between price and quality is neither exact nor easy to define. But the lower the price and the higher the quality, the greater the wine value. Though it seems simple, this equation is contorted by many variables. There’s supply and demand, of course. Changing vintage conditions or the unexpected rise to cult status of a once-obscure producer from a long-ignored region can further complicate the economics. Value is also a relative term. A great deal from Burgundy will be vastly different from a steal from Abruzzo. Over years of thinking about this issue, I have concluded that for most consumers, the greatest values are found in the range of $15 to $20 a bottle. At this price, you will find wines that are not only sound, but exciting. These bottles are often the works of traditional craftsmanship, which makes wine an expression of culture. I’ve held to this formula for more than a decade, putting together lists of great values from all corners of the wine world. Sometimes, the bottles have been obscure, as the general esteem in which a region is held is inversely proportional to value. But often the wines come from regions right under our noses. While $15 to $20 is the land of plenty, I inevitably hear from people who believe $20 is too much to pay for a bottle of wine. Some argue that $20 is beyond their budgets, which I understand. Others simply feel that no bottle is worth more than $10, $5 or another arbitrarily chosen figure. I understand that position, too. We all have different spending priorities. If, for example, you prefer wines that are farmed conscientiously for environmental, moral or health reasons (practices that produce better grapes) it becomes difficult to find acceptable bottles in this price range. Farming organically, for example, is much more labor-intensive. Cutting costs often means scaling up and mechanizing. Similarly, in the winery, shortcuts like dunking oak staves or oak-dust tea bags into tanks of wine to infuse them with flavor are far more economical than aging wine in oak barrels. So is adding yeast nutrients, bacteria and enzymes, all intended to ensure the achievement of a wine that will fit predetermined specifications with a minimum of fuss and chance. These and other cost-saving techniques can be crude, and tend to make dull, obvious wines. While such bottles can cost far more than $20, it’s easier to escape the tyranny of such processed wines at $20 than it is at $8 or $10 or $12. Exciting wines can be found at $12 or less, though it is not easy. While this list contains some gems — like a red from Bodegas Olivares in the Jumilla region of Spain, made from very old vines of monastrell — these wines are for the most part simple pleasures. I don’t mean that as faint praise. I will always have a place for wines like these. Here are 12 bottles, each under $12, in no particular order. The appellation, Montepulciano d’Abruzzo, reveals exactly what this wine is: montepulciano grapes from the Abruzzo region of central Italy, on the Adriatic coast. Nothing complex here, just the wonderful, quintessential combination of sweet cherry fruit tempered by a bit of bitterness and acidity found in so many Italian reds. It’s delicious and refreshing. (Polaner Selections, Mount Kisco, N.Y.) This intensely floral, unusual white comes from the Côtes de Gascogne, a catchall region in southwest France perhaps better known for brandy. In fact, the main grapes in this wine, colombard and ugni blanc, are better known as components of Cognac. Altogether, this wine is lively, balanced and intriguing. (Skurnik Wines, New York) This cheerful, dry red blend comes from one of the best Languedoc producers, Mas de Daumas Gassac, working in concert with a local cooperative. It’s a typical modern southern blend: 40 percent syrah, 25 percent grenache, 20 percent mourvèdre and 15 percent carignan. At $9.99, it’s a great value, with bright, earthy flavors of red fruit that linger. (Polaner Selections) This cava, the bubbly of Spain, is straightforward and uncomplicated. It’s dry and fresh, with yeasty, apple flavors and a lacy texture. In case anybody confuses it with a far more exalted sparkling wine, the label will set you straight: “Jaume Serra Cristalino is not affiliated with, sponsored by, approved by, endorsed by, or in any way connected to Louis Roederer’s Cristal Champagne or Louis Roederer.” (CIV U.S.A., Miami) Here’s a bottle of plain old Bordeaux from the outlying areas of the exalted region, the sort of wine, we are told, that nobody buys anymore. Except, this is the proverbial great drink: a dry, delicious, refreshing wine that goes with all sorts of foods. It’s 70 percent merlot, 20 percent cabernet franc and the rest cabernet sauvignon, and harks back to a time when local villagers bought their wines “en vrac,” or in bulk, in containers that they filled and refilled directly from the producer. (Village Wine Imports, Bronx, N.Y.) Violet-scented Argentine malbec is a good thing. Violet-scented Argentine malbec that is medium-bodied, unmarred by clumsy oak treatments or other cellar techniques, is a great thing. This bottle, from an excellent producer, is a superb value. (Skurnik Wines) Graciano is often part of the Rioja blend, but I rarely see it on its own. This wine is 100 percent graciano, from the Navarra region of north central Spain, aged in old oak barrels. It’s lightly floral, with plenty of crackling, refreshing acidity. (David Bowler Wine, New York) Pine Ridge, a Napa Valley producer, has been making this lively blend of chenin blanc and viognier for ages. The grapes don’t come from Napa, which keeps the price down. It’s light and bright, with flavors of flowers and herbs and maybe a touch of residual sugar. It will go well with seafood or chicken. Pinot blanc is just an everyday wine in Alsace. And while producers there make many pinot blanc wines, the majority, like this one, are not made from the pinot blanc grape. Instead, they are often auxerrois, another white grape, with perhaps a small percentage of pinot blanc. Regardless of the constituents, this is light and pleasant, with aromas and flavors of citrus and herbs. (Esprit du Vin, Boca Raton, Fla.) This is easygoing, pure tempranillo, blended with a little bit of garnacha and mazuelo. It’s a classic formula for Rioja, complete with a modest cushioning of oak. It’s not a complex wine, but it’s highly satisfying. (Arano, Boca Raton, Fla.) Sandy soils, as in this vineyard in the Jumilla region of southeastern Spain, are intolerable to phylloxera, the aphid that started to eat its way through European vineyards in the 19th century. As a result, these old vines of monastrell, or mourvèdre as it’s known in French, did not have to be grafted onto American rootstock, which resists phylloxera. Is that why this powerful, spicy red is so deep and rich? I don’t know, but this bottle is an extraordinary value. (Rare Wine Company, Brisbane, Calif.) I love manzanilla sherry, and it astonishes me that world-class bottles, and half-bottles like this one, are available for $10. This savory, briny, delicate wine would be a lovely aperitif anytime, but especially when served cool in warmer weather. Want another treat? You can find half-bottles of Valdespino Inocente, Deliciosa’s iconic fino sibling, for the same price.

2019,13 Great Things We Saw at Milan’s Design Fair,"The highlights of the recent Salone del Mobile included rainbow-colored Aalto stools, harlequin carpets and a field of wildflowers. It’s hard to gauge the exact scale of the Salone del Mobile furniture fair in Milan — where most international design brands and studios debut their annual collections — because it encompasses both the city’s fairgrounds and also hundreds of nearby pop-up shows in galleries, retail spaces and even an abandoned panettone factory. But it certainly feels more ambitious each year, at least in terms of the work on view. Last week’s fair featured no fewer than five presentations by the Milan-based design firm Dimore Studio; a sprawling Kvadrat show with a restaurant, a flower field and two Jean Prouvé cabins; and a major interactive interiors installation by Google developed in partnership with neuroscientists. Not to mention the ever-growing, ever-more-elaborate involvement of the world’s biggest fashion brands, which this year included Tod’s — the company presented full-size yurts, huts and other archetypal shelters reimagined by the architect Andrea Caputo — and Louis Vuitton, who debuted the latest collection from its Objets Nomades series of travel-inspired furnishings. Here, our 13 other highlights. [Coming later this spring: the T List newsletter, a weekly roundup of what T Magazine editors are noticing and coveting. Sign up here.] The Italian curator Nicolas Bellavance-Lecompte recently launched a design residency program at the century-old Milanese foundry Fonderia Artistica Battaglia and chose as his first subject the Stockholm-based designer Anton Alvarez, who used a special machine to extrude huge noodles of wax that were then cast in bronze using a lost-wax technique. The results debuted last week in the 5Vie district inside a private 15th-century church, open to Salone visitors for the very first time. Though they look like simple, free-form marble tables, the pieces in Studio Binocle’s Six Tableaux series have an entertaining back story that made the series a favorite. Challenged to design a dining table by a client who didn’t like anything on the market, the architect Lorenzo Bini attempted to avoid making a piece too boring or too pretentious by creating an amoeba-shaped tabletop that he called “an impudent rip-off” of one of Ellsworth Kelly’s leaf drawings. Five more versions soon followed, traced directly from details of works by Louise Bourgeois, Cy Twombly, Christopher Wool and others. The French-Italian rug brand CC-Tapis has made a habit of inviting up-and-coming designers to translate their aesthetics into striking floor coverings each year, and this collection was no exception. The standouts were soft, irregularly shaped gradient rugs by the Amsterdam-based designer Germans Ermics and a trippy harlequin grid series by Martino Gamper. This year marked the fourth edition of Doppia Firma, a project by Fondazione Cologni dei Mestieri d’Arte and Living Corriere della Sera that pairs designers with highly skilled craftspeople to create a collaborative object. The highlight was a stained-glass-and-marble floor lamp by Maarten de Ceulaer and the Belgian glass purveyor Atelier Mestdagh, but we also spotted a nice take on one of the fair’s most ubiquitous objects this year — a room divider — by the designer Vito Nesta and the wallpaper artisans at San Patrignano. Though it officially launched with a tiny preview last year, Far, the Nilufar gallery’s new offshoot dedicated to experimental contemporary work, got a proper introduction last week, taking over the majority of Nilufar’s Depot space with pieces by 10 different designers. The work, curated by Studio Vedèt, was memorable, especially the pieces by Julien Manaira and Odd Matter, but so was the scenography: a landscape of enormous plastic exhibition bubbles dreamed up by Space Caviar. Every two years, Flos builds a massive booth at Salone del Mobile that inevitably fills up with crushing stampedes of curious people. The stampede is usually justified — as it was this year by four key releases: an enormous chandelier of interlocking leather parabolas by Formafantasma, a poetic curved track-lighting system by Michael Anastassiades, the resurrection of Mario Bellini’s 1964 flat-pack Chiara lamp and a brilliantly sculptural outdoor lighting collection by Nendo. This year, rather than just presenting commercial products, Artek showcased a playful initiative called the FIN/JPN Friendship Collection. It’s a group of six projects that represent various thoughtful mergers of Finnish and Japanese design, from new versions of Aalto’s Stool 60 — including one with Technicolor tops by the Tokyo architect Jo Nagasaka and another that was indigo-dyed by the Japanese workshop Buaisou — to a bench by the designer Koichi Futatsumata that channels the shared public bathing traditions of the two countries. If this year’s show felt short on new discoveries, a clear exception was Kabinet, a brand founded just months ago by two young designers interested in revitalizing the craft industry in the Veneto region of Italy. The line stood out for its contemporary take on sumptuous materials like burl wood, tortoiseshell and mohair. “No Man’s Land” by Kvadrat and Raf Simons was not just an exhibition but a destination; visitors came not only to see Simons’s sixth collection for the textile brand — corduroy, shimmering or speckled bouclés — but also to taste food from a pop-up outpost of the London restaurant Rochelle Canteen, gaze at a field of wildflowers installed by the Belgian florist Mark Colle and wander around the Jean Prouvé prefab cabins that were part of the presentation’s elaborate mise-en-scène. One of the best projects on view at Satellite, the section of the Salone fairgrounds dedicated to showcasing young designers, wasn’t furniture at all but Zurich-based Marie Schumann’s luminous wall hangings. Made from ombré cotton or polyester and draped threads of metallic Lurex, they were almost three dimensional, more like artworks than textile designs. The American artist Matthew Day Jackson showed three versions of his loopy new table and chairs for the Finnish brand Made by Choice. Arranged within three color-coded rooms, the pieces came in bright green; black, with a subtle rainbow sheen; and a more conservative natural wood. Jackson engineered the tables’ legs to work entirely by an elaborate system of interlocking parts, so that no tools or screws are needed to take the table apart or put it back together again. The New York-based designer Bec Brittain’s angular Heron lamps — particularly a version in pink and gray stone — were the stars of the Carrara-based marble brand Mmairo’s small but admirable collection, along with new tables by Karen Chekerdjian and an architectural table lamp by Niko Koronis. The Parisian design publicist David Giroire decided to become his own client at this year’s fair, joining with the creative director Jerome Bazzocchi to start an ambitious new furniture brand dedicated to making limited-edition works by lesser-known talents. Called Theoreme Editions, its first collection features a chubby shearling chair balanced on a copper cube by Pool, a colored resin console by Francesco Balzano and a huge pebble-shaped floor mirror by Joris Poggioli. An earlier version of this article misstated the nationality and the occupation of Matthew Day Jackson; he is an American artist, not a British designer.",The New York Times

Clubbed Thumb, the downtown company that first produced “What the Constitution Means to Me,” brings back Will Arbery’s play about three sisters (Crystal Finn, Susannah Flood, Miriam Silverman) and many husbands for an encore run. Reviewing Taylor Reynolds’s production last summer, Laura Collins-Hughes called it “surreal, funny, ultimately muddled.” 212-260-0153, clubbedthumb.org ‘17 BORDER CROSSINGS’ at New York Theater Workshop (in previews; opens on April 15). Get your visa approved and your passport stamped as this exploration of migration by the playwright and performer Thaddeus Phillips arrives at New York Theater Workshop. Phillips, who heads Philadelphia’s Lucidity Suitcase Intercontinental, twines memories of his own travels with more fraught journeys. 212-460-5475, nytw.org ‘SOCRATES’ at the Public Theater (in previews; opens on April 16). The unexamined life is probably not worth staging. But Tim Blake Nelson’s new play attempts to probe the mind and biography of one of the most controversial philosophers of the ancient world. Michael Stuhlbarg stars; Doug Hughes directs. How will the youth of Athens fare? 212-967-7555, publictheater.org ‘FLEABAG’ at the SoHo Playhouse (closes on April 14). Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s monologue about a sexually compulsive young Londoner ends its relationship with New York. Maybe you’ve already seen the streaming series it spawned on Amazon, but as Ben Brantley reported, the live event “throbs with a concentrated, combustible vitality that a camera is incapable of capturing, even with pore-probing close-ups.” At this point, the chances of getting tickets are slim, but you can check the website daily for any that become available or wait in the cancellation line that forms at the box office an hour before the show. 212-691-1555, sohoplayhouse.com ‘THE LEHMAN TRILOGY’ at the Park Avenue Armory (closes on April 20). This history of the brokerage house turned failed investment giant conducts its last transactions. Ben Brantley wrote that Sam Mendes’s production of Stefano Massini’s play, adapted by Ben Power and starring Simon Russell Beale, Ben Miles and Adam Godley, “unfolds a tale of extravagant wealth with an even more dazzling economy of means.” The shows have sold out, but in addition to a cancellation line that will form two hours before each performance, rush tickets will be released on the website at noon. 212-933-5812, armoryonpark.org ‘LIFE SUCKS’ at Wild Project (closes on April 20). This sort-of adaptation of “Uncle Vanya,” by the “Stupid _______ Bird” playwright Aaron Posner, wraps up its cleverly melancholic run. Elisabeth Vincentelli wrote that the play, which stars Jeff Biehl, “understands full well that there is no date stamp on feeling stranded between regrets and hopes, between fancy dreams and the banality of existence.” 212-228-1195, thewildproject.com ‘THE WHITE DEVIL’ at the Lucille Theater (closes on April 14). A Jacobean tragedy about star-crossed lovers and the spouses who just happen to get murdered along the way, this John Webster play piles up its final corpses. Directed by Louisa Proske for Red Bull Theater and starring Daniel Oreskes and Lisa Birnbaum, the production is sometimes too much, but typically it’s spry and stylish. 212-352-3101, redbulltheater.com",The New York Times
2019,13 Poets Laureate Receive Fellowships for Civic Projects,"The Academy of American Poets on Wednesday announced the 13 recipients of its inaugural Poets Laureate Fellowships, a program to promote creative projects around the country. The fellowships are financed by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, which awarded $2.2 million to the academy in January. The poets laureate, from 10 states, will receive a combined amount over $1 million to establish projects like podcasts, writing workshops and poetry readings in their communities and support civic programs in the next year. In the application process, poets laureate — those appointed to promote the art form in their state or locale — were invited to submit letters of recommendation and civic project proposals. The submissions were reviewed by a panel that included three former United States poets laureate, who are anointed by the Librarian of Congress. The academy also consulted the Federation of State Humanities Councils. [Read more about the states’ poets laureate here.] The grants range from $50,000 to $100,000 each, and funding determinations were made by the academy’s board of directors. Decisions “were based on the panel’s evaluation forms and the scope and reach of the proposed civic projects,” said Jennifer Benka, the executive director of the Academy of American Poets, who is also a board member. The 13 recipients include Grace Cavalieri, the poet laureate of Maryland; Paisley Rekdal, Utah; Adrian Matejka, Indiana; Jaki Shelton Green, North Carolina; Jeanetta Calhoun Mish, Oklahoma; and Claudia Castro Luna, Washington. The others are the poet laureate of Nevada County, Calif., Molly Fisk; Fred L. Joiner of Carrboro, N.C.; Robin Coste Lewis of Los Angeles; Ed Madden of Columbia, S.C.; Raquel Salas Rivera of Philadelphia; Kim Shuck of San Francisco; and TC Tolbert of Tucson. The Academy of American Poets was founded in 1934 and aims to bolster poetry through outlets like American Poets magazine, National Poetry Month and the Poem-a-Day program. An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of one poet laureate. The poet is Kim Shuck, not Schuck.",The New York Times
2019,"13 Pop, Rock and Jazz Concerts to Check Out in N.Y.C. This Weekend","Our guide to pop and rock shows and the best of live jazz happening this weekend and in the week ahead. ADELINE at C’mon Everybody (May 1, 8 p.m.). As the frontwoman of the Brooklyn band Escort, this Parisian-born singer lent her sultry vocals to slick nu-disco tracks. Now performing solo, she remains committed to her 1970s influences, as seen on the self-titled debut album she put out in November. After playing her record release show at this bar in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, Adeline returns for the first of four Wednesday-night concerts, over the course of which she will feature guest artists like the funk group IGBO and the electronic duo Life on Planets. cmoneverybody.com FOXING AND NOW, NOW at Warsaw (April 26, 8 p.m.). These joint headliners share Midwestern roots and emo proclivities. Foxing, a four-piece from St. Louis, most recently released a third album of indie-rock songs, which have grown more ambitious and expansive through the addition of lush synths, strings and, on one track, bagpipes. Their Minnesota-based tour mates, Now, Now, also made strides with their third album, last spring’s “Saved” — a record that ended a six-year lull and maintained the dark intensity of their previous work while introducing a new pop sheen, best heard on songs like “MJ” and “Yours.” 212-777-6800, warsawconcerts.com TALIB KWELI at Brooklyn Bowl (May 1-3, 8 p.m.). A noted rapper, activist and sometimes Soulquarian, this Brooklyn native is perhaps best known as one half of Black Star, opposite Mos Def. Since the duo effectively dissolved in the early 2000s, Kweli has released solo music at a consistent clip, most recently on “Radio Silence,” the 2017 record on which he returns to a slate of topics that have become his bread and butter — police brutality and toxic masculinity among them. Special guests at Kweli’s three-night engagement in his home borough will include the poet Jessica Care Moore, as well as Niko Is and K’Valentine, two artists signed to his Javotti label. 718-963-3369, brooklynbowl.com JACKIE MENDOZA at Park Church Co-op (April 26, 7 p.m.). This Mexican-American singer’s music is often described as “ukulele electropop,” but with its reggaeton and ambient touchstones, it feels much more eclectic than that label might suggest. A former member of the Brooklyn-based shoegaze band the Gingerlys and the psych-pop group Mint Field, from Tijuana, Mexico, Mendoza has been writing and recording music on her own since high school and is finally set to put out her debut solo EP, “LuvHz.” Her performance on Friday in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, coincides with its release date; expect her to perform highlights from the recording, including “Mucho Mas,” a dense experimental track on which she sings in Spanish about how there is “way more out there” for her. adhoc.fm [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] MR. EAZI at Brooklyn Steel (April 28, 8 p.m.). This Nigeria-bred artist, born Oluwatosin Ajibade, has termed his signature style “banku music,” after the traditional Ghanaian dish — a winking reference to critical takes on his languid vocal style, which gives the impression of someone who has just had a heavy meal. Sonically, Ajibade’s music blends elements of highlife, a genre native to West Africa, as well as dancehall and rap; his palette will likely expand because he aims to “push every boundary and erase any genre lines,” as he told The Los Angeles Times last week. On Sunday, Mr. Eazi returns to Brooklyn, where he played his first-ever show in the United States back in 2016. 888-929-7849, bowerypresents.com PUP at Brooklyn Steel (April 26, 7:45 p.m.). “I got stuck on death and dying and obsessive thoughts that won’t let up,” this Canadian rock group’s lead vocalist Stefan Babcock sings on their new album, which is aptly titled “Morbid Stuff.” The band can be cruel (“Just cause you’re sad again, it doesn’t make you special at all” is their refrain on one track) and self-deprecating (their name is an acronym for “Pathetic Use of Potential”), but their energy is boundless. Their opener, Diet Cig — the duo of Alex Luciano and Noah Bowman — are the rare act that can keep pace, with buoyant pop-punk tunes punctuated by Luciano’s signature high kicks. 888-929-7849, bowerypresents.com OLIVIA HORN ‘A BIRTHDAY TRIBUTE TO ELLA FITZGERALD’ at Smoke (April 26-27, 7, 9 and 10:30 p.m.). The vocalists Charenée Wade and Brianna Thomas both root themselves snugly within the bluesier realms of jazz’s vocal tradition, and though neither sounds much like Ella Fitzgerald, there is no escaping the influence of the First Lady of Song. Wade’s clear but forceful voice will lead the way on Friday; the next evening, Thomas — whose singing is laden with rousing, youthful energy — will take the helm. 212-864-6662, smokejazz.com MARIZA at the Town Hall (May 1, 8 p.m.). Since right around the turn of the millennium, Mariza has carried the lineage of fado — a Portuguese tradition centered on songs of heartache and lament — into the present day, drawing upon the deep sensitivity and raw, cinematic power of her voice. Born in Mozambique, she moved to Lisbon as a girl and learned fado at the knee of the music’s elders. Here she will perform pieces from her acclaimed, self-titled 2018 album. 800-745-3000, thetownhall.org TOMEKA REID at the Jazz Gallery (April 26, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). Among the rising stars on jazz’s avant-garde, few are busier or more widely praised than Reid. The cellist — who recently released an album of duets, “The Mouser,” with the drummer Filippo Monico — enjoys the empowerment and open possibility of free improvisation, but she also seeks the firm foundation of a steady groove. Her clearly articulated, lyrically imaginative cello playing can fulfill a range of roles in quick succession: melodist, beat maker, textural accompanist. At the Jazz Gallery she will perform in two separate formations: a duo with the drummer Tomas Fujiwara (nodding to her new album) and a longstanding quartet featuring Fujiwara, the guitarist Mary Halvorson and the bassist Jason Roebke. 646-494-3625, jazzgallery.nyc KARRIEM RIGGINS at the Blue Note (April 30-May 1, 8 and 10:30 p.m.). Riggins, a drummer and producer, has dual citizenship in the worlds of straight-ahead jazz (he has been a sideman for Mulgrew Miller and Diana Krall, among others) and left-wing hip-hop. His two albums, 2012’s “Alone Together” and last year’s “Headnod Suite,” attest to the strong influence of J. Dilla — the game-changing rap producer who mentored Riggins — but have a heavy swing vibe reflective of Riggins’s drumming. He recently served as one-third of the crossover supergroup August Greene, which also features the keyboardist Robert Glasper and the rapper Common. Here he presents a band of his own, one likely to toggle between hip-hop, dub reggae and jazz. 212-475-8592, bluenote.net RENEE ROSNES QUARTET at Flushing Town Hall (April 26, 8 p.m.). Rosnes, a pianist, is still riding high on the success of last year’s “Beloved of the Sky,” an album of original compositions inspired by the paintings of Emily Carr. Its original pieces range from tangled melodic webs to coolly meditative exhalations. Taken together, they amount to a reckoning with the legacy of post-bop’s piano heroes: The ghosts of Cedar Walton, Andrew Hill and Geri Allen are alive in Rosnes’s playing. In Queens, Ms. Rosnes appears with two members of the band from the album — the vibraphonist Steve Nelson and the bassist Peter Washington — as well as the drummer Lewis Nash. 718-463-7700, flushingtownhall.org WADADA LEO SMITH at the Kitchen (April 26-27, 8 p.m.; April 28, 3 p.m.). This trumpeter, composer and farsighted musical thinker has only ripened with age; at 77, he’s making some of the most affecting music of his career, and he is as prolific as ever. His most recent album is “Rosa Parks: Pure Love. An Oratorio of Seven Songs,” on which he blends brass, electronics and a string quartet to make slow, glassy music that’s often as faint as a memory, yet as urgent as a protester’s chant. He presents the 15-part work here alongside a deep cast of collaborators: The Diamond Voices trio, the RedKoral string quartet, the BlueTrumpet Quartet and the Janus Duo (Pheeroan akLaff on drums and Hardedge on electronics) will all be onstage with him. Jesse Gilbert will present a video component, and the butoh dancer Oguri will also perform. 212-255-5793, thekitchen.orgGIOVANNI RUSSONELLO BC35 VOL. 2 RECORD RELEASE SHOW at Market Hotel (April 25, 8 p.m.). It’s an anniversary so right, Martin Bisi needs to celebrate it twice. Last week, this proprietor of BC Studio, which birthed such seminal albums as Swans’ “The Great Annihilator,” dropped the second volume of a compilation that commemorates his studio’s 35th birthday. The lineup this time is about the same as last year’s party for the first volume, with a couple of tweaks: Genevieve Fernworthy of Tidal Channel will kick things off with a five-piece that includes the drummer Stephen Moses from Alice Donut; Bisi will perform with the drummer Bob Bert, the bassist Ryan Skeletonboy and members of Pop. 1280 and Parlor Walls; the bassist Algis Kizys will rejoin Phil Puleo on percussion and Jim Coleman on electronics to unveil two new songs, but this time Dana Schechter from Insect Ark will add her bass skills to their mesmerizing, marvelous drone; White Hills will top that off with their next-level psychedelia; and best of all, Live Skull will end the night, playing together under that name for the first time in 30 years. markethotel.orgDANIELLE DOWLING",The New York Times
2019,"13 Pop, Rock and Jazz Concerts to Check Out in N.Y.C. This Weekend","Our guide to pop and rock shows and the best of live jazz happening this weekend and in the week ahead. THE CACTUS BLOSSOMS at Bowery Ballroom (April 11, 8 p.m.). Because of their tightly woven harmonies and rockabilly influences, this band of brothers from Minneapolis has racked up comparisons to two of music’s most celebrated siblings: the Everlys. This year, the group, comprising Page Burkum and Jack Torrey, released “Easy Way,” a record that ever-so-slightly mussed up the clean-cut sound of their 2016 label debut, but maintained a sunny outlook and retro coziness. One highlight, “Got a Lotta Love,” was written with Dan Auerbach from the Black Keys. With its heart-on-its-sleeve lyrics, it illustrates their songwriting strategy. As Torrey told Rolling Stone, singing about love is “more attractive than singing about divisive subjects.”212-260-4700, mercuryeastpresents.com ELLA VOS at Brooklyn Steel (April 10, 8 p.m.). Many women’s careers are hindered by pregnancy; this pop singer’s was propelled by it. Her best-known song, the moody, R&B-tinged track “White Noise,” centers on her experience with postpartum depression, and she has said that becoming pregnant is what gave her the courage to pursue music in the first place. The anonymity granted by Vos’s stage name (her chosen moniker roughly translates from Spanish to “she you”) further boosts her confidence, empowering her to tackle difficult material in her songs. “You Don’t Know About Me,” from her debut album, addresses women’s lack of bodily agency, and “Empty Hands,” from an EP released in January, documents the cancer treatment she recently underwent.888-929-7849, bowerypresents.com HAND HABITS at Bowery Ballroom (April 10, 8 p.m.). Meg Duffy, the songwriter behind this indie-rock project, is a musician’s musician. A product of New York’s Hudson Valley D.I.Y. community, Duffy gained a reputation in Los Angeles for shredding on demand as a go-to session guitarist and a member of Kevin Morby’s touring band. Duffy’s solo work is more restrained and reflective, as evinced on Hand Habits’ recent sophomore album, “Placeholder,” which features a softened guitar tone and raw lyrics about anxiety. After supporting Japanese Breakfast at two New York shows in January, Hand Habits return as a headliner.212-260-4700, mercuryeastpresents.com [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] HONEY DIJON at 99 Scott (April 5, 11 p.m.). “House music for me was never just about tracks,” this D.J., transgender activist and fashion darling told Vice. “It was really about creating something that was too black, too queer and too gay.” Coming of age in Chicago during the heyday of house, Honey Dijon was mentored by Derrick Carter, a pioneer of the genre. Her own style grew to be more eclectic, drawing on techno and sampling soul and pop hits, but it honors her house roots. As a performer, she strives to foster human connection through sound, channeling the sense of liberation she found in her own formative musical experiences, like sneaking into Chicago nightclubs as a teenager. tixr.com SOUNDTRACK OF AMERICA at the Shed (April 5 and 7, 8 p.m.; April 9, 8:30 p.m.; through April 14). For its opening, this flashy new interdisciplinary arts space — a cultural counterweight to the surrounding commercial development in Hudson Yards — will host five nights of concerts honoring the influence of African-American musicians. Developed by the filmmaker Steve McQueen, the series aims to explore the story of black music in America from early spirituals to today’s diverse forms. To that end, the performances in the coming week feature artists such as the jazz pianist and bandleader Jon Batiste, the rappers Smino and Rapsody, the avant-pop cellist Kelsey Lu and the R&B singer Emily King.646-455-3494, theshed.org Y LA BAMBA AND HABIBI at BRIC House Ballroom (April 11, 8 p.m.). Luz Elena Mendoza’s Mexican heritage has long informed her songwriting: As the frontwoman of Y La Bamba, she sings in both Spanish and English, taking cues from traditional musica mexicana as well as American folk songs and dream pop. Her band’s most recent album, “Mujeres,” grapples with what it means to be Mexican in the current political climate, and with the machismo entrenched in Mexican society. At this Brooklyn arts center, Y La Bamba share a bill with Habibi, another group for whom multicultural identity is a central concern. Their “Cardamom Garden” EP from last year was recorded partly in Farsi, celebrating their lead singer’s Iranian roots, and cultivated a distinctly American surf-rock vibe.718-683-5600, bricartsmedia.orgOLIVIA HORN MICHAËL ATTIAS at Greenwich House Music School (April 6, 7:30 p.m.). On Friday, Attias will release “Échos la Nuit,” an album of slow, ruminative solo recordings on which he plays both the alto saxophone (his primary instrument) and the piano. Hearing these 12 tracks is like inspecting the mysterious line drawings of a beloved artist. Sometimes you’ll almost discern the contour of a landscape or the dark shading of a limb, but ultimately the shapes all drift back into a desolate, spacious abstraction. At Greenwich House, Attias will perform solo and in a quartet.212-242-4770, greenwichhouse.org AMIR ELSAFFAR AND TWO RIVERS WITH HAMID AL-SAADI at Pioneer Works (April 8, 7 p.m.). ElSaffar, a lauded Iraqi-American trumpeter, leads bands mostly comprising jazz musicians, but he gets them to use the trundling rhythms and maqam-based melodies of Middle Eastern music, rather than the typical tools of contemporary jazz. Recently he has been performing with Al-Saadi, a singer and scholar of traditional maqam. Here Al-Saadi will join ElSaffar’s sextet, Two Rivers.pioneerworks.org JONATHAN FINLAYSON at the Stone (April 10-13, 8:30 p.m.). Last year, Finlayson, a young trumpeter with an appetite for tangled rhythm and lithe, fugacious melody, released a compelling album, “3 Times Round,” with his sextet. In the coming week at the Stone, across four evenings, he gathers a different band each night: On Wednesday and Thursday, there are trios (featuring the bassist Mark Helias and the drummer Tom Rainey on the first night, then the saxophonist Brian Settles and the drummer Chad Taylor on the second). On April 12, he presents a quintet that includes the alto saxophone phenom Immanuel Wilkins, and on April 13, he closes the run with a septet, playing a new suite of music called “The Odyssey of Big Boy.”thestonenyc.com SULLIVAN FORTNER TRIO at the Village Vanguard (through April 7, 8:30 and 10:30 p.m.). Fortner is just 32, but the New Orleans-born pianist — who’s often clad in a loose smoking jacket and fedora — carries himself with the wizened, avuncular comportment of a jazz elder. When he sits down at the piano, though, youthful energy comes spilling off him like sweat from an athlete’s back. He plays bracing, mile-a-minute postbop, often tangling up his arpeggios and using both hands to create layers of rhythm. At the Vanguard he is joined by Ameen Saleem on bass and Jeremy Clemons on drums; the group will likely draw some repertoire from Fortner’s most recent release, “Moments Preserved.”212-255-4037, villagevanguard.com OLIVER LAKE at Roulette (April 5, 8 p.m.). An avant-garde alto saxophonist and multimedia artist, Lake has been at the top of his class since the early 1970s, when he arrived in New York from St. Louis, where he had helped establish the influential Black Artists Group. In 1976 he and three other saxophonists formed the World Saxophone Quartet, an all-sax combo that became one of the most successful, if unorthodox, jazz groups of the following decade. At Roulette, he presents Alto Madness, a similar ensemble featuring three fellow alto saxophonists — Bruce Williams, Darius Jones and Michaël Attias — as well as the drummer Pheeroan AkLaff. The band will play “Tone Poem for J. A. H.,” a piece Lake originally wrote 12 years ago for the World Saxophone Quartet.917-267-0368, roulette.org ‘A TRIBUTE TO DAVE VALENTIN’ at the Hostos Center for the Arts and Culture (April 6, 7:30 p.m.). Valentin, a Grammy-winning flutist and a fixture of New York’s salsa and Latin jazz scenes, died in 2017 at 64, cutting short a career that encompassed the release of almost two dozen of his own albums, as well as stints with McCoy Tyner’s Latin All-Stars and Tito Puente’s Golden Latin Jazz All-Stars. The pianist Bill O’Connell was the musical director of Valentin’s final band, and here he presents an hommage to his former boss, playing songs from Valentin’s repertoire with a quintet that includes the flutist Andrea Brachfeld. After an intermission, O’Connell will retake the stage with a new 10-piece group, Bill O’Connell’s Afro-Caribbean Ensemble, featuring the master percussionist Roman Díaz. 718-518-4455, hostos.cuny.edu/culturearts MCCOY TYNER AND CHARLES MCPHERSON WITH THE JAZZ AT LINCOLN CENTER ORCHESTRA at the Rose Theater (April 5-6, 8 p.m.). Two jazz giants, Tyner and McPherson will celebrate their 80th birthdays together in a performance with Wynton Marsalis’s Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra. (Tyner reached the milestone late last year; McPherson will turn 80 in July.) The large ensemble will play Tyner’s and McPherson’s compositions, which have been newly arranged for orchestra by members of the group.212-721-6500, jazz.orgGIOVANNI RUSSONELLO",The New York Times
2019,13 Standout Sets at a Milestone New Orleans Jazz Fest,"Live Review NEW ORLEANS — If any popular-music festival was built to last an unbroken 50 years, it’s the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival. It was already looking back when it started in 1970, assembling a Louisiana Heritage Fair of music and food traditions to glorify connection and continuity. Many of the musical styles it brought together were already generations old. So what’s another half-century? This year’s Jazz Fest, as everyone calls it, finished its first four-day weekend on Sunday (it continues May 2-5). It’s an institution dedicated to its home city’s particular local and regional culture: not a trademark revived for anniversaries, like Woodstock, or a reboot tied to a cherished name, like the Newport Folk Festival. Jazz Fest’s booking policy leans toward musicians who share something — funk, fiddles, accordions, carnivals, French and Afro-Caribbean connections — with Louisiana lore. And the festival’s physical layout is designed to encourage discoveries. The path from the two main stages to the blues, gospel and jazz tents leads past a Cultural Exchange Pavilion featuring world music and the Jazz & Heritage stage with performances by brass bands and Mardi Gras Indians, New Orleans’s miracles. Jazz Fest has built its attendance in recent years by adding more pop hitmakers at the top of its bills. But where many pop festivals are simply run-throughs of touring road shows, Jazz Fest visitors tend to incorporate something of New Orleans, having local musicians sit in and savoring the city’s charms. For her appearance on Saturday, Katy Perry performed her hits, but she had her stage set emblazoned with exhortations from the New Orleans-born poet Cleo Wade, and she used the Soul Rebels brass band as a horn section. More than 300 groups performed in the festival’s first four days. I heard a fraction of them, but here are 13 of the standouts. Jazz Fest presents New Orleans music as both a polyglot cultural mix and as a fountainhead of ideas. Santana’s multifaceted, proudly bilingual blues-Latin-rock-jazz-pop catalog invokes its own migrations and fusions, now linked to messages of positive thinking and global healing. An extended set touched down periodically on hits, with Carlos Santana re-creating his familiar guitar solos only to take off from there. There was ample room for excursions into jazz, boogaloo, cumbia and even a hard-rock version of John Lennon’s “Imagine” sung by Cindy Blackman Santana, Carlos’s wife and the band’s indefatigable drummer. Trombone Shorty, from New Orleans, joined the band for an encore that free-associated through Jimi Hendrix, Swamp Dogg, the Rolling Stones, the Beatles, “Fever” and the New Orleans piano standard “Big Chief.” The pianist Ellis Marsalis was part of the first Jazz Fest. This year, his four musician sons — Wynton on trumpet, Branford on saxophones, Delfeayo on trombone and Jason on drums — joined him to perform his own compositions. The pieces traversed New Orleans jazz from slightly skewed traditionalism to knotty modernism; solos navigated every twist with brawn and panache. After featuring students from a music school established after Hurricane Katrina and named after Ellis Marsalis, the set concluded with the four sons raucously parading all around the jazz tent. The soul hits Irma Thomas had from 1959 into the 1960s seesaw between womanly sass (“Don’t Mess With My Man”) and lovesick loneliness (“Ruler of My Heart”). They didn’t quite establish her as a nationwide star, but she became a New Orleans mainstay, and she still sings them with bluesy passion and a trumpetlike clarity. She wished Mick Jagger — whose heart surgery made the Rolling Stones drop out of Jazz Fest — a speedy recovery, but also reminded the crowd that she sang “Time Is on My Side” before he did. And when she moved into a medley of second-line songs and called for people to wave something in the air — handkerchiefs, hats — thousands of listeners happily obeyed. Flashy, two-fisted piano players are central to the sound of New Orleans. “Piano Professors” was one of the many tribute sets that are increasingly part of Jazz Fest, as — over the last 50 years — mortality has claimed indispensable musicians like Professor Longhair, Allen Toussaint and James Booker. Five of their students and inheritors showed what they’ve learned in a brisk set of impossible-sounding piano solos that demanded propulsion, depth and sparkle. Tom McDermott mastered fearsome Jelly Roll Morton compositions like the aptly-titled “Finger Breaker”; Davell Crawford, even brawnier and wilder, flung tremolos and glissandos all over the place in a Booker tribute. They’re local luminaries who are too little known outside New Orleans. Bonnie Raitt first played Jazz Fest in 1977 and has returned often. She praised it from the stage as a refuge for the “endangered species” of “roots music,” the blues, country, soul and funk that infuse her songs about love and honest acceptance. She augmented her band with two New Orleans-based keyboardists whom she has collaborated with through the years, Jon Cleary and Ivan Neville. And with Jazz Fest serendipity, she brought out Boz Scaggs — who had performed the night before — to join her and Cleary singing a Toussaint song all three have recorded, “What Do You Want the Girl to Do”; they turned it into a hymn. George Porter Jr. on bass and Joseph (Zigaboo) Modeliste on drums were the rhythm section of the Meters, the band that defined New Orleans funk in the 1960s and 1970s as a marvel of staggered syncopation. With the guitarist Ian Neville — the son of Art Neville of the original Meters — and Ivan Neville (Art’s nephew), along with the guitarist Tony Hall, they offered their own tunes as lessons in funk construction before finding new rhythmic nooks and crannies in Meters favorites. The singer Moonlight Benjamin, from Haiti, built up a dark, incantatory power. Wearing a ceremonial-looking black dress and singing with a voice that could reach all the way up to an unbridled cry, she led a band that merged cranked-up blues-rock guitars and modal patterns with rhythms informed by voodoo drumming, a mesmerizing synergy. Troubled thoughts smolder and then sear in Maggie Koerner’s music. She sang for a year with the New Orleans band Galactic, but her own songs aren’t party funk. They’re roots-rock kin to Adele or Stevie Nicks: soul-infused rockers that move in dramatic crescendos through pain, anger and resolve. A songwriter, singer, dancer and drummer from Ivory Coast in West Africa, Dobet Gnahore brought crisply modernized African pop to Jazz Fest. Her voice moved from airy delicacy to forthright declamation; the traditional sounds in her performance were loops from a computer meshed with electric guitar lines, and the rhythms exulted in ways to subdivide six-beat grooves. And with her beaded top and her hair swept up in a scarf and cowrie shells, she was dressed like a West African cousin of New Orleans Mardi Gras Indians. Cedric Burnside’s grandfather was the Mississippi bluesman R.L. Burnside; his father was the blues drummer Calvin Jackson. He has held onto his inheritance of raw, hypnotic electric blues. In a duo with a drummer, he twanged stark guitar riffs and sang with dire intensity; eventually they switched instruments, and Burnside’s voice grew even more uncanny as he slammed the drums. Preservation Hall Brass — the brass-band annex of the Preservation Hall Jazz Band — brought pure euphoria to its Saturday-afternoon set, mixing ensemble precision and rowdy improvisational outbursts in the magnificent New Orleans jazz tradition. It went time-traveling through styles, from vintage second-line to funk, while the audience turned into a parasol-pumping parade. Electric funk bands that plug in onstage and brass bands whose instruments are ready to pick up and parade are both New Orleans assets. Corey Henry, who has been a member of the redoubtable Rebirth Brass Band and Galactic, combined them in his Treme Funktet set at Jazz Fest. The brass — including on trumpet his daughter, Jazz, a member of the all-female Original Pinettes Brass Band — could work like a taut horn section or a freewheeling squall; the band’s riffs were all muscle. Like Jazz Fest itself, Taj Mahal has made it his business to trace the blues back to its sources and out to its latter-day family, from Delta fingerpicking to boogaloo, reggae and rock. He sang with gruff gusto and knowing humor, as if he was bringing the world into his backyard.",The New York Times
2019,15 Plays and Musicals to Go to in N.Y.C. This Weekend,"Our guide to plays and musicals coming to New York stages and a few last-chance picks of shows that are about to close.

It’s all fun and games until dynastic conflict pretty much destroys Rome, and some poor saps have to mop up the blood. In Taylor Mac’s new play, a follow-up to Shakespeare’s plasma-spattered “Titus Andronicus,” those saps are played by Nathan Lane and Kristine Nielsen, with Julie White. George C. Wolfe directs. 212-239-6200, garyonbroadway.com [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] ‘GRIEF IS THE THING WITH FEATHERS’ at St. Ann’s Warehouse (previews start on April 20; opens on April 28). In Enda Walsh’s adaptation of Max Porter’s poetic novel, for Wayward Productions and Complicité, a father and two sons grapple with a mother’s sudden death. The arrival of a crow effects some healing. The bereaved father and possibly metaphorical bird unite in the agile body of Cillian Murphy. 718-254-8779, stannswarehouse.org ‘INK’ at the Samuel J. Friedman Theater (in previews; opens on April 24). James Graham’s indelible drama reports on the early career of Rupert Murdoch. When Ben Brantley saw the play in London last year, he called it a “fiendishly entertaining, if structurally unbalanced, new play.” For Manhattan Theater Club, Bertie Carvel and Jonny Lee Miller star. Rupert Goold directs.212-239-6200, manhattantheatreclub.com ‘THE PAIN OF MY BELLIGERENCE’ at Playwrights Horizons (in previews; opens on April 22). In just a few years, Halley Feiffer has become one of our foremost chroniclers of female rage, ambivalence and devastation. In this new play, Feiffer stars as Cat, a whip-smart journalist, and Hamish Linklater is Guy, the married man who derails her career ambitions. Trip Cullman directs. 212-279-4200, playwrightshorizons.org ‘PASSAGE’ at Soho Rep (previews start on April 23; opens on May 5). Can the oppressors and the oppressed hang out? Christopher Chen, a form-breaking playwright, offers a dreamy anatomy of colonialism, imagining Country X, which is ruled by Country Y, and the citizens caught in the middle. Saheem Ali directs. 866-811-4111, sohorep.org ‘PAUL SWAN IS DEAD AND GONE’ at Torn Page (previews start on April 25; opens on May 1). Swan, “the most beautiful man in the world,” is in residence at a Chelsea townhouse. In this new drama from the Civilians, a quasi-documentary troupe, the playwright Claire Kiechel resurrects Swan, an artist, a dancer and her great-great uncle. Steve Cosson directs Tony Torn, Robert Johanson, Helen Cespedes and Alexis Scott. 718-230-3330, thecivilians.org ‘SAFEWORD’ at the American Theater of Actors (in previews; opens on April 25). The playwright and director S. Asher Gelman follows up “Afterglow,” a provocative play about an open marriage, with another sexually charged drama. A tale of two chefs, a power dom and his genderqueer partner, it explores bondage, domination and fine dining. 866-811-4111, safewordtheplay.com ‘TOOTSIE’ at the Marquis Theater (in previews; opens on April 23). David Yazbek and Robert Horn adapt the beloved 1982 movie about Michael Dorsey, an actor who will do anything — even waist training — for a part. (Here it’s a role in a Broadway musical. Very meta.) Santino Fontana and a bold red wig star alongside Lilli Cooper, Sarah Stiles and John Behlmann. Scott Ellis directs. tootsiemusical.com ‘DO YOU FEEL ANGER?’ at the Vineyard Theater (closes on April 27). Mara Nelson-Greenberg’s very dark comedy, about an empathy coach trying to civilize an unwoke collection agency, gives its final notice. Ben Brantley wrote that the play “aspires to more than caricatures of dangerously devolved masculinity,” adding that Nelson-Greenberg is also “considering the ways in which women unthinkingly absorb a poisoned social system.” 212-353-0303, vineyardtheatre.org ‘THE LEHMAN TRILOGY’ at the Park Avenue Armory (closes on April 20). This history of the brokerage house turned failed investment giant conducts its last transactions. Ben Brantley wrote that Sam Mendes’s production of Stefano Massini’s play, adapted by Ben Power and starring Simon Russell Beale, Ben Miles and Adam Godley, “unfolds a tale of extravagant wealth with an even more dazzling economy of means.” The shows have sold out, but in addition to a cancellation line that will form two hours before each performance, rush tickets will be released on the website at noon. 212-933-5812, armoryonpark.org ‘LIFE SUCKS’ at Wild Project (closes on April 20). This sort-of adaptation of “Uncle Vanya,” by the “Stupid _______ Bird” playwright Aaron Posner, wraps up its cleverly melancholic run. Elisabeth Vincentelli wrote that the play, which stars Jeff Biehl, “understands full well that there is no date stamp on feeling stranded between regrets and hopes, between fancy dreams and the banality of existence.” 212-228-1195, thewildproject.com An earlier version of this article misstated that Andrea Martin would appear in “Gary: A Sequel to Titus Andronicus.” Martin was injured and left the production; Kristine Nielsen has taken over her role.",The New York Times
2019,"150 People Missing After Boat Sinks in Congo, President Says","KINSHASA, Democratic Republic of Congo — About 150 people were missing after a boat sank in an eastern lake in the Democratic Republic of Congo, President Felix Tshisekedi said on Twitter on Tuesday, a day after the vessel went down. “I am very saddened by the sinking of a boat on April 15 at Lake Kivu. The provisional toll is 150 missing,” Mr. Tshisekedi said on the president’s official Twitter account. “I express my sincere compassion to the families who have suffered. I am closely watching the situation to identify and sanction the perpetrators.” The boat set off Monday from the village of Kituku, near the city of Goma on Lake Kivu’s northern shore, and sank in South Kivu Province near the territory of Kalehe. Vital Muhini, the national deputy from South Kivu Province, said the cause of the sinking was unknown. “For the moment, we want to have the exact number and the names of the victims who have embarked on this boat,” Mr. Muhini said. Local news outlets reported that three bodies were found on Tuesday, and Reuters reported that 33 people had been rescued. “We ask the lake security services, including the lake police, the Directorate General for Migration and the naval force to monitor the movements of the lake to avoid boat overload,” Delphin Birimbi, an activist in South Kivu, told a United Nations radio station. “What is at the root of this tragedy was first of all the bad loading. Then, there were violent winds.” Because of a lack of public infrastructure in Congo, some private operators use boats to speed transport between regions. Many of the boats do not meet safety requirements, however, and shipwrecks in Congo are often caused by overloading and a lack of signs and alerts regarding lake conditions.",The New York Times
2019,17 Art Exhibitions to View in N.Y.C. This Weekend,"Our guide to new art shows and some that will be closing soon. ‘SIAH ARMAJANI: FOLLOW THIS LINE’ at the Met Breuer (through June 2). Born in Iran, Armajani has been living in the United States since 1960. This retrospective ranges from work he did as a teenage activist in Tehran to models of the many public sculptures he has produced across America over the past five decades. It introduces us to a sharp social thinker, a wry (and increasingly melancholic) metaphysician, a plain-style visual poet and, above all, an artist-ethicist. “Bridge Over Tree,” Armajani’s wonderful large-scale sculpture presented by Public Art Fund at Brooklyn Bridge Park (on the Empire Fulton Ferry Lawn through Sept. 29) to coincide with the Met show, is well timed for our present era of sundering moral confusion and offers ways forward from it. (Holland Cotter) 212-731-1675, metmuseum.org ‘JEAN-MICHEL BASQUIAT’ at the Brant Foundation (through May 15). The opening of the Brant Foundation Art Study Center in the East Village, with an exhibition of nearly 70 works by Basquiat created from 1980 to 1987, serves as a fitting temporary shrine for this Brooklyn-born painter, who became a global sensation in the early 1980s and died at 27 of a heroin overdose. Basquiat sprayed poetic, enigmatic graffiti on walls in downtown Manhattan before moving to canvas, dated Madonna before she was famous and made paintings with Andy Warhol. Part of a group of Neo-Expressionist painters who were largely rejected by critics, he was embraced by an influential audience and a surging art market and ended up creating a brand of African-American history painting that still resonates today. Tickets to the exhibition have sold out, but you can add your name to the wait list by sending a request to ticketsnyc@brantfoundation.org. (Martha Schwendener) 212-777-2977, brantfoundation.org ‘THE JIM HENSON EXHIBITION’ at the Museum of the Moving Image. The rainbow connection has been established in Astoria, Queens, where this museum has opened a new permanent wing devoted to the career of America’s great puppeteer, who was born in Mississippi in 1936 and died, too young, in 1990. Henson began presenting the short TV program “Sam and Friends” before he was out of his teens; one of its characters, the soft-faced Kermit, was fashioned from his mother’s old coat and would not mature into a frog for more than a decade. The influence of early variety television, with its succession of skits and songs, runs through “Sesame Street” and “The Muppet Show,” though Henson also spent the late 1960s crafting peace-and-love documentaries and prototyping a psychedelic nightclub. Young visitors will delight in seeing Big Bird, Elmo, Miss Piggy and the Swedish Chef; adults can dig deep into sketches and storyboards and rediscover some old friends. (Jason Farago) 718-784-0077, movingimage.us ‘FRIDA KAHLO: APPEARANCES CAN BE DECEIVING’ at the Brooklyn Museum (through May 12). This is not exactly an exhibition of Kahlo’s art — it contains just 11 paintings, from compelling self-portraits to ghastly New Age kitsch — but an evocation of an artistic life through her elegant Oaxacan blouses and skirts, not to mention the corsets and spinal braces she wore after a crippling traffic accident. Do her outfits have the weight of art, or are they just so much biographical flimflam? Your answer may vary depending on your degree of Fridamania, but the woven shawls and color-saturated long skirts here, as well as gripping photographs of the artist by Carl Van Vechten, Imogen Cunningham, Manuel Álvarez Bravo and other great shutterbugs, suggest Kahlo’s real accomplishment was a Duchampian extension of her art far beyond the easel, into her home, her fashion and her public relationships. (Farago) 718-638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org ‘THE LONG RUN’ at the Museum of Modern Art (through May 5). The museum upends its cherished Modern narrative of ceaseless progress by mostly young (white) men. Instead we see works by artists 45 and older who have just kept on keeping on, regardless of attention or reward, sometimes saving the best for last. Art here is an older person’s game, a pursuit of a deepening personal vision over innovation. Winding through 17 galleries, the installation is alternatively visually or thematically acute and altogether inspiring. (Roberta Smith) 212-708-9400, moma.org ‘JOAN MIRÓ: BIRTH OF THE WORLD’ at the Museum of Modern Art (through June 15). Drawn mostly from MoMA’s unrivaled Miró collection, this fabulous exhibition is best when tracing the artist’s brilliant early twists on Modernism and their swift ascent to “The Birth of the World,” a 1927 masterpiece that presaged the drips and stains of radical painting two decades hence. Unappreciated in its time, it was barely exhibited until 1968. (Smith) 212-708-9400, moma.org ‘MONUMENTAL JOURNEY: THE DAGUERREOTYPES OF GIRAULT DE PRANGEY’ at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (through May 12). This exhibition is a buffed jewel. In 1842, just a couple of years after Louis Daguerre unveiled the world’s first practical camera, Joseph-Philibert Girault de Prangey, a French aristocrat with a yen for experimental technology, set off on a three-year road trip, lugging a 100-pound kit as he took the world’s first photographs of Athens, Cairo, Constantinople and Jerusalem. More than 100 of Girault de Prangey’s precise daguerreotypes glisten here under pin lights, and his systematic photos of Islamic architecture, in particular, express how the new technology of photography could flit between art and science, and would soon become a tool of colonial rule. Girault de Prangey’s daguerreotypes were little seen before 2003, when his descendants put them on the market; their discovery was a landmark in the history of early photography, and this show is too. (Farago) 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] THE ORCHID SHOW: SINGAPORE at the New York Botanical Garden (through April 28). This 17th annual orchid extravaganza features the natural species and hybridized sensations of Southeast Asia — upward of 70 percent of the display in the Enid A. Haupt Conservatory. Thousands of them, in hundreds of varieties and every conceivable — and inconceivable — shape, size and color. The partners on this show are Singapore Botanic Gardens, whose National Orchid Garden has the largest collection in the world, and Singapore’s Gardens by the Bay, a green-themed entertainment attraction where the wedding party finale in “Crazy Rich Asians” was filmed. There are two major attractions: a pair of supertrees — 18-foot-tall steel armatures in the trunklike, canopied shape of actual trees — and a promenade of arches, dripping with orchids, that leads to the conservatory’s main dome. The colors move through a spectrum from yellow — Oncidium ‘Goldiana,’ or the “dancing lady” orchid — to pink to darker, hotter shades. It is like walking under a rainbow. (William L. Hamilton)718-817-8700, nybg.org ‘BETYE SAAR: KEEPIN’ IT CLEAN’ at the New-York Historical Society (through May 27). Saar has been making important and influential work for nearly 60 years. Yet no big New York museum has given her a full retrospective, or even a significant one-person show, since a 1975 solo at the Whitney Museum of American Art. As this exhibition demonstrates, the institutional oversight is baffling, as her primary themes — racial justice and feminism (her 1972 breakthrough piece, “The Liberation of Aunt Jemima,” merges the two by transforming the racist stereotype of the smiling black mammy into an armed freedom fighter) — are exactly attuned to the present. (Cotter) 212-873-3400, nyhistory.org ‘SCENES FROM THE COLLECTION’ at the Jewish Museum. After a surgical renovation to its grand pile on Fifth Avenue, the Jewish Museum has reopened its third-floor galleries with a rethought, refreshed display of its permanent collection, which intermingles 4,000 years of Judaica with modern and contemporary art by Jews and gentiles alike — Mark Rothko, Lee Krasner, Nan Goldin, Cindy Sherman and the excellent young Nigerian draftswoman Ruby Onyinyechi Amanze. The works are shown in a nimble, nonchronological suite of galleries, and some of its century-spanning juxtapositions are bracing; others feel reductive, even dilettantish. But always, the Jewish Museum conceives of art and religion as interlocking elements of a story of civilization, commendably open to new influences and new interpretations. (Farago) 212-423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org ‘TOLKIEN: MAKER OF MIDDLE-EARTH’ at the Morgan Library & Museum (through May 12). J. R. R. Tolkien did more than write books like “The Hobbit” and the “Lord of the Rings” trilogy; he invented an alternate reality, complete with its own geography, languages, religion and an era-spanning history. This exhibition of his artwork, letters, drafts and other material reminds visitors that the stories Tolkien wrote, however impressive, represent only a fraction of his efforts, and it highlights his unparalleled ability to create an immersive experience using only words and pictures. After a visit you, too, may find yourself believing in Middle-earth and the hobbits, elves, dwarves, orcs and wizards that live there. (Peter Libbey) 212-685-0008, themorgan.org ‘T. REX: THE ULTIMATE PREDATOR’ at the American Museum of Natural History (through Aug. 9, 2020). Everyone’s favorite 18,000-pound prehistoric killer gets the star treatment in this eye-opening exhibition, which presents the latest scientific research on T. rex and also introduces many other tyrannosaurs, some discovered only this century in China and Mongolia. T. rex evolved mainly during the Cretaceous Period to have keen eyes, spindly arms and massive conical teeth, which could bear down on prey with the force of a U-Haul truck; the dinosaur could even swallow whole bones, as affirmed here by a kid-friendly display of fossilized excrement. The show mixes 66-million-year-old teeth with the latest 3-D prints of dino bones, and also presents new models of T. rex as a baby, a juvenile and a full-grown annihilator. Turns out this most savage beast was covered with — believe it! — a soft coat of beige or white feathers. (Farago) 212-769-5100, amnh.org ‘NARI WARD: WE THE PEOPLE’ at the New Museum (through May 26). The persistent and liberating message in Ward’s sculpture and room-size installations is that art can be made from virtually anything. In this midcareer retrospective, anything means old carpets, plastic bags, bottles, zippers, bed springs, keys and furniture. Although the exhibition includes a number of large installations, Ward is best as a creator of curious and discrete sculptures, ones that remind us that our world is filled with potentially magical objects. We enter museums expecting to be transformed, but if we shift our perspective and look around us, we’ll see that everyday life is really just art waiting to happen. (Schwendener) 212-219-1222, newmuseum.org ‘THE WORLD BETWEEN EMPIRES: ART AND IDENTITY IN THE ANCIENT MIDDLE EAST’ at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (through June 23). The Met excels at epic-scale archaeological exhibitions, and this is a prime example. It brings together work made between 100 B.C. and A.D. 250 in what we now know as Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen. In the ancient world, all were in the sphere of two competing superpowers — Rome to the west and Parthia to the east — and though imperial influence was strong, it was far from all-determining. Each of the subject territories selectively grafted it onto local traditions to create distinctive new grass-roots cultural blends. Equally important, the show addresses the fate of art from the past in a politically fraught present. (Cotter) 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org ‘HILMA AF KLINT: PAINTINGS FOR THE FUTURE’ at Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum (through April 23). This rapturous exhibition upends Modernism’s holiest genesis tale — that the male trinity of Kandinsky, Malevich and Mondrian invented abstract painting starting in 1913. It demonstrates that a female Swedish artist got there first (1906-7), in great style and a radically bold scale with paintings that feel startlingly contemporary. The mother of all revisionist shows regarding Modernism. (Smith) 212-423-3500, guggenheim.org ‘LUCIO FONTANA: ON THE THRESHOLD’ at the Met Breuer (through April 14). The art of this Argentine-Italian modernist looks a bit like it comes from another planet, and it might as well, given how seldom we see it in New York. The Met Breuer show, with single environments at the Met Fifth Avenue and El Museo del Barrio, is the artist’s first museum survey here in over 40 years. This wouldn’t be especially notable — plenty of his Latin American peers never get seen at all — were Fontana, who died in 1968, not so influential a figure. The “threshold” in the title refers not only to the early phase of his career, which the Met Breuer exhibition highlights, but also to his position as a forebear of contemporary art as we know it. Things we take for granted — installation, new media and the poly-disciplinary impulse that defines so many 21st-century careers — Fontana pioneered in the 1950s. (Cotter) 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org ‘R.H. QUAYTMAN: +X, CHAPTER 34’ at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum (through April 23). At the summit the Guggenheim’s spiraling rotunda, this show appears as if the exhibition of the Swedish artist Hilma af Klint, on the floors below, had suddenly exploded into 28 fragments. Quaytman made this series of works in 2018 in response to af Klint’s oeuvre from the last century, and Quaytman is the perfect artist to answer af Klint: Af Klint worked in series, and Quaytman works in what she calls “chapters.” Where af Klint took orders from spirits she claimed to have contacted through séances, Quaytman, for this project, has adopted af Klint as her higher power, working in a more secular, channeled collaborative vein. And where af Klint offers a bright, dynamic symphony, Quaytman responds with a spare, restrained and slightly dissonant tone poem. (Schwendener) 212-423-3575, guggenheim.org",The New York Times

Quaytman made this series of works in 2018 in response to af Klint’s oeuvre from the last century, and Quaytman is the perfect artist to answer af Klint: Af Klint worked in series, and Quaytman works in what she calls “chapters.” Where af Klint took orders from spirits she claimed to have contacted through séances, Quaytman, for this project, has adopted af Klint as her higher power, working in a more secular, channeled collaborative vein. And where af Klint offers a bright, dynamic symphony, Quaytman responds with a spare, restrained and slightly dissonant tone poem.

Yet no big New York museum has given her a full retrospective, or even a significant one-person show, since a 1975 solo at the Whitney Museum of American Art. As this exhibition demonstrates, the institutional oversight is baffling, as her primary themes — racial justice and feminism (her 1972 breakthrough piece, “The Liberation of Aunt Jemima,” merges the two by transforming the racist stereotype of the smiling black mammy into an armed freedom fighter) — are exactly attuned to the present. (Cotter) 212-873-3400, nyhistory.org ‘SCENES FROM THE COLLECTION’ at the Jewish Museum. After a surgical renovation to its grand pile on Fifth Avenue, the Jewish Museum has reopened its third-floor galleries with a rethought, refreshed display of its permanent collection, which intermingles 4,000 years of Judaica with modern and contemporary art by Jews and gentiles alike — Mark Rothko, Lee Krasner, Nan Goldin, Cindy Sherman and the excellent young Nigerian draftswoman Ruby Onyinyechi Amanze. The works are shown in a nimble, nonchronological suite of galleries, and some of its century-spanning juxtapositions are bracing; others feel reductive, even dilettantish. But always, the Jewish Museum conceives of art and religion as interlocking elements of a story of civilization, commendably open to new influences and new interpretations. (Farago) 212-423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org ‘TOLKIEN: MAKER OF MIDDLE-EARTH’ at the Morgan Library & Museum (through May 12). J. R. R. Tolkien did more than write books like “The Hobbit” and the “Lord of the Rings” trilogy; he invented an alternate reality, complete with its own geography, languages, religion and an era-spanning history. This exhibition of his artwork, letters, drafts and other material reminds visitors that the stories Tolkien wrote, however impressive, represent only a fraction of his efforts, and it highlights his unparalleled ability to create an immersive experience using only words and pictures. After a visit you, too, may find yourself believing in Middle-earth and the hobbits, elves, dwarves, orcs and wizards that live there. (Peter Libbey) 212-685-0008, themorgan.org ‘T. REX: THE ULTIMATE PREDATOR’ at the American Museum of Natural History (through Aug. 9, 2020). Everyone’s favorite 18,000-pound prehistoric killer gets the star treatment in this eye-opening exhibition, which presents the latest scientific research on T. rex and also introduces many other tyrannosaurs, some discovered only this century in China and Mongolia. T. rex evolved mainly during the Cretaceous Period to have keen eyes, spindly arms and massive conical teeth, which could bear down on prey with the force of a U-Haul truck; the dinosaur could even swallow whole bones, as affirmed here by a kid-friendly display of fossilized excrement. The show mixes 66-million-year-old teeth with the latest 3-D prints of dino bones, and also presents new models of T. rex as a baby, a juvenile and a full-grown annihilator. Turns out this most savage beast was covered with — believe it! — a soft coat of beige or white feathers.

The persistent and liberating message in Ward’s sculpture and room-size installations is that art can be made from virtually anything. In this midcareer retrospective, anything means old carpets, plastic bags, bottles, zippers, bed springs, keys and furniture. Although the exhibition includes a number of large installations, Ward is best as a creator of curious and discrete sculptures, ones that remind us that our world is filled with potentially magical objects. We enter museums expecting to be transformed, but if we shift our perspective and look around us, we’ll see that everyday life is really just art waiting to happen. (Schwendener) 212-219-1222, newmuseum.org ‘THE WORLD BETWEEN EMPIRES: ART AND IDENTITY IN THE ANCIENT MIDDLE EAST’ at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (through June 23). The Met excels at epic-scale archaeological exhibitions, and this is a prime example. It brings together work made between 100 B.C. and A.D. 250 in what we now know as Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen. In the ancient world, all were in the sphere of two competing superpowers — Rome to the west and Parthia to the east — and though imperial influence was strong, it was far from all-determining. Each of the subject territories selectively grafted it onto local traditions to create distinctive new grass-roots cultural blends. Equally important, the show addresses the fate of art from the past in a politically fraught present. (Cotter) 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org ‘LUCIO FONTANA: ON THE THRESHOLD’ at the Met Breuer (through April 14). The art of this Argentine-Italian modernist looks a bit like it comes from another planet, and it might as well, given how seldom we see it in New York. The Met Breuer show, with single environments at the Met Fifth Avenue and El Museo del Barrio, is the artist’s first museum survey here in over 40 years. This wouldn’t be especially notable — plenty of his Latin American peers never get seen at all — were Fontana, who died in 1968, not so influential a figure. The “threshold” in the title refers not only to the early phase of his career, which the Met Breuer exhibition highlights, but also to his position as a forebear of contemporary art as we know it. Things we take for granted — installation, new media and the poly-disciplinary impulse that defines so many 21st-century careers — Fontana pioneered in the 1950s. (Cotter) 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org ‘JASPER JOHNS: RECENT PAINTINGS & WORKS ON PAPER’ at Matthew Marks Gallery (through April 6). Combining efforts from several series, dotted with unusually small canvases, this is among the most intimate and user-friendly of all Johns’s gallery exhibitions. Certain motifs recur; techniques and paint surfaces change; two astounding canvases reflect a new interest in green and the Vietnam War. The artist’s refusal, at 88, to slow down moves and inspires.

2019,18 Art Exhibitions to View in N.Y.C. This Weekend,"Our guide to new art shows and some that will be closing soon. ‘SIAH ARMAJANI: FOLLOW THIS LINE’ at the Met Breuer (through June 2). Born in Iran, Armajani has been living in the United States since 1960. This retrospective ranges from work he did as a teenage activist in Tehran to models of the many public sculptures he has produced across America over the past five decades. It introduces us to a sharp social thinker, a wry (and increasingly melancholic) metaphysician, a plain-style visual poet and, above all, an artist-ethicist. “Bridge Over Tree,” Armajani’s wonderful large-scale sculpture presented by Public Art Fund at Brooklyn Bridge Park (on the Empire Fulton Ferry Lawn through Sept. 29) to coincide with the Met show, is well timed for our present era of sundering moral confusion and offers ways forward from it.

Everything in “Artists Respond,” a big, inspiriting blast of an historical survey, dates from a time when the United States was losing its soul, and its artists — some, anyway — were trying to save theirs by denouncing a racist war. Figures well known for their politically hard-hitting work — Judith Bernstein, Leon Golub, Hans Haacke, Peter Saul, Nancy Spero — are here in strength. But so are others, like Dan Flavin and Donald Judd and Barnett Newman, seldom associated with visual activism. Concurrent with the survey is a smaller, fine-tuned show by a contemporary Vietnamese-born artist, Tiffany Chung; it views the war through the eyes of people on the receiving end of aggression.

The opening of the Brant Foundation Art Study Center in the East Village, with an exhibition of nearly 70 works by Basquiat created from 1980 to 1987, serves as a fitting temporary shrine for this Brooklyn-born painter, who became a global sensation in the early ’80s and died at 27 of a heroin overdose. Basquiat sprayed poetic, enigmatic graffiti on walls in downtown Manhattan before moving to canvas, dated Madonna before she was famous and made paintings with Andy Warhol. Part of a group of Neo-Expressionist painters who were largely rejected by critics, he was embraced by an influential audience and a surging art market and ended up creating a brand of African-American history painting that still resonates today. Tickets to the exhibition have sold out, but you can add your name to the wait list at the foundation’s website. (Martha Schwendener) 212-777-2977, brantfoundation.org ‘THE JIM HENSON EXHIBITION’ at the Museum of the Moving Image (ongoing). The rainbow connection has been established in Astoria, Queens, where this museum has opened a new permanent wing devoted to the career of America’s great puppeteer, who was born in Mississippi in 1936 and died, too young, in 1990. Henson began presenting the short TV program “Sam and Friends” before he was out of his teens; one of its characters, the soft-faced Kermit, was fashioned from his mother’s old coat and would not mature into a frog for more than a decade. The influence of early variety television, with its succession of skits and songs, runs through “Sesame Street” and “The Muppet Show,” though Henson also spent the late 1960s crafting peace-and-love documentaries and prototyping a psychedelic nightclub. Young visitors will delight in seeing Big Bird, Elmo, Miss Piggy and the Swedish Chef; adults can dig deep into sketches and storyboards and rediscover some old friends. (Jason Farago) 718-784-0077, movingimage.us ‘FRIDA KAHLO: APPEARANCES CAN BE DECEIVING’ at the Brooklyn Museum (through May 12). This is not exactly an exhibition of Kahlo’s art — it contains just 11 paintings, from compelling self-portraits to ghastly New Age kitsch — but an evocation of an artistic life through her elegant Oaxacan blouses and skirts, not to mention the corsets and spinal braces she wore after a crippling traffic accident. Do her outfits have the weight of art, or are they just so much biographical flimflam? Your answer may vary depending on your degree of Fridamania, but the woven shawls and color-saturated long skirts here, as well as gripping photographs of the artist by Carl Van Vechten, Imogen Cunningham, Manuel Álvarez Bravo and other great shutterbugs, suggest Kahlo’s real accomplishment was a Duchampian extension of her art far beyond the easel, into her home, her fashion and her public relationships.

With George Balanchine, the indefatigable Kirstein (1907-96) founded the School of American Ballet and the New York City Ballet. But he was also an impassioned writer, collector, curator and devotee of photography who had much to do with MoMA in its early years. The museum commemorates his complex career with art, letters and ballet ephemera, drawn from its vast holdings. (Roberta Smith)212-708-9400, moma.org ‘THE LONG RUN’ at the Museum of Modern Art (through May 5). The museum upends its cherished Modern narrative of ceaseless progress by mostly young (white) men. Instead we see works by artists 45 and older who have just kept on keeping on, regardless of attention or reward, sometimes saving the best for last. Art here is an older person’s game, a pursuit of a deepening personal vision over innovation. Winding through 17 galleries, the installation is alternatively visually or thematically acute and altogether inspiring. (Smith) 212-708-9400, moma.org ‘JOAN MIRÓ: BIRTH OF THE WORLD’ at the Museum of Modern Art (through June 15). Drawn mostly from MoMA’s unrivaled Miró collection, this fabulous exhibition is best when tracing the artist’s brilliant early twists on Modernism and their swift ascent to “The Birth of the World,” a 1927 masterpiece that presaged the drips and stains of radical painting two decades hence. Unappreciated in its time, it was barely exhibited until 1968. (Smith) 212-708-9400, moma.org ‘MONUMENTAL JOURNEY: THE DAGUERREOTYPES OF GIRAULT DE PRANGEY’ at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (through May 12). This exhibition is a buffed jewel. In 1842, just a couple of years after Louis Daguerre unveiled the world’s first practical camera, Joseph-Philibert Girault de Prangey, a French aristocrat with a yen for experimental technology, set off on a three-year road trip, lugging a 100-pound kit as he took the world’s first photographs of Athens, Cairo, Constantinople and Jerusalem. More than 100 of Girault de Prangey’s precise daguerreotypes glisten here under pin lights, and his systematic photos of Islamic architecture, in particular, express how the new technology of photography could flit between art and science, and would soon become a tool of colonial rule. Girault de Prangey’s daguerreotypes were little seen before 2003, when his descendants put them on the market; their discovery was a landmark in the history of early photography, and this show is too.

There are two major attractions: a pair of supertrees — 18-foot-tall steel armatures in the trunklike, canopied shape of actual trees — and a promenade of arches, dripping with orchids, that leads to the conservatory’s main dome.

2019,1969: Lebanon Declares State of Emergency After Riots,"International Herald Tribune BEIRUT, April 23 (AP). — A state of emergency was declared throughout Lebanon tonight after anti-government riots in which at least 10 died and scores were wounded. The state of emergency will last until Sunday, Radio Lebanon said. Demonstrators had spilled into the streets in Beirut, the capital; in the southern port of Sidon; and in the Bakaa Valley village of Barr Elias. Chanting slogans in support of the Arab guerrilla movement, they clashed in the streets with security forces. The government admitted that the 10 persons died in fighting in Beirut, in the southern town of Sidon and in the Bakaa Valley, but unconfirmed reports said the total may be higher. Scores were injured and arrested. In Beirut, machine-gun fire rattled through the streets as six armored cars were called into action. Students surged through the Basta area, a densely populated Moslem quarter and leftist stronghold, in support of the Arab guerrilla movement, and security forces were stoned from hastily erected street barricades. The students were defying a long-standing ban on demonstrations to protest against government restrictions on guerrilla activities in Lebanon. The army clamped an indefinite curfew on Beirut and steel-helmeted troops were patrolling all areas as dusk fell. The Lebanese government has tried to curb the guerrillas from using this country as a base for operations against neighboring Israel for fear of reprisals. Thirteen Lebanese civil airliners were destroyed in an Israeli commando raid on Beirut International Airport last Dec. 28. — The International Herald Tribune, April 24, 1969",The New York Times
2019,Chicagoans Reflect on What Having a Black Woman as Mayor Will Mean,"CHICAGO — Adrianne Burton, 38, believes that the next mayor of Chicago will have a sharper, more empathetic eye on the public schools. Carolyn Davenport, 62, is confident that the new mayor will be a superior manager, accustomed to running a career and a household without any fuss. On her lunch break in the Loop, Denise Thompson, 54, had a different view. “We’re making history, sure,” she said. “But a black woman running the city will be just like anybody else.” On Tuesday, Chicagoans were headed to the polls to vote for a successor to Mayor Rahm Emanuel. Residents were choosing between two African-American women, guaranteeing that Chicago will become the largest American city to elect a black woman as its mayor. [Read more about the Chicago election for mayor that resulted in a win for Lori Lightfoot, the first black woman to run the city.] Competing in the runoff election are Lori Lightfoot, a lawyer and former federal prosecutor, and Toni Preckwinkle, the president of the Cook County Board and the chairwoman of the county’s Democratic Party. Both women beat out 12 other candidates in an election in February, a who’s who of well-known names that made up the most crowded ballot in municipal history. As the voting began, the historic nature of the election was greeted in Chicago with both pride and nonchalance, a sense that electing an African-American woman as mayor would be significant, but not seismic. [Here’s more on Chicago’s election.] Maybe it is because Chicago has already seen such milestones, sending the first African-American president, Barack Obama, to the White House; helping elect the first African-American woman to the United States Senate, Carol Moseley Braun of Illinois, in 1992; and making Harold Washington the city’s first black mayor in 1983. “It is tremendous,” said Josie Brown Childs, a civic leader who worked for Mr. Washington in the 1980s. “But Chicago has been on the forefront of certain black politics, whether it was with Harold or Obama. We’ve been in the lead on those things.” In interviews around the city during the run-up to the election, Chicagoans said they were carefully weighing the platforms and promises of Ms. Preckwinkle and Ms. Lightfoot, watching their performances in televised debates and considering what kind of leader the current moment in Chicago demands. “For me, personally, I’m asking, ‘Who is going to be the break from politics as usual in Chicago?’” said Jordie Davies, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Chicago whose dissertation focuses on political activism. “I’m excited about two black women. But I’m looking at records. I’m looking at who is going to offer the most holistic platform for addressing problems in Chicago.” Deidre Baumann, 50, a lawyer who cast her vote Tuesday at a library in the Budlong Woods neighborhood on the North Side, said she would be happy with whichever candidate prevailed. “Either way, this is a historic election,” she said. She watched the debates and studied the candidates’ records carefully, she said, deciding in the end to vote for Ms. Lightfoot, who she believed would bring her experience as a federal prosecutor to push for criminal justice reform. [Here’s what you need to know about Lori Lightfoot, the first black woman to be elected mayor of Chicago and the first openly gay mayor for the city.] “We have to make this city safe for all the citizens and the police,” Ms. Baumann said. “On the other hand, we cannot continue to incarcerate black and brown people in disparate numbers.” In her eyes, Ms. Preckwinkle represented an older political model. “I’m disturbed a bit by her ties to the machine,” she said. “She always touted herself as the progressive candidate. She’s had to move away from that as she navigated the political system in Chicago.” The new mayor must contend with a host of complicated issues in the nation’s third largest city, including a deep pension crisis, persistent violent crime, reform of the police department and the question of how to spur investment and growth in long-neglected and segregated neighborhoods on Chicago’s West and South Sides. Under Mr. Emanuel, the downtown has boomed, flourishing with tech companies, high-rise hotels, a sparkling riverfront and luxury apartments. But many African-American residents have moved out of the city in recent years. Mr. Emanuel, who was elected to two terms, did not seek a third term in office. Polls have suggested that Ms. Lightfoot has a commanding lead over Ms. Preckwinkle, who entered the race last September after Mr. Emanuel announced that he would not run again. Ms. Preckwinkle garnered endorsements from powerful labor groups — the Chicago Teachers Union and the Service Employees International Union — and from prominent black leaders including Jesse White, the secretary of state. In the part of Chicago’s South Side that Ms. Preckwinkle once represented in the City Council, voters remembered her tenure fondly. Bob Kurth, 76, a longtime resident of the Kenwood neighborhood, said Ms. Preckwinkle came through years ago when he complained about a hole in the street near his condo building. “She was approachable: If you had a problem that was part of the ward, you called her and you had a meeting with her,” Mr. Kurth said on Tuesday after voting for Ms. Preckwinkle. “You saw her on the street, she always had time to talk to you.” Ms. Preckwinkle’s long stint in government was not a deterrent. “With Toni, she didn’t start as a politician, and that means a lot to me,” said Mr. Kurth, a retired salesman. “She’s learned how to play the game, but I don’t consider her a part of it.” Others saw Ms. Preckwinkle’s years in political office as a concern. The fact Ms. Lighftoot had not served in elective office helped her earn the vote of Michelle Saulnier, 29, a Ph.D. student. “It’s a good thing, especially in Chicago where there’s known to be a lot of corruption,” Ms. Saulnier said after casting her ballot in the Logan Square neighborhood, where Ms. Lightfoot lives and her campaign signs abound. “I think that’s really important to try to break some of these cycles that we’re in.” .” Ms. Lightfoot had a head start on the campaign trail, declaring her candidacy for mayor in May 2018, when it was widely believed that she would face off against Mr. Emanuel. A relatively unknown figure who has never held elective office, Ms. Lightfoot has spent time introducing herself to voters as a candidate who would focus on overhauling the police department, curbing street violence and rebuilding neighborhoods beyond the affluent downtown and North Side. Ra Joy, an entrepreneur in Chicago who was a candidate for lieutenant governor in 2018, endorsed Ms. Lightfoot early in the race, he said on Saturday at a candidate forum at the Rainbow PUSH Coalition on the South Side. A mayoral contest between two African-American women has scrambled the usual political calculus in Chicago, or what Mr. Joy called “tribal voting,” in which politicians could count on support from voters of their own race. “It’s turned that notion on its head,” he said, adding that the successful candidate would have to build coalitions of Latinos, whites and African-Americans in a city where the population is almost evenly divided among the three groups. Celestine A. Strain, 46, a hospital technician, brought her granddaughter Kalicia, 9, to the forum at Rainbow PUSH, hoping Kalicia would someday remember seeing two black women running for mayor of Chicago. “It’s amazing for her to see,” Ms. Strain said, adding that she was hoping Ms. Preckwinkle, who has been a familiar face in county government for years, would emerge victorious on Tuesday. “I really believe that she has the right experience.” The Rev. Jesse Jackson offered no endorsement in the race, saying that he hoped to be more of a peacemaker after what played out in recent weeks as a bitter campaign. On stage on Saturday, he urged both candidates to sign a statement agreeing to appear together the morning after the election. “I wanted to play a reconciling role,” Mr. Jackson said in an interview in his office at Rainbow PUSH. “The campaign ends. Let the healing begin.”",The New York Times
2019,2 Arrested in Vandalism of Slave Memorial at University of North Carolina,"Two people were arrested Monday on charges that they vandalized a memorial dedicated to slaves and African-American workers at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the university police said. The suspects, Nancy Rushton McCorkle, 50, and Ryan Francis Barnett, 31, face misdemeanor charges of vandalism and ethnic intimidation. Mr. Barnett also faces a misdemeanor charge of public urination. Efforts on Monday evening to reach Ms. McCorkle and Mr. Barnett by phone and through email were unsuccessful. The university police said they identified the suspects through video surveillance footage. The Unsung Founders Memorial was defaced with racial slurs and urine on March 31, and at least one of the vandals had ties to a group called Heirs to the Confederacy, the university said. The university has not specified what was written on the memorial or whether the slurs were directed at anyone in particular. Ms. McCorkle and Mr. Barnett are also charged with vandalizing an art installation on campus the same night, the university police said. The Unsung Founders Memorial, installed in 2005, is meant to honor “those men and women of color — enslaved and free — who helped build the Carolina we all know and love,” according to the university. It features a stone tabletop six feet in diameter that is held up by 300 bronze figurines. Its vandalism inflamed tensions at the university, where last year protesters toppled a Confederate monument called “Silent Sam,” seen by many as an emblem of white supremacy. The Unsung Founders Memorial, situated on the same plaza as Silent Sam, became a rallying point for those who opposed the statue. “When we were doing sit-ins on Silent Sam, protesters would organize to put flowers on Unsung Founders,” said Lindsay Ayling, a graduate student in the history department who helped organize protests of the statue. The toppling of Silent Sam came amid a greater reckoning nationwide over what to do with Confederate symbols and tributes. Confederate monuments have been removed across the country, from Los Angeles to Brooklyn. Silent Sam is being stored at a secure, undisclosed location on campus, until the university’s board of governors decides what to do with it, the university has said. Protests have continued both for and against that statue’s removal. Lance Spivey, chairman of the Heirs to the Confederacy, said Monday that both Ms. McCorkle and Mr. Barnett are members of the group. He said he was investigating the charges they face, but did not have further comment. He said he did not know if the two had retained lawyers. Heirs to the Confederacy has previously been involved in a number of high-profile confrontations on campus protesting the removal of Silent Sam since it was felled last August. In a March 12 blog post about the motivations for his activism, Mr. Spivey said, “I am willing to die for what I believe; I am more so ready to kill for it.” Four days later, he carried a handgun onto campus before being turned away by university police, according to the university and Mr. Spivey’s account. Ms. Ayling said she was “worried about the fact that the Heirs to the Confederacy have been coming to campus armed.”",The New York Times
2019,"2 Men Arrested in Killing of Lyra McKee, Northern Ireland Journalist","LONDON — The police in Northern Ireland said on Saturday that they had arrested two men under the terrorism act in connection with the killing of Lyra McKee, a journalist who was covering a night of violent unrest in Londonderry. The men, ages 18 and 19, were taken to a police station in Belfast, the capital, which handles serious investigations, to be questioned in the killing of Ms. McKee on Thursday in the Creggan area of Londonderry, the Derry City and Strabane District Police said in a statement on Twitter. Londonderry is known to many of its residents, especially those who are Roman Catholic, as Derry. The police said on Friday that they were attributing the killing on Thursday night to the New Irish Republican Army, a militant splinter group. The violence that night came on the 21st anniversary of the Good Friday agreement, the 1998 accord that largely brought an end to decades of conflict in the region between republicans or nationalists, largely Catholic, who believe Northern Ireland should be part of a united Ireland, and unionists, largely Protestant, who want it to remain British. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, Ms. McKee, 29, was the first journalist to be killed in Northern Ireland since 2001, when loyalists — unionist extremists — shot dead Martin O’Hagan, a reporter investigating paramilitaries and drug gangs for a Dublin-based newspaper. In the search for information about Ms. McKee’s killing, the police released CCTV footage showing her standing in the crowd in Creggan, a heavily Catholic area of Londonderry, on the night she was killed. The video also shows a masked figure leaning in from behind a street corner. At a vigil in the city on Friday, Ms. McKee’s partner, Sara Canning, spoke of her as “the woman I was planning to grow old with” and said her dreams had been “snuffed out by a single barbaric act.” “We are all poorer for the loss of Lyra,” she said. The vigil, parts of which were broadcast on the BBC, brought together the leaders of the two main rival parties of Northern Ireland, Mary Lou McDonald of the leading republican party, Sinn Fein, and Arlene Foster of the Democratic Unionist Party, who were pictured standing side by side, with Ms. Canning holding a rainbow flag in the background. Ms. Foster said it was her first visit to Creggan, which is a republican heartland. “I came to stand in solidarity with all of the people who are here today,” she told mourners, gesturing with both hands toward the crowd. Applause followed. “And I want to say, your pain is my pain; it doesn’t matter whether you are Catholic or Protestant, whether you identify as Irish or British,” she said. Facing widespread public anger, a group considered to be speaking for the New Irish Republican Army announced that it would cancel a parade it had planned to hold in Creggan on Monday to commemorate the anniversary of the Easter Rising, a 1916 rebellion in Dublin against British rule in Ireland. Commemorations of the Easter Rising are annual rites in Irish republican culture, and it was a police search for arms and explosives that they believed would be used in an attack to mark the occasion that sparked the riot in which Ms. McKee died. The group, Saoradh (Irish for “Liberation”), said in a statement on its website on Friday that a “republican volunteer” had been defending the area against what it termed an attack by armed “crown forces” when Ms. McKee was “killed accidentally while standing behind armed crown force personnel and armoured vehicles.” It later added a line to the statement saying, “The Derry 1916 Commemoration Committee have opted to cancel this Easter Monday’s annual commemoration as a mark of respect for the tragic and accidental killing of Lyra McKee.” Colleagues remembered Ms. McKee as an accomplished investigative journalist; in 2016, she was named on a Forbes list of remarkable news media professionals under 30. She crowdsourced funds for the research of her first book, “Angels With Blue Faces,” an investigation into the killing of a unionist lawmaker by the Provisional Irish Republican Army in 1981. The book was published last year. Recently, she was working on “The Lost Boys,” about the disappearances of children and young men during the Troubles, as the years of conflict in Northern Ireland are known. An online fund-raiser to help her family with funeral expenses collected about 47,000 pounds — more than $60,000 — in its first day.",The New York Times
2019,U.N.C. Charlotte Shooting Leaves 2 Dead and 4 Wounded,"Read Wednesday’s updates as we learn more about the shooting. A man with a pistol walked into a classroom at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte late Tuesday afternoon and opened fire, fatally shooting two people and injuring four others on the last day of classes, the authorities said. The police disarmed the suspect and took him into custody at a building on campus, Chief Jeff Baker of the U.N.C.C. Police and Public Safety Department said. The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department identified the suspect as Trystan Andrew Terrell, 22. The police declined to elaborate on a possible motive for the shooting. On Wednesday, the university identified the six victims, all of whom were students. It said the two who were killed were Ellis Parlier, 19, of Midland, N.C., and Riley Howell, 21, of Waynesville, N.C. The four students who were injured were Sean DeHart, 20, and Drew Pescaro, 19, both of Apex, N.C.; Emily Houpt, 23, of Charlotte; and Rami Alramadhan, 20, of Saudi Arabia. All four were expected to survive, the university’s chancellor, Philip Dubois, told WBT radio. “Three of them had surgery and are still in the hospital,” he said. “One was released.” The chief said the gunman did not say anything when he was taken into custody. “One officer immediately went to the suspect to take him down,” he said. “Our officers’ actions definitely saved lives.” By The New York Times Mr. Terrell was charged with two counts of murder, four counts of attempted murder, four counts of assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill, possession of a firearm on an educational property and discharging a firearm on an educational property. Just before 6 p.m., the campus’s office of emergency management reported that shots were fired near the Kennedy Building, an administrative building in the middle of campus. Katie Ballard, 24, a graduate student in gerontology, was sitting in a classroom in a nearby building when her professor stepped out. The professor came back in and said she heard somebody had been shot. Then an alert popped up on a projector screen at the front of the class saying that gunshots had been fired close by. “Run, Hide, Fight,” the alert said. “Secure yourself immediately.” Ms. Ballard ran with about 30 other students to an empty room nearby and locked the doors. Ms. Ballard never heard any gunshots, but she heard helicopters buzzing while locked in the room. She heard students running up and down the halls. Through the window, she saw a man who had been shot in the abdomen. A handful of paramedics crouched around him, tending to his wounds. “It was so surreal,” Ms. Ballard said. “I just felt all the blood leave my face. I felt there’s no way this is real.” Eventually, she said, “the police came and knocked on the door, and we were all escorted out with our hands above our head.” Videos posted on Twitter showed police officers running in one direction while students streamed in the other direction. “We are in shock to learn of an active shooter situation on the campus of UNC Charlotte,” Vi Lyles, the mayor of Charlotte, said in a tweet. “My thoughts are with the families of those who lost their lives, those injured, the entire UNCC community and the courageous first responders who sprang into action to help others.” It was the final day of classes for the school year, with graduation ceremonies scheduled for early May. Some students were getting ready for the summer break, and some were preparing to attend an on-campus concert featuring the rapper Waka Flocka Flame, which was canceled after the shooting. Joan F. Lorden, the school’s provost and vice chancellor for academic affairs, said at a news conference late Tuesday evening that the school had canceled final exams through Sunday. “From today through the weekend,” she said, “everything academic is essentially canceled.” Gov. Roy Cooper of North Carolina said at the news conference that the state would take a “hard look” at how such shootings could be prevented in the future. “This is a tough day, but this university will get through it,” Mr. Cooper said. “One thing I do know is a student should not have to fear for his or her life when they are on our campuses.” The episode was yet another in a series of deadly shootings that have made headlines across the United States. It happened three days after a gunman opened fire at a synagogue in Poway, Calif., killing a congregant there, and came on the heels of anniversaries of other deadly school shootings. It has been a little more than one year since 17 people were killed in Parkland, Fla., and two decades since 13 were killed at Columbine High School. U.N.C. Charlotte is a public university with an enrollment of about 30,000. It is the largest postsecondary educational institution in the Charlotte area.",The New York Times
2019,2 Virginia Police Officers Are Fired Amid Allegations of Links to White Nationalists,"Two Virginia police officers who worked for different agencies were fired this week after an anti-fascist group linked them to white nationalist organizations. The first case involved Sgt. Robert A. Stamm of the Virginia Division of Capitol Police, who had been assigned to protests calling on Gov. Ralph Northam to resign over a racist yearbook photo that surfaced in February. Anti-Fascists of the Seven Hills, which said it was based in Richmond, Va., wrote online in February that Sergeant Stamm came to its attention because he had a large Band-Aid covering his neck while patrolling. The group found photos on social media of Sergeant Stamm with tattoos, flags and banners that used white supremacist symbols and images, it said in a blog post. It also said he was linked to the Asatru Folk Assembly, which the Southern Poverty Law Center has described as an extremist group that invokes pre-Christian Nordic spirituality. In 2015, the F.B.I. foiled a plot by men it described as followers of an extremist variant of the Asatru faith to attack black churches and synagogues in the Chesterfield area. Sergeant Stamm was suspended after the group published its post. On Wednesday, Col. Anthony S. Pike, the Capitol Police chief, announced in a statement that Sergeant Stamm had been “separated from his employment.” He did not explain what had led to the firing. In Facebook messages on Thursday night, Mr. Stamm said that he was discriminated against for his Asatru religion. “My religion is not politics, it is faith,” he wrote. “My constitutional rights were violated. Period.” In the second case, Daniel Morley, a school resource officer with the Chesterfield County Police Department, was fired Thursday following an investigation into allegations that he was affiliated with the group Identity Evropa, also known as the American Identity Movement. Members of that group helped plan the 2017 “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, Va., according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. Antifa Seven Hills had identified Mr. Morley as a “pledge coordinator” for the group, which recruits on college campuses and elsewhere. Antifa said that Mr. Morley was responsible “for guiding new applicants through the vetting process” and had been a member since 2017. Mr. Morley was suspended in March while the department investigated the claims. Col. Jeffrey S. Katz, the police chief, wrote on social media on Thursday that investigators had authenticated the online postings and activities. “The views espoused by and attributed to Mr. Morley violate county and departmental policy and our organizational values; his continued employment is antithetical to the expectations of our personnel and those we serve,” he wrote. The anti-fascist group also alleged that Mr. Stamm and Mr. Morley knew each other, and in March it posted what it said was a photo of the two together. Efforts to Mr. Morley on Thursday night were unsuccessful.",The New York Times
2019,2 Women Were Killed on a Beach Vacation in 1973. A DNA Test Just Led to an Arrest.,"In the nearly 30 years that Ernest J. Broadnax has lived in New York City, he has always been known for getting into trouble, with 14 arrests on charges like assault and burglary. He served three stints in state prison. But now, in an advanced age, he’s become known to neighbors as a cordial but distant man, who has struggled with alcohol and drug addiction. But none of the crimes in New York that he was charged with were as severe as the gruesome killings he is now accused of having committed. This week, the police in Queens arrested Mr. Broadnax for the 1973 murders of two women who had been vacationing in Virginia, the police there said. A cold-case squad in Virginia Beach identified Mr. Broadnax, who is in his 80s, as a suspect by using technology that did not even exist when the women, Lynn Seethaler and Janice Pietropola, both 19, were killed inside a motel cottage near the oceanfront. DNA evidence found at the crime scene was used last fall to match Mr. Broadnax’s profile in a national database, a Virginia Beach law enforcement official said. The official did not say what type of DNA was collected from the scene, and requested anonymity to discuss the pending case because doing so is illegal under Virginia law. Mr. Broadnax, a native of Virginia, was arrested on Monday on a fugitive warrant issued by the Virginia Beach police. Officials there said he is charged with two counts of murder and one count of rape. He is being held on a New York City jail barge awaiting extradition, according to the police and jail records. “Our objective now is to be able to bring justice for the victims, and for their families to be able to have a sense of peace and closure,” said Officer Linda Kuehn, a spokeswoman for the Virginia Beach police. Ms. Seethaler and Ms. Pietropola were from Pittsburgh and were on vacation when their bodies were found in an oceanside motel on June 30, 1973, according to the local police’s online summary of the case. William Haden, the retired detective who handled the case, said in an interview on Tuesday that the killer strangled Ms. Seethaler, slashed her throat and shot her twice in the head; Ms. Pietropola was strangled, raped and shot three times, he said. A motel clerk had called the police after the women failed to show up to check out at the end of their weeklong stay, Mr. Haden said. The police later said the attacker had removed a screen and climbed into the room, according to The Virginian-Pilot. Investigators interviewed two men who had dated the women, The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported, but did not charge them with a crime. They were among hundreds of people questioned and thousands of leads exhausted by 1988, the police told The Virginian-Pilot. But the case went cold. “I am just relieved,” Mr. Haden said. “It was an albatross around my neck all those years, and that albatross has now been removed.” The arrest stunned Adedayo Peterson, whose mother was briefly married to Mr. Broadnax in the 1970s. She said Mr. Broadnax had served in the Army and had been incarcerated in Virginia before he met her mother. “I didn’t expect nothing like that,” Ms. Peterson said. “But I wouldn’t put it past him.” The marriage, his second, was short-lived and soured after Mr. Broadnax became violent. He once whipped her mother with a belt and on another occasion pulled a gun on her brother, Ms. Peterson said. A public defense lawyer assigned to Mr. Broadnax’s case could not be reached for comment. A local television station, WTKR, reported in 2011 that the killings of Ms. Seethaler and Ms. Pietropola were two of at least 12 women with similar physical traits who were murdered or went missing in Virginia Beach between 1973 and 1985. Though the police considered the possibility of a serial killer, investigators were unable to determine if the killings were connected, Mr. Haden said. Some of the women were killed in their homes and two were found floating in the ocean. Several other women vanished from the oceanfront and have never been found. “Of course you look at that,” Mr. Haden said of trying to connect the killings. “You wouldn’t be worth the powder on your shoes if you didn’t.” Mr. Broadnax has lived in New York since at least 1990, where he has been incarcerated three times for crimes including assault, according to corrections records. State law required him to submit DNA because he was convicted of a felony. He was released from prison on parole in 2013, after serving most of an eight-year sentence for assault, according to state prison records. In that incident, the police said he was selling metal scraps in Manhattan in 2006 when he got into a fight with a customer and broke the man’s arm. He settled into a first-floor apartment in Hollis, Queens, where neighbors said he was quiet but cordial, waving hello to neighbors, and carrying on small talk. “He was one of the older people in the building,” said one neighbor, who also refused to give their name. “Sometimes he forgot things, like he had dementia. We all looked out for him, you know?” A few months ago, Patrick Penafiel, 63, said, that he saw three detectives in the hallway, questioning Mr. Broadnax before searching his apartment. Mr. Penafiel only recalled one occasion when Mr. Broadnax socialized, when he was invited to a tenants’ meeting. “He told us he was a recovering alcoholic, and drug addict,” he said. “He showed us his diploma from a rehabilitation center. We all clapped for him.” An earlier version of this article misstated the day Ernest J. Broadnax was arrested. It was Monday, not Thursday.",The New York Times
2019,20 Art Exhibitions to View in N.Y.C. This Weekend,"Our guide to new art shows and some that will be closing soon. ‘SIAH ARMAJANI: FOLLOW THIS LINE’ at the Met Breuer (through June 2). Born in Iran, Armajani has been living in the United States since 1960. This retrospective ranges from work he did as a teenage activist in Tehran to models of the many public sculptures he has produced across America over the past five decades. It introduces us to a sharp social thinker, a wry (and increasingly melancholic) metaphysician, a plain-style visual poet and, above all, an artist-ethicist. “Bridge Over Tree,” Armajani’s wonderful large-scale sculpture presented by Public Art Fund at Brooklyn Bridge Park (on the Empire Fulton Ferry Lawn through Sept. 29) to coincide with the Met show, is well timed for our present era of sundering moral confusion and offers ways forward from it. (Holland Cotter) 212-731-1675, metmuseum.org ‘ARTISTS RESPOND: AMERICAN ART AND THE VIETNAM WAR, 1965-1975’ (through Aug. 18) and ‘TIFFANY CHUNG: VIETNAM, PAST IS PROLOGUE’ (through Sept. 2) at Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington. Everything in “Artists Respond,” a big, inspiriting blast of an historical survey, dates from a time when the United States was losing its soul, and its artists — some, anyway — were trying to save theirs by denouncing a racist war. Figures well known for their politically hard-hitting work — Judith Bernstein, Leon Golub, Hans Haacke, Peter Saul, Nancy Spero — are here in strength. But so are others, like Dan Flavin and Donald Judd and Barnett Newman, seldom associated with visual activism. Concurrent with the survey is a smaller, fine-tuned show by a contemporary Vietnamese-born artist, Tiffany Chung; it views the war through the eyes of people on the receiving end of aggression. (Cotter) 202-663-7970, americanart.si.edu ‘MATTHEW BARNEY: REDOUBT’ at Yale University Art Gallery in New Haven (through June 16). The wildly innovative sculptor and filmmaker, Yale class of 1989, heads back to the halls of ivy to present his first major project since the six-hour excremental eruption of “River of Fundament” — and shows Barney in a lighter, nimbler mode than he has displayed in years. The new film “Redoubt,” shot in his home state of Idaho, riffs on the myth of Diana and Actaeon; the goddess, here, is an NRA-approved sharpshooter, while the doomed voyeur is the artist himself, making plein-air etchings of Diana and her attendants. Related copper etchings appear in the exhibition, and Barney has electroplated them over varying times, encrusting them with weird metal nodules. “Redoubt” lacks the operatic grandeur some of Barney’s fanboys prefer. But it’s the most emancipated work of his career, and it should make a star of Eleanor Bauer, the dancer and choreographer whom he has entrusted with the film’s most beautiful movement sequences. The film runs about two hours and screens on Saturday afternoons and on select weekdays; check the website for times. (Jason Farago) 203-432-0600, artgallery.yale.edu ‘JEAN-MICHEL BASQUIAT’ at the Brant Foundation (through May 15). The opening of the Brant Foundation Art Study Center in the East Village, with an exhibition of nearly 70 works by Basquiat created from 1980 to 1987, serves as a fitting temporary shrine for this Brooklyn-born painter, who became a global sensation in the early ’80s and died at 27 of a heroin overdose. Basquiat sprayed poetic, enigmatic graffiti on walls in downtown Manhattan before moving to canvas, dated Madonna before she was famous and made paintings with Andy Warhol. Part of a group of Neo-Expressionist painters who were largely rejected by critics, he was embraced by an influential audience and a surging art market and ended up creating a brand of African-American history painting that still resonates today. Tickets to the exhibition have sold out, but you can add your name to the wait list at the foundation’s website. (Martha Schwendener) 212-777-2977, brantfoundation.org ‘THE JIM HENSON EXHIBITION’ at the Museum of the Moving Image (ongoing). The rainbow connection has been established in Astoria, Queens, where this museum has opened a new permanent wing devoted to the career of America’s great puppeteer, who was born in Mississippi in 1936 and died, too young, in 1990. Henson began presenting the short TV program “Sam and Friends” before he was out of his teens; one of its characters, the soft-faced Kermit, was fashioned from his mother’s old coat and would not mature into a frog for more than a decade. The influence of early variety television, with its succession of skits and songs, runs through “Sesame Street” and “The Muppet Show,” though Henson also spent the late 1960s crafting peace-and-love documentaries and prototyping a psychedelic nightclub. Young visitors will delight in seeing Big Bird, Elmo, Miss Piggy and the Swedish Chef; adults can dig deep into sketches and storyboards and rediscover some old friends. (Farago) 718-784-0077, movingimage.us ‘FRIDA KAHLO: APPEARANCES CAN BE DECEIVING’ at the Brooklyn Museum (through May 12). This is not exactly an exhibition of Kahlo’s art — it contains just 11 paintings, from compelling self-portraits to ghastly New Age kitsch — but an evocation of an artistic life through her elegant Oaxacan blouses and skirts, not to mention the corsets and spinal braces she wore after a crippling traffic accident. Do her outfits have the weight of art, or are they just so much biographical flimflam? Your answer may vary depending on your degree of Fridamania, but the woven shawls and color-saturated long skirts here, as well as gripping photographs of the artist by Carl Van Vechten, Imogen Cunningham, Manuel Álvarez Bravo and other great shutterbugs, suggest Kahlo’s real accomplishment was a Duchampian extension of her art far beyond the easel, into her home, her fashion and her public relationships. (Farago) 718-638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org ‘LINCOLN KIRSTEIN’S MODERN’ at the Museum of Modern Art (through June 15). With George Balanchine, the indefatigable Kirstein (1907-96) founded the School of American Ballet and the New York City Ballet. But he was also an impassioned writer, collector, curator and devotee of photography who had much to do with MoMA in its early years. The museum commemorates his complex career with art, letters and ballet ephemera, drawn from its vast holdings. (Roberta Smith) 212-708-9400, moma.org ‘ALICJA KWADE: PARAPIVOT’ at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (through Oct. 27). This shrewd and scientifically inclined artist, born in Poland and based in Berlin, has delivered the best edition in five years of the Met’s hit-or-(often-)miss rooftop sculpture commission. Two tall armatures of interlocking steel rectangles, the taller of them rising more than 18 feet, support heavy orbs of different-colored marble; some of the balls perch precariously on the steel frames, while others, head-scratchingly, are squinched between them. Walk around these astral abstractions and the frames seem to become quotation marks for the transformed skyline of Midtown; the marbles might be planets, each just as precarious as the one from which they’ve been quarried. (Farago)212-535-7710, metmuseum.org ‘JOAN MIRÓ: BIRTH OF THE WORLD’ at the Museum of Modern Art (through June 15). Drawn mostly from MoMA’s unrivaled Miró collection, this fabulous exhibition is best when tracing the artist’s brilliant early twists on Modernism and their swift ascent to “The Birth of the World,” a 1927 masterpiece that presaged the drips and stains of radical painting two decades hence. Unappreciated in its time, it was barely exhibited until 1968. (Smith) 212-708-9400, moma.org ‘MONUMENTAL JOURNEY: THE DAGUERREOTYPES OF GIRAULT DE PRANGEY’ at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (through May 12). This exhibition is a buffed jewel. In 1842, just a couple of years after Louis Daguerre unveiled the world’s first practical camera, Joseph-Philibert Girault de Prangey, a French aristocrat with a yen for experimental technology, set off on a three-year road trip, lugging a 100-pound kit as he took the world’s first photographs of Athens, Cairo, Constantinople and Jerusalem. More than 100 of Girault de Prangey’s precise daguerreotypes glisten here under pin lights, and his systematic photos of Islamic architecture, in particular, express how the new technology of photography could flit between art and science, and would soon become a tool of colonial rule. Girault de Prangey’s daguerreotypes were little seen before 2003, when his descendants put them on the market; their discovery was a landmark in the history of early photography, and this show is too. (Farago) 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org ‘MORONI: THE RICHES OF RENAISSANCE PORTRAITURE’ at the Frick Collection (through June 2). Moroni, among the best of underappreciated Renaissance painters, brought a new level of naturalism to his subjects, who included lavishly dressed aristocrats but also scholars and tradesmen. (See his depiction of an extraordinarily handsome, sensitive and contemporary-looking tailor.) We seem to be looking at real people as they existed, unidealized, meticulously observed and psychologically present, especially in their direct appraising gazes. A thrilling show.

This sturdy addition to our story of the global 1960s, organized by the respected art historian Reiko Tomii, introduces American audiences to three bold positions in Japanese art — by one solo figure and two collectives who all worked far from the lights of Tokyo. Yutaka Matsuzawa, a Conceptualist with a Buddhist streak working in a forest near Nagano, made posters and mail art that aimed to imagine a world of total nothingness. The group GUN, in agrarian Niigata, produced breathtaking land art by filling pesticide sprayers with pigment and spewing color across fresh snow. And the Play, a collective in the Kansai region, sailed together on barges or built tree houses on hillsides to rediscover freedoms beyond social boundaries. The lesson: It’s not just the opposition of East and West that needs rethinking, but that of the metropolis and the sticks. (Farago)212-715-1258, japansociety.org ‘BETYE SAAR: KEEPIN’ IT CLEAN’ at the New-York Historical Society (through May 27). Saar has been making important and influential work for nearly 60 years. Yet no big New York museum has given her a full retrospective, or even a significant one-person show, since a 1975 solo at the Whitney Museum of American Art. As this exhibition demonstrates, the institutional oversight is baffling, as her primary themes — racial justice and feminism (her 1972 breakthrough piece, “The Liberation of Aunt Jemima,” merges the two by transforming the racist stereotype of the smiling black mammy into an armed freedom fighter) — are exactly attuned to the present. (Cotter) 212-873-3400, nyhistory.org ‘SCENES FROM THE COLLECTION’ at the Jewish Museum (ongoing). After a surgical renovation to its grand pile on Fifth Avenue, the Jewish Museum has reopened its third-floor galleries with a rethought, refreshed display of its permanent collection, which intermingles 4,000 years of Judaica with modern and contemporary art by Jews and gentiles alike — Mark Rothko, Lee Krasner, Nan Goldin, Cindy Sherman and the excellent young Nigerian draftswoman Ruby Onyinyechi Amanze. The works are shown in a nimble, nonchronological suite of galleries, and some of its century-spanning juxtapositions are bracing; others feel reductive, even dilettantish. But always, the Jewish Museum conceives of art and religion as interlocking elements of a story of civilization, commendably open to new influences and new interpretations. (Farago) 212-423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org ‘TOLKIEN: MAKER OF MIDDLE-EARTH’ at the Morgan Library & Museum (through May 12). J. R. R. Tolkien did more than write books like “The Hobbit” and the “Lord of the Rings” trilogy; he invented an alternate reality, complete with its own geography, languages, religion and an era-spanning history. This exhibition of his artwork, letters, drafts and other material reminds visitors that the stories Tolkien wrote, however impressive, represent only a fraction of his efforts, and it highlights his unparalleled ability to create an immersive experience using only words and pictures. After a visit you, too, may find yourself believing in Middle-earth and the hobbits, elves, dwarves, orcs and wizards that live there. (Peter Libbey) 212-685-0008, themorgan.org ‘T. REX: THE ULTIMATE PREDATOR’ at the American Museum of Natural History (through Aug. 9, 2020). Everyone’s favorite 18,000-pound prehistoric killer gets the star treatment in this eye-opening exhibition, which presents the latest scientific research on T. rex and also introduces many other tyrannosaurs, some discovered only this century in China and Mongolia. T. rex evolved mainly during the Cretaceous Period to have keen eyes, spindly arms and massive conical teeth, which could bear down on prey with the force of a U-Haul truck; the dinosaur could even swallow whole bones, as affirmed here by a kid-friendly display of fossilized excrement. The show mixes 66-million-year-old teeth with the latest 3-D prints of dino bones, and also presents new models of T. rex as a baby, a juvenile and a full-grown annihilator. Turns out this most savage beast was covered with — believe it! — a soft coat of beige or white feathers. (Farago) 212-769-5100, amnh.org ‘NARI WARD: WE THE PEOPLE’ at the New Museum (through May 26). The persistent and liberating message in Ward’s sculpture and room-size installations is that art can be made from virtually anything. In this midcareer retrospective, anything means old carpets, plastic bags, bottles, zippers, bed springs, keys and furniture. Although the exhibition includes a number of large installations, Ward is best as a creator of curious and discrete sculptures, ones that remind us that our world is filled with potentially magical objects. We enter museums expecting to be transformed, but if we shift our perspective and look around us, we’ll see that everyday life is really just art waiting to happen.

The Met excels at epic-scale archaeological exhibitions, and this is a prime example. It brings together work made between 100 B.C. and A.D. 250 in what we now know as Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen. In the ancient world, all were in the sphere of two competing superpowers — Rome to the west and Parthia to the east — and though imperial influence was strong, it was far from all-determining. Each of the subject territories selectively grafted it onto local traditions to create distinctive new grass-roots cultural blends. Equally important, the show addresses the fate of art from the past in a politically fraught present. (Cotter) 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org ‘THE LONG RUN’ at the Museum of Modern Art (through May 5). The museum upends its cherished Modern narrative of ceaseless progress by mostly young (white) men. Instead we see works by artists 45 and older who have just kept on keeping on, regardless of attention or reward, sometimes saving the best for last. Art here is an older person’s game, a pursuit of a deepening personal vision over innovation. Winding through 17 galleries, the installation is alternatively visually or thematically acute and altogether inspiring.

This 17th annual orchid extravaganza features the natural species and hybridized sensations of Southeast Asia — upward of 70 percent of the display in the Enid A. Haupt Conservatory. Thousands of them, in hundreds of varieties and every conceivable — and inconceivable — shape, size and color. The partners on this show are Singapore Botanic Gardens, whose National Orchid Garden has the largest collection in the world, and Singapore’s Gardens by the Bay, a green-themed entertainment attraction where the wedding party finale in “Crazy Rich Asians” was filmed. There are two major attractions: a pair of supertrees — 18-foot-tall steel armatures in the trunklike, canopied shape of actual trees — and a promenade of arches, dripping with orchids, that leads to the conservatory’s main dome. The colors move through a spectrum from yellow — Oncidium ‘Goldiana,’ or the “dancing lady” orchid — to pink to darker, hotter shades. It is like walking under a rainbow. (William L.

2019,"20 Years After Columbine, Schools Have Gotten Safer. But Fears Have Only Grown.","Present your driver’s license to be scanned and verified. Have your photograph taken. Pass your belongings through a metal detector. Welcome to your child’s school. Twenty years after the Columbine High School shooting, a school visit can feel like going to the airport. See-through backpacks and armed officers are common sights on campus. So are “run, hide, fight” trainings, full of tips on how to survive an active shooter. Some days might bring lockdown drills that students are not told in advance are rehearsals, not real threats. And in rare cases, the adult teaching algebra or social studies might be armed. Hundreds of millions of public dollars have been spent “hardening” schools against every parent’s nightmare: something like the 1999 shooting in which two students killed 12 of their classmates and a teacher at a Colorado high school, and set off an enduring debate on gun violence and the safety of the nation’s schools. But ramping up security never relieved anxieties. Americans believe schools are more unsafe today than they were two decades ago, according to a new poll — even as federal data shows that by most measures, schools have become safer. In some ways, the panic and dark legacy of Columbine brought to suburban and rural schools some of the fears and pressure that urban students of color had already been living under. In the 1990s, the crime rate at schools and in larger society was already beginning a historic decline. But the myth of the “superpredator” — a generation of youth who were said to be inherently violent — led to more police officers and metal detectors in urban schools. Administrators doled out harsh punishments for ordinary infractions like fighting and truancy, ranging from suspensions and expulsions to referrals to the criminal justice system. For many children in urban centers, school hardening began long before the image of gunmen stalking classrooms was seared into the national consciousness. A survey last month of 1,063 adults by The Associated Press and the N.O.R.C. Center at the University of Chicago found that 74 percent of parents of school-age children, and 64 percent of nonparents, believed schools were more unsafe today than they were in 1999. Only 35 percent of parents said they felt “very confident” that their child was safe at school. The seemingly endless string of mass shootings has certainly not helped. Newtown. Parkland. Santa Fe. Just this week, hundreds of schools across Colorado were closed while officials frantically searched for an armed woman who they said had made threats and was “infatuated” with Columbine. Half the respondents in the AP-N.O.R.C. poll said that bullying deserved “a great deal” of the blame for school shootings, and 48 percent said the availability of guns was “a great deal” to blame. Their fears run counter to the data presented in a federal report released this week. School is still among the safest places an American child can be. Homicide is a leading cause of death for American youth, but the vast majority of those deaths take place at home or in the neighborhood. Between 1992 and 2016, just 3 percent of youth homicides and 1 percent of youth suicides took place at school, according to the federal report. School crime levels decreased between 2001 and 2017. The number of students between 12 and 18 years old who reported being the victim of a violent crime at school over the past six months dropped from 2 to 1 percent. Incidents of theft, physical fights, the availability of illegal drugs and bullying also went down. These changes echo the national drop in crime. When school shootings did take place in recent years, they were typically the result of personal altercations, relationship violence or robberies, according to research from Everytown for Gun Safety, an anti-gun organization. The unique horror of mass shootings means they occupy a central place in parents’ fears, and in the nation’s political debate about gun access and school safety, even though they remain rare. There were 37 active-shooter incidents at American schools between 2000 and 2017, an average of two to three such episodes per year. Those events resulted in 67 people being killed and 86 wounded, according to the federal data. The most notorious school shootings have taken place at suburban, predominantly white schools. But students of color are disproportionately affected by more typical gun violence. Fourteen percent of Native American students and 8 percent of black students reported being threatened or injured by a weapon at school in 2017, compared with 5 percent of white students, according to the federal report. Experts caution that schools should avoid overpreparing for mass shootings and should instead focus on more typical threats to students’ safety. Those include mental health problems, family trauma, severe weather, traffic accidents on or near school grounds and child abductions due to custody disputes. When it comes to hardening schools, policymakers “are spending money that is not effective,” said Jagdish Khubchandani, a professor of health science at Ball State University and an author of a new study that found no evidence that any of the common expenditures on campus security have decreased gun violence. He warned that the money spent on school security came with opportunity costs: fewer funds for nurses, guidance counselors or academic enrichment, as well as less political pressure on addressing the widespread availability of guns. “You walk into a school and you are almost in a military zone,” Professor Khubchandani said. “Is that conducive to education?”",The New York Times
2019,"20 Years After Columbine, What Have We Learned?","Retro Report A horrifying mass shooting that unfolded onscreen in real time has become a recurring nightmare with a well-worn script. Columbine wasn’t the first. There had been other mass shootings at American schools. One in 1997 killed three students and wounded five others at a high school in West Paducah, Ky. A 1998 massacre at a middle school in Jonesboro, Ark., left five dead and 10 wounded. But no earlier burst of gun insanity shattered the national psyche like the carnage on April 20, 1999, at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., outside Denver. The very name Columbine — rooted in the Latin word for dove, an enduring symbol of peace — was instantly transmogrified into a metaphor for a nation gone haywire in its embrace of devastating weaponry. Twenty years later, the attack remains as vivid as yesterday for many Americans, and not only because of its appalling casualty count: 13 killed and 21 wounded, excluding the heavily armed shooters, teenage students who took their own lives. Columbine was more than the deadliest assault till then on a high school in the United States. It was a defining horror of the nascent digital age. Much of it unfolded onscreen in real time. Cowering students used cellphones to report what they had seen or heard. The possible impact that violent video games and internet trawling had on adolescent minds came wrenchingly to the forefront of debate. In line with its mission of examining the past to try making sense of the present, the Retro Report series of video documentaries recalls Littleton’s nightmare on its 20th anniversary to explore what we have learned about school shootings across the years — and have yet to learn. Among the unknowns is just how severe the threat is to America’s vulnerable young and their teachers. Some analyses show an increase in Columbine-like episodes, others a decline. Researchers disagree even on methodology. Do you include gang fights in the tally of misery? How about incidents that take place near school grounds but not on them? But the knowns are self-evident, and unspeakable. From their writings, we know that Columbine became a touchstone for some of this country’s most unhinged. It inspired the armed young men who killed 32 people at Virginia Tech in 2007 and 26 first graders and their instructors at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in 2012. Less clear was its influence on the shooter who took 17 lives last year at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. Still, the madness spoke for itself. The derangement extends beyond schools to other venues once considered sanctuaries against a raging world. Concertgoers at an outdoor music festival in Las Vegas came under fire in 2017, with 58 of them killed. Houses of worship are no longer havens. Witness the 9 shooting deaths in 2015 at a black church in Charleston, S.C., the 11 deaths last year at a synagogue in Pittsburgh, the 6 at a Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Wis., in 2012, and the periodic assaults on mosques, even if none in this country have approached the carnage last month in Christchurch, New Zealand, where 50 Muslims were gunned down at prayer. For people fearful of falling victim themselves someday, the question is no longer “Why me?” but, rather, “When me?” Gun Violence Archive, which tracks the mayhem online, defines a mass shooting as one with four or more casualties. Through April 10, the archive had recorded 80 incidents in the United States this year, with at least 103 people killed and 284 wounded. Last year’s numbers were 340 mass shootings — an average of nearly one a day — with at least 373 deaths and 1,347 wounded. The Washington Post calculated earlier this month that in schools alone, in the years since Columbine, more than 223,000 children have been exposed to gun violence during classroom hours. Over the last 50 years, more Americans have been killed by guns (about 1.6 million through homicide or suicide) than in all United States wars combined (about 1.4 million). By now, mass shootings are so ingrained in the national character that they come with their own well-worn script. Political and religious leaders dutifully send “thoughts and prayers.” News organizations deconstruct the killers’ lives, investigations that invariably boil down to the painfully obvious: these people had come unglued. Television anchors debate whether the shooters should be publicly identified. And the National Rifle Association stays calculatedly quiet for a day or two, then truculently reasserts its absolutist opposition to any form of gun regulation. There was a time when federal lawmakers were sufficiently sickened by the violence to act. In 1994, Congress passed a law banning assault weapons. But that statute expired 10 years later. Since then, the government has done nothing but gladden the N.R.A.’s heart. Federal law now largely protects the firearms industry from lawsuits, though Sandy Hook families are trying to test the extent and depth of that shield. For its part, the United States Supreme Court has strengthened gun owners’ rights under the Second Amendment. And through it all, death keeps calling. Last month, two teenage Parkland survivors psychically scarred by their ordeal took their own lives, as did the father of a Sandy Hook first-grader who was killed. “He was a brokenhearted person,” said another father who lost a child in the massacre. “As we all are.” The video with this article is part of a documentary series presented by The New York Times.

2019,2019 ACM Awards: Women Make Noise Outside the Top Categories,"Country music royalty turned out in force on Sunday for a glittering night of live performances and honors at the 54th annual Academy of Country Music Awards. The show’s host, Reba McEntire — her record 16th time in the job — wasted no time in addressing one of the evening’s touchy subjects: the lack of women nominees in some top categories. Noting recent snow in Las Vegas, where the awards were held in a live, performance-heavy broadcast, McEntire said, “It was so cold it froze us women out of entertainer of the year.” Kacey Musgraves, the winner of four Grammy Awards this year, including album of the year for “Golden Hour,” was absent from the all-male list of nominees in the show’s top category. The honor went to Keith Urban, whose wife, the actress Nicole Kidman, appeared genuinely shocked at his win. But Musgraves took home the awards for both album of the year and female artist of the year. “I’m so thankful for the chance to share my political perspective,” Musgraves said in accepting the female artist of the year prize, dedicating the award to women who felt pressure to silence themselves. “This award goes out to any woman, or girl — or anybody, really — that is maybe being told that her perspective or her style is too different to work,” Musgraves said. “Just stay at it. It’ll work out.” [Watch how Kacey Musgraves turned country music psychedelic.] And women ruled the MGM Grand Garden Arena stage as Chrissy Metz, of hit NBC show “This Is Us,” made her live TV performance debut, alongside the country stars Lauren Alaina, Mickey Guyton and Maddie & Tae, for a stirring rendition of “I’m Standing With You.” Jason Aldean and Florida Georgia Line opened the show with a rousing performance of “Can’t Hide Red,” but some on social media took offense to Tyler Hubbard’s American flag suit. Dan + Shay scored three straight early wins, for song of the year and single of the year for “Tequila,” as well as duo of the year. Male artist of the year went to Thomas Rhett. The star-laden three-hour show marked an upbeat return to celebrating country music after last year’s awards assumed a somber note following the October 2017 mass shooting, also in Las Vegas, that killed 58 people at a country music festival. Aldean, who was performing at that festival when the gunfire broke out, received the ACM artist of the decade award. Other country stars performing included Blake Shelton, Luke Bryan, Chris Stapleton, Urban, Brooks & Dunn, Miranda Lambert, McEntire and George Strait.",The New York Times
2019,2019 N.F.L. Draft Analysis: How All 32 Picks Fit (or Don’t Fit),"The Arizona Cardinals took Kyler Murray No. 1 as expected, but there were several surprises in the first round of the N.F.L. draft. The Arizona Cardinals did what everyone thought they would, picking Oklahoma’s Kyler Murray, a quarterback who seemed destined to one day play for Coach Kliff Kingsbury. His selection started off a wild first day of the 2019 N.F.L. draft that involved several trades, a few shocking picks, Roger Goodell absorbing contact from a defensive tackle and the Oakland Raiders continuing to confound with their picks. In the end, both the Raiders and the Giants made three picks, and neither team made conventional choices with their haul. Instead it was the Washington Redskins who seemed to come away as unlikely winners, landing their quarterback of the future in Ohio State’s Dwayne Haskins at No. 15 and then trading back into the first round to get Mississippi State’s Montez Sweat at No. 26. Several high profile players were left out of the first round, including Missouri’s Drew Lock, who was the third-rated quarterback on many draft boards; Florida’s Jawaan Taylor, rated by many as the top offensive tackle, and Washington’s Byron Murphy, who was considered by many to be the second best cornerback available. The draft will continue on Friday with the second and third rounds and then will conclude Saturday with rounds four through seven. But first, we offer analysis of all 32 first-round selections for how they fit — and sometimes how they don’t. Oklahoma5-foot-10, 206 pounds Murray had the unenviable task of following in Baker Mayfield’s shoes at Oklahoma. Not only did he live up to Mayfield by keeping the Heisman Trophy at the school for a second straight season, but in many ways he surpassed the top pick in last year’s draft. Murray’s numbers were staggering: 42 touchdown passes (with just seven interceptions), 4,361 passing yards and 12 rushing touchdowns. His athleticism is so outrageous that he was the ninth overall pick in last year’s M.L.B. draft, with talent evaluators saying he had the potential to have a Rickey Henderson-like impact on that game. The biggest question mark about Murray, by far, is how a player of his height and weight can succeed in the modern passing game, but there is also at least some cause for concern that he only has one season under his belt as a full-time starter. How he fits: The Cardinals undoubtedly are not in love with using the top pick on a quarterback a year after using the 10th overall pick on Josh Rosen, but the pairing of Murray with Coach Kliff Kingsbury is too perfect to pass up. Kingsbury will presumably install an Air Raid-style offense, and short of Mayfield or Patrick Mahomes, there are few quarterbacks in the world more suited to it than Murray. Arizona will have to sort out what to do with Josh Rosen, but the second-year quarterback out of U.C.L.A. should have some trade value for a team hoping he can build on his modest rookie season. Ohio State6-foot-4, 266 pounds A remarkably strong player from head to toe, Bosa can generate interior power like a tackle while still possessing the skill and speed levels of an end. He comes from a football family, with his father, John, having played for Miami and his brother Joey currently starring for the Los Angeles Chargers. Nick, who had 17.5 sacks in limited action over three years, might have to compete with Joey to be the most accomplished Bosa, but to many talent evaluators he was head and shoulders above any other player in this draft class, even after he missed most of the 2018 season as a result of core muscle surgery. There was a mild hubbub about comments he made on Twitter, but the only thing that kept him from being the No. 1 pick was the perfect fit of Murray and Kingsbury. How he fits: The 49ers already had a star defensive tackle in DeForest Buckner, and they added Dee Ford to bolster their line, but they needed at least one more edge rusher and Bosa is by far the best one available in this draft. There may be some blowback in the Bay Area based on Bosa’s social media posts in the past — especially the post that called Colin Kaepernick a “clown” — but from a purely football standpoint he couldn’t be a better fit. San Francisco will now have to figure out how to add a No. 1 wide receiver. Alabama6-foot-3, 303 pounds It seems like a day will come when every team has a dominant interior lineman out of Alabama. Williams may be the latest in a long line of players who fit that general description, but that shouldn’t take away from how effective he could be from day one provided a team plays to his strengths. Williams is a natural athlete who has repeatedly shown good instincts on the field, but the only real concern with him is that he may struggle to maintain the mass necessary to deal with double-teams. He will have to prove that he can either add weight or successfully use his speed and technique to make up for what amounts to a disadvantage. How he fits: The Jets’ top need was an edge rusher, but they decided to go with an interior lineman instead. They ended up with a player who was at the top of some lists in terms of potential in this draft. Passing up on Josh Allen seems fairly surprising, as does the decision to not trade down in hopes of filling the team’s bare cupboards more quickly. The Jets must believe that Williams can put on the bulk necessary to dominate from the tackle position. Clemson6-foot-4, 264 pounds In an age of specialization, Ferrell is about as versatile as they come at defensive end. He can be effective against the run while also finding his way to the quarterback with relative ease, and there’s no reason to believe he couldn’t start right away. His ceiling is somewhat limited based on a lack of inside moves and conditioning issues that have seen him wear down as games go along, but his floor is very high. How he fits: With the first of three first-round picks, the Raiders already showed themselves to be … the Raiders. Instead of picking Josh Allen, the edge rusher they seemingly need, they reached all the way down to Ferrell, an end who was ranked in the mid-20s on many boards. He should be good quickly, but there is little reason to believe he’ll be great. The Raiders have two more picks left to fill out their team, but this pick will have people talking for days. Louisiana State 6 feet, 237 pounds Since he was a star running back in high school, White has fashioned himself into a sideline-to-sideline defender, taking full advantage of his blazing speed (4.42 seconds in the 40-yard dash) to earn the Dick Butkus Award in 2018 as college football’s best linebacker. His size is not ideal, and he is still raw enough at the position that he occasionally gets fooled by smart opponents, but the amount of growth he showed once he chose which side of the ball to focus on seems to indicate that he is eminently coachable. He can play his way onto the field immediately but will hit another level if he can increase his feel for the game while maintaining his advantage in athleticism. How he fits: Tampa Bay had targeted White all along, as he fills the team’s biggest need at inside linebacker, but the Bucs likely sweated out the last few minutes trying to decide if they should take Josh Allen instead. Passing up the top player on the board couldn’t have been easy, but a player like White who can truly run a defense made a lot of sense and gives Coach Bruce Arians an anchor on that side of the ball. Duke 6-foot-5, 221 pounds His work with David Cutcliffe has Jones pro-ready in several ways, as his throwing mechanics are already in line with what teams look for, and there is little question that he can handle the mental aspects of the position. That being said, there is at least some concern that he simply doesn’t have the arm to be something special in the N.F.L. The league is littered with success stories of players told the same thing — Joe Montana and Tom Brady both fit that mold — but figuring out if Jones is an exception like them or simply a decent player who can game-manage his way into mild success is what will make or break this pick. He’ll need to get more aggressive in making his read and releasing the ball, and less aggressive in choosing to run, but until he actually gets on the field and is tested by an N.F.L. defense, he’ll likely be a polarizing selection. How he fits: The Giants have Eli Manning’s successor, or at least they hope they do. Jones never stood out while he was at Duke, but his stock has been soaring over the last few months and he somehow leapfrogged Ohio State’s Dwayne Haskins. He doesn’t have Haskins’ arm, and he doesn’t have Kyler Murray’s secondary skills, but the Giants, who needed a graceful way to move on from the team’s two-time Super Bowl-winning quarterback, have placed an enormous bet on a player whom many had rated as the fourth-best quarterback in this draft. Kentucky6-foot-5, 262 pounds Allen shares a name with the quarterback Buffalo took with the seventh pick in last year’s draft, but he makes his living chasing quarterbacks rather than throwing passes. This Allen can outrun tackles but has the strength to eventually perfect powering through them as well. He could still use some refinement in terms of adjusting his attack when his first approach doesn’t work, but his 17 sacks and five forced fumbles in 2018 weren’t a fluke. He is not a natural fit as a coverage linebacker, and he may not contribute much outside of pass-rush, but he can add plenty of value to a team regardless. How he fits: Everyone had assumed the Jaguars would go with T.J. Hockenson based on the terrific fit with Nick Foles, but no one thought Allen would fall this far. Allen fills a distinct need for the team and was by far the top player available on nearly every draft board. Taking advantage of other teams passing on Allen makes perfect sense, but it creates an interesting dilemma as to where Hockenson will end up. Iowa 6-foot-5, 251 pounds Hockenson won the John Mackey Award as the nation’s top tight end of 2018 despite splitting time with another top prospect at his position, Noah Fant. Both players are hoping to follow in the footsteps of other successful Hawkeye tight ends like Dallas Clark and George Kittle, but Hockenson is the one most analysts agree has the most pro potential. At the combine he ran a 4.7 40-yard dash and showed off a 37.5-inch vertical leap. He has the ideal frame for a tight end. There is a lot of refinement necessary in his blocking, and he could stand to put on some overall muscle mass, but Hockenson should be ready to contribute as a receiver from day one. How he fits: That didn’t take long. Hockenson had widely been expected to go at No. 7, but waiting until No. 8 isn’t so bad. He will now spend his days controlling the middle of the field for Matthew Stafford, giving Detroit’s big-armed quarterback the big weapon in the red zone that he has been missing since Calvin Johnson retired. Houston6-foot-2, 287 pounds That many people know Oliver for his argument with Coach Major Applewhite on the sidelines of a game in November is a shame, as Oliver, who snubbed Alabama to play with his brother in Houston, showed a lot of skill in his 32 college games before a knee injury cut his junior year in half. Effectively playing tackle at his size is a rarity, so there is reason for skepticism that he can handle the rigors of the N.F.L., but if he can prove to be an Aaron Donald-like exception to the rule, the skill and intensity are definitely there. How he fits: This was a very conventional pick in a good way. The Bills needed help on the interior of their defensive line and Oliver was the best tackle on the board. He has the big personality of a star and he should develop into one if Buffalo lets him play in the way that he thrives. Is he Aaron Donald? Maybe not. But he’s in that mold. Michigan5-foot-11, 234 pounds Bush’s father — also named Devin Bush — played eight seasons in the N.F.L. as a defensive back and was a member of Coach Jim Harbaugh’s staff in Michigan, helping prepare his son for life as a professional. Some teams will snub their noses at the younger Bush for being smaller than a typical three-down linebacker, but with elite speed (4.43-second 40) and the ability to drop back into coverage with ease, he effectively adds a safety to a team’s front-seven. How he fits: This pick originally belonged to Denver, a team that could have used Dwayne Haskins at quarterback, but the Broncos shipped the pick to the Steelers instead for a package that has yet to be revealed. Pittsburgh wanted to move up for a chance to beat everyone else to Bush, a player who brings a truly rare combination of skills to the middle of the field. Alabama 6-foot-4, 302 pounds Is Williams a guard or a tackle? That’s a debate that could follow the Crimson Tide star for a while. He looked strong playing left tackle in 2018, and there is a lot about his game that is reminiscent of Joe Thomas, a player he has cited as a hero. But he’s small for the position and doesn’t have the extra-long arms that sometimes help a player overcome a lack of height. None of this is to say he won’t be successful. Once a team decides where to stick him, there’s little to indicate he won’t thrive. But the ambiguity will likely come into play as teams decide if he’s a fit for them. How he fits: The Bengals desperately need a linebacker to replace Vontaze Burfict, but tackle was also a need and Williams’s ceiling is a top left tackle and his floor is a solid guard. There were some more exciting players on the board, but Williams was a safe and smart pick for a team that needs to figure out how to keep its quarterback healthy. Michigan 6-foot-4, 277 pounds Gary is enormous, fast (4.58 40), strong (26 bench press reps) and able to jump (38-inch vertical, 120-inch broad). He’s aggressive and disruptive and he seems like he should be dominant. But after three years of Gary simply trying to plow his way through the line — a strategy that resulted in just 9.5 total sacks — it is safe to say that his technique could use some refinement. The disparity between what it seems like he should do and what he has done created a fairly enormous rift in which some evaluators considered him a top-10 player while others had him in the late teens or early 20s. How he fits: The Packers continue to avoid first-round skill players at all costs — the team hasn’t drafted one since Aaron Rodgers in 2005 — and go with Gary, a combine star who has never played as well as people have expected him to. Coach Matt LaFleur will be worried about installing a new offense, but Green Bay will have to find a way to coach Gary in a way that unlocks his enormous athletic potential. Clemson 6-foot-3, 315 pounds A quick player who rarely makes the wrong move, Wilkins is limited by his need to stick in the scheme he prefers, with another tackle taking up space to make up for Wilkins’s lack of length and overall strength. But in the right spot he can make an enormous impact, often making head’s-up plays to swat down passes — a skill you’d expect to see in a taller player with longer arms. Wilkins graduated college in just two and a half years and has the personality to be embraced by a fan base and locker room, but first he needs to prove he can play. How he fits: Dwayne Haskins is in a bowling alley currently and he likely is very confused. The Dolphins, a team that badly need a long-term solution at quarterback passed up the best thrower in this draft, choosing to go with Wilkins, a terrific interior defender who is a worthy selection in the first half of the night but doesn’t fill nearly as big of a need as Haskins would have. Boston College 6-foot-4, 308 pounds From a family of offensive linemen, Lindstrom is big enough to handle life in the pros but is far more athletic than a typical guard. One could quibble with his length, and he could stand to increase his overall strength, but he has experience as a tackle, adding some versatility, and everything at the scouting combine suggested that his tape is an accurate portrayal of a guard who will thrive any time he is asked to move into space. How he fits: Did Atlanta need a guard? Well, every team can use a great guard. There are some players who may have been a better fit for the Falcons, like Jeffery Simmons at defensive tackle or Montez Sweat as an edge rusher, but Lindstrom is the kind of pick who carries almost no downside long-term. Ohio State 6-foot-3, 231 pounds No Big Ten quarterback has been drafted in the first round since Kerry Collins in 1995, and no Ohio State quarterback has had that distinction since Art Schlichter in 1982, but Haskins didn’t play much like a Big Ten quarterback. He sat back in the pocket and picked apart defenses, leading the nation with 4,831 passing yards and 50 touchdowns in 2018. The left him third in the Heisman voting behind Oklahoma’s Kyler Murray and Alabama’s Tua Tagovailoa and set him up to be a close second behind Murray in terms of quarterback prospects in this draft. He is fairly statuesque in terms of mobility, and he only played 22 games in college, but his right arm is a cannon and he is not afraid to use it. How he fits: The Redskins may all be in a room pinching themselves right now because there is no way Haskins, the top thrower in this year’s draft, should have fallen to Washington at No. 15. Predicted by many to go off the board at No. 6, and with the arm talent to be No. 1 most years, Haskins steps into a great situation where Case Keenum will be starting but can be moved aside easily once the rookie is ready. Florida State 6-foot-5, 249 pounds At a glance, Burns may seem like an N.B.A. player who has wandered onto a football field. Tall and lanky, he gracefully glides around less athletic tackles, taking inefficient but fairly pretty paths to the quarterback. Against college linemen that translated to 23 sacks over three seasons, but some skepticism about his ability to succeed without a dramatic change in diet and approach is warranted. A team that wants a project with huge upside could likely find myriad uses for his size and speed, but a team that just wants someone who will get to the quarterback early and often would be wise to look elsewhere. How he fits: The Panthers passed up on Montez Sweat, the top edge rusher available, to draft the enormous potential of Burns. He’s a hard player to figure out, and Carolina will need to find creative ways to use him, but he’s such a physical freak that Coach Ron Rivera and his staff should have a lot of fun trying him out in myriad ways. Clemson 6-foot-4, 342 pounds Lawrence seemingly never lived up to his hype in college, but he has the ideal size for a 3-4 nose tackle. The power he occasionally showed on the field was on display at the scouting combine when he managed 36 reps on the bench press. He’s more of an athlete than you’d think based on his size and shape, and the tools are all there for him to consistently draw double-teams. But he has yet to show that he can break through and get to the quarterback himself, putting him a bit beyond players who seemingly have fewer physical gifts. How he fits: With their second pick of the night — acquired from Cleveland in the Odell Beckham Jr. trade — the Giants again reached down the draft boards a bit to pick up Lawrence, a fine player who was projected to go in the mid-to-late 20s. Considering the Giants’ needs on the edge, passing up Montez Sweat, an edge rusher with top-10 talent, would almost have to mean they were scared away by his heart issues. North Carolina State 6-foot-3, 306 pounds Bradbury’s graceful movement makes more sense when you realize he’s a former tight end. He has the overall strength to power through bigger defensive tackles but can adjust and recover far better than a typical center. Adding some weight would be ideal, but the only thing stopping him from being an instant starter would be an occasional habit of grabbing and holding that he’ll need to work on if he wants to stay on the field. How he fits: The Vikings’ biggest need was on the interior of its offensive line — Kirk Cousins can’t win games if he spends most of them on his back — and Bradbury is a terrific fit even if there were some higher-rated players available at other positions. Minnesota still has holes to fill on its offensive and defensive lines, but they got what they needed most. Mississippi State 6-foot-4, 301 pounds Is Simmons this year’s version of Reuben Foster? That’s the big question, because on talent alone, Simmons is one of the five or 10 best players in this draft class. The red flags come in two varieties. The first is that he tore his A.C.L. in February and it’s unknown when he’ll be back to full speed. The second, which is far more serious, is his 2016 arrest on assault charges in which he was accused of repeatedly hitting a woman in an incident that also involved several other people. Simmons has not had any off-field incidents since, but after the 49ers watched as Foster’s ugly past came roaring back on them, culminating in the talented linebacker’s release, teams are likely wary of how much they can trust Simmons having put his own past behind him. How he fits: Though Simmons is easily a top-five player in terms of talent, the fight he participated in back in 2016 has haunted him ever since. There are plenty of people who believe that the context of the altercation makes Simmons’s case far different than the players who have been accused of domestic violence, but a disturbing video of him repeatedly punching a woman is hard to forget. He has not tried to hide from the incident and he has worked to make up for it, but considering the recent backslides from players like Reuben Foster and Tyreek Hill, it is not surprising that some teams chose to look elsewhere. From a football standpoint, Simmons is a good selection, but at this point teams truly need to consider more than just football. Iowa 6-foot-4, 249 pounds How unusual is it for a school to have two tight ends drafted in the first round? Consider that only one tight end — from any school — was drafted in the first round last year. No tight ends were selected in the first round in 2011, 2012, 2015 or 2016. With that, it shouldn’t be a surprise that Fant and his teammate, T.J. Hockenson, who went to the Detroit Lions with the eighth overall pick, made N.F.L. history as the first pair of tight ends from one school to end up first-rounders in the same year. Fant may not be quite the complete package as Hockenson, but he should be a matchup nightmare. Bigger than a wide receiver, Fant competed in the triple-jump and high jump in high school and he put on a show at the scouting combine, with a 4.5 second 40 and a 39.5 inch vertical leap. There is a question of overall toughness, as he has not shown much ability as a blocking tight end and he has yet to leverage his physical advantages into winning battles for contested balls, but a creative offensive coordinator could likely find plenty of use for him. How he fits: This pick was part of the deal that allowed Pittsburgh to move up to No. 10 to select Devin Bush. The Broncos get a monster of an athlete. Fant doesn’t have the all-around game of T.J. Hockenson, but he will be a red zone nightmare for defenses and he has the speed to succeed in the open field as well. Maryland 5-foot-11, 198 pounds A running back in high school, Savage can absolutely fly with a 4.36-second 40 time. He’s on the small side — 5 foot 11 was actually taller than many had anticipated — but he has shown strong coverage skills and can handle himself like a larger player, at least in limited bursts. Being an every-down safety seems like a stretch, but he could be a solid contributor if his team picks the right spots to deploy him. How he fits: In a trade with Seattle, the Packers moved up to grab Savage, one of the best safeties in this draft but one who was expected by many to be a second-round pick. He needs to work on his tackling — a lot — but he is certainly more accomplished than Green Bay’s other first-round pick, Rashan Gary. Washington State 6-foot-5, 315 pounds The adjustment to the N.F.L. may take a bit of time, but the tools are all there for Dillard to be a blind side anchor for years to come. He started four years at Washington State, and even if he may not have displayed the nasty streak that teams often prefer in linemen, he consistently showed an ability to handle any type of blocking situation. How he fits: To move up to No. 22, Philadelphia gave Baltimore the No. 25 pick as well as picks in the fourth and sixth rounds. The Eagles considered it worth it in order to get ahead of the competition for Dillard, who seemingly trails Jawaan Taylor in terms of N.F.L. readiness. That the Eagles weren’t making a move to shore up the team’s secondary was fairly shocking. Alabama State6-foot-5, 322 pounds Howard was a late bloomer and gained nearly 90 pounds while in college, but as he worked to refine his technique he quickly moved up draft boards. He played quarterback in high school and is a terrific athlete for a player his size, with his only glaring needs being more work in the weight room and more time refining his technique. How he fits: With Andre Dillard off the board, the Texans had to go to a second option and they chose Howard, a player who didn’t get nearly as much hype as Florida’s Jawaan Taylor but is thought by some to have more potential once he gets fully up to speed. Alabama 5-foot-10, 220 pounds It was a long wait, but a running back is finally off the board. It would be easy to look at Jacobs’s modest college statistics and wonder what makes him a first-rounder, but he has the ideal body for the rigors of the N.F.L. and has shown glimpses of being able to fight for yardage inside, get around the corner on outside runs, and catch the ball like a wide receiver. If he can prove himself in pass protection, that would translate to the skills of an every-down back. Roster fit could be an issue, as he would ideally be paired with a runner capable of breaking off the occasional extra-long gain to balance out Jacobs’s steady progress. How he fits: After making an enormous reach with their first of three picks, Oakland made only a mild one to select Jacobs, by far the best running back in this draft. The retirement of Marshawn Lynch helped increase the team’s need at the position, and Jacobs could slide in well as a centerpiece in Coach Jon Gruden’s offense. There is some concern that the Raiders had bigger needs elsewhere, but if they were determined to pick a running back they picked the right one. Oklahoma5-foot-9, 166 pounds A foot injury may have cost Brown a chance at a historic run at the scouting combine. “I was going to aim for the record, for sure,” he told reporters. Topping John Ross’s record of 4.22 seconds in the 40-yard dash, set in 2017, would have been exciting, but there’s really no lack of enthusiasm when it comes to Brown who averaged 18.3 yards a catch in his two seasons with the Sooners and scored 17 touchdowns. His size is certainly not ideal — in fairness to Brown, he has put on nearly 40 pounds since he left high school as a 130-pounder — but DeSean Jackson, who weighs 175 pounds, has shown that a receiver can be fairly durable even at a smaller size. How he fits: With the back end of a trade with Philadelphia, the Ravens get Hollywood Brown, a cousin of Antonio Brown who is an absolute burner — or at least he will be once his injured foot heals. The first pick of the Eric DeCosta era is certainly exciting, but temper expectations: Lamar Jackson is still learning to throw the ball. Just ask John Brown, a burner of a wide receiver who disappeared when Jackson took over last season. Mississippi State6-foot-6, 260 pounds Originally a tight end recruit, Sweat switched to defense, struggled to make things work at Michigan State, and then exploded once he found a new home with the Bulldogs. Using his outrageous speed — he ran a 4.41 second 40-yard dash at the combine — he recorded 22.5 sacks over the last two seasons. Even before reports came out that he had a heart issue there was a belief that he could struggle to find the instant success of some other early first-round picks. Now teams are also sorting out a complicated medical condition. If a team is comfortable with his medical report, it seems as if all he needs to dominate in the N.F.L. is a small increase in muscle and more experience. How he fits: The Redskins traded up with the Colts to get this pick, and after adding their quarterback of the future in Dwayne Haskins, they took by far the best player on the board in Sweat. On talent alone Sweat was a top-10 or top-12 pick, and the Redskins, in trading up for him, indicated that they have cleared him medically. He’s one of the fastest defensive linemen in recent history and he fills a distinct need in Washington. Mississippi State 5-foot-11, 205 pounds It was between Abram, Maryland’s Darnell Savage and Virginia’s Juan Thornhill as to which safety would be drafted first. While Thornhill is a converted corner who excels in coverage, and Savage can do a little of everything, Abram is a beast in the box who uses his compact frame as a devastating weapon in the middle of the field. He can help a team against the run, and isn’t a total liability in coverage, but a team looking for a defensive back who can truly shut down the passing game will want to look elsewhere. How he fits: The Raiders may have to worry if Abram is simply a box safety, but even if he is limited to that role he can add a lot to the defense by scaring teams away from the middle of the field. He seemed like a second-day player, but the Raiders decided to go with him rather than one of the cornerbacks who would fill a more obvious need. Notre Dame6-foot-6, 295 pounds Tillery’s inconsistency and some questions about his conduct on the field had him pegged as a second-day pick on most draft boards. When he builds up a head of steam he can be terrifying, but he’ll need show consistent effort and figure out how to be more creative when a play doesn’t go well. How he fits: The Chargers apparently decided the potential for Tillery to boom made his relatively high chance of busting acceptable. He certainly has the physical traits necessary to excel, and he steps into a team with several quality defenders to show him the path to success. If he can be coached there is a chance that this pick will end up looking very prescient. Texas Christian 6-foot-2, 283 pounds He doesn’t have the burst or high-end speed of an edge rusher, but Collier can be a solid contributor as a relentless end who wears blockers down through consistent effort and superior strength as a game progresses. That only translated to 14.5 sacks over 33 games in college, but part of that was a matter of playing time. Barring a dramatic shift, he is more of a rotation player than an end worth getting excited about. How he fits: Seattle will be picking back-to-back thanks to trades with Kansas City and Green Bay. With the first of the two, they took Collier, a player it’s hard to get too excited about. The Seahawks have developed enough quality defenders in recent years that they should be given the benefit of the doubt, but at the very least it should be a while before Collier will contribute much. Georgia 5-foot-11, 193 pounds Baker benefits some from being the best of a fairly weak class of cornerbacks. The skill is there to handle the N.F.L., but a lack of speed and questions about his size make him the type of player who may have been a second-day pick if there were any options who hit the typical benchmarks. That being said, he hasn’t allowed a touchdown in either of the last two seasons, collecting five interceptions along the way, so assuming he can’t handle the N.F.L. is premature. How he fits: The Giants had made some risky moves with their first two picks of the first round, but trading up with Seattle to select the best cornerback in this year’s draft is an easy pick to like. Washington6-foot-7, 315 pounds McGary is enormous, but his arms are fairly short and he may not be physical enough to stay at tackle in the N.F.L. If he has to move to guard his ceiling is far lower, but he can help in the running game at either position. How he fits: The Falcons traded up with the Los Angeles Rams; following their selection of Chris Lindstrom at No. 14, they went with another offensive lineman, though this one comes with far more question marks. If he can handle being a tackle then this is a great value at No. 31, but that’s a fairly big if. Arizona State 6-foot-2, 228 pounds Harry’s raw numbers were down a little in 2018, but he increased his yards-per-catch to 14.9 and scored nine touchdowns. The Saint Vincent native won’t blow by any cornerbacks, but he can outfight most of them for a contested ball. Unlike many rookie receivers, he has already shown an ability to contribute as a run-blocker, which will help get him on the field even as he adjusts to playing against more talented defensive backs. How he fits: The Patriots had the chance to draft an heir apparent for Tom Brady in Drew Lock, but instead they gave Brady a terrific weapon in Harry. He does all the little things that will ingratiate him with Coach Bill Belichick, and even if his ceiling is a bit lower than Ole Miss’s D.K. Metcalf, Harry is a classic Patriots pick as someone who can compete from day one and will otherwise stay out of the way. An earlier version of this article described incorrectly the career of Devin White. He was a running back in high school, not college.",The New York Times
2019,2020 Democratic Candidates Target Barr Over Mueller Report,"CRESTON, Iowa — Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York had just finished a speech at a coffee shop in southwest Iowa on Thursday, one that focused on rural issues like expanding broadband and developing the local economy. But the first question from her audience, posed by a man named Matt Brummett, focused on what he saw as a more urgent matter: “Should Democrats impeach Attorney General William Barr?” Ms. Gillibrand said it was unclear if Congress had that power (though the Constitution grants it). But she took the opportunity to criticize Mr. Barr’s handling of the special counsel’s report. “He’s behaving as the president’s personal lawyer,” Ms. Gillibrand said. “He’s not behaving as the attorney general of the United States.” With that, Ms. Gillibrand joined several other Democratic presidential candidates who assailed Mr. Barr for the way he handled the release of the Mueller report, arguing that his framing of its findings amounted to a partisan attempt to protect President Trump. [Keep track of the latest politics news with our newsletter.] As the day proceeded, candidates such as Senators Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris and Ms. Gillibrand took turns criticizing Mr. Barr, first for holding a news conference about the report before anyone could review it and then for the amount of the report that was redacted when it was released. Ms. Warren accused Mr. Barr of acting like a “publicist for the president of the United States” and called his media briefing “a disgrace.” Ms. Harris added that the briefing had been “filled with political spin and propaganda” that “should concern us all.” By late Thursday, other candidates like Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Julián Castro appeared to have reviewed the more than 400-page report by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. They said they found the information in it more alarming than exonerating. Many, including Senator Bernie Sanders, directed their ire toward Mr. Trump, blaming the president for obstructing the investigation and vowing to continue gathering information about his actions. In issuing their analysis of the report, however, the Democratic candidates largely avoided discussing its substance in detail and did not point out specific passages they found most concerning. Mr. Buttigieg, for instance, spoke about it in broad strokes, saying: “The Mueller report is a disturbing if not completely surprising collection of evidence that shows a president putting his own interests ahead of the country’s.” “It is clear that Donald Trump wanted nothing more than to shut down the Mueller investigation,” Mr. Sanders said. “While we have more detail from today’s report than before, Congress must continue its investigation into Trump’s conduct and any foreign attempts to influence our election.” The appraisal of Mr. Barr’s performance, the report’s contents and Mr. Trump’s role in the ordeal came as lawmakers and the public at large were still digesting the redacted version of the report by Mr. Mueller, who investigated Russian interference in the 2016 election, any ties between the Russian effort and the Trump campaign and possible obstruction of justice by Mr. Trump. That version of the report was published online around 11 a.m. Thursday, about 90 minutes after Mr. Barr offered a strong defense of Mr. Trump at his news conference. [Read excerpts and analysis of the report.] Asked about the results of the inquiry during a town-hall meeting in Nashua, N.H., former Representative Beto O’Rourke said he would defer to his former colleagues in the House on impeachment but drew applause when he said Mr. Trump’s fate would be “decided in November of 2020 and will inform the choice that we make.” Speaking to reporters later, Mr. O’Rourke noted that he had only been asked about impeachment a handful of times since entering the presidential race, pointing out that voters are far more focused on policy matters. “I don’t know that impeachment and those proceedings in the House and potential trial in the Senate is going to answer those questions for people,” he said. Senator Amy Klobuchar echoed many of the other Democrats competing for the chance to run against Mr. Trump in 2020 when she said that the public wanted to hear from Mr. Mueller directly. In a video on Twitter, she called on him to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee; she is a member of the committee, as is Ms. Harris and Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, who are among the 18 Democrats running for president. “Today’s delivery of the redacted special counsel’s report underscores the need for Congress to receive the unredacted report and to hear from Robert Mueller himself about his findings,” she later said in a statement. “The attorney general has shown his bias again and again.” At the news conference, Mr. Barr said he had given Mr. Trump’s lawyers access to Mr. Mueller’s report “earlier this week,” before it was to be sent to Congress and made public. Ms. Gillibrand said on Twitter that she was “deeply disturbed” by that move. But of the 18 Democrats currently in the field, only Representative Eric Swalwell of California called on Mr. Barr to resign. “You can be the president’s defense attorney or America’s attorney general,” Mr. Swalwell said in a statement, “but you can’t be both.”",The New York Times

2019,2020 Democrats Seek Voters in an Unusual Spot: Fox News,"There is an unlikely new hot spot for Democratic candidates: Fox News. President Trump’s favorite network is increasingly playing host to hopefuls from the Democratic presidential field, eager for exposure to the vast Fox News audience — even as they risk a backlash from others in the party who view the network as an ideological menace. The expedition into what many liberals consider enemy territory picked up this week after Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont appeared at a town hall on the network, drawing the biggest television audience of any 2020 Democratic candidate so far — more than 2.5 million people — while pitching himself to Trump-leaning viewers who may be willing to cross party lines next year. On Wednesday, Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota said she had agreed to a Fox News town hall-style event next month. Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., is in advanced talks with the network. Julián Castro, the former housing secretary, is close to signing on, and Senators Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Cory Booker of New Jersey say they are open to the idea. The debate over whether to appear on Fox News reflects in some ways a larger divide in the party as it ponders how to retake the White House: Should Democrats focus on expanding and mobilizing the various coalitions that make up their base, or seek inroads with the millions of Americans who supported Mr. Trump in 2016? For Mr. Buttigieg’s ascendant campaign, the answer, in a saturated media age, was easy. “We are going to talk to voters everywhere and we are going to meet them where they are,” said Lis Smith, who oversees media strategy for Mr. Buttigieg, who in March became the first 2020 Democratic candidate to sit for an interview with Chris Wallace on “Fox News Sunday.” “The outdated approach of taking a calculated and risk-averse approach to the media needs to be put in the past.” “Voters are going to reward fearlessness,” Ms. Smith added, “even if that comes with a mistake here or there.” [Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter.] Fox News town halls are moderated by news anchors like Bret Baier, not the network’s hard-right commentators. But the fealty that pundits like Sean Hannity show to Mr. Trump have many establishment Democrats apprehensive. Last month, the Democratic National Committee took the unusual step of barring Fox News from sponsoring any of its presidential primary debates, saying its “inappropriate relationship” with the administration made it unfit to stage a fair event. Critics say that Democrats who go on the network lend credibility to a platform that many liberal voters view as xenophobic, toxic and an incorrigible mouthpiece for the president. “I understand the short-term incentives for Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg to appear on Fox News, but putting an imprimatur of legitimacy on one of the most destructive forces in American politics has long-term consequences,” Dan Pfeiffer, a former senior adviser to President Barack Obama and a host of the liberal podcast “Pod Save America,” wrote on Twitter on Tuesday. (Ms. Smith fired back, noting on Twitter that Mr. Obama had sat for interviews with the former Fox News star Bill O’Reilly.) Even Mr. Trump seemed mystified to see Mr. Sanders, one of his sharpest critics, granted Fox News airtime to call the president a “pathological liar,” among other epithets. “So weird to watch Crazy Bernie on @FoxNews,” Mr. Trump tweeted on Tuesday, as a loyal viewer displeased by an unexpected story arc. “What’s with @FoxNews?” the president wrote. Mr. Trump has been complaining about Fox News for many months. But the campaign’s strategy is to depict Democrats as too extreme for the country, and it fears that candidates will seem more presentable if Fox News introduces them in a friendly way. Mr. Trump and some of his advisers are also irked that Fox News is showcasing not just Mr. Sanders, but a moderate like Ms. Klobuchar of Minnesota, a Midwest state where the Trump campaign is looking to make headway, according to people familiar with their thinking. [Check out the Democratic field with our candidate tracker.] Mr. Sanders received generally positive reviews for his appearance on Fox News, but other Democrats remain wary. Senator Kamala Harris of California, in an interview on “Pod Save America” on Wednesday, said she would “think about” appearing on Fox News, although she declined to commit. “I’m not excluding anyone in terms of trying to earn their vote and compete for their vote,” she said. “There’s a whole other conversation to be had about how Fox News does their work and the bias with which they do it.” Mr. Castro’s campaign, in its talks with the network, had questions about who the audience would be and whether the event would be conducted in a nonpartisan manner, according to Jennifer Fiore, a senior adviser. But it was satisfied with the responses it received, including that the audience would be made up of independents and Democrats. The appearance has not been scheduled, but the two sides appear close to setting a date. Mr. Castro “has always campaigned for every vote, Democrat and Republican,” Ms. Fiore said, noting that he had served as a mayor in a red state. Some Democratic strategists pointed out that an appearance on Fox News grants access to the top-rated cable news channel — the network routinely beats its rivals CNN and MSNBC in overall ratings — along with the favorable optics of wading into the lion’s den, essentially signaling to voters that a candidate is unafraid to engage with a challenging moderator and a potentially skeptical audience. Others note that in last year’s midterm elections, Democrats were able to wrest four Midwestern governorships from Republicans, including three in states Mr. Trump captured in 2016 — showing the value of trying to win back voters in that region who might be disenchanted with the president. “It’s just a smart place to be,” said Tad Devine, Mr. Sanders’s longtime strategist, who is not working for his campaign this year. “In politics, the downsides are inevitable. You have to weigh them against the upsides. And the upside is you get to talk to millions of people.” And maybe rally the faithful, too. After Mr. Sanders’s appearance Monday, he blasted out a fund-raising appeal about it to his supporters, embedding a Fox News clip in which audience members cheered his “Medicare for all” plans. “Last night Bernie showed why he is the best candidate to beat Trump,” the email declared. Other Democrats argue that the Fox News audience is unnecessary, pointing to the excitement surrounding candidates like former Representative Beto O’Rourke, whose unapologetically liberal run for the Senate in Texas last year galvanized voters and donors, pushing him to within three points of victory. Then there is a broader concern that the symbiosis between Fox News stars and the Trump administration means the network will not treat Democrats fairly. On Monday, hours before Mr. Sanders went on the network, the chairman of the D.N.C. told a Fox News interviewer that he had no plans to reconsider his decision to bar the network from sponsoring an official party debate. “I don’t have faith in your leadership at Fox News at the senior levels,” the chairman, Tom Perez, told the anchor Bill Hemmer. Mr. Hemmer, who works on the reporting side of the network, pushed back, comparing Fox News’s opinion programming to that of a newspaper’s editorial page. “We’ll give you a fair shake,” he said. That argument has been echoed by Fox News executives, who say that the Democrats’ debate decision was shortsighted and that the network’s reporters serve as neutral journalists. Mr. Wallace won praise in 2016 for his moderating of the third presidential debate. Fox News declined to comment for this article. Lesser-known candidates like Andrew Yang, a former tech executive, and Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii have made appearances in shorter segments on the network. But Mr. Sanders is currently a front-runner in the Democratic race, and his extended appearance Monday represented a bigger leap. The audience on Monday was significantly larger than the 1.95 million who watched Ms. Harris on CNN in January, the previous benchmark for televised town halls. Mr. Sanders attracted more viewers between the ages of 25 and 54, the key demographic in cable news, than the same night’s broadcast of Rachel Maddow, who is MSNBC’s top-rated star. Still, some candidates remain on the fence. And others seem ready to dodge the subject completely. Asked on Tuesday if she would participate in a Fox News town hall, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts told a reporter to speak to her communications director. “She’s the one figuring out where we’re going to go and who we’re talking to,” Ms. Warren said. Contacted on Wednesday, the communications director, Kristen Orthman, declined to comment.",The New York Times
2019,"2020, Sri Lanka, Sun-Maid Raisins: Your Weekend Briefing","Here are the week’s top stories, and a look ahead. 1. Election interference topped the news in Washington this week, and will next week. The F.B.I. director, Christopher Wray, said the bureau was shoring up its counterintelligence operations in advance of next year’s elections, calling the 2018 midterms “a dress rehearsal for the big show in 2020.” There were also more revelations from the Mueller report. Our reporters dug into how Russia’s efforts to connect with President Trump and his team spun into high gear after the election, and Mr. Trump’s fixation on targeting Hillary Clinton. Above, Mr. Trump at the White House on Friday. Attorney General William Barr is scheduled to testify before the Senate about the report on Wednesday, the same day the Department of Justice is to deliver the full, unredacted report to members of Congress. Have you been keeping up with the headlines? Test your knowledge with our news quiz. And here’s the front page of our Sunday paper, the Sunday Review from Opinion and our crossword puzzles. ____ 2. Investigators from half a dozen countries are searching for clues about how an obscure Islamist group could have executed the Easter attacks in Sri Lanka, which killed 250 people. Ribbons and flags were hung in Colombo, above, to honor the victims. Failures in preventing and investigating the attacks are exposing rifts in Sri Lanka’s government. On Saturday, four people detonated explosives inside a house linked to the bombings as the authorities closed in. The government said they found 15 people dead. Perhaps the most striking details to emerge so far are how the paths of two powerful families of billionaires ended up on opposite ends of the attacks. In an instant, five of their children were dead. ____ 3. Four years ago, President Barack Obama gently discouraged Joe Biden from running for president. But Mr. Biden is back, and presenting himself as Mr. Obama’s natural heir. “The question now,” our chief White House correspondent writes, “is whether he can parlay his service for the last Democratic president into his own successful quest.” After months of anticipation, Mr. Biden kicked off his campaign for 2020 this week under a cloud from the past. The former vice president drew criticism for refusing to directly apologize to Anita Hill for his handling of the Clarence Thomas hearings in 1990. Mr. Biden, 76, heads to Pittsburgh on Monday for his first official campaign event. ____ 4. The neighborhood is mostly black. The buyers are mostly white. The change is jolting the economics of the land beneath everyone. In cities across the United States, white homeowners are arriving in places they’ve long avoided. Since 2000, according to a Times analysis of demographic and housing data, the arrival of white residents is affecting about one in six predominantly African-American census tracts. The pattern is playing out across the country, as in Raleigh, N.C., above. Predominantly minority neighborhoods near downtowns are growing whiter, while suburban neighborhoods that were once largely white are experiencing an increased share of black, Hispanic and Asian-American residents. ____ 5. The National Rifle Association is facing a deep internal leadership crisis. Oliver North, above, announced he would not serve a second term as the N.R.A.’s president following a power struggle with Wayne LaPierre, the group’s chief executive. The confrontation pits Mr. LaPierre, the foremost voice of the American gun rights movement, against Mr. North, the central figure in the Reagan-era Iran-contra affair who remains a hero to many on the right. Behind it is a legal battle between the N.R.A. and its advertising agency, and now an investigation by the New York attorney general into the group’s tax-exempt status. ____ 6. Guantánamo Bay is preparing for a new phase at the detention center: Hip and knee replacements, wheelchair ramps and hospice care. Above, an older detainee inside a communal cellblock. With no sign that the prison will close, the Pentagon has begun planning for detainees to grow old and die at the facility. Commanders were told last year to draw up plans to keep the detention center going through 2043. But questions linger — how much medical care should the prisoners receive, how should it be delivered and how much will Congress provide to pay for it. “Am I going to need dialysis down here? I don’t know. Someone’s got to tell me that,” said the commander of the detention center. “Are we going to do complex cancer care down here? I don’t know. Someone’s got to tell me that.” ____ 7. Officials are trying to curb the potential spread of measles after an outbreak was declared in Los Angeles County. More than 700 students and staff members at two universities — the University of California, Los Angeles, above, and California State University, Los Angeles — have been quarantined. The move comes as the number of measles cases in the United States reached 695 this week, the highest number recorded since the disease was declared eliminated in this country in 2000. At the center of the vaccination debate is a question about religious objection. But the leaders of major faiths vigorously endorse vaccination. ____ 8. This is a story about raisins you never saw coming. When Sun-Maid brought in Harry Overly as a new chief executive to revamp the century-old company, he was taken aback by the level of animosity he encountered. He wanted to change the United States raisin industry for the better, and got more than he bargained for. We went to California’s Central Valley, home of the American raisin industry, and found a tale of intimidation, death threats, conflagration, farmland and a so-called raisin mafia. ____ 9. And now a different kind of food for thought. On Friday, The Times Food section won the James Beard Award for best publication of the year. Here’s what some of our staff writers and editors are cooking this weekend: Sam Sifton, our food editor, is getting back to his grill, and offers this guide for people who doubt themselves in the presence of fire. We also have recipes for how to get eggplant right from the Israeli-born British chef, restaurateur and cookbook writer Yotam Ottolenghi, above. And one of our writers made the case for Marsala wine. If you’re planning ahead for the week, here are five weeknight dishes to get you into the groove. ____ 10. Finally, it’s time to dig into one of our Weekend Reads. This week we have a stories about an amputee’s 140-mile run through the Sahara, above; a group of black playwrights who are challenging American theater; and our review of “Avengers: Endgame,” the finale in the Marvel saga.

2019,"24 Charged in $1.2 Billion Medicare Scheme, U.S. Says","Federal officials said Tuesday that they had dismantled a $1.2 billion Medicare scheme that spanned continents and ensnared hundreds of thousands of unsuspecting elderly and disabled patients. Under the scheme, which the authorities described as one of the largest health care frauds in United States history, doctors prescribed back, shoulder, wrist and knee braces that were not needed, prosecutors said. Twenty-four people were charged, according to the Justice Department. “These defendants — who range from corporate executives to medical professionals — allegedly participated in an expansive and sophisticated fraud to exploit telemedicine technology meant for patients otherwise unable to access health care,” Brian Benczkowski, the assistant attorney general for the department’s criminal division, said in a statement. Some of the accused were owners of durable medical equipment companies that paid kickbacks and bribes to doctors to write prescriptions for braces that were medically unnecessary, according to the authorities. An international telemarketing network with call centers in the Philippines and Latin America would reach out to Medicare beneficiaries, persuading them to get the free or low-cost braces. The doctors would sometimes write prescriptions without speaking to the patient. “The defendants took advantage of unwitting patients who were simply trying to get relief from their health concerns,” Craig Carpenito, the United States attorney for New Jersey, said in a statement. “Instead, the defendants preyed upon their weakened state and pushed millions of dollars’ worth of unnecessary medical devices, which Medicare paid for, and then set up an elaborate system for laundering their ill-gotten proceeds.” The defendants laundered the proceeds through international shell companies and used the money to buy exotic cars, yachts and luxury real estate around the world, the authorities said. Prosecutors brought charges related to the payment of bribes, illegal kickbacks, money laundering and conspiracy to commit health care fraud against people in California, Florida, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, South Carolina and Texas. The individuals charged included the chief executives or employees of five telemedicine companies, the owners of dozens of durable medical equipment companies and three licensed medical professionals, the Justice Department said. In Florida, Willie McNeal IV, the owner and chief executive of two telemedicine companies, hired health care providers and then paid them to prescribe braces for Medicare beneficiaries regardless of whether it was medically necessary, according to an indictment. Mr. McNeal would then receive illegal kickbacks in exchange for ordering those braces, the indictment said. Mr. McNeal, 42, facilitated the submission of fraudulent Medicare claims worth nearly $250 million, the government said. If convicted, the government demanded that Mr. McNeal forfeit the profits obtained from the illegal kickbacks and any property that was purchased with those proceeds, including 10 properties in Florida. John Lauro, a lawyer representing Mr. McNeal, said in a phone interview on Tuesday that he could not comment on the specifics of the allegations but that he was disappointed by the Justice Department’s decision to arrest Mr. McNeal with “no advance warning” or opportunity to explain himself. “They simply arrested without asking any questions or giving the client the opportunity to talk about the telemedicine business model,” Mr. Lauro said. In a case out of South Carolina, more than a dozen companies owned by Andrew Chmiel, 43, billed Medicare for more than $200 million as part of a scheme to sell medically unnecessary equipment, according to an indictment. The indictment listed three properties, six cars and nearly two dozen bank accounts as subject to forfeiture if Mr. Chmiel is convicted. Mr. Chmiel’s lawyer said he was reviewing the indictment, but did not immediately comment on the charges. The alleged scheme was investigated by the F.B.I. and the Department of Health and Human Services inspector general, and is being prosecuted by the Justice Department. The I.R.S. and 17 United States attorney’s offices also took part in the crackdown.",The New York Times
2019,27 More Graves May Have Been Found at a Notorious Florida Boys School,"More than two dozen additional unmarked graves may have been discovered on the grounds of a defunct boys reform school in the Florida Panhandle that was notorious for beatings, abuse, forced labor and neglect, according to a letter sent by the state’s governor this week. The discovery at the former Arthur G. Dozier School for Boys came during pollution cleanup at the site last month when a subcontractor found 27 “anomalies” in the ground consistent with possible graves, according to the letter from Gov. Ron DeSantis to the chairman of the board of commissioners in Jackson County, where the school grounds are. The latest development adds to the grim accounting of the school, where anthropologists have already found 55 graves and unearthed the remains of 51 people from the 1,400-acre campus, which sits amid thick pine forests in the town of Marianna. In records, the cause of death for the boys was often listed as “unknown” or “accident”, though it is known that a fire in 1914 killed eight boys who had been locked in a room. Others died in flu epidemics. Some runaways were shot. Mr. DeSantis has asked state officials to work with Jackson County on how to address the new findings, and more testing is needed to determine whether the anomalies are, indeed, unmarked graves. The county plans to develop an industrial center at the site as well as a training center for people with autism. Almost from the moment the school opened as the Florida State Reform School in 1900, there was a steady stream of reports of abuse, indentured servitude, crowding and neglect. So many children — among them runaways and so-called incorrigibles — were sent to the institution that it became the largest in the country. Despite continued allegations of mistreatment and harsh conditions, the school remained open until 2011, when the state shuttered it. Advocacy efforts by a group of men known as the White House Boys helped to reveal the horrors that took place at the school. A team of anthropologists from the University of South Florida used radar technology to search beneath the ground and discover dozens of unmarked graves. The anthropology team has focused largely on Boot Hill, which during the segregation era was a documented cemetery on the African-American side of campus. The latest findings only add to the catharsis for people like Jerry Cooper, who was at the school from 1960-61 and is president of the White House Boys, whose name is a nod to the small cinder-block building where they say they were viciously flogged for the slightest infraction. “Does it surprise me about what they located?” Mr. Cooper, 74, asked. “No. I’ve always said this is not all the bodies. I experienced that place. I know what went on there. It’s a lot worse than the people know.” He once received 135 lashes at 2 a.m., he said, and almost died from the beating. There are untold numbers of stories like that. Mr. Cooper said he was at a ceremony at the Dozier campus earlier this year, and now the thought of what lay in the soil beneath his feet makes him shudder. “One hundred yards away or so, there’s 27 more anomalies,” he said. “That hits hard.”",The New York Times
2019,3 Black Churches Have Burned in 10 Days in a Single Louisiana Parish,"ATLANTA — Three historically black churches have burned in less than two weeks in one south Louisiana parish, where officials said they had found “suspicious elements” in each case. The officials have not ruled out the possibility of arson, or the possibility that the fires are related. “There is clearly something happening in this community,” State Fire Marshal H. Browning said in a statement on Thursday. “That is why it is imperative that the citizens of this community be part of our effort to figure out what it is.” The three fires occurred on March 26, April 2 and April 4 in St. Landry Parish, north of Lafayette. A fourth fire, a small blaze that officials said was “intentionally set,” was reported on Sunday at a predominantly white church in Caddo Parish, about a three-hour drive north. “But just as we haven’t connected the three in St. Landry, we haven’t connected the one in Caddo,” said Ashley Rodrigue, a spokeswoman for the Louisiana Office of State Fire Marshal, on Friday. [Read: ‘They Didn’t Burn Down Our Spirit’: Louisiana Black Churches Defiant Amid Fires] Local officials said that they were still investigating the fires, and did not say if they knew of any suspects, a motive, or whether racism was an element. “There certainly is a commonality, and whether that leads to a person or persons or groups, we just don’t know,” Mr. Browning said at a news conference on Thursday. The F.B.I. and federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are involved in the investigation, said Jeff Nowakowski, a spokesman for the A.T.F.’s New Orleans field division. The Rev. Gerald Toussaint, pastor at Mount Pleasant Baptist Church in Opelousas, La., was driving to work on Thursday morning at around 4:45 a.m. when his wife called him to say she had seen on social media that their church was ablaze. Mr. Toussaint was aware of the two other fires that had been set at nearby houses of worship, St. Mary Baptist Church in Port Barre, and Greater Union Baptist Church in Opelousas. He rushed to the scene. The church, which was founded in the 19th century, had undergone extensive remodeling two years ago. Now it is nearly gone, he said, except for a brick wall and corridor in the front. “I’m trying to find out who did it, why they did it, did it have anything to do with me,” said Mr. Toussaint, who drives trucks for a living. “I don’t know none of this.” He also said he did not want to speculate, for fear of angering potential arsonists, or prompting copycat crimes. St. Landry Parish is a rural area studded with crawfish ponds and bayous in the heart of Cajun and Creole country. It is 56 percent white and 41 percent black. Mr. Toussaint said that relations were generally good between black and white residents. Since the 1950s, black churches across the South have been the targets of numerous racist attacks, from arson to bombing to armed assault. In 2015, a white supremacist shot and killed nine people at a Bible study at an African-American church in Charleston, S.C. In 2006, a string of arsons at Alabama churches, some predominantly white, some predominantly black, proved to be the work of three college students that officials characterized as a “joke” that had spun out of control. Last month, a black member of a predominantly black congregation, Hopewell Missionary Baptist Church in Greenville, Miss., pleaded guilty to burning his church. The church was spray-painted with the words “Vote Trump” in an effort to make the attack seem politically motivated, a Mississippi official said. At the news conference Thursday, Sheriff Bobby Guidroz of St. Landry Parish said that law enforcement officials would do “whatever it takes” to protect churches and churchgoers. “We’re doing everything we can, collectively, to solve this crime,” he said. An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the congregation of a church in Caddo Parish that suffered a fire. It is a predominantly white church, not a predominantly black one.",The New York Times

2019,3 Mountain Climbers Presumed Dead After Avalanche in Canada,"OTTAWA — Three professional mountain climbers were missing and presumed dead on Thursday after an avalanche in Banff National Park in the western province of Alberta. The three were identified as Jess Roskelley, an accomplished American mountaineer, and David Lama and Hansjörg Auer, both Austrian, by the North Face clothing company, their sponsor. When the men failed to return from their climb as scheduled on Wednesday, Parks Canada, the government agency responsible for the park, said that it immediately sent aircraft to search for them. The aerial survey found, the agency said, “signs of multiple avalanches and debris containing climbing equipment” in the area where the three had been climbing. “They are missing and local search and rescue has assumed the worst,” the North Face said in an email. “We are waiting to learn additional information as the search mission continues.” Mr. Roskelley is the son of John Roskelley, a well-known mountaineer and author. In 2003, when the younger Roskelley was 20, father and son climbed Mount Everest. The son was believed to be the youngest American to have done so at that time. A biography of Mr. Lama on the North Face website says that he is the son of a Nepali mountain guide and an Austrian nurse. He began climbing at the age of 5 and was widely recognized for his skill when he was a teenager. Mr. Auer, who was born in 1984, was a mathematics and sports teacher at a secondary school until 2009 when he became a professional climber. In 2016, he received the Paul Preuss Prize, an award for outstanding mountaineers who climb without the help of ropes or other aids. The parks service said that recovery efforts had been postponed because of “additional avalanches and dangerous conditions at the scene.” Precipitation and high winds, it added, were increasing avalanche risk. The three men were climbing the east face of Howse Peak, according to the parks service, which is 10,810 feet tall. Stephen Holeczi, a visitor safety specialist for Parks Canada, said at a news conference in Lake Louise, Alberta, that the site was very remote and a “highly technical, alpine route. It’s not a regular route.” Mr. Holeczi said that because the peak was outside the park’s regular avalanche monitoring zone, weather conditions at the time are unknown. He added, however, that the warming sun of April generally increases the risk of avalanche. Brandon Pullan, the editor in chief of Gripped, a Canadian climbing magazine, who lives on the edge of the park in Canmore, Alberta, said the three climbers appeared in the area about two weeks ago. The route they were attempting, known as M16, has only been climbed successfully once, 20 years ago, he said.",The New York Times
2019,3-Year-Old Found Alone at Border Is One of Many ‘Heartbreaking’ Migrant Cases,"[Read the latest edition of Crossing the Border, a limited-run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet. Sign up here to receive the next issue in your inbox.] MCALLEN, Tex. — The 3-year-old boy was alone, and crying. Early on Tuesday morning, Border Patrol agents at the Fort Brown station in South Texas found the boy in a cornfield. He had his name and a phone number written on his shoes. Agents said the boy was abandoned by smugglers, who fled back toward Mexico when the Border Patrol approached. The lone child crossing the border was not an anomaly — more than 8,900 unaccompanied children were apprehended by the Border Patrol in March, nearly twice the number seen in October. Many were teenagers, but for years, children younger than 12 have been among those making the journey across America’s southern border without their parents or other relatives, often traveling with groups of strangers. Theirs is a harrowing, complex and dislocating saga, as children as young as 3, 4 or 5 are passed from migrant group to migrant group for days, often eventually abandoned in the deserts of Arizona or in the brush of South Texas. Like the boy found near Brownsville, Tex., this week, the children generally have phone numbers of relatives in the United States written on their clothes or on slips of paper they carry in their pockets. “These cases can be heartbreaking, because of how small the children are and because they are often very confused and scared by the entire ordeal,” said Lindsay Toczylowski, executive director of Immigrant Defenders Law Center in Los Angeles, which provides legal services to unaccompanied children. How children end up on their own in the chaotic environment of the southwest border often follows a familiar pattern. Parents flee poverty and violence in countries like Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador. They leave one or more of their children behind with relatives. Later, after settling in the United States, the parents send for the children they left behind, and those children make the journey with a relative or with strangers. After crossing the border, the children are often abandoned by smugglers and other migrants who believe the children will be rescued by the Border Patrol. It is a tremendous gamble: Agents have, over the years, saved children’s lives in these situations. One evening in June at the Arizona border, Border Patrol agents discovered a 6-year-old boy on a border road at a time when the temperature was more than 100 degrees. The abandoned boy was from Costa Rica, and told the agents that his uncle had dropped him off and had told him that the Border Patrol would pick him up. The boy said he was on his way to see his mother in the United States. In July, agents in the Border Patrol’s Rio Grande Valley sector came upon an 8-year-old boy, alone, by a river road. Agents were only able to learn his name and his age as they took him in for processing — he spoke only a regional dialect they did not understand. The number of unaccompanied children crossing the southwest border in the fiscal year that began Oct. 1, 2018, is on track to reach the peak achieved in the 2014 fiscal year, when more than 68,500 migrant children were intercepted. In the first half of the current fiscal year, agents apprehended 35,898 unaccompanied children, compared with 50,036 during the entire 2018 fiscal year. “I’ve been in the Border Patrol going on 24 years,” said John R. Morris, the acting deputy chief patrol agent in the Border Patrol’s Rio Grande Valley sector, which includes the Fort Brown station. “In my early days, a child would never be abandoned.” Now, the phenomenon is “on the increase” as children are left to the care of smugglers who see them as “cargo,” he said. “We just recently had a 2-year-old girl who was literally left at the riverbank with her name and a phone number written on a T-shirt — a 2-year-old girl.” Those who work along the border say the unaccompanied children traveling without parents or relatives are sometimes even as young as infants. In recent weeks, several infants were being held at the Border Patrol’s Centralized Processing Center in McAllen, Tex. — all of them had crossed the border without their families, were apprehended as part of larger migrant groups and were expected to join relatives already living in the United States. “We’ve seen that plenty of times,” said Jorge Gonzalez, the patrol agent in charge of the Border Patrol’s Brownsville Station and a 19-year veteran of the agency. “It’s a child that doesn’t belong to really, truly, anybody within the group, and they’re to get turned over to their parents that have already made their way into the United States.” In one case, a 2-year-old girl was found with a group of migrants in November just north of the border near Campo, Calif. She was not related to anyone in the group, and was strapped to the chest of a 17-year-old boy in a makeshift cloth baby carrier. The girl had been traveling with her mother, but the mother became tired and asked if one of the other migrants could carry her daughter. The 17-year-old boy agreed. But the group of migrants later separated, and the boy was unable to locate the girl’s mother. When he crossed into the United States with the girl still strapped to his chest, he had still not located the mother, according to the Border Patrol. After he and the girl were apprehended, the girl was placed in custody as officials worked on reuniting her with her mother. In the case of the 3-year-old boy found on Tuesday in the cornfield, federal officials were working on reuniting the boy with his family. Pictures released on Twitter by the Border Patrol’s parent agency, Customs and Border Protection, show the boy sitting at a desk in a Border Patrol office, watching “Paw Patrol” on an official’s computer. The boy is from Mexico, but he does not speak well enough to communicate. After the agents discovered him in the cornfield, he was transported to a hospital, found to be in good condition and released back to the Border Patrol. At the Fort Brown station, the agents’ attempts to contact the child’s family were unsuccessful. One agent bought the boy some clothing before he was transferred to the Border Patrol’s main processing center in McAllen. He remained there on Wednesday, being cared for by contracted child-care workers assigned to the center, officials said. Theoretically, the boy, because laws pertaining to Mexicans allow for swifter deportations, could be quickly sent home. However, since he is very young and was found alone, this is unlikely to happen: American authorities cannot easily ascertain whether the child has a fear of returning to his home country or was a victim of trafficking. Children who arrive in the country alone pose a number of challenges to federal officials and to the agencies and contractors responsible for caring for them while they are detained. When children are too young to talk, basic communication is difficult. Many of these children can act out or withdraw, out of confusion and frustration with their situation. “We have run into kids who are so young they can’t express what they want,” said Anthony Enriquez, director of the unaccompanied minors program at Catholic Charities Community Services in New York, which represents more than 700 unaccompanied minors who are in the process of being deported. “When you get into situations when you have a child who isn’t verbal yet and doesn’t have the capacity to comprehend the situation and make an informed decision, we have an ethical dilemma.” Many of the families who send for their children appear not to understand, or they ignore, the dangers of the treacherous journey they are forcing the children to take, said some of those who work with migrant families. Boys and girls alike are at risk of being sexually exploited and abused by smugglers, of becoming seriously ill, or of dying from heat, cold or dehydration in the harsh, vast terrain on the southwest border. It is unknown how many cases of very young children traveling alone end in tragedy. In 2014, a 12-year-old girl left Ecuador to reunite with her parents in the Bronx. She never made it. The girl — Noemi Álvarez Quillay — was sexually assaulted by smugglers at the border in Ciudad Juárez, Mexico. Days later, on March 11, 2014, still in Mexico, Noemi committed suicide by hanging herself from a shower curtain rod. A joint investigation that included United States law enforcement agencies led to the indictment in Mexico of more than 40 people involved in smuggling and assaulting Noemi and other women and children. Mr. Gonzalez, the lead agent at the Brownsville station, recalled an incident about a year ago, when he worked at another South Texas station in rural Starr County. Agents discovered a boy who was 3 or 4 years old. He had a phone number for his aunt that he carried on a piece of paper. “He was by one of the river landings, and he was actually caught with a group of aliens, but nobody said, ‘I brought him,’” Mr. Gonzalez said, adding, “Truthfully, there’s only one way he crossed, and that was with that group. But at that point, nobody wanted to take any kind of ownership of that situation.” The agents contacted the boy’s aunt, and then the aunt put the boy’s mother in touch with the authorities. Both women were living in the United States. “I think desperation is definitely part of it,” Mr. Gonzalez said. “I guess the situations that they currently reside in kind of dictate the manner in which they’ll try anything to get their family home again. I think that’s just the human condition. Everybody wants to be with their family, and they’re willing to do whatever it takes to do that.”",The New York Times

Later, after settling in the United States, the parents send for the children they left behind, and those children make the journey with a relative or with strangers. After crossing the border, the children are often abandoned by smugglers and other migrants who believe the children will be rescued by the Border Patrol. It is a tremendous gamble: Agents have, over the years, saved children’s lives in these situations. One evening in June at the Arizona border, Border Patrol agents discovered a 6-year-old boy on a border road at a time when the temperature was more than 100 degrees. The abandoned boy was from Costa Rica, and told the agents that his uncle had dropped him off and had told him that the Border Patrol would pick him up. The boy said he was on his way to see his mother in the United States. In July, agents in the Border Patrol’s Rio Grande Valley sector came upon an 8-year-old boy, alone, by a river road. Agents were only able to learn his name and his age as they took him in for processing — he spoke only a regional dialect they did not understand. The number of unaccompanied children crossing the southwest border in the fiscal year that began Oct. 1, 2018, is on track to reach the peak achieved in the 2014 fiscal year, when more than 68,500 migrant children were intercepted. In the first half of the current fiscal year, agents apprehended 35,898 unaccompanied children, compared with 50,036 during the entire 2018 fiscal year. “I’ve been in the Border Patrol going on 24 years,” said John R. Morris, the acting deputy chief patrol agent in the Border Patrol’s Rio Grande Valley sector, which includes the Fort Brown station. “In my early days, a child would never be abandoned.” Now, the phenomenon is “on the increase” as children are left to the care of smugglers who see them as “cargo,” he said. “We just recently had a 2-year-old girl who was literally left at the riverbank with her name and a phone number written on a T-shirt — a 2-year-old girl.” Those who work along the border say the unaccompanied children traveling without parents or relatives are sometimes even as young as infants. In recent weeks, several infants were being held at the Border Patrol’s Centralized Processing Center in McAllen, Tex. — all of them had crossed the border without their families, were apprehended as part of larger migrant groups and were expected to join relatives already living in the United States. “We’ve seen that plenty of times,” said Jorge Gonzalez, the patrol agent in charge of the Border Patrol’s Brownsville Station and a 19-year veteran of the agency. “It’s a child that doesn’t belong to really, truly, anybody within the group, and they’re to get turned over to their parents that have already made their way into the United States.” In one case, a 2-year-old girl was found with a group of migrants in November just north of the border near Campo, Calif. She was not related to anyone in the group, and was strapped to the chest of a 17-year-old boy in a makeshift cloth baby carrier. The girl had been traveling with her mother, but the mother became tired and asked if one of the other migrants could carry her daughter. The 17-year-old boy agreed. But the group of migrants later separated, and the boy was unable to locate the girl’s mother. When he crossed into the United States with the girl still strapped to his chest, he had still not located the mother, according to the Border Patrol. After he and the girl were apprehended, the girl was placed in custody as officials worked on reuniting her with her mother. In the case of the 3-year-old boy found on Tuesday in the cornfield, federal officials were working on reuniting the boy with his family. Pictures released on Twitter by the Border Patrol’s parent agency, Customs and Border Protection, show the boy sitting at a desk in a Border Patrol office, watching “Paw Patrol” on an official’s computer. The boy is from Mexico, but he does not speak well enough to communicate. After the agents discovered him in the cornfield, he was transported to a hospital, found to be in good condition and released back to the Border Patrol. At the Fort Brown station, the agents’ attempts to contact the child’s family were unsuccessful. One agent bought the boy some clothing before he was transferred to the Border Patrol’s main processing center in McAllen. He remained there on Wednesday, being cared for by contracted child-care workers assigned to the center, officials said. Theoretically, the boy, because laws pertaining to Mexicans allow for swifter deportations, could be quickly sent home. However, since he is very young and was found alone, this is unlikely to happen: American authorities cannot easily ascertain whether the child has a fear of returning to his home country or was a victim of trafficking. Children who arrive in the country alone pose a number of challenges to federal officials and to the agencies and contractors responsible for caring for them while they are detained. When children are too young to talk, basic communication is difficult. Many of these children can act out or withdraw, out of confusion and frustration with their situation. “We have run into kids who are so young they can’t express what they want,” said Anthony Enriquez, director of the unaccompanied minors program at Catholic Charities Community Services in New York, which represents more than 700 unaccompanied minors who are in the process of being deported. “When you get into situations when you have a child who isn’t verbal yet and doesn’t have the capacity to comprehend the situation and make an informed decision, we have an ethical dilemma.” Many of the families who send for their children appear not to understand, or they ignore, the dangers of the treacherous journey they are forcing the children to take, said some of those who work with migrant families. Boys and girls alike are at risk of being sexually exploited and abused by smugglers, of becoming seriously ill, or of dying from heat, cold or dehydration in the harsh, vast terrain on the southwest border. It is unknown how many cases of very young children traveling alone end in tragedy. In 2014, a 12-year-old girl left Ecuador to reunite with her parents in the Bronx. She never made it. The girl — Noemi Álvarez Quillay — was sexually assaulted by smugglers at the border in Ciudad Juárez, Mexico. Days later, on March 11, 2014, still in Mexico, Noemi committed suicide by hanging herself from a shower curtain rod. A joint investigation that included United States law enforcement agencies led to the indictment in Mexico of more than 40 people involved in smuggling and assaulting Noemi and other women and children. Mr. Gonzalez, the lead agent at the Brownsville station, recalled an incident about a year ago, when he worked at another South Texas station in rural Starr County. Agents discovered a boy who was 3 or 4 years old. He had a phone number for his aunt that he carried on a piece of paper. “He was by one of the river landings, and he was actually caught with a group of aliens, but nobody said, ‘I brought him,’” Mr. Gonzalez said, adding, “Truthfully, there’s only one way he crossed, and that was with that group. But at that point, nobody wanted to take any kind of ownership of that situation.” The agents contacted the boy’s aunt, and then the aunt put the boy’s mother in touch with the authorities. Both women were living in the United States. “I think desperation is definitely part of it,” Mr. Gonzalez said. “I guess the situations that they currently reside in kind of dictate the manner in which they’ll try anything to get their family home again. I think that’s just the human condition. Everybody wants to be with their family, and they’re willing to do whatever it takes to do that.”",The New York Times
2019,30 Die Fighting Forest Fire in China,"BEIJING — A forest fire in southwestern China turned deadly over the weekend when winds shifted unexpectedly, trapping firefighters and local officials in a maelstrom. The bodies of 30 people who could not escape were found on Monday, officials announced, even as the fire continued to burn out of control. Among those who died were the chief of a regional forestry bureau in Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture in Sichuan Province, and his deputy, state media reported. The officials had traveled to the scene of the fire, which broke out on Saturday in a remote location at altitudes nearing 13,000 feet, and had not been heard from since. “A huge fireball was formed in an instant,” the Ministry of Emergency Management said in a statement announcing the deaths. The death toll appeared to be the largest for firefighters in China since a devastating blaze at a chemical plant in Tianjin killed more than 100 in 2015. Although forest fires are common in China in the spring, the government had issued fire warnings in recent days in Sichuan and several other regions experiencing high temperatures and drought. The Chinese Meteorological Observatory warned that dry weather, strong winds and high temperatures would persist, and it urged people to exercise particular caution during the annual holiday of Qingming, known as Tomb Sweeping Day, which falls this coming Friday. Millions travel to their ancestral homes during the holiday. The warning cited heightened risks in the mountains north of Beijing, near parts of the Great Wall; in Shanxi Province in central China; and in Sichuan and neighboring Yunnan Province in the southwest. “The forest fire risk level in some areas is extremely high,” The Paper, a digital news organization, said, citing the observatory. The fire in Sichuan appeared to be the worst of several that broke out in the country in recent days. It was not the biggest — one in Shanxi appeared to have consumed a larger area — but it became the deadliest. Nearly 700 firefighters from the Liangshan branch of the Sichuan Forest Fire Brigade have been fighting the blaze. On Sunday afternoon, the wind abruptly shifted the fire, catching dozens by surprise. Of those reported killed, 27 were firefighters and three were local officials, according to reports in state media, which were limited and contradictory at times. There were no immediate reports about the cause of the fire, nor its size. The tragedy could focus new attention on the training and equipment of China’s firefighters. The main service was transferred in 2018 from the People’s Armed Police to the Ministry of Emergency Management. Some firefighters viewed the reorganization as representing a potential loss of prestige and benefits. A staff member of the Sichuan Provincial Fire Corps Combat Command Center, reached by telephone, said that firefighting teams organized by the local government usually recruited villagers. Another official said that local villagers were familiar with the terrain and conditions and received adequate training. “The advancement of technology in recent years should have provided them with better safety guarantees than before,” the official China Daily wrote on Monday evening, referring to the latest fire and the deadly blaze in 2015. “But the two fires in Tianjin and Sichuan have exposed that there is still a long way for China to go to modernize its firefighting system.” OpinionKim Mahood",The New York Times
2019,"36 Hours in Kobe, Japan","There’s more to this sunny port city than beef. Jazz, for one thing; an urban waterfall, for another. In 1868, after more than two centuries of isolationism, the opening of the port of Kobe brought a wave of international influences to this sunny city on the main Japanese island of Honshu. These days visitors will find Western-style mansions built by foreign diplomats, music influenced by the United States, and dim sum in the city's Chinatown district. But the main attractions remain rooted in the region. Kobe is the western neighbor of more well-trafficked tourist destinations — Kyoto is less than a half-hour away on the Shinkansen bullet train; Osaka is just 15 minutes. Although the city is best known for its beef, those who linger in this welcoming, walkable metropolis will also discover a singular music scene, memorable museums, eclectic shopping, little-known regional specialties and an easygoing atmosphere tinged with the foreign flavors that continue to flow through the city’s glittering harbor. Don’t let the name of the Takenaka Carpentry Tools Museum fool you — even those who can’t tell a Phillips Head from a Torx will be riveted by the exhibits presented inside this beautiful museum, just steps from Shin-Kobe station. A superb iPod audio guide (free) narrates the history, traditions, artistry and craftsmanship of Japanese architecture and woodworking, so allow a couple of hours to explore everything from the ceremonial duties of a master carpenter and the joint beams of centuries-old temples to the harmonious beauty of intricate kumiko zaiku wood latticework. Admission, 500 Japanese yen, or about $4.50. Exit Shin-Kobe station and you’ll face an urban milieu, but right behind the station, nature takes over. Curl north around the station, which abuts forested foothills, and follow the steep, shady path into the woods where, after about a half-mile, you’ll reach Nunobiki Falls, a series of majestic cascading waterfalls well worth the sweaty ascent. Brush up on your Japanese before sidling up to the counter at Rakuzake, a cheerful standing bar that opened last April in a downtown shopping arcade. This local hangout, with blonde-wood counters and colorful flower arrangements, serves small plates to be paired with drinks, namely nihonshu (sake). Order a glass and several dishes — thick slices of salmon and tuna sashimi, maybe some chilled tofu, plus a plate of piping-hot fried octopus. On the second round, don’t miss the standout karaage (fried chicken), served with fresh cabbage and a dollop of Kewpie mayo. Dinner for two, about 3,000 yen. Thanks to foreign influences, Kobe has long had an ear for jazz — local lore claims that the first Japanese jazz band was formed here in 1923. The city hosts an annual jazz festival and nightly live shows are staged in hushed clubs around town, including the atmospheric Sone. For a taste of the music scene without the hefty admission fee, descend a flight of stairs to Jam Jam. A coffee shop by day and a jazz cafe by night, this welcoming music den has a vast vinyl library of new wave and classic jazz from around the world, plus a great selection of Japanese whiskies, and separate seating for conversation (near the bar) and for listening (facing the speakers). The local community initiative Eat Local Kobe wants residents to do precisely that at its seasonal Saturday morning farmers market in Higashi Yuenchi Park. In warmer months, vendors sell organic local fruits and vegetables, herbs, honey, eggs, tofu, juices and more. Year-round, find similar products at the market’s brick-and-mortar sibling, Farmstand, which opened last year. Shelves were recently stocked with edible treats — plump strawberries, Tanishita Farm’s tomatoes, Camembert from North Kobe’s Laitiere Yuge — while an adjacent cafe served healthy snacks, vegetable smoothies, seasonal specials and delicious soft-serve cones. If there’s time to visit only one art museum in Kobe, skip the Tadao Ando-designed Hyogo Prefectural Museum of Art in favor of its quirkier cousin: the Yokoo Tadanori Museum of Contemporary Art. Opened in 2012, this museum showcases the wide-ranging works of Yokoo Tadanori, a graphic designer-turned-painter and Hyogo Prefecture native. In addition to psychedelic Warholian silk-screens from the 1960s, for which Tadanori is best known, the galleries also exhibit his more recent paintings, including a current series of works painted in public spaces (through May 6). Admission, 700 yen. Gyoza are typically served with a thin soy-and-vinegar sauce, sometimes spiked with chili oil, but in Kobe, the preferred dipping condiment for these sizzling pan-fried dumplings is an umami-rich miso sauce. Stop for a snack at Hyotan, a gyoza specialist since the 1950s with eight seats along a cramped counter (look for the red curtain-like noren). Once you’ve shoehorned yourself onto a stool, ordering is easy: The only thing on the menu is gyoza, seven per order (390 yen). In addition to pots of miso sauce, there are also bottles of garlic oil, vinegar, soy sauce and chili oil on the counter for a mix-your-own condiment adventure. Underneath the train tracks between Motomachi and Kobe stations stretches a peculiar shopping arcade where you can unearth great vintage vinyl and the missing controller to your childhood Nintendo. Stroll through Motoko Town, as the aging arcade is called, to poke around bric-a-brac shops filled floor-to-ceiling with 20th-century computers, for example, or kitschy belt buckles, or, somewhat disturbingly, military uniforms from the United States and Germany. You’ll also pass excellent vintage shops and record stores, small art galleries, a working silversmith and a local designer’s screen-print T-shirt stall. Near Kobe Station, the arcade devolves into a ghost town, with only the occasional open stall peddling 20th-century, Showa-era toys and boxes of old remote controls; better to start at Motomachi and walk southwest. Kobe beef is what many come here for, and you can find it served a variety of ways throughout the city, at street food stalls and specialty restaurants like Ishidaya. But if you prefer lighter fare, head to Hanare, an intimate eight-seat hideaway specializing in sumibiyaki, or cooking over charcoal. Start with sake and sashimi; in lieu of an English menu, the chef will pull out the day’s fish for you to choose. For adventurous diners, this is the place to try torisashi, chicken sashimi. Add to that a few skewers of yakitori — momo (thigh), hatsu (heart), kawa (skin) — and the house specialty: a beautifully arranged garden of charcoal-roasted vegetables. Dinner for two, about 9,000 yen. After dinner, sample local craft beers at In Tha Door Brewing, one of the few brew pubs in the city. The industrial concrete-and-plywood space serves beers brewed on-site, like the hazy Shiroinon White Ale (seating charge, 300 yen). Or walk to Minato Hutte, a small guesthouse nearby with a street-level bar stocked with Japanese spirits. The order here is a gin and tonic mixed with Ki No Bi, a citrusy gin with hints of yuzu and cypress from the new small-scale Kyoto Distillery. Before calling it a night, swing by Taco Stand Anga, a screwball shack selling tacos, drinks and dagashi — penny-candy-like snacks — amid colorfully eclectic décor. Glide high above the treetops aboard the Shin-Kobe Ropeway, a gondola that whisks passengers up a steep mountain slope to an observation deck with expansive views of the urban sprawl (1,500 yen round-trip). After admiring the panorama, which on clear days extends to the Seto Inland Sea, you can head deeper into the forest on a mountain hike or wander leisurely downhill through the Nunobiki Herb Gardens, where seasonal flora ranges from tulips and nasturtium in spring to summer sunflowers and lilies to the fiery leaves of autumn. On a quiet lane behind Ikuta Shrine, stop at Beyond Coffee Roasters, an excellent micro-roastery in a tiny house with a new stand-alone coffee shop across the street. Opened last year, the cute little shop, with a herringbone-wood counter and paint-smeared walls, is standing room only, so if it’s busy, take an espresso with tonic water to go. Otherwise, wait patiently for a pour-over, which might be prepared by Bunn, the mustachioed roaster whose signature handlebar inspired the shop’s logo. On January 17, 1995 at 5:46 a.m., Kobe and the surrounding area were devastated by a massive earthquake that left more than 6,000 dead and nearly a quarter of a million homes destroyed. To understand the trauma overcome by this city, visit the Great Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake Memorial, a moving museum dedicated to preserving the memories of this disaster, and educating the public on how to prepare for and act if faced with a future natural threat. Despite the potentially frightening subject matter, this engaging, educational museum is routinely packed with local schoolchildren. However, those with vertigo or acute natural-disaster anxiety may prefer to skip the introductory exhibit: a powerful earthquake re-enactment involving shaking video and booming surround sound. Admission, 600 yen. Steps from Motomachi station, the Candeo Hotels Kobe Tor Road opened last year with 159 minimalist guest rooms, a sauna and public bath, lovely mountain views from the lobby and a breakfast buffet offering Western and Japanese options (3-8-8 Sannomiya-cho, Chuo-ku; candeohotels.com/kobe-torroad; from about 10,000 yen). Overlooking the harbor, the Hotel Okura Kobe is the city’s landmark property, situated in a waterfront skyscraper with an elegant lobby, welcoming staff, several restaurants, and 475 spacious guest rooms, many with nighttime views across the twinkling port (2-1 Hatoba-cho, Chuo-ku; kobe.hotelokura.co.jp/en; from about 10,500 yen). The central Sannomiya district is a good choice for apartment rentals, which often include the use of a Pocket Wi-Fi, or portable hot spot. Rates for a one-bedroom start around $110 on Airbnb.

2019,36 Hours in Marseille,"The French port city is shedding much of its once-gritty reputation and emerging as a place where ambitious cultural and culinary offerings take center stage. No city divides the French like Marseille. For every admirer cooing about the sun-warmed sea, craggy coastlines, fish-rich bouillabaisse and the Mediterranean melting pot (thanks to 20th-century immigration from Greece, Spain, Italy, Corsica, Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria), someone else is grousing about corruption, dirty streets and eroding Frenchness. And where the port city’s champions see a swaggering no-nonsense metropolis free of bourgeois pretensions, others see a lack of refinement. Everyone agrees, however, that Marseille is a city in metamorphosis. Major urban-renewal projects have upgraded the waterfront into a sprawl of state-of-the-art cultural venues, shopping centers and skyscrapers from five-star architects. At the same time, ambitious seasonal cooking, artisanal cocktails and indie-fashion concept stores — once nearly unheard-of — are making noticeable inroads, infusing the city with something it had mostly lacked: cool and cachet. Perhaps inevitably, some now lament that Marseille is losing its distinctive working-class character and southern French soul. And, predictably, some now gush that the city has never been more modern, ambitious or happening. Built between the 14th and 17th centuries, Fort St. Jean has been restored and reconfigured as a public space and is an essential part of your Marseille initiation. Its battlements, towers and rooftop gardens provide commanding views of the expansive blue waters and the sprawling cityscape, from the postmodern Villa Méditerranée next door to the city’s 19th-century, neo-Byzantine churches: Notre Dame de la Garde basilica and Cathédrale Sainte Marie Majeure. Admission 9.50 euros, or about $10.50. The sea gave birth to Marseille, carrying the Greek and Roman settlers who laid the earliest stones of ancient Massilia. Marseille has repaid the favor with MuCEM, a waterfront museum complex devoted to the Mediterranean and its civilizations. A high footbridge connects Fort St. Jean to MuCEM’s dramatic cube-shaped museum, known as J-4. Panoramic vistas come courtesy of a rooftop lounge and glass exterior catwalks on each facade, while two ground floor exhibitions provide panoramas of Mediterranean history. Alas, some might find “Ruralités,” dedicated to the agricultural history of the basin, as dull as dirt. Fortunately, “Connectivités” impresses with its colorful evocation of Renaissance-era maritime powers — including Istanbul, Venice, Seville and Lisbon — through Ottoman ceramics, Italian silks and more. The bookshop concludes your local education with French-language guidebooks, maps, literary works and historical studies like “Marseille Ou La Mauvaise Réputation.” Many of Marseille’s immigrant waves washed up in the Panier district, a village-like maze of narrow cobbled streets, tiny squares and weather-beaten houses in sherbet colors. Rue de Lorette serves up two classic flavors of Mediterranean Marseille. Start your two-stage ethno-bloat with one of the two thin, crispy pizza options — anchovy or cheese (15 euros) — at Chez Etienne, a lively tile and timber restaurant founded by Sicilians in 1943. The former is all zesty red sauce and fresh fish; the latter is agreeably gloppy and gooey. Crossing the street, you arrive in Morocco at Ahwash, a stylish living room-like restaurant and boutique. For your main course, you can plunge into roasted lamb, chicken tajine with preserved lemons (16 euros) or an excellent tajine of stringy-soft beef, long-stewed peppers and caramelized onions (16 euros). Take home Moroccan glassware, ceramics or candles. [What are your recommendations for a weekend in Marseille? Tell us in the comments section.] Formerly a hospital, the grandiose 18th-century building holding the Intercontinental Marseille — Hotel Dieu now offers sedation in the form of wines, beers, spirits (notably gin) and cocktails, courtesy of Le Capian bar. A soaring space outfitted with plush couches and carpets, the establishment pours out numerous Provençal products, including Doucillon beer (10 euros) and Le Daviel cocktails (pastis, lychee liqueur, spice syrup and Champagne; 21 euros). If those don’t stupefy you, the view of the illuminated harbor almost certainly will. When your shopping list includes a concrete rendering of Yoda’s head and socks embossed with erotic cartoons, visit Chez Laurette. After working in Paris for Marc Jacobs, the namesake owner returned home to southern France and opened a concept store where every item — from beers to bath products — is made in France. Fashion reigns, with rugged leather boots by La Botte Gardiane, shimmery retro-1960s dresses by Mood-eh and other Gallic garments. Nearby, Le Diable Méridien will accessorize you in French leather, from watches by Les Partisanes to satchels from Bleu de Chauffe, while Jogging boutique-cafe runs the couture route occupied by cult designers like Simon Jacquemus (preppy fashion) and Marine Serre (rock ’n’ roll chic dresses and accessories). Run by a tattooed young staff and playfully overdecorated with nautical-kitsch décor, La Boite à Sardine at first seems a silly take on the traditional seafood shack. But the daily-changing menu will please purists: All is fresh, and the cooking is mostly straightforward with occasional embellishments. A winter afternoon visit found oysters, sea urchin, calamari and sole on the menu, along with cold crunchy-pink shrimp (meant to be torn apart with your hands and dunked in aioli mayonnaise) and slabs of thick bonito, pan-fried in a charred bread crumb crust. A glass of fruit-forward Coteaux d’Aix-en-Provence white wine is a worthy accompaniment. A two-course lunch for two costs about 50 euros. Don’t insult Friche La Belle de Mai by calling it an “art museum.” Sprawling across the vast grounds of a 19th-century tobacco works, the hodgepodge of historical and contemporary buildings might best be described as a multispace, polypurpose cafe-restaurant-bar-bookshop-skatepark-playground-graffiti gallery-concert hall-nursery school and sometime yoga workshop that also happens to host multiple rotating contemporary art exhibitions. In other words, this onetime cigarette factory is still lit up, day and night. Museum admission: 5 euros. The trademark innovations are all there: rows of vertical pilotis that lift the concrete apartment building off the ground; horizontal bands of windows; panels of bright primary colors to enliven the gray exterior. Massive and modernist, the so-called Cité Radieuse could only come from the forward-looking mind of Le Corbusier — although, admittedly, the pioneering Swiss architect was looking forward in the 1940s and ’50s, when Brutalism was still futuristic. Named a Unesco World Heritage Site in 2016, the building contains several areas open to the public, including the rooftop MAMO art gallery (summer only) a new bookshop (a trove of architecture tomes, posters and even paints) and the 21-room Hotel Le Corbusier. The outdoor terrace of the hotel’s restaurant, Le Ventre de l’Architecte, is a prime spot to sip a Pietra beer from Corsica (4 euros) while watching the Mediterranean sunset. Someone must rename Sépia. The moniker evokes a colorless and static scene, frozen in the past. This new lively restaurant is none of those things. The chef, Paul Langlère, a veteran of some Alain Ducasse gastronomic temples, has elevated a disused snack bar into one of Marseille’s hottest tables. Situated on a leafy hillside, the simple industrial-cool dining room and outdoor tables offer views of the twinkling city while serving up an ever-changing chalkboard menu of fresh ingredients in freestyle preparations. A February visit included a house-smoked slab of local mackerel that burst with citric crunch and radiant hues (courtesy of beetroot spaghetti, diced apple and horseradish yogurt) followed by a filet mignon as thick as a Dickens novel that was topped with charred seaweed for a crisp, smoky-briny mouthful. Three courses are 39 euros. As night falls in Marseille, three friends approach the darkened storefront of a cheesy souvenir shop, fumble with the door handle and vanish inside. Minutes later, more do the same. On and on couples and small crowds arrive, giddy to be creeping into a closed shop. What the devil? This is Carry Nation, a bar so secret that one must register online to obtain the address, door code and entry instructions. Within awaits a Roaring Twenties universe of vintage furniture and bartenders in suspenders who mix cocktails like Un Automne en France (whiskey, crème de peche, Racine de Suze bitters, yellow wine and verjus; 13 euros). For drinks without the rigmarole, nearby Gaspard is a tiny wood-lined bar whose specialties include La Sieste de Shiva (whiskey, chai spice and pineapple; 12 euros), a sweet-sour concoction. A strange, barren and (almost) uninhabited world hides 30 minutes from Marseille’s Vieux Port: the Frioul Archipelago. Blasted by eons of wind and waves, the four small islands have eroded into rocky, chalk-white lumps of cliffs, ravines, coves and outcroppings where perhaps 100 intrepid locals make their home. The Frioul If Express ferries you to If Island — where you can explore the abandoned 16th-century prison immortalized in the novel “The Count of Monte Cristo” — and then onward to Ratonneau Island. From the harbor, gravel paths extend along the coast and into the interior, leading to the ruins of a 19th-century hospital and various fortresses. Amid squealing gulls and crashing surf, the journeys provide nonstop sublime vistas, most notably of Marseille itself, spreading down the hills and stretching along the cliffs of the Mediterranean coast. Ferry ticket: 10.80 euros round-trip. Marseille’s sprawling harbor, Le Vieux Port, is the picturesque heart of the city. Nearby studios without a view cost around $50 to $60 a night on www.airbnb.com. Apartments with views tend to be larger and fancier, with prices starting around $120 a night. With its lifestyle boutique, restaurant, vast garden and frequent Friday night parties, Hotel Maison Montgrand (35 rue Montgrand; 33-4-91-00-35-20) is a Marseille tastemaker. The 49 rooms are done in minimalist style with smooth woods and muted tones. Doubles from 75 euros to 165 euros depending on the season and demand. Marseille’s most discreet hotel might be Le Couvent (6 rue Fonderie Vieille; 33-6-12-31-48-79). Occupying an unmarked 17th-century stone building, the sprawling mansion-like space has no restaurant, spa or other amenities — just 10 stylish contemporary apartments outfitted with vintage pieces, art and books. Studios from 130 euros. Follow NY Times Travel on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook.

2019,36 Hours in Mendocino County,"Tall trees, mushroom ice cream, a Buddhist brunch: the possibilities are endless in this rural slice of Northern California. Ninety miles north of San Francisco, Mendocino County is just far enough away to have narrowly escaped the Bay Area’s radical transformation during the tech boom years. In contrast to other formerly quiet Northern California backwaters, Mendocino maintains its rural identity and eccentricities, including its longstanding status as one of the country’s major marijuana-producing regions. Where there is big news, it’s largely culinary. The 30-year-old chef at Elk’s Harbor House Inn was recently named a James Beard award semifinalist for Best Chef in the West. Besides the Harbor House’s eight- to 12-course, $150 per person prix fixe dinners, there are cheesemakers, upstart breweries, exceptional farm stands — notably Fort Bragg’s Nye Ranch and Caspar’s Fortunate Farm — and farm-inspired restaurants, like the long-awaited, soon-to-open Fog Eater Cafe, which began as a farm pop-up, and will serve “California cuisine with a Southern twang.” After years of population stagnation, young people are moving in, or coming home, and committing themselves to Mendocino’s fertile soil and sea. It’s a second wave back-to-the-land movement and a welcome reprieve from the Bay Area’s buzz. Take Highway 128 through the Anderson Valley, to Hendy Woods State Park, where you can stretch your legs beneath the awe-inspiring giant redwoods or take a dip in the Navarro River. Then, backtrack to Boonville’s Pennyroyal Farm, the sister farmstead to one of Mendocino’s most beloved wineries, Navarro Vineyards. Sample rich goat and sheep milk cheeses, fresh and aged, exceptional pinot noir, and farm-made pickles and preserves. Sit out back, beside a gurgling fountain, and watch sheep meander beneath the vines. In the spring, a farm tour (11 a.m. daily) offers the overwhelming cuteness of nursing lambs and kids. For dinner, reserve a table at the Boonville Hotel, a former roadhouse that’s now a beautiful, family-owned inn with a wide porch, flickering fireplaces when the weather’s cool, and a seductive patio garden for outdoor dining during the warm months. The restaurant’s new chef, Perry Hoffman, is from Sonoma’s James Beard award-winning SHED and, before that, Napa’s Michelin-starred Étoile. Here, his prix-fixe menus (starting at $58) include lively dishes and unexpected flavor combinations. Imagine mussels with charred cabbage, grapefruit, fennel and seaweed or a whole stuffed quail with artichokes, shiitake mushrooms, bolting kale and brown rice vinegar. After winding through the redwoods and along the coast, head for the former logging town of Fort Bragg, for some small town night life. The 135-year-old Golden West is a dive bar that was bought in 2015 by a couple who grew up locally and returned after living in Los Angeles. The bar has maintained its vintage character (neon signs, shuffleboard and pool tables, faded black-and-white photos of logging scenes) while upgrading its extensive liquor cabinet and serving excellent cocktails, and has occasional but unexpectedly good live music, as well as a Sunday Bloody Mary bar. Or, for a family-friendly pub in a tucked-away location, seek out Mendocino’s newest brewery, Overtime Brewery, which teams with Nye Ranch in making its exotic seasonal beers, like the “Thistle Dew” artichoke ale or Nye Ranch Cucumber Batch. Take a couple of crowlers — a 32-ounce can filled from the tap and sealed on site — of your favorite beer to go. Tucked into a strip mall, Cafe Jaavy — the younger sister of the longtime local favorite, Los Gallitos — has colorful oilcloth tablecloths, a salsa bar and a breakfast menu that includes savory Mexican breakfasts like chilaquiles (tortilla chips simmered in a flavorful, mildly spicy sauce, served with beans and eggs, $9.50) and standout huevos rancheros with chorizo ($9.50), plus sweeter offerings like banana and berry crepes ($8.99) and generous smoothies ($4.50) made with fresh fruit. The Tropical, with mango, apple, pineapple, melon, chili and lime is particularly tasty. Then, head for the 47-acre Mendocino Coast Botanical Gardens, where 124 species of rhododendrons put on a spectacular show in April and May. Drive south to Mendocino village to walk its photogenic streets and gawk at the immaculately preserved Victorians. Pop into Frankie’s for a scoop of locally made Cowlick’s ice cream. Among the cafe’s 16 rotating flavors are chai, Campari grapefruit sorbet, yellow cake batter and mushroom. Then, take a restorative soak in Sweetwater Spa’s communal — and clothing optional — eight-person redwood tub, sweat in the cedarwood sauna, or indulge in a massage (starting at $110 for 50 minutes). There are also private tubs ($25 per hour), which are enclosed but open to the sky; if a starry soak is your thing, Sweetwater is open until 9 p.m. Next door, Cafe Beaujolais’s weekend-only takeout window, the Brickery, serves pizza ($13) with big, perfectly charred air pockets and daring toppings, like Moroccan-spiced rabbit and garlicky New Haven-style white clam pizza. On sunny days, the backyard garden is idyllic for sharing a pie and savoring a glass of rosé or a craft cider. Fort Bragg’s signature attraction, a former town dump that was transformed by time into a beach of gleaming sea glass, has been badly picked over and is no longer the dazzling sight it once was. For a glimpse of its former glory, head to the odd little International Sea Glass Museum south of town, where Captain Cass sells bags of so-called Seed Glass ($4.95) to replenish the beach’s supply. Across Highway 1, the Glass Fire Gallery displays fantastic blown-glass creations in the form of jellyfish chandeliers and mushroom-shaped table lamps. While in the area, go for a stroll along the newly opened Noyo Headlands Coastal Trail. After more than a century of the headlands being occupied by a sprawling mill site, the town now has access to its coastal bluffs, where California poppies blaze orange in the spring, when it’s also possible to spot migrating whales spouting offshore. For a dose of Mendocino’s wonderful eccentricity, visit The Larry Spring Museum of Common Sense Physics, a tiny two-room storefront museum that celebrates the life and work of the local inventor, lay scientist and World War II transport pilot, Larry Spring. In the same small building, Lost Coast Found has a charming selection of vintage home goods: midcentury stereos, cheery 1970s-era coffee cups, along with used books, postcards and miscellanea. Have an early, California-style dinner by the water in Noyo Harbor, where you have a difficult choice of dining options. For fresh, crispy fish and chips, bundle up and sit on the riverside deck at Sea Pal Cove, where dinner guests include sea gulls, there are $5 pints of high-end craft beer, and views of passing fishing — and, in season, whale-watching — boats. A few doors down, Princess Seafood Market & Deli is a woman-owned and -run fishing operation with its own boat and seafood restaurant. Princess serves reasonably priced, locally caught seafood, including whole Dungeness crab ($27.95), barbecued Royal Miyagi oysters ($12.95 for a half dozen, and a grilled prawn po boy ($15.95). During chilly coastal evenings, the deli’s tented seating area provides heat lamps and freshly laundered blankets. Then, pick up a Coast Packet and take a gamble on a local performance. One of the joys of small town cultural life is the unexpectedness of what’s available from week to week, whether it’s the wonderful independent Flynn Creek Circus or a riotous political play at the Mendocino Theatre Company. On your way through Mendocino, grab a takeout breakfast — an organic housemade bagel with lox and “all the veggies” ($12.50) or “market-inspired” quiche ($8) — at Mendocino’s Good Life Cafe. Sip your coffee to-go as you drive a breathtaking stretch of Highway 1 to the village of Elk, population 200. Tote your breakfast down to Greenwood State Beach to sit on a piece of driftwood, look out over the volatile Pacific and take a long breath of sea air. Then, visit Elk Greenwood Museum and Visitor Center — originally the town’s post office — to learn some Greenwood lore from the center’s knowledgeable docents. Take Philo-Greenwood Road back to Anderson Valley and taste your way out of town. The options can be overwhelming, but the redwood tasting room at Toulouse Vineyards and Winery is especially beautiful and its wines are excellent renditions of classic local varietals: Alsatian whites and pinot noirs. For three wineries in one Spanish-style plaza, stop at The Madrones complex, where Drew Family Cellars, Smith-Story Winery and the newly opened Long Meadow Ranch, which has estate-grown Burgundian varietals, share a plaza. Cut east over Route 253 — a spectacular 16-mile drive across hilltops of moss-draped California live oaks — to Ukiah, Mendocino’s 16,000-person county seat. Dedicated to an extraordinary, but largely forgotten painter, the Grace Hudson Museum and Sun House displays Hudson’s striking and distinctly empathetic portraits of native peoples and immigrants, exhibits the work of local artists, and offers tours of Hudson’s Arts and Crafts home, which she called Sun House. Head south to the City of 10,000 Buddhas, a former California State Mental Hospital that is now a Buddhist community and monastery. The campus’s distinctive arched entrance is undergoing renovation, but its roaming peacocks, evocative institutional architecture and Jyun Kang Vegetarian Restaurant, which serves tasty vegetarian dishes to a mostly local crowd, remain. Or hop down the 101 to Hopland, where Rock Seas serves an ever-changing menu that riffs on brunch classics — like coconut French Toast with star anise, coconut, brown sugar and mango ($12). In the last two years, two long-awaited new hotels have opened on the Mendocino coast. The Harbor House Inn, in Elk, is a 1916 redwood home which was originally built by the local logging company and designed to showcase the beauty of the region’s lumber. After an eight-year renovation, the inn reopened in May of 2018 with 10 rooms (starting at $355, breakfast included) and a destination restaurant. Located on a high bank where the Noyo River becomes a harbor, the Noyo Harbor Inn has 15 rooms starting at $199 — nearly all with wide views of the waterfront or the Pacific. Many of Mendocino’s rustic redwood homes have been converted to vacation rentals in recent years. A mile and a half from Mendocino village, pet- and child-friendly Mendocino Treehouse is not only built of redwood, but the octagonal cottage is built around a living tree. Two bedrooms and two bathrooms, starts at $275. Follow NY Times Travel on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook.

2019,36 Hours in St. Louis,"The city, with its once-quiet, now-vibrant downtown, offers new restaurants, microbreweries and a rich array of cultural venues, including a museum that pays tribute to the blues. Before travelers could fly there, St. Louis, on the Mississippi River, was a natural point of continental convergence for rails, trails and sails, the gateway to the West in the 19th century. That traffic, and the industry that grew up around it, created a legacy of wealth and power that is reflected in the city’s architecture and memorials to its complex history. These days, the downtown core, which boomed with industrialization in the early 20th century, and hollowed out with a rush to the suburbs thereafter, is filling up with new residences, hotel projects and cultural venues (including a museum dedicated to the blues). You can still drink Budweiser in the massive factory where it’s made, but you’ll also find microbreweries that emphasize local ingredients; innovative takes on soul food at restaurants like Gourmet Soul; and flavors introduced by immigrant communities from the Balkans and beyond. The 630-foot Gateway Arch, the grand 1965 city landmark, remains the same, including the vintage tram rides to the top (tram ride from $12). But a four-year, $380-million remodeling of Gateway Arch National Park (admission $3) reframes the monument’s connection to the city and to the westward migration it commemorates. A highway that divided the park from the city has been covered, providing additional park land and easy pedestrian access. A sloping plaza now ushers visitors into the subterranean Museum at the Gateway Arch, overhauled to explore Western colonization from different viewpoints, including that of Manifest Destiny (themed “the West was won”), Native Americans (“the West was stolen”) and Mexico (“the North was taken”). Design fans will appreciate the new gallery devoted to Eero Saarinen’s brilliant catenary arch design, including the models of relatively conservative entries it beat in the design competition. Students of history shouldn’t miss the Old Courthouse, part of the park and the site where Dred Scott and his wife, Harriet, sued for their freedom from slavery. St. Louis is the original home of the ubiquitous macro-brew Budweiser. But microbrew operations, some employing veterans of Bud, have created competing pints at newer brewers like Side Project Brewing, Narrow Gauge Brewing Company and Urban Chestnut Brewing Company. If forced to pick one, don’t miss the original upstart, the Saint Louis Brewery, makers of Schlafly beer. Since 1991, the Schlafly Tap Room has occupied a historically registered 1901 printing company building west of downtown in a handsome neighborhood of brick warehouses still awaiting revival. There’s hardly a type of beer Schlafly hasn’t made over the years and the taps turn seasonally. Look for the hazy white lager and refreshing kölsch (pints $6). [What are your recommendations for a weekend in St. Louis? Tell us in the comments section.] Many St. Louis chefs champion the abundance of Missouri-grown foods, including, on the high end, the chef Michael Gallina. The native of St. Louis worked at New York’s Blue Hill at Stone Barns for nearly 10 years before moving back home to open the farm-to-table restaurant Vicia. The vegetable-centric menu celebrates Midwestern ingredients with fine-dining flair in the window-wrapped room, and warm servers set a relaxed tone. Dishes change with the seasons, but recently included ham-studded crispy fried rice ($16), fork-tender, grass-fed beef with whey onions ($18), and turnip tacos ($18) that use paper-thin turnip slices as shells for make-your-own tacos, accompanied by strained yogurt, pickled red onion, black beans and optional pork or mushrooms. The bar does liquid wonders with herbs and even leftover yogurt whey. Amanda Clark, an historian, can spout all the pertinent facts and figures about St. Louis. But she wanted to combine them with more offbeat, seamy and overshadowed city stories when she founded Renegade Stl tours six years ago. Now the company has expanded its portfolio to include tours themed to disasters and catastrophes, photography, baseball and manufacturing history. The two-hour Downtown History and Architecture Extravaganza (from $20) is a good first outing, covering St. Louis’s start in 1764 as a French trading settlement; the Gilded Age boom when city merchants profited outfitting westward migrants; and the midcentury development of the Gateway Arch. En route she points out architectural gems from the architects Louis Sullivan and Philip Johnson and discusses the city’s early experiment in legal prostitution and its ongoing struggle with brick theft from historic buildings. Waves of immigrants — including Italians in the restaurant-filled Hill district and Germans, among them the founders of Anheuser-Busch beer — have left their mark on St. Louis. More recently, beginning in the 1990s, refugees from Bosnia flocked to affordable St. Louis, particularly the Bevo Mill district, home to a replica of a wooden fountain found in Sarajevo. The community’s proudest culinary expression is found in suburban Webster Groves where Balkan Treat Box, long a popular food truck, just opened a brick-and-mortar, lunch-only shop dealing grilled beef sausages called cevapi ($11) and Turkish wood-fired pide flatbread with Balkan kajmak cream ($11). In the Botanical Heights District, named for its proximity to the comprehensive Missouri Botanical Garden, Union Studio provides one-stop shopping for a variety of local art, clothing, jewelry and crafts. Wander over to browse for handle-free ceramic mugs by the potter Al Westcott, handmade ties and pocket squares by Lonesome Traveler and sensuously draping pendant necklaces from Mahnal Jewelry by Shayba Muhammad. Pick up souvenirs from an assortment of St. Louis-themed cards, pins and dish towels. If perishables are more your style, hit Union Loafers bakery and cafe next door for a loaf of fresh sourdough. Two of the city’s many interesting museums are small enough to hit in one stimulating spree. First, stop in the Grand Center neighborhood at the Pulitzer Arts Foundation (free), a fascinating blend of Tadao Ando’s minimalist architecture and rotating exhibitions of contemporary art from St. Louis’s famed publishing family. Continue downtown to the two-year-old National Blues Museum ($15), which pays homage to the American musical form that evolved from field hollers and rags by W.C. Handy to Muddy Waters’ electric blues and Chuck Berry’s early rock ’n’ roll. Interactive exhibits allow visitors to write and create their own blues song by choosing piano, harmonica and guitar styles, writing lyrics and mixing it all up in a sound booth. Send yourself the finished results via email. Besides being a great introduction to the blues, the museum celebrates African-American culture in St. Louis, which is also home to the Scott Joplin House State Historic Site where the ragtime composer lived, and The Griot Museum of Black History, featuring exhibits on slavery and wax figures of area-born celebrities, including Josephine Baker. The chef most closely associated with St. Louis’s culinary emergence, Gerard Craft, has done French, Italian and now, in his new restaurant called Cinder House, South American food. A tribute, in part, to his childhood nanny from Brazil, Cinder House serves a mix of wood-fired dishes from grilled prawns ($15) to steaks (from $32), and Brazilian pork, beef and chimichurri feijoada ($32) and moqueca seafood stew ($30). Situated in the riverfront Four Seasons Hotel St. Louis, Cinder House includes a spacious outdoor patio that serves caipirinhas and mojitos ($11), in addition to Instagrammable views of the Gateway Arch. There is a wealth of choices in the rich performing arts scene, including the Repertory Theatre of St. Louis, which includes the playwright Tony Kushner as an alumnus. St. Louis Black Repertory bills itself as the nation’s largest professional African-American theater company. Earlier this year it staged the premiere of “Canfield Drive,” exploring media coverage of the 2014 shooting death of Michael Brown in nearby Ferguson, Mo.; “Nina Simone: Four Women” runs May 15 to June 2. The second-oldest symphony in the country, the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra plays in Powell Symphony Hall, an ornate 1935 vaudeville theater. In summer, the 100-year-old Municipal Opera Association, known as the Muny, stages popular musicals (“Guys and Dolls” kicks off the season June 10) in a vast 10,800-seat outdoor stadium in Forest Park. Arrive early or prepare to line up at Half & Half in suburban Clayton, where the chef and owner, Mike Randolph takes breakfast seriously. A little more than half of the menu in the sunny, bustling storefront skews savory, with dishes like a fried egg sandwich ($8.50), and veggie hash with eggs and potatoes that comes in a piping hot skillet ($11). On the sweet side, there’s pancakes with raspberry jam, mascarpone and granola ($11) and s’mores French toast ($10.50). Wash it down with bottomless cups of locally roasted Blueprint Coffee ($3.95). The site of the St. Louis World’s Fair in 1904, the nearly 1,300-acre Forest Park serves as the wilderness and playing field for urban residents, as well as a cultural magnet with attractions that include the Saint Louis Art Museum, Missouri History Museum, Saint Louis Zoo and Saint Louis Science Center. You can drive around the park, but the best way to see it is on foot, following paths that wind through forests and prairies and around tranquil ponds. Park-goers can also rent a kayak at the boathouse ($15 an hour), play tennis ($5) or golf (from $22). With its many museums, St. Louis covers the spectrum of culture, anchored on the playful end by City Museum (admission $15). The all-ages playground, based in a 600,000-square-foot former shoe factory, houses a mix of eclectic exhibits and carnival attractions, including a Ferris wheel and giant slide on the roof. Slides, as well as stairs, connect four levels of this arty fun house, which features an aquarium, collections of architectural artifacts, mosaics and taxidermy and a mini shoelace factory. Its “no maps” policy encourages guests to let loose and go where the treehouse or the underground caves lead. Many of the loft apartment conversions that have revived St. Louis’ downtown buildings now stock Airbnb’s inventory. For example, the one-bedroom Designer Loft in Center of Downtown features whitewashed brick walls, modernist furnishings and a fully equipped contemporary kitchen. From $65; Airbnb.com/rooms/17106158. The new Hotel Saint Louis occupies a retrofitted 1893 landmark building originally designed by Louis Sullivan with a restored marble lobby capped by a stained-glass ceiling.

2019,"37 Years Later, Israel Recovers Body of Soldier Killed in Lebanon War","JERUSALEM — The remains of an Israeli soldier who went missing nearly 37 years ago in a calamitous battle with Syrian forces in Lebanon have been repatriated, the Israeli military said Wednesday, healing a long-festering wound to the national psyche and handing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a unifying achievement just six days before he seeks re-election. The soldier, Sgt. First Class Zachary Baumel, a 21-year-old tank driver who was born in Brooklyn, emigrated to Israel with his family in 1970. He was lost and believed killed a few days into the 1982 Israeli invasion of southern Lebanon, in the chaos after his brigade was ambushed near the village of Sultan Yakoub, in the eastern Bekaa Valley. Israel’s military and intelligence services never stopped searching for him, and two others who remain missing. One key breakthrough came in 1993, during the Oslo peace talks, when half of an identification tag belonging to Sergeant Baumel was delivered by Yasir Arafat, the Palestine Liberation Organization chairman, to an emissary of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. In 2016, Russia returned to Israel, at Mr. Netanyahu’s request, a tank that had been seized in the Sultan Yakoub battle, sent by Syria to Moscow and kept on display at the armored corps museum there. Last year, a Syrian-based Palestinian official told The Associated Press that insurgents had found the remains of three Israeli soldiers, including Sergeant Baumel, in a cemetery in the Yarmouk Palestinian refugee camp in Damascus, the Syrian capital. And in the fall, Russia said its soldiers had come under fire while helping Israel search graves in Syrian territory controlled by Islamic State forces. Mr. Netanyahu, who a day earlier had announced plans to meet with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia on Thursday, said Israel had “invested immense efforts” in what he called the “moral duty” of resolving what had happened to Sergeant Baumel. “In his last words, written on a postcard before leaving for the battle of Sultan Yakoub, he wrote, ‘Don’t worry, everything is all right, but it doesn’t seem like I’ll be coming home soon,’” Mr. Netanyahu said in a televised announcement Wednesday evening. “It took the state of Israel 37 years to bring him home,” he continued. “The operation to return Zachary Baumel back home is an example of the camaraderie that defines us as a nation, as an army and as a state.” For Israeli Jews, nearly all of whom enter the military at 18, the recovery of a fallen soldier or the return of a prisoner of war can be a galvanizing national event. In 2011, Mr. Netanyahu released 1,027 Palestinian prisoners to retrieve one missing soldier held by Hamas, Gilad Shalit. And the prime minister has faced fierce criticism over his policy toward Gaza from the family of Lt. Hadar Goldin, who was believed killed during the 2014 Gaza war by Hamas militants, who still hold his remains. Hamas is also believed to be holding the remains of another soldier, Staff Sgt. Oron Shaul, from the 2014 war, as well as two Israeli civilians who are believed to be alive. “It’s something Israelis get excited about,” said Amos Harel, a military analyst for the newspaper Haaretz. “You have to bring them home. It’s a terribly emotional and ideological issue.” Mr. Harel noted that the Goldin family had publicly expressed fear that their campaign to recover their son’s remains would suffer the same fate as the search for the three soldiers lost at Sultan Yakoub, two of whom remain missing. Indeed, Tzur Goldin, Lieutenant Goldin’s twin brother, assailed Mr. Netanyahu after the announcement about Sergeant Baumel. “Hadar is not overseas or in a faraway country,” he wrote on Twitter. “It is very clear where he is. He is an hour away from Netanyahu’s office” in Israel’s military headquarters, he said, “held by a loathsome terror organization that is making a fool of a terrified government that follows a failing policy. Shame on you!” Still, for Mr. Netanyahu, the closing of such an old case could not have been more propitiously timed. He has run an exceptionally divisive re-election campaign, pitting Jews against Arab citizens and his fellow conservatives against the left, but the return of Sergeant Baumel’s remains for burial in Israel gave him a victory that could be savored by nearly every voter who has served in the military or has a relative who did. Moreover, with Mr. Netanyahu in a tight race with Benny Gantz, a retired three-star general and army chief, anything that reminds voters of the prime minister’s competence and devotion as Israel’s commander in chief would help counteract Mr. Gantz’s appeal as a lifelong military man. Finally, Mr. Netanyahu’s announcement came an hour before — and completely buried in the Israeli news media — a news conference at which Ehud Barak, a former prime minister and army chief, and several other retired senior military, national security, intelligence and diplomatic officials attacked Mr. Netanyahu. Their remarks came in response to a brewing scandal involving Mr. Netanyahu’s approval of the sale of advanced German-made submarines to Egypt. The battle of Sultan Yakoub was a disastrous start to what became a disastrous military adventure for Israel in Lebanon. Sergeant Baumel’s brigade entered a narrow valley unaware that a Syrian armored division was positioned in the surrounding hills. Survivors told of bedlam as eight tanks were abandoned and soldiers fled on foot. A rescue mission was mounted, and about 20 Israeli soldiers were killed. One of the captured tanks was paraded through the streets of Damascus. Yehuda Katz, a gunner in one tank, went missing. In another, Sergeant Baumel, the driver, and Sgt. First Class Tzvi Feldman, a loader and communications operator, were lost, the army said. Two other soldiers who were captured and the remains of one who was killed were returned to Israel by 1985. Eventually, Israel concluded that Palestinians in Syria were holding the other missing at the direction of the P.L.O., which the Israeli army said undertook a “protracted effort of concealment and deception” that impeded the search for years. At an army ceremony on Wednesday, the chief of staff of the Israel Defense Forces, Lt. Gen. Aviv Kochavi, spoke of the “great obligation” he bears “to take care of every soldier” who swears allegiance to the state. “This commitment is to every family that entrusts us with them, and a commitment to Israeli society who puts their trust in us,” he said.",The New York Times
2019,4 Film Series to Catch in N.Y.C. This Weekend,"Our guide to film series and special screenings happening this weekend and in the week ahead. All our movie reviews are at nytimes.com/reviews/movies. THE ANARCHIC CINEMA OF VERA CHYTILOVA at BAM Rose Cinemas (through April 18). In the United States, the Czech-born filmmaker Chytilova (1929-2014) remains best known for her second feature, “Daisies” (on Friday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday), a touchstone of filmmaking in the run-up to the Prague Spring (it was initially banned in Czechoslovakia) and a milestone of feminist cinema, starring Jitka Cerhova and Ivana Karbanova as mischief makers whose antics upend conventions of film and narrative form. But BAM’s retrospective paints a fuller picture of the auteur; almost all the other titles in the series are rarely shown stateside. The 1980s horror film “Wolf’s Hole” (on Saturday), for instance, about teenagers on a ski trip, is said to offer an opportunity to see Chytilova fuse political allegory with more conventional genre tropes.718-636-4100, bam.org ‘EL DESENCANTO’ at Film Forum (April 13, 5:10 p.m.). An account of the Paneros, a Spanish literary family whose patriarch became a leading figure of letters during Franco’s rule, this documentary from the mid-1970s was intended as the Iberian Peninsula’s answer to “Grey Gardens,” according to Film Forum. Unreleased in the United States, it inspired a new book on the Paneros by Aaron Shulman, who will introduce the screening. “In addition to producing thousands of pages of poetry and prose, the Paneros have inspired academic studies, fan fiction, film treatments and Twitter hashtags, but they are virtually unknown in the English-speaking world,” Amanda Vaill wrote in her review of the book for The New York Times.212-727-8110, filmforum.org INFRADESTRUCTION! (A.K.A. WHEN INFRASTRUCTURE ATTACKS) at Anthology Film Archives (April 13-21). The natural follow-up to last month’s Infrastructure on Film series — which gawked at the ingenuity of highway systems and railways — is this collection of movies about engineering gone awry. The problems might extend to the choice of director in “Maximum Overdrive” (on Saturday, Wednesday and April 19), which has a reputation as a notoriously silly filmmaking debut from Stephen King that pits sentient machinery against the populace. “Final Destination 2” (on Saturday, Tuesday and April 19) opens with its ill-fated cast members cheating death by avoiding a vehicular pileup, while the culprit in “Volcano” (on Tuesday and April 21) is not so much infrastructure as the bubbling lava beneath it. And if you’ve only seen “Titanic,” check out the riveting “A Night to Remember” (on Sunday, Wednesday and April 20), a more matter-of-fact, procedural account of the ship’s sinking.212-505-5181, anthologyfilmarchives.org [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] LINCOLN KIRSTEIN AND FILM CULTURE at the Museum of Modern Art (through April 24). While MoMA celebrates the influence of Kirstein, a founder of New York City Ballet, on the worlds of art and dance with an exhibition, this parallel program commemorates his role as a pioneering cinephile. This retrospective recreates some of the original programs from a film society Kirstein helped start in the early 1930s, such as a double bill of the Soviet animation “Mail” and Luis Buñuel’s Surrealist outrage “L’Age d’Or” (on Tuesday). It also showcases film work Kirstein championed, from the acting of James Cagney, who can be seen in “The Public Enemy” (on Friday and April 21) and “A Midsummer Night’s Dream” (on April 22), to rushes that Sergei Eisenstein filmed in Mexico (on Saturday) for a never-completed project on the country’s history.212-708-9400, moma.org",The New York Times

As the film noir expert Eddie Muller has noted, when “Dragnet Girl” was rediscovered in the 1970s, many critics had to expand their perceptions of Yasujiro Ozu, the Japanese director whose gently understated intergenerational family dramas (“Late Spring,” “Tokyo Story”) had earned him a global reputation as a master. By contrast, this early-1930s silent gangster drama finds Ozu tipping his hat to the Hollywood pictures of the period. It will screen with an electronic score performed live by Coupler. 212-875-5601, filmlinc.org JAMMIN’ GEARS: TRUCKERS ON FILM at Anthology Film Archives (through April 21). When Fritz Lang said in “Contempt” that CinemaScope was only good for filming funerals and snakes, he neglected to mention big rigs and the open road. This series actually begins well before the wide-screen era, with George Raft and Humphrey Bogart as truck-driving brothers in “They Drive by Night” (on Sunday and Tuesday). And in between meat-and-potatoes thrillers (Steven Spielberg’s “Duel,” on Saturday and Wednesday, and Jonathan Mostow’s “Breakdown,” on Friday, Tuesday and Thursday) and oddities (Sam Peckinpah’s late-career “Convoy,” on Wednesday and April 12 and 21, adapted from a C. W. McCall song), the programming also cracks open a window on social issues of the 1970s. In “White Line Fever” (on Saturday and Monday), Jan-Michael Vincent plays a Vietnam veteran who takes on a corrupt trucking operation. 212-505-5181, anthologyfilmarchives.org [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] THE OTHER JAPANESE NEW WAVE: RADICAL FILMS FROM 1958-61 at Japan Society (April 5-27). Nagisa Oshima’s “Cruel Story of Youth,” which had its premiere in 1960, may or may not be the definitive depiction of the alienation felt by Japan’s postwar generation, but as this retrospective — with rarities, top to bottom — illustrates, that film was hardly alone. Highlighting directors who are less known internationally, Japan Society will present works from several of Oshima’s contemporaries at the Shochiku studio and elsewhere in the Japanese film industry of the era, beginning with the director Kiju Yoshida, whose “Good-for-Nothing” (on Friday) centers on a nihilistic young man and the secretary who shows sympathy for him. “The End of Love” (on Saturday), directed by the film critic Eizo Yamagiwa, had been presumed lost but will now screen for what is said to be the first time in the United States. 212-715-1258, japansociety.org WHAT PRICE HOLLYWOOD at the Museum of Modern Art (April 8-20). There’s a lot going on conceptually in MoMA’s latest series, designed as a companion piece to the vintage posters on display outside the museum’s theaters. The title comes from a 1932 George Cukor film (showing on April 13), which was a forerunner of “A Star Is Born.” The guiding intellectual spirit is the critic Parker Tyler, who asked in 1944 whether Hollywood would “remain monstrous and pernicious” or make movies that worked “toward an end beyond what any other art has accomplished in a mass sense.” The selections zero in on how movies have shaped perceptions of sexual politics. More than half the films come from the 1930s, but in terms of when they were released, the lineup begins with the silent-era star Louise Brooks (“Diary of a Lost Girl,” on Tuesday) and ends with Divine (“Female Trouble,” on Thursday and April 20). 212-708-9400, moma.org",The New York Times

Six decades after the end of the silent era, Charles Lane made “Sidewalk Stories,” a (mostly) wordless independent feature in which Lane played a street artist who ends up caring for an abandoned 2-year-old girl. Lane will introduce this double bill, which pairs “Sidewalk Stories” with the film to which it tips its bowler hat: Charlie Chaplin’s “The Kid.” (Separately, “The Kid” will screen at IFC Center on Friday, Saturday and Sunday.)718-636-4100, bam.org ROBERTO GAVALDÓN: NIGHT FALLS IN MEXICO at the Museum of Modern Art (through May 5). Appraising MoMA’s 2015 series on Mexican noir in The New York Times, J. Hoberman called Gavaldón “the most versatile and prolific of Mexican golden age filmmakers.” That thesis can be put to the test with this 13-film tribute. Gavaldón’s noir-friendly interest in blurring the line between good and evil gets an uncommonly literal vehicle in “The Other One” (“La Otra”), showing on Friday and May 4, which finds Dolores del Rio playing identical twins — one poor and kind, the other wealthy and venal. In the western “Rosauro Castro” (on May 4), Pedro Armendáriz plays a cruel political boss who strains to keep a village in his grip.212-708-9400, moma.org [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] IARA LEE RETROSPECTIVE at Maysles Cinema (April 28-May 2). This filmmaker and activist is perhaps best known for her 1996 documentary “Synthetic Pleasures,” which examined how then-emerging phenomena like virtual reality and cosmetic surgery were changing the way humans related to the world around them. That movie will screen on Sunday, and Lee will appear for Q. and A.s at all four screenings in this series.212-537-6843, maysles.org TRIBECA FILM FESTIVAL at various locations (through May 5).

2019,4 Killed in ‘Targeted’ Shootings in British Columbia,"A 60-year-old man was arrested after allegedly killing four people in a “targeted” series of shootings on Monday, the police in British Columbia said. The gunman, whom the authorities had not named as of Tuesday morning, killed two men and two women in three locations within about three miles of one another in the city of Penticton, said Ted De Jager, superintendent of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The first shooting was reported at 10:30 a.m., and the suspect had turned himself in by 11:30, he said. The victims were not identified, pending notification of their families. But the police said they believed the gunman knew all of the victims. “While the investigation remains active and ongoing, we do believe this was a targeted incident,” Mr. De Jager said at a news conference on Monday. The shooting was the deadliest on record in Penticton, a city of about 34,000 people that is about a four-and-a-half-hour drive from Vancouver. Throughout the province, mass shootings are rare: Only five shootings in British Columbia have killed more than four people. The last such shooting was in 2007, according to Penticton Western News. It was not immediately known what type of gun had been used in the attacks. Gun owners in Canada must be licensed. Before a license is granted, officials check the buyer’s past for any violent crimes or behavior, crimes involving firearms or violent episodes related to mental illness in the preceding five years. Handguns, semiautomatic and automatic weapons must be registered with the federal government, but lawmakers eliminated a national registry of rifles and shotguns in 2012. Last year, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau proposed expanding the background review to the licensee’s entire lifetime while resuming the record-keeping for some rifle and shotgun sales, prompting a fierce pushback from some gun owners. The national long-gun registry, introduced in 1995 in response to a mass shooting of students in Montreal, was unpopular in rural areas but supported by the police. Lawmakers in Quebec voted in 2016 to create the province’s own registry, over the protests of gun owners. Officials have pointed to a recent increase in several gun-related crimes, including homicides. Canada’s homicide rate reached a 10-year high last year, driven largely by gang-related shootings, according to a government report. Debates over gun laws heated up in Canada last year after a shooting in Toronto killed two people and wounded 13 others in July. In response, the city council suggested the federal government ban handgun sales in the city, while the Montreal City Council called for a national ban on the weapons. An earlier version of this article misstated the year of the most recent shooting in British Columbia that killed more than four people. It was 2007, not 1996.",The New York Times
2019,4 New Operas in 4 Months? Only in Berlin,"BERLIN — No place on earth rivals Berlin for the volume and variety of opera on offer, from Georg Frideric Handel to Hans Werner Henze. The city has three world-class companies, which this season have combined for a total of 85 fully staged productions. And they are investing in new works to run alongside the old war horses. When Detlev Glanert’s “Oceane,” inspired by a 19th-century novella about a woman who attempts to live outside patriarchal bourgeois society, has its premiere at the Deutsche Oper on April 28, it will be the third of four works taking their first bows here this season. Just a week later, the Komische Oper will present “M: A City Searches For a Murderer” by Moritz Eggert, based on the classic film thriller by Fritz Lang. Earlier this year, the Staatsoper presented Beat Furrer’s “Violetter Schnee” and a completely revised version of Jörg Widmann’s 2012 “Babylon.” Matthias Schulz, the Staatsoper’s general director, said in an interview that “to show commissioned works is essential, to show that opera isn’t just a museum. It’s a living art form.” There are challenges inherent in adding new works to what remains a conservative field. While world premieres generate excitement among enthusiasts, attracting a general audience is tricky, and it is difficult for new operas to gain a foothold in the repertoire. More often than not, it’s here today and gone tomorrow for fresh commissions, even the most critically praised ones, which tend to present too much of a financial risk to revive past their first performances. State-funded opera houses don’t need to be full every night to pay the bills. But administrators don’t want to perform to half-empty houses. “I don’t just want my work to be done once,” Mr. Glanert, the composer of “Oceane,” said in an interview. (And he has been fortunate, with multiple productions for most of his 10 operas.) Robert Carsen, who is directing “Oceane,” put it more bluntly: ”When I do a world premiere, I always say that I hope I’m not working on a world ‘dernière.’” Of Berlin’s three opera houses, the Deutsche Oper has shown the most sustained commitment to new work. Its artistic director, Dietmar Schwarz, has scheduled a major contemporary opera each season since he took on that position in 2012, including three world premieres. But only one of those, Aribert Reimann’s “L’Invisible,” is scheduled for revival — on the occasion of its composer’s 85th birthday in 2021. “We think it’s important to do it again,” Mr. Schwarz said, “but financially it will probably be difficult.” Mr. Widmann, the composer, said he didn’t know after its premiere seven years ago in Munich if “Babylon” “would ever be performed again. So many new pieces, especially monstrously complex pieces, never are. I’m very grateful for this house’s trust to give this crazy piece another chance.” (Mr. Widmann completely revised the work, a Biblical epic, to produce a new “Berlin version.”) According to the Staatsoper, ticket sales were strong for both “Babylon” and “Violetter Schnee,” an intense and mysterious 100-minute work about people trapped in an apocalyptic snowstorm, even if they received mixed reviews. The company will revive both works in coming seasons. “When we do efforts like that, and they are successful, we have to bring them back,” Mr. Schulz said. Companies attempt to attract audiences to these new works by promoting them as central events of the season. But working on them, said Mr. Carsen, the director, is always a leap into the unknown. “I always approach anything I’m directing as if it’s just been written,” he said. “And I want people to hear it and see it as if they’ve never seen it or heard it before. Which is, of course, the case with a world premiere.” Mr. Widmann said that much depends on the conditions under which a premiere is prepared. With “Babylon,” the musical idiom of which is complex and demanding, he said he was lucky to have worked with the Staatsopers in Munich and Berlin, two of Germany’s finest companies. “If the audience feels it’s performed and sung fantastically and if it touches their hearts,” he said, “then the modern musical language should not be a barrier.” Mr. Eggert, the composer of “M,” said, “Many people expect to suffer through a new opera. It’s a challenge for everyone, for the audience and the composers as well: how to create new works that can be understood without reading lengthy program notes.” His 90-minute score contains an enormous children’s chorus, spoken dialogue, synthesizers, and sound effects to evoke the big city. Barrie Kosky, the artistic director of the Komische Oper and the director of the production, said he asked the composer to channel the Weimar-style spirit of Kurt Weill. Mr. Kosky said this was “a deliberate attempt to create a link with the Berlin music-theater history, and as a ‘Gesamtkunstwerk’” — a “total work of art” — “it goes in a completely different direction than what Detlef Glanert or Beat Furrer or Jörg Widmann does.” But whether “M” would come back in a future season, he couldn’t say. Mr. Glanert said that it’s only natural for it to take time for audiences to become acclimated to the new. “Music is performed, evaluated and flops, or is performed again,” he said. “That’s the life cycle of any piece of music. And I think this is normal.” Is it realistic to expect new operas to ever reach the level of popularity of “Aida” or “Tosca”? Mr. Eggert said that opera companies should redraw their programs so that half of all the works presented are new. In Germany, generous state subsidies to opera houses mean they “could be much more adventurous,” he said. “In fact,” he added, “I’m appalled that it doesn’t happen.” The polemics to this effect that appear on his blog inspire some hate mail, but also support, especially from people who work in the field. “Something has to change,” he said. Mr. Kosky said he had reservations. “We have a duty, of course, to replenish the repertoire, but there are always questions hanging over my head,” he said. “Are the proscenium and the orchestra pit really the future of opera in the 21st century? Are we just creating these works for institutions? Do we all create them because we’re worried desperately that our Dracula-like dependence on 400 years of repertoire is going to come to an end if we don’t find new pieces?” Although his house is rolling out the red carpet for “M,” Mr. Kosky said his first allegiance is to the classics. “I am a signed-up member of the opera necrophiliacs club,” he said. “I can’t survive without my Mozart, Puccini and Richard Strauss.” Mr. Widmann, whose work deftly blends contemporary and historical styles, said he resisted writing operas when he was younger, but now felt it was his duty. “I need this as a composer, and the audience needs it, too,” he said. “To me, the whole opera system would not make sense at all if you only play the same old operas over and over again.” He is fortunate to be surrounded by supportive institutions. “We’re very lucky that we have the money to do this,” said Mr. Schwarz, of the Deutsche Oper. “It’s very important that you have this kind of art, which is not commercial. That we haven’t yet found a contemporary work that can be part of the repertory over the past 40 years doesn’t mean that we should give up.” (The important works of Philip Glass and John Adams are slowly making inroads in Germany.) Mr. Kosky said he isn’t giving up on world premieres, either, but he’s thinking beyond classically-trained composers. He wanted the next one he worked on to be “an operetta. But I want a great rock band or a brilliant jazz composer to do it.” “I’m sorry,” he added. “I’m an old showgirl and I like a bit of a tune.” An earlier version of this article misspelled a composer’s given name. It is Detlev Glanert, not Detlef.",The New York Times
2019,4 Takeaways From That Huge Study of Scott Kelly,"There’s never been a study like it before, and there probably never will be again. Starting in March 2015, astronaut Scott Kelly spent 340 days aboard the International Space Station. A team of scientists tracked his body’s responses to long-term spaceflight in painstaking detail. They simultaneously tracked his identical twin brother, Mark, on Earth. On Thursday, the scientists began publishing the huge trove of results from the so-called NASA Twins Study — 90 pages, all told, and that’s just the first installment. Here’s a guide to what they’ve found … so far. [Sign up to get reminders for space and astronomy events on your calendar.] Scientists tracked a huge range of measurements in the NASA Twins Study, from Mr. Kelly’s performance on cognition tests to levels of gene activity in his cells. Many of the molecular tests had never been carried out on astronauts before. The exams required Mr. Kelly to draw his own blood and to send fresh samples back to Earth in a Soyuz supply craft. Within 48 hours, researchers were analyzing the samples at NASA labs. In one test, researchers broke open Mr. Kelly’s white blood cells and searched for molecular signals from each of his genes to see whether they were active. The scientists identified thousands of genes that ramped up their pace. By looking at what those genes do, the team gleaned some clues as to why they became active in Mr. Kelly. Some are known to be triggered by stress, so it was no surprise to find that Mr. Kelly’s immune system also was on high alert. In another test, the researchers scrutinized molecular caps on the ends of Mr. Kelly’s chromosomes, called telomeres. Telomeres shorten with age, and stress can shorten them further. But Mr. Kelly’s telomeres actually grew longer on average during his time in space. Human biology is complicated and mysterious, even here on Earth. So documenting changes that Mr. Kelly experienced in space won’t automatically help scientists understand the causes. For example, why did his telomeres get longer? The Twins Study researchers are still trying to figure it out. It might have something to do with Mr. Kelly’s carefully designed, nutrient-rich diet — or perhaps the stress of space travel triggered stem cells to wake up and start multiplying. Another mystery lies in the very design of the experiment. NASA only examined a single astronaut in space, comparing his responses to his genetically identical brother. It’s hard to know if all astronauts would experience the same changes — or if some of those changes are flukes of his own experience and genetic makeup. Radiation can trigger certain mutations that may increase a person’s risk of developing cancer. And there’s more radiation in Earth orbit than on the surface of the planet. In his 340 days aboard the space station, Mr. Kelly was exposed to an estimated 48 times more radiation than he would have been subjected to had he spent a year on the planet. Scientists were able to observe the appearance of radiation-induced mutations in Mr. Kelly’s cells. The mutations were still present in Mr. Kelly months after his return, suggesting that he’ll carry them forward in his life, possibly causing a modest increase in his risk of cancer. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] So it’s a bit worrying that a long-term trip to Mars would expose astronauts to eight times more radiation than Mr. Kelly received. In addition, Mr. Kelly did worse on cognition tests even six months after landing, making more mistakes and responding more slowly. It’s possible that the physical demands of spaceflight were to blame, or that unconsciously his motivation had decreased. These unexpected declines led some researchers to worry about how ready astronauts would be for a challenging landing on Mars after many months in deep space. NASA understands that long-duration spaceflight could pose serious challenges to astronauts. By studying those challenges aboard the space station, the agency has been trying to quantify those risks. And on Earth, scientists have been investigating potential countermeasures. Take radiation. On the space station, Mr. Kelly’s cells switched on genes known to help repair DNA. It’s possible that his cells actually undid a lot of mutations right after they arose. Researchers are investigating a variety of compounds that might spur the cells of astronauts to repair even more damage. But such drugs might not be enough to handle, say, an unexpected solar flare, which would spray vast amounts of radiation. Some experts have speculated that spaceships would need a shielded room where astronauts could hide until flares were over. Although that might protect astronauts in theory, it would also add a lot of extra weight to a mission to Mars. And that’s just one of the biological risks that scientists will have to plan for.",The New York Times
2019,4 Tax Strategies That Could Make a Divorce Settlement Easier,"Wealth Matters Strip out the acrimony and emotion, and divorce can be boiled down to a business negotiation. Harsh as that may sound — there are often children stuck in the middle — when a couple gets down to completing their split, the numbers matter: assets, support, time allotted with children. Divorce negotiations are never easy, and they became more complicated this year. The Republican lawmakers’ sweeping overhaul of the tax code changed many of the calculations that factor into the logistics of divorce. Many Americans learned this year how tax changes affected their return, with some people owing more than they had expected. But others are realizing a slew of unforeseen consequences. A few weeks back, I wrote about how a provision meant to spur companies to invest in equipment has also been an enormous tax break to business owners interested in buying a private plane. The revised tax code has brought similar surprises to couples going through a divorce, to the point where lawyers and financial advisers are suggesting their wealthier clients bring accountants into the mix to lay out the tax implications of age-old strategies. Here are four strategies for taxpayers to consider: It all started with the change in how alimony would be taxed. Lawyers last year warned clients in the midst of a divorce to hurry up. But like love, divorce cannot be rushed. For divorces completed this year forward, the spouse paying alimony can no longer deduct the cost, as if it were a business expense, while the spouse receiving the money no longer has to claim it as income. The reason for changing a provision of the tax code that dates to 1942 was that vastly more people claimed the deduction than reported the payment on their income tax. The revisions were a way for the Internal Revenue Service to make up the shortfall. For individuals, the loss has made alimony payments more costly to the paying spouse because it eliminated a tax break that often served as a mechanism to bring about an agreement. Take someone earning $300,000 a year who had to pay a third of that in alimony to a spouse who did not work. If that divorce was settled last year in a state with no state income tax, the paying spouse could deduct the full amount and be left with $157,250 after taxes, said Craig Richards, director of tax services at Fiduciary Trust Company International. This year, that person would be left with $123,126, or about $34,000 less. On the other side, the receiving spouse, who would have paid $15,416 in taxes in a divorce settled last year, was able to keep the entire $100,000 tax-free this year. The difference grows as income grows. Mr. Richards ran a similar projection with someone earning $2 million and paying out $400,000 in alimony. Because of the lost deduction, that divorce cost at least $120,000 more this year. That increase, divorce lawyers said, has already slowed down negotiations. Peter R. Stambleck, a partner at the family law firm Aronson Mayefsky & Sloan, said that what he called “the legal spread where the government was eating the difference” in taxes often helped the two sides come to an agreement. One way the wealthiest are looking to get around this change is by setting up trusts for their former spouses that will pay out income equivalent to the alimony but without the tax burden. There’s a bit of a science to setting up these entities, called grantor trusts, and an art to persuading the receiving spouse to pay taxes on the money paid out. The trusts need to be funded with assets that will generate income as a substitute to the alimony payment and established after the divorce has been finalized, or else the spouse funding it will be responsible for the taxes, said Eugene Pollingue Jr., a partner at Saul Ewing Arnstein & Lehr. “It’s not alimony,” he said. “It’s a property settlement, and that’s tax-free.” To sell it to the spouse who will then have to pay taxes on the distribution, Mr. Pollingue said, the trust ensures payments continue even if the paying spouse dies — alimony stops at death — and whatever is left when the receiving spouse dies can go to heirs. Some accountants caution that the technique is too aggressive. “Let’s say you created a trust for the benefit of a spouse, and you’re guaranteeing $2,000 a month,” said Carrie Baron, a certified public accountant and co-founder of the accounting firm Baron Strohmenger. “The I.R.S. could say that’s just disguised alimony.” Others complain that such trusts are another tax provision that favors the ultrawealthy. “If you don’t have a lot of property to split up, you’re going to have to pay alimony, and now you’re going to have to do it in after-tax dollars,” said Christina M. Baltz, partner at the law firm Withers. “To a certain extent, you can say this is another Trump tax change that’s hit the middle class and not the upper class.” The limitations on state and local tax deductions surprised many who saw their tax bill go up. When it comes to divorce, that limitation can turn the home, a prime marital asset, into a hot potato. Until this year, the spouse with less money would often want to keep the marital home for the children, but doing so now has become more costly, said Alvina Lo, chief wealth strategist at Wilmington Trust. In one example Ms. Lo’s group worked on, a spouse who earned $70,000 got the house, worth $1.5 million, while the other spouse kept an equivalent amount of liquid assets. But with property taxes of $25,000 a year that were no longer fully deductible, the client’s tax bill increased by 25 percent. She had to sell. “When you’re counseling clients, they feel like they can control their spending and the money going out, but when you show them their number, this is not discretionary spending,” Ms. Lo said. “These are hard dollars you owe Uncle Sam regardless of your expenses.” In a high-property-tax state like New Jersey, some divorcing couples are looking to get rid of second homes as well, said Sandra C. Fava, a partner in Fox Rothschild’s family law group. “People have vacation homes at the Jersey Shore, and now they’ve lost the deduction for property taxes on their main home and second home,” she said. “That’s caused a real difference to their finances.” Some states, like New York, further complicate the process by having a set of standards that were created when alimony and state and local taxes were deductible on federal tax returns. The standards are meant to protect spouses with less money and create a framework to equitably distribute assets. The deductions have changed, but the standards have not — and aren’t likely to. The New York guidelines “were heavily negotiated,” Mr. Stambleck said. “It was too cumbersome a process to think it will happen again. We’re stuck with a state statute that doesn’t conform with federal statute.” But in a twist, New York State stills allows a deduction for alimony. The tax value of children in a divorce was also changed in the tax overhaul. So, too, has the value of spending time with them, particularly if they are college bound. In financial terms, children have become a smaller deduction. The exemption for each dependent — $4,050 per person — was eliminated, but the child tax credit was increased to $2,000 from $1,000. That credit starts to phase out at $200,000 of income for an individual and disappears at $240,000. This matters because it can be used as a negotiating tool in a divorce. The credits can be given to the spouse with lower income in exchange for a break elsewhere in the negotiations, said William P. Allen, principal at the Brisbane Consulting Group. A more valuable financial break may come with the amount of time children spend with each parent. Children spending more time with the spouse earning less could tip the scales when it comes to financial aid down the road, Mr. Richards said. If a family uses the Free Application for Federal Student Aid form, the income of the parent who has the children more often will be given more weight in the aid decision, he said. “You might want to give the spouse who makes less money a day more or a week more so the tiebreaker goes to them,” he said. “There’s the potential they might be eligible for financial aid.” Advisers say the only way to have some sort of certainty is to do a practice, or pro forma, tax filing. “It’s not only one thing that changed in tax reform,” Ms. Lo said. “You really need to factor in everything. You have to know how it’s going to impact your spending going forward.” And that advice goes for people who are in the midst of a divorce. Ms. Fava is working on a divorce where the couple filed their taxes jointly but owe $7,000 more than they did last year. “Had information been exchanged at the right time, I might have asked them to run the return both ways,” she said. “I wonder what the return would have been had they filed separately. They might have had a lesser overall burden.” Now, they have just one more thing to fight over.",The New York Times
2019,4 of the Most Dramatic Moments From the Mueller Report,"WASHINGTON — The special counsel’s report was publicly released on Thursday, offering long-awaited details about the investigation into potential ties between President Trump’s campaign and Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. The report, which found insufficient evidence of cooperation between the campaign and Russia to warrant criminal charges, contained plenty of redactions, but its more than 400 pages still included a number of revelations. Amid the fact-finding and the legal rationale, the report also described the toll that the investigation took on Mr. Trump and chronicled private conversations between the president and his associates. Sometimes, things in the White House got heated. Here are some of the most dramatic moments from the report. In May 2017, when the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, appointed the special counsel, the president issued a polite public statement, deploying a phrase that would become a refrain throughout the investigation: “There was no collusion.” Privately, Mr. Trump had a visceral reaction. When Jeff Sessions, then the attorney general, shared the news in the Oval Office, the president slumped in his chair. “Oh my God,” he said, according to the report. “This is terrible. This is the end of my presidency,” he said, adding an expletive. Mr. Trump then became angry and blamed Mr. Sessions for recusing himself from the Russia investigation, something he would never forgive Mr. Sessions for. “Everyone tells me if you get one of these independent counsels it ruins your presidency,” Mr. Trump reportedly said. “It takes years and years, and I won’t be able to do anything. This is the worst thing that ever happened to me.” The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, ultimately agreed that there was insufficient evidence to establish that Mr. Trump or his associates engaged in a criminal conspiracy with Russia to disrupt the 2016 election, although Mr. Mueller was less definitive on the issue of obstruction of justice. At a news conference on Thursday, Attorney General William P. Barr deemed the president cleared of obstruction. “There is substantial evidence to show that the president was frustrated and angered by his sincere belief that the investigation was undermining his presidency,” he said. The president angrily asked for Mr. Sessions’s resignation the day the special counsel was appointed. But when Mr. Sessions gave the letter to Mr. Trump the next day, he was in a different mood. Mr. Trump pocketed the letter, asking Mr. Sessions several times if he wanted to keep his job and shaking his hand when he said that he did. But the president did not return the letter, according to the report. Reince Priebus, the former chief of staff, and Stephen K. Bannon, the president’s former chief strategist, were concerned that Mr. Trump had kept the letter. Mr. Priebus told Mr. Sessions that it could function as a “shock collar” and that as long as he had it, the president had the Justice Department “by the throat,” the report said. Mr. Priebus spent almost two weeks trying to wrest the letter back from Mr. Trump, who took it with him on a trip to the Middle East. The president showed the letter to aides as they flew from Saudi Arabia to Israel, asking them what he should do with it. Later on the trip, when Mr. Priebus asked Mr. Trump for the letter, the president told him it was at the White House. The president did not hand over the letter to Mr. Sessions until May 30, three days after he returned, with a note, “Not accepted.” According to the report, Mr. Trump sparred with Donald F. McGahn II, the former White House counsel, over a very lawyerly tendency: taking notes. After news outlets, including The New York Times, reported in early 2018 that Mr. Trump had ordered the firing of Mr. Mueller, the president tried to persuade his White House counsel to rebut the coverage. Mr. McGahn refused because the articles were generally accurate, according to the report. Although the president denied that he said the word “fire,” Mr. McGahn replied that was how he interpreted their conversation. During the meeting, the president quizzed Mr. McGahn about why he took notes, the report said. “Why do you take notes? Lawyers don’t take notes. I never had a lawyer who took notes,” Mr. Trump reportedly said. Mr. McGahn said that he took notes because he was a “real lawyer,” explaining that they created a record. Mr. Trump invited the F.B.I. director at the time, James B. Comey, to dinner in January 2017, one day after the acting attorney general, Sally Yates, came to the White House to discuss her concern that the national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, had not been telling the truth about his contacts with the Russian ambassador to the United States. The invitation appears to have alarmed a number of Mr. Trump’s advisers, according to the report. Mr. McGahn had earlier advised the president not to communicate directly with the Justice Department. When Mr. Bannon, a senior adviser at the time, heard about the invitation, he suggested that he or Mr. Priebus attend as well. The president declined the offer and said he wanted the time alone with Mr. Comey. According to the report, Mr. Priebus told him, “Don’t talk about Russia, whatever you do.” The president said he would not discuss Russia. Instead, he brought up Mr. Flynn, saying that “the guy has serious judgment issues.” He also demanded loyalty from Mr. Comey. After that exchange became public, Mr. Trump and his aides disputed Mr. Comey’s version of events, going so far as to say that Mr. Comey, not the president, had requested the meeting. But the report said “substantial evidence corroborates Comey’s account of the dinner.” That evidence includes the president’s daily diary, which notes that he extended the invitation, as well as the recollection of senior F.B.I. officials whom Mr. Comey told about the conversation afterward. As the disclosure of his demand for a loyalty pledge spurred controversy, the president did not seem to understand the fuss. During a private conversation with the White House press secretary at the time, Sean Spicer, Mr. Trump denied ever making the demand, the report said. And even if he did, the president told Mr. Spicer, “Who cares?”",The New York Times
2019,400-Year-Old Bible Stolen From Pittsburgh Library Is Recovered in the Netherlands,"A 1615 Geneva Bible stolen two decades ago from the Carnegie Library in Pittsburgh in a long-running theft scheme has been recovered from a Dutch museum, the F.B.I. announced this week. The Bible was among hundreds of rare books, maps and other items, worth about $8 million in total, that the authorities have said were stolen by the archivist in charge of the collection over nearly 20 years. Prosecutors say the archivist, Gregory Priore, 62, sometimes walked out of the building with the items in plain sight. He then sold the works to a prominent book dealer, John Schulman, 55, whose shop was a block away and who had appeared as an expert appraiser on the television show “Antiques Roadshow,” according to an affidavit. The two men were charged last year with numerous counts of theft, conspiracy and other charges, and await trial. Robert G. Del Greco Jr., a lawyer for Mr. Schulman, said his client maintained his innocence, but declined to comment otherwise. A lawyer for Mr. Priore did not immediately return a call on Friday. F.B.I. officials said they had given the Bible to the office of the Allegheny County district attorney, Stephen A. Zappala Jr., who is prosecuting the case and will use the Bible as evidence. The Bible is similar to one known to have been carried to North America by the Pilgrims aboard the Mayflower, Robert Jones, special agent in charge of the F.B.I.’s Pittsburgh field office, said at a news conference on Thursday. “One can only imagine the journey this particular Carnegie Library Bible has taken,” Mr. Jones said. Using sales records, investigators last year traced the Bible to a museum focused on American pilgrims in Leiden, the Netherlands, said the museum’s director, Jeremy Bangs. Mike Manko, a spokesman for the district attorney, said that the museum bought the Bible in 2015 through a private seller for $1,200, and that it was currently appraised at $5,500. Dr. Bangs, an American historian who has lived in the Netherlands for decades, said he had acquired the Bible from a reputable seller for exhibitions, scheduled to take place in 2020 and 2021 in Massachusetts, on the books that Pilgrims owned. The Bible was translated by English Protestant exiles in Geneva during the reign of Queen Mary Tudor, the museum’s site notes. It is also called a “Breeches Bible” because of its unusual translation in Genesis 3:7 — “Then the eyes of them both were opened, and they knewe that they were naked, and they sewed figtree leaues together, and made themselues breeches,” the site states. The King James Bible does not use the word “breeches.” An addition to the book’s cover, which Mr. Bangs said was most likely made in the 19th century, reads “Holy Bible —- Breeches Edition.” It is weathered, with evidence of mold on some pages, and loose binding. Mr. Bangs said that investigators initially contacted him last year and asked him to mail the Bible back. Given its delicate condition, he questioned whether the request was real, he said. After learning more about the Pittsburgh case, Mr. Bangs said he contacted the Dutch police, who assigned an investigator trained in handling artwork to take possession of the Bible and transport it to the American Embassy. The F.B.I. said its own Art Crime Team helped to bring the Bible back to the United States, covered in Bubble Wrap and nestled in a protective container. Mr. Manko said that investigators were making progress in recovering other works as well. An initial search turned up 24 items, and 18 “cannibalized” or partial items, from a warehouse. Since then, investigators have recovered 18 books and 293 maps, plates and pamphlets, worth about $1.6 million, he said. The case has shocked the rare-book world. Until the theft was discovered and Mr. Priore was fired in 2017, he had been the sole archivist for the collection of rare books in the Oliver Room at the Carnegie Library, which is Pittsburgh’s public library system. Mr. Schulman was a respected member of the Antiquarian Booksellers’ Association of America. The organization said he once led its ethics committee. Over the years, Mr. Priore would carry items out of the library and drop them off at the shop, the affidavit states. Mr. Priore sometimes used an X-acto knife to remove part of a book and sell it individually, prosecutors contend. The affidavit states that Mr. Schulman paid Mr. Priore up front and then resold many of the items. Mr. Priore said he needed the money to “stay afloat” and pay tuition for his four children, and accused Mr. Schulman of spurring him on, the affidavit shows. “I should never have done this,” he told investigators. “I loved that room, my whole working life, and greed came over me.”",The New York Times
2019,5 Cheap(ish) Things to Help You With Meal Prep,"Minimize food waste and maximize savings. For most people, healthy, affordable eating doesn’t just magically happen. You need to build a strategy: when you’ll shop, when you’ll prep and when you’ll cook the components you’ll use in dishes for the week. This ballet where your past, present and future selves work together in harmony is known as meal planning. Here’s a terrific overview of the meal planning mind-set. The promise of meal planning is that by automating the shopping, planning and cooking process, you’re not coming up with food ideas on the fly; you’ve put in some legwork upfront so you’ll have some (healthy! delicious! crowd-pleasing!) options. When done well, meal planning both minimizes food waste and allows you to save money, too, as you’ll rely on impulsive takeout less. You’ll also free up mental energy that would otherwise be tied up wondering what you’ll make for dinner every night. We all go through trial-and-error as we figure out what system works best for us. Apps and websites give plenty of tips and inspiration. Themed nights also help as they take some guesswork out: Taco nights, pizza nights, soup and salad nights and — my personal favorite — breakfast-for-dinner night. No need to reinvent the wheel if choosing a template works for you. In collaboration with Wirecutter, a New York Times company that reviews and recommends products, here are five cheap(ish) items to make weekly meal planning a breeze. Baking sheet It never occurred to me to chuck my inferior baking sheet, even though it was warped, leaky and burned everything unlucky enough to make contact with it. I held onto it for years before I realized there was a better way. Once you embrace a high-quality baking sheet, you’ll kick yourself for not making the switch sooner. If you’re planning on doing high-volume roasting or assembling quick sheet-pan dinners, you’re going to need a sturdy, dependable baking sheet. Wirecutter recommends Nordic Ware Natural Aluminum Commercial Baker’s Half Sheet, which it calls a “durable workhorse of a pan.” The warp-resistant heavyweight aluminum will cook everything evenly, and the rim will keep juices and liquids that will come in handy if you’re, say, roasting fish or preparing Greek-style broiled shrimp. Mixing bowls When you don’t have a ton of space to prep and store food, it’s easy to rationalize skimping on a full mixing bowl set. I had only two bowls in my small kitchen for years: one large enough for popcorn and one small enough to fit a handful of cherries. Both were woefully inadequate when washing and prepping ingredients for the week. I realized a great set of mixing bowls doesn’t have to be a bulky addition to your setup. In fact, they can actually be quite versatile. The Pyrex Smart Essentials 8-Piece Mixing Bowl Set, Wirecutter’s favorite glass mixing bowl option, is microwave-safe and attractive enough to double as a serving bowl. Snap-on lids make storing leftovers easy. Instant pot Smart electric cookers give you more flexibility in your cooking repertoire. Add a small side dish to a chili or hearty soup and you’re good to go. Wirecutter recommends the Instant Pot Duo 6-Quart, which is really like seven kitchen appliances in one. It boasts 14 settings to cook stews, chili, grains, rice and more. [Check out this guide to learn about cooking with an Instant Pot.] Dutch oven A reliable Dutch oven is fabulous for weeknight soups and stews or slow-cooked meats. I use mine for one-pot meals like this pasta recipe. I’m a fan of any recipe that feeds my entire family and requires minimal cleanup. Wirecutter’s favorite is the 6-Quart Lodge Color Enamel Dutch oven, which performs as well as comparable Dutch ovens many times more expensive. The bigger handles are great because I can maneuver the pot securely even if I’m wearing bulky pot holders. Food storage containers You’ll want to divvy up the food you prepare into pre-portioned containers so you can take it out as needed for meals during the week. That means you’re going to need durable food containers. If you’re a fan of something lightweight, reach for the Snapware 18-Piece Total Solution Plastic Food Storage Set, Wirecutter’s pick for plastic containers. If you want something more enduring, Wirecutter recommends the Pyrex 18-Piece Simply Store Food Storage Set. It’s glass that will play nice in your freezer.

2019,5 Cheap(ish) Things to Take on Your Next Long Flight,"Are we there yet? Welcome to the Smarter Living newsletter. We email readers once a week with tips and advice for living a better, more fulfilling life. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Monday morning. The difference between an annoying flight and an enjoyable one usually comes down to one’s level of preparedness. For instance, during a long flight, I know I’ll be alternately fatigued, cranky and dehydrated. Besides the stress of navigating security lines, layovers and delays, there’s the mind-numbing time spent in the air. Hunger makes me grumpy. Twisting in my seat and rifling through my carry-on bag aggravates me. Heading off those pain points makes all the difference in boosting my mood. I don’t step foot on an airplane without a stockpile of snacks and a robust library of podcasts, movies and TV shows downloaded on my tablet. I also make sure to have a few key products at the ready so I can deal with anything — intrusive noises, boredom, my own funk — and step off the plane relaxed, hydrated and well rested. With that in mind, in collaboration with Wirecutter, a New York Times company that reviews and recommends products, here are five cheap(ish) items to make your next long flight more bearable. (And if you’re looking to load up on the sturdiest travel supplies, read more in Wirecutter’s guide to the best gear for traveling.) Pen A great pen is one of the most underrated items you can pack for your trip. I’m all for zoning out during a long flight, but after passively listening to an audiobook and watching a few episodes of a Netflix show, you might want to switch gears. Number and word puzzles can engage (and energize) your brain and help pass time when the onboard Wi-Fi is spotty. You might also need to fill out forms or keep track of important information, so a reliable pen is essential. Wirecutter recommends the Pilot Precise V5 RT. This retractable ballpoint pen writes smoothly, and it’s affordable enough that you won’t be too bummed if you misplace it during your travels. Lip balm Airplane air is notorious for sucking the moisture out of skin, so protect yourself against the inevitable dryness coming your way. Wirecutter recommends the hydrating Eos Smooth Sphere Lip Balm for most people. It’ll keep lips moisturized and the tingly, sweet mint flavor is pleasant enough that both my husband and my 9-year-old niece enjoy using it. It’s also available in stick form, which is perfect for stashing in pockets and purses. Earplugs Noise-cancelling earbuds are great if you’re serious about retreating into a silent cocoon during your flight. However, if you don’t mind a little background noise filtering in (and don’t want to drop a lot of cash), a pair of foam earplugs will do the job just fine. They’ll tamp down children’s tantrums and inescapably loud conversations so you can grab needed shut eye. Wirecutter recommends Mack’s Ultra Soft Foam Earplugs because they stay snug in your ear and have a noise reduction rating of 32 decibels. They come in a tub of 50 pairs, so feel free to share. Eye mask After the anxiety of catching the flight and boarding the plane, I’m usually ready to take a snooze cruise. Sometimes I drift away easily. Other times I struggle when the person in the seat ahead of me has their window shade up and sunlight is flooding in. Just to be on the safe side, I always keep a sleep mask handy so I can sleep when I need to, not when conditions allow. Wirecutter recommends the Nidra Deep Rest eye mask for travelers because it’s weightless, adjustable and its contoured cups won’t put pressure on your eyes. Toiletry bag When I flew from New York to Melbourne, Australia, my carry-on toiletry bag was the superstar of the trip. Having my hygiene must-haves — hand cream, dry shampoo, contact lens case and solution, toothbrush, toothpaste, deodorant — in one convenient place made me feel 100 percent less grouchy during my excruciatingly long 26-hour trip. I’m sure my seatmate appreciated my efforts, too. Wirecutter’s pick is the lightweight, spill-resistant Sea to Summit Travelling Light Hanging Toiletry Bag. If your favorite products don’t come in travel-friendly sizes, decant lotions and potions into reusable bottles. Wirecutter recommends the Sea to Summit Travelling Light set which conforms to T.S.A. regulations. It’s a smart way to bring a little bit of home wherever you go. Digital Addiction Getting You Down?

2019,5 Minutes That Will Make You Love the Piano,"We asked a few of our favorite artists to tell us about music that matters to them. Listen to their choices. Last fall, we asked our writers and editors, and some of our favorite artists, to select the five minutes or so they’d play for friends to make them fall in love with classical music. (See the picks.) Choosing was hard, but we loved it so much that we’re bringing it back — this month, with the goal of persuading those same curious friends to love the piano, the most powerful and protean of instruments. We know you’ll make memorable discoveries, and we hope you enjoy. Chopin makes the piano sing. He’s a poet. When I play an encore by him, you hear people immediately relax. This nocturne is one of the most popular ones; it catches the ear. And Arthur Rubinstein is my idol. He has a way that is so simple that it touches your soul without needing to know anything about the music. While the pulse is steady in this piece, the mood keeps shifting — touching melancholy, anxiety, calm, hopefulness. But the music and emotions stay delicate, with nothing overstated; the piano eases into the opening notes and seems to vanish into thin air at the end. Rameau composed for the harpsichord in its 18th-century heyday, but Alexandre Tharaud made his recording on a modern piano, flooding rich colors into the nobility of this Sarabande. The combination of courtly dignity and expressive fullness will remind you of your favorite lush, elegant costume drama. This music has a magical appeal to people who never listen to classical music. When I went to Beijing to learn the piano, we stayed in a suburb, because it was cheap. The kids had never heard piano music in their lives before. They were like: “You came all the way from Shenyang, potato farmer? And you are playing what?” That was how people in Beijing thought about regional people. Then I played this piece, and they were like, “Ooh, this potato farmer does nice stuff.” I brought it back for my new album, “Piano Book.” There is only one album by the 95-year-old Ethiopian nun Emahoy Tsegué-Maryam Guèbrou. Her style might be described as the intersection of the drawing-room music of 19th-century pianists (Moritz Moszkowski and Cécile Chaminade) and 20th-century blues pianists of African descent (Meade Lux Lewis and Mary Lou Williams). This piece exhibits perfect understanding of the instrument and flawless technical finish. In Ethiopia it has the status of an honored classic. The year I came to the United States to study, 1997, Gyorgy and Marta Kurtag’s recording “Kurtag, Bach: Jatekok” came out. Hearing them play shined a light on a spirituality that could be achieved collectively, with a delicate dance. It is as though this couple is interweaving the universe together, each taking his or her own role, to complete a haiku. Relationship goals? I think so. In the last movement of Beethoven’s final piano sonata, a sublimely simple theme is put through an astonishing set of variations — until the mystical final few minutes. Then the music splits apart: The theme is played delicately in the piano’s high range, hovering over oscillating riffs below. And in the middle is a continuous, softly shimmering trill. This dreamy chapter of Messiaen’s cycle “20 Ways of Looking at the Child Jesus” begins with a spacious, serene berceuse. But once the lullaby gives way to sleep, it turns into something more fluid. There’s a passionate, dissonant climax, and then a sublimely mystical return of the berceuse at the end. This next piece shows how simply — and how quickly — one piano can conjure a vivid scene. The opening is just a single note, played 16 times at a crescendo, like an image coming into focus. Then, with a cleverly chugging rhythm, Meredith Monk evokes a train passing, over an ostinato base as consistent as evenly spaced railroad ties. With its aching harmonies and seamless blend of Latin rhythms, ragtime, Romantic flourish and ineffable nostalgia, this is one of those rare pieces whose emotional impact can withstand familiarity; it gets me every time. Fast-forwarding to the end does feel like cheating — kind of like skipping to the tarmac scene of “Casablanca” — but why postpone heartbreak? This piece depicts the ruins of an abandoned city in India. It wanders from idea to seemingly unrelated idea — frequently zooming in to examine a curious object, otherwise taking in the whole uncanny picture. These shifts in perspective are articulated through restless change in register (how high or low the music is), compass (the distance between the hands), and harmony. One gains a sense of a vast, deserted space, beautiful but also a bit threatening, illuminated by cold light. When I was 9 years old, my father returned from the Taipei flea market carrying a turntable and a large stack of records. He played them incessantly. What especially sticks in my memory is Arthur Rubinstein’s recording of the Chopin mazurkas. There are no words to describe this one’s haunting beauty, expressive sophistication and provocative harmonies. It is among a handful of works that made me become a musician. An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of a pianist. He was Moritz Moszkowski, not Moszkowsk.",The New York Times
2019,5 Questions All Cat or Dog Owners Should Ask Their Vets,"Bring this list of questions to ask your vet at your next appointment. Ms. Wells is a staff writer at Wirecutter, a product recommendation site owned by The New York Times Company. Whether you’re a lifelong pet owner or a first-time adopter, a trip to a rowdy and crowded vet’s office can be a frazzling experience. I was once so distracted by my dog Sutton’s incessant licking of her lips, an indicator of stress, that I forgot all about my mental checklist of questions until after the appointment ended. If your attention is easily diverted by your pet’s antics or you get nervous around doctors, make a plan. To ensure history doesn’t repeat itself, I now save my questions, along with my pet’s medical history and dietary notes or troubling symptoms, to my phone ahead of every visit. Dr. Leni Kaplan, a clinician and lecturer with Cornell’s Small Animal Community Practice, said in an email interview that owners shouldn’t feel embarrassed by coming in with a list of questions. “Veterinarians have pets, too, and have often faced the exact challenges our clients face,” she said. “The more questions we can answer, the more successful owners and veterinarians will be in delivering the best care possible.” Here’s what both novice and experienced pet owners should always ask their vet at their next wellness exam. Browsing the scores of pet food options on a store’s shelves — each one enticing you with images of real ingredients and happy-go-lucky pets, and labeled with marketing buzzwords such as “handcrafted” or “grain-free” — can be overwhelming. Your vet can steer you toward the food that’s ideal for your pet’s age, breed, size and activity level. “Veterinarians can and should offer advice on feeding, not the high school kid at the food store,” said Dr. Karen Louis, a veterinarian and owner of Metro East Vet in Belleville, Illinois. “Some pet food companies have hired marketing teams that are positively brilliant at confusing pet owners.” My dog Sutton’s four-legged sister is a fluffy Maine-coon mix named Tanzie. For a time I attributed Tanzie’s robust appearance to her thick coat — until the day a friend called her “fat.” Even though I couldn’t see the chonk, my vet later confirmed my cat was indeed overweight. “It can be difficult to assess a pet’s weight if they are fluffy and even harder to notice changes in weight when we see our pets every day,” said Dr. Karen Fine, a veterinarian with Central Animal Hospital in Leominster, Massachusetts. No kidding. A 2018 clinical survey by the Association for Pet Obesity Prevention reported that 55.8 percent of dogs and 59.5 percent of cats are overweight or obese. Among all pet owners surveyed, 68 percent said they wanted their vet to recommend a routine or maintenance diet for their pet. Dr. Fine added that weight gain can put pets at risk for diabetes and heart disease (not to mention shorten their lifespans, according to a study in the Journal of Veterinary Internal Medicine). Being underweight, in contrast, may point to a parasitic infection or chronic illness. So ask your vet about what the changes in your pet’s weight mean and, if necessary, the best way to get things back on track. Exercise helps people bond with their pets, aids in the pets’ weight loss and curbs behavioral issues such as furniture scratching or trash rummaging. Although all pets need daily exercise, professionals agree the amount varies by a pet’s age, breed and medical history. Puppies that get short bursts of energy throughout the day, known as “the zoomies,” need several daily play sessions or short walks to tucker them out, which is safer than one long session on their growing bodies. Samantha Aline Pierre, a licensed veterinary technician with Blue Pearl Veterinary Partners, said that “large breed dogs, living in the city, should be walked two to three times a day” in addition to engaging in regular play. But sedentary adult dogs such as Chihuahuas and Great Danes may need less physical and mental stimulation. And short-nosed dogs such as bulldogs have respiratory issues that make exercise difficult. Most indoor cats need about 30 minutes of play a day, divided into two sessions. Pierre favors cat-sized hamster wheels, although any exercise tool will do. Fishing-pole toys with feathers, crinkle balls and puzzle feeders should do the trick if your cat isn’t trained to leash-walk. (Wirecutter, the product review site owned by The New York Times Company, has recommendations for dog-walking harnesses, leashes and cat-enrichment toys.) A veterinarian can offer an exercise regimen appropriate for your pet, as well as warning signs of overexertion so you know when it’s time for a cool-down. They may also refer you to an accredited animal behaviorist or trainer for further insights into your pet’s ideal activity level and how to manage behavioral issues. Pets are adept at hiding their pain, so some owners may overlook dental care until symptoms become unavoidable. Stinky breath, rotting teeth or loss of appetite can mean periodontal disease, or worse, an infection in the heart, known as endocarditis. Your pet’s doctor will check for early signs of infection at an annual wellness exam and propose a revised treatment plan. “Similar to people, dogs and cats develop periodontal disease if their teeth are not brushed daily and oral health is not maintained,” Dr. Kaplan said. Pet owners trust professionals to guide them on what’s needed to keep pets happy and healthy. Yet the recommendations aren’t always affordable. Last year the American Pet Products Association reported that the average routine vet visit cost $182 for cats and $257 for dogs — and that surgical visits cost almost double. The best veterinary clinics are up front about the costs of treatments they recommend as well as the associated benefits and risks. If the quoted fees turn your face pale, tell your vet about your budget so you can agree on a cost-effective treatment plan that won’t compromise your pet’s well-being. If you have pet insurance that you’d like to use to offset some of the costs, keep in mind you’ll need a detailed receipt to submit to your plan for reimbursement — only a few insurers link up with clinics directly to share billing and payment info. (Wirecutter recommends Trupanion’s plan for most cats and dogs.) “Veterinarians are trained to offer the best, but not every owner can afford the ‘Cadillac treatment,’” Dr. Louis said. “If something doesn’t make sense on the estimate, ask. Many times the ‘Honda Civic treatment’ works fine.” Before you get to your questions, expect your vet to ask about your pet’s diet, behavioral changes and prescriptions, such as anxiety meds or pest preventives. To ensure you don’t forget anything, jot down the food and medication names, feeding frequencies and dosages. Documenting your pet’s routine and any questions you have ahead of time ensures that you won’t get rattled by your pet’s nervous behavior at the clinic. “Since our pets can’t talk, it’s up to us to give the vet as much information as possible,” said Kim Crawford, the president of Friends with Four Paws, an Oklahoma-based animal rescue group. “You are the voice for your pet; don’t settle. Your pet’s health and well-being are in your hands.” Sign up for the Wirecutter Weekly Newsletter and get our latest recommendations every Sunday.

2019,5 Questions That Will Determine if Joe Biden Can Succeed,"WILMINGTON, Del. — Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s entry Thursday into the sprawling Democratic primary has immediately reshaped the race, giving definition to a contest that has been defined mostly by uncertainty. Mr. Biden offers voters a household name, nearly a half-century of political experience and the implied promise of restoring the country to a less polarized, pre-Trump era. But perhaps more than any other presidential front-runner in modern history, he begins his bid confronting deep skepticism from friend and foe alike that he can capture his party’s nomination. [Sign up for our politics newsletter and join our conversation about the 2020 presidential race.] Here are five questions looming over Mr. Biden’s candidacy, the answers to which could determine whether he becomes America’s 46th president or concludes his career by losing his third bid for the White House. Most casual voters, even in the primary, know Mr. Biden as President Barack Obama’s vice president. But he was a senator from Delaware for 36 years before he entered the West Wing, and his record from a decidedly earlier day in Democratic politics is where his rivals for the nomination will focus their fire. He opposed busing to integrate schools, wrote a hard-line criminal justice bill and supported the Iraq War. Most immediately, Mr. Biden will have to decide how to respond to new critical comments by Anita Hill, the law professor who in 1991 accused Justice Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment. Mr. Biden recently called her, according to an aide, to express regrets that he did not do more for her when he presided over her appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee. But she told The New York Times that the call left her deeply unsatisfied, and that she did not consider it an apology. She said she is not convinced that Mr. Biden truly accepts the harm he caused her and other women. It remains unclear what his broader strategy will be for handling scrutiny from the press and bombardments from his Democratic opponents along with a legion of left-wing critics who want to defeat his candidacy and ward off any return to a more moderate brand of liberalism. Mr. Biden’s supporters hope Mr. Obama offers him something of a halo. Many in Mr. Biden’s orbit hope that rather than litigate every criticism about his Senate record, he restrains himself and focuses on his partnership with the country’s first black president. The message from Mr. Biden’s announcement video was urgent and unmistakable: President Trump’s tenure amounts to a national emergency and defeating him is essential to America’s survival. Framing the campaign this way does not just make 2020 a referendum on the president, it also offers Mr. Biden a rationale for why Democrats should put forward a septuagenarian in the winter of his political life. This is not, he is arguing, yet another nomination clash in one more presidential campaign. [Check out our tracker of the 2020 Democratic candidate field.] But so far, it has sure seemed that way. Even the candidates who believe that Mr. Trump should be impeached are not eager to discuss the president or why he should be removed from office. The race has mostly focused on their policy ideas, biographies and how to accommodate a party drifting left. Before Mr. Biden’s announcement, the campaign was animated this week by a debate over whether prisoners should be allowed to vote. Many Democratic strategists believe that Mr. Biden should resist tangling with his intraparty rivals and avoid the temptation to prove that he is just as progressive as they are. “Don’t let the agenda stray from the argument that he can deliver us from Trump,” said Paul Begala, the former Bill Clinton adviser. But when Mr. Biden appears before reporters and voters upon arriving in Iowa next week, that may prove easier said than done. Never known for his discipline, the former vice president is entering a media environment unlike that in his first two presidential campaigns; now his every misstep will immediately pinball across the internet. And he is stepping into a race filled with 19 other candidates who could lift their profiles by baiting the front-runner into a back-and-forth that would quickly erase memories of Mr. Biden’s high-minded call to arms. Mr. Biden this month played down his party’s leftward turn, pointing out the success of moderates in last year’s midterm elections and telling reporters he was a proud “Obama-Biden Democrat.” But less clear is what exactly that means in 2019. Mr. Biden has not sketched out any vision on health care, criminal justice, education or the environment. He has said he has the most progressive record of any candidate, but then amended that to indicate he was alluding to his stances on social issues like L.G.B.T. rights. [Here’s a look at what Mr. Biden has said about some key issues.] Mr. Biden may be too tenuous a front-runner to alienate any of his party’s core constituencies, but he could risk just as much by portraying himself as anything besides a mainstream liberal. He faces few more important tasks than finding that balance: reflecting the party for what it is today without attempting a cringe-inducing reinvention of what he likes to call his “brand.” Mr. Biden’s announcement video was about one big promise to voters: He would eject Mr. Trump from office and lead a country that they could be proud of. Asked by a reporter outside a pizzeria in Wilmington, Del., on Thursday afternoon about his message for the rest of the world, he said “America is coming back” and said his administration would be “ethical, straight, telling the truth.” But the traditional American values Mr. Biden extolled may only go so far in inspiring voters, both in a primary and a general election. Some of his Democratic competitors already have well-developed signature proposals that have helped to define their candidacies, like Senator Bernie Sanders’s Medicare for All Act, Senator Elizabeth Warren’s plan to forgive student loans and Senator Cory Booker’s “baby bonds” program. Mr. Biden has nothing comparable, at least so far. Mr. Biden may start to fill in this blank space on Monday, when he is to visit a Pittsburgh union hall and speak about the middle class and the economy. But it is unclear whether he will be inclined to develop sweeping policy plans, or whether he will stay close to his roots as a moderate who favors political compromise and incremental change. The risk to Mr. Biden, if he takes too long to define his vision for the future, is that he might come to be seen mainly as a figure of nostalgia — a candidate of the past. So far, the most important fund-raising in the Democratic race has happened online. And several of the most prominent candidates, including Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren, are fueling their campaigns almost exclusively that way. Mr. Biden’s approach will be different, and far more reliant on the largess of the wealthiest benefactors of the Democratic Party. His aides have already spent more than a week encouraging donors to send $2,800 checks — the maximum sum allowed — to his primary-campaign-in-waiting, and a Comcast executive who oversees the company’s lobbying division was hosting a major fund-raiser for Mr. Biden in Philadelphia on Thursday night. The financial challenges for Mr. Biden are twofold. He must raise an immense amount of money rapidly, without the benefit of a robust online fund-raising machine of the kind some of his rivals possess. And Mr. Biden must raise that amount without stoking suspicions among Democratic primary voters that he is compromised by his dependency on big money. [Mr. Biden started his campaign with $0, when other candidates had already collected millions.] The latter danger — that “Middle-Class Joe,” as he styles himself, could come to be seen as a candidate of rich people and corporations — may be especially vexing to Mr. Biden because his record on banking and corporate regulation has already drawn sharp criticism from the left. Yet, without having spent years cultivating an online donor base, and lacking the novelty factor that has helped other candidates soak the internet, Mr. Biden appears to see little alternative to seeking out the biggest checks possible. An earlier version of this article misstated the number of Democratic candidates in the race. There are 20, not 19.",The New York Times
2019,5 Things We Learned About Beyoncé’s Coachella Triumph in ‘Homecoming’,"Early Wednesday morning, Netflix began streaming “Homecoming,” a 137-minute documentary and concert film detailing Beyoncé’s headlining set at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in 2018. Her elaborate performance — complete with 64 credited musicians, a phalanx of dancers and pyrotechnics both real and figurative — was an instant sensation when she unveiled it in the desert, and it streamed live online, last April. [Beyoncé’s “Homecoming” came with a surprise: a live album.] Beyoncé’s show brought more than a century of black musical traditions to America’s biggest music festival, with quotations and techniques joining her hits with Houston’s slowed-down screw music, Washington, D.C.’s percussive go-go rhythms, New Orleans’ brass bands and bounce artists, the Nigerian Afrobeat of Fela Kuti, the Jamaican dancehall of Sister Nancy, the Atlanta crunk of Pastor Troy, and even a moment for “Lift Every Voice and Sing,” the early 1900s hymn long called the black national anthem. “Homecoming” includes brief vignettes exploring the monthslong run-up to the most celebrated concert of the internet age. Here’s what we learned. [Read our review of the Beyoncé Coachella doc “Homecoming.”] The show’s theme of homecoming at historically black colleges and universities (known as H.B.C.U.s) was inspired by personal experience. Though Beyoncé did not attend college, the Houston native explained that she would visit Prairie View A&M University, rehearse at Texas Southern University and “always dreamed of going to an H.B.C.U.” Her father, Mathew Knowles, went to Fisk University in Nashville. “I wanted it to feel the way I felt when I went to [the H.B.C.U. marching band showcase] Battle of the Bands,” Beyoncé explains of the Coachella set, “because I grew up seeing those shows and that being the highlight of my year.” Her difficult 2017 pregnancy was more harrowing than we knew. Though Beyoncé has talked about battling pre-eclampsia while pregnant with twins Rumi and Sir Carter, she reveals that one of the babies’ heartbeats “paused a few times,” necessitating an emergency C-section. Balancing being a mother and a superstar was not easy. Beyoncé has said she was 218 pounds the day she gave birth to her twins in the summer of 2017. In the documentary, she details a pre-Coachella diet that cut out bread, carbs, sugar, dairy, meat and alcohol — she lets out an exhausted sigh and adds that she’s hungry. “There were days that I thought, you know, I’d never be the same. I’d never be the same physically, my strength and endurance would never be the same,” she says. “In the beginning it was so many muscle spasms. Just, internally, my body was not connected. My mind was not there. My mind wanted to be with my children. What people don’t see is the sacrifice. I would dance, and go off to the trailer, and breast-feed the babies, and the days I could, I would bring the children.” If you couldn’t have guessed, this is Beyoncé’s show. “I personally selected each dancer, every light, the material on the steps, the height of the pyramid, the shape of the pyramid,” she says in the film. “Every tiny detail had an intention.” (This is also what her Coachella choreographers told us.) There’s more music beyond the massive performance. Inside the doc, Beyoncé’s daughter Blue Ivy Carter, 5 or 6 at the time, provides an a cappella version of “Lift Every Voice and Sing.” Also, in one more nod to the rich musical history explored in “Homecoming,” the end credits feature a new Beyoncé cover of “Before I Let Go,” the 1981 R&B hit by Maze featuring Frankie Beverly. And when the film was released early Wednesday morning, it came with a surprise: a live album capturing the festival set.",The New York Times
2019,50 Years After Altamont: The End of the 1960s,"lens A reluctant rock concert attendee, Bill Owens nevertheless photographed the disastrous 1969 music festival Altamont and the close of an era. A half-century ago, 1969 capped a radical, idealistic decade that saw the rise of the hippie generation and the assassinations of John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Woodstock, perhaps the most famous concert ever, happened that summer, with free love and drugs serving as backdrops to sets by Jimi Hendrix, Santana, Richie Havens and others. But another large, raucous rock festival that year became notorious for very different reasons: Altamont. That December, the Rolling Stones and the Grateful Dead organized an impromptu concert at Altamont Speedway, in the golden hills of Northern California’s East Bay, that drew an estimated 300,000 people. Four people died, including a man who was killed by members of the Hells Angels who had been hired to provide “security” for the event. So much for peace and love. The concert was featured in the documentary film “Gimme Shelter,” and a few photojournalists captured the experience. Among them was Bill Owens, who would soon rise to photographic fame for his seminal early 1970s project “Suburbia,” which cheekily documented the rise of the suburbs in California. In December 1969, he was working as a photographer for The Independent, a newspaper in nearby Livermore, Calif., when his friend Beth Bagby and her boyfriend, Robert, who worked for The Associated Press, called to see if he wanted to shoot the concert. His editors gave him the day off as long as he let them publish a photo of the gathering. “The concert was going to be on a Saturday morning,” he recalled. “For some reason I had a motorcycle, probably because it was $85. So I drove my motorcycle out, and I went on the back roads. People were abandoning their cars, so pretty soon I had to ditch the motorcycle, because there was a barbed-wire fence there, and I couldn’t take it up this hill.” He got there early with two cameras, three lenses, film and a jar of water. He climbed up the sound tower to get a bird’s-eye view, which gave him a sense of the concert’s sprawling scale. Several hours later, a Hells Angels biker climbed the tower and threatened to bash his head with a pipe wrench and toss him off the tower if he didn’t come down. Since he’d used up all his film by then, Mr. Owens happily obliged and slowly made his way back to his motorcycle to go home. As he later wrote: “People fighting on sound towers only happens in the movies, and the good guy wins. Reality is different.” Mr. Owens didn’t even like rock concerts as he was a few years older than the hippies surrounding him, and he wasn’t interested in “dope.” He just wanted to go home to his family, put on the TV and watch Walter Cronkite. Ms. Bagby stayed into the night, and photographed a Hells Angels member stabbing an African-American man, Meredith Hunter, near the stage as the Stones played. Mr. Owens didn’t know anything had gone horribly wrong until the following day. In addition to pictures of Mick Jagger making his way through the crowd, and Jefferson Airplane and Santana on stage, Mr. Owens managed to capture images of the Hells Angels beating people with pool cues, and feared his family might be at risk. Not taking any chances, he published his images under a pseudonym. “When the images appeared in Rolling Stone and Esquire all over the world, I had two or three different aliases on different images,” he said. “I would not publish my name, because my name is in the phone book, and I don’t want anybody associated with the Hells Angels to come looking for me and shoot me thinking I was the one who shot the photographs of the guy being murdered. “I’ve got a wife and a kid, and a second kid coming along. You want to be watching TV in the night time. You don’t want to be sitting there with a gun trying to protect yourself. I don’t want anything to do with that culture.” After the images were published, Mr. Owens and Ms. Bagby lent their negatives to a young couple who planned to include them in a book, but their house was burglarized and the thieves took all the negatives. Mr. Owens blames the Hells Angels, who he suspects weren’t interested in evidence remaining at large. The few pictures that survived have been collected in a new photo book, “Altamont 1969,” that was recently published in Italy by Damiani Books. It’s a fascinating collection of photographs, in addition to being an important document of a turbulent chapter in American cultural history. It’s also a surprising series to those who know Mr. Owens for his funny, warmhearted projects from the 1970s, and perhaps also to those who know him only as one of the founders of the craft beer brewing and craft distilling movements in the United States. Mr. Owens also served in the Peace Corps and took a hitchhiking trip around the world. The Altamont project, which relied so heavily on being present at a particular moment, seems an outlier compared to the rest of his work. In 1978, he published a manual about how to become a documentary photographer, in which he wrote: “Each year prizes are given to photographers who were at the right disaster at the right time: a shot of someone falling to his death, or better yet, a photograph of someone holding a gun on a hostage, and being blasted at by the cops. My photographs of violence are not a source of personal pride.” But at 80, having lived a rich and varied life, Bill Owens is thrilled the book will be a part of the cultural conversation. And he’s glad it’s happening now. “I know now, at age 80, God can take you,” he said. “Within three months, I can go. A lot of people have gone already. I read the obits. When you’re ready, something can be cooking inside of you, and you’re gone, and I’ve got this legacy to take care of.” Follow @nytimesphoto and @jblauphoto on Twitter.
