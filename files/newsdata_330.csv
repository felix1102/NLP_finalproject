2020,Highlights From the Final Day Before Voting,"MANCHESTER — Amy Klobuchar, sounding only slightly hoarse at her fifth rally of the day, at a bar in downtown Manchester, told voters she was in the process of firing up her campaign operation in the coming Nevada caucuses — “and beyond,” she added. More than any other major candidate, Ms. Klobuchar will have to expand her organization in Nevada in a tightly compressed time frame before the Feb. 22 caucuses. She has focused overwhelmingly so far on Iowa and New Hampshire, and for most of the race has faced significant financial constraints. But a Klobuchar aide said on Monday that the campaign was shifting staff members out of Iowa and into Nevada, and Ms. Klobuchar appears to be in a stronger financial position after a post-debate infusion of online cash. “We’re so excited about tomorrow night and then to Nevada, where we’re building a big operation,” Ms. Klobuchar said. She went on to repeat a plea she has offered over the last few days, telling New Hampshire voters “this is a big deal for me here” and crediting the state with having vaulted relatively unknown or underfunded candidates into national contention in the past. Without strong finishes in both New Hampshire and Nevada — and perhaps even with them — it could be exceedingly difficult for Ms. Klobuchar to compete across the enormous Super Tuesday map in early March. But the mere fact that Ms. Klobuchar is confidently turning her attention west represents a real shift from just last week, when her fifth-place finish in Iowa seemed unlikely, on its own, to change the trajectory of her campaign. Without the intervening debate, Ms. Klobuchar could well have been headed for another likely fifth-place finish, leaving her future as a candidate in serious doubt.",The New York Times
2020,Tracy Letts Can’t Fight With His Playwright,"Spring Preview That’s because he is the playwright, and the star, of “The Minutes,” a breakneck comedy about political blood sport in a small town. Credit...Lyndon French for The New York Times CHICAGO — On a freezing cold February day, in an over-lit rehearsal room, in the run-up to yet another referendum on the state of our nation and democracy, Tracy Letts was chanting and pounding his chest. This should surprise no one, really. Letts, 54, made his name a quarter-century ago with a pair of plays — “Bug” and “Killer Joe” — that involved no small amount of macho posturing, almost always to disastrous effect for the characters involved. But the cause of Letts’s current exhortations had little to do with sex, guns and drugs, and more to do with the other blood sport that has overtaken our national psyche: politics. His newest play, “The Minutes,” is a dark comedy, set at a City Council meeting in a small town called Big Cherry, a Peyton Place riven by vicious rivalries, petty parking concerns and a community secret or two. And while the temptation is to see the play as a parable for our current political divisions — see all that chanting and chest pounding — Letts says “The Minutes” wasn’t meant to be a condemnation of President Trump, or any particular politician. Rather, it’s an examination of how we make myths about ourselves as a society and how that informs how we treat one another. “If you are going to talk about politics, or the way we behave socially, and you’re going to talk about this country, in a basic or elemental way, you have to visit how we made it, how we got here, and the resistance to visiting that, both now and forever,” he said after a recent rehearsal at the Steppenwolf Theater Company, where the play premiered in 2017. “And that’s one of the things that really drove me to complete the play.” How he ended up acting in the play, mind you, is a different story: “The Minutes” is the first time Letts has appeared in a play of his own, let alone one on Broadway, where the production opens on March 15 at the Cort Theater. Cast by the director Anna D. Shapiro as a replacement for the former “CSI” star and fellow Steppenwolf member William Petersen, Letts portrays the patient, pragmatic and problematic Mayor Superba, a character who rarely leaves the stage for 90 minutes. But Tracy Letts, playwright, says Tracy Letts, actor, was not his first choice. “I didn’t want to do it,” he said, noting that Petersen was “terrific” in the 2017 premiere, but was unavailable for the Broadway run. But as Shapiro and the play’s commercial producers mulled New York, many of the bankable male actors they considered didn’t “necessarily understand the joys of ensemble theater,” Letts said, noting that Superba shares the stage with an assortment of council members, adorned with similarly Dickensian names like Oldfield, Assalone, and Carp. (He says he stole the Superba name from a refrigerator.) “You go through a few of those people and then you go, the hell with it, I’ll do it,” Letts said. So it is that Letts — who won a Tony Award in 2013 for his take as George in “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” — has been stumbling his way through rehearsals as an actor and then stumbling home to do rewrites as a playwright, trying to tweak the script while also cursing the writer. “If I’d known that I was going to wind up doing it I wouldn’t have given him so many goddamn lines,” Letts said of Superba. Letts’s fatigue, of course, has more to do than with just his performance: his son, Haskell, will turn 2 just days before Letts opens on Broadway, and just as his wife and Haskell’s mother, the actress Carrie Coon, finishes a revival of “Bug,” his 1996 creepy-crawly conspiracy comedy, at Steppenwolf. The opening of “The Minutes” and the closing of “Bug” are scheduled for the same day, and Letts, a first-time father at 52, describes his family’s current chaos — toddler, rehearsal, performance, repeat — like “planning the battle of Midway everyday.” Indeed, Coon, who fell in love with Letts as she played Honey in “Virginia Woolf,” says the current grind is so intense that Letts is threatening to retire, something she teases him about. “He says he wants to be a stay-at-home dad,” said Coon, 39. “I’m like, ‘Why don’t you give that a try for a couple of weeks and see how that feels?’” “The Minutes” also comes to Broadway — with a cast that includes Blair Brown, Jessie Mueller, Austin Pendleton and Armie Hammer — just as Letts is coming off a streak of screen performances, often playing stuffy, if lovable, middle-aged men: Henry Ford II (blustering and blubbering his way through “Ford v Ferrari”), and the impressively mutton-chopped editor in Greta Gerwig’s “Little Women.” (He said he specifically asked the director for such showy facial hair. ) He also took a sweeter turn as the title character’s father in Gerwig’s “Lady Bird,” after playing an ambitious United States senator in Showtime’s “Homeland,” a role that leads us back to “The Minutes.” In some ways, it seems fated that Letts would write a play infused by politics: He is a man, after all, who frequently uses the word “congress” as a verb. He is a die-hard liberal who hails from Oklahoma, one of the nation’s most conservative states. He was born on the Fourth of July. But Letts insists the idea for the “The Minutes” came well before Trump’s election, as he watched the national rancor build leading up to the 2016 campaign. As time has passed, however, the script has seemingly taken on meaning, said Shapiro, who serves as artistic director of the Steppenwolf. “Quite frankly, when I did it before I thought the world was as bad as it could get; and now, the situation is far more precarious,” Shapiro said, adding, the play was now “less abut a bad place that’s been bad for awhile, and more about the moment that a community, and a culture, turns.” Letts echoes this. “It might have been a little weird when I wrote it,” he said, “but it seems less and less weird with each passing day.” “The Minutes” came during a period of creative ferment for Letts, during which he wrote “Mary Page Marlowe,” a play inspired in part by his mother, the novelist Billie Letts, who died in 2014, and “Linda Vista,” which he said was inspired by some friends and fellow 50-somethings, “good fellows who have made some mistakes.” (He also finished an unproduced play, “The Scavenger’s Daughter,” which he said was too big and peculiar to get a showing.) Letts, who has been sober for nearly three decades, says he has no explanation for the last decade’s prolific spurt of writing. “They just kind of tumbled out,” he said. Each recent production has seemingly moved Letts — who won a Pulitzer Prize in 2008 for the epic family drama “August: Osage County” — further away from his earlier reputation as enfant terrible, which he says was always overstated anyway. “I’m pretty happy,"" he said. “I got no reason not to be.” That said, there is still a wee bit of the outcast vibe in Letts, who seems to prefer black-on-black garb, blocky glasses and dark boots. Now gray and slimmed down, he grew up an “awkward smart aleck,” in Durant, Okla., the son of a pair of professors at Southeastern Oklahoma State University. His father, Dennis, was also an actor — Letts’s first performance came as a 15-year-old alongside his dad in a production of Howard Teichmann’s “Solid Gold Cadillac.” “I did this play and people were nice to me,” Letts said, adding “it had that social element that I wanted to repeat.” Steppenwolf, with its ensemble company, had a similar vibe. “There isn’t a star system here,” he said. Nonetheless, Letts has become one of the bigger names and most steady producers at the company, which includes John Malkovich, Gary Sinise and Laurie Metcalf, who earned an Oscar nomination, playing opposite him in “Lady Bird.” Oklahoma provided the backdrop for “August,” which remains one of Letts’s proudest accomplishments — a Tony for best play, in addition to the Pulitzer — and one of his most bittersweet, given that his father died during its Broadway run, his mother a few years later. Both are often on Letts’s mind, particular as he and his wife raise Haskell, a blond, rhubarb-cheeked cherub currently sporting the same wispy-on-top hairstyle as his old man. They live in an elegant, modern home in the Bucktown neighborhood of Chicago, decorated with vintage movie posters and Mort Kunstler prints. Letts writes in a second-floor office piled with old newspapers he swears he’s going to read. His process is a technophile’s nightmare: pounding out words on an old IBM Selectric, before transferring scripts to a file on a laptop, which he then prints off the computer before … deleting the file, something he says sometimes forces him to retype — and rewrite — as he goes. The basement of the home contains what Letts jokingly calls his “sickness”— a stash of 5,000 or so films on DVD, arranged alphabetically, by director’s name, secreted on shelves behind a row of curtains. His parents liked jazz — Weather Report, Yusef Lateef — and Miles Davis was on the turntable on a recent visit. There were also plenty of kids’ books, and his son was happily baby-talking through “Charley Parker Played Be Bop,” and “Little Humans.” “Little humans can put on a show,” the little boy said, repeating a line in the book. His father beamed.",The New York Times
2020,Translating for Bong Joon Ho at the Oscars: Aspiring Director Sharon Choi,"Choi, who interpreted for the “Parasite” director and others involved with the film, has become a familiar face throughout awards season. Bong Joon Ho was onstage a lot on Sunday night, giving one acceptance speech after another as his film “Parasite” scooped up Oscars, including best picture. Beside him each time was a familiar face. Sharon Choi, a filmmaker herself, is the interpreter who has followed Bong and the “Parasite” team throughout their successful awards season. She has given the English translation of the director’s (many) speeches and interviews, through several red carpets and late-night TV appearances. (Bong speaks English and will occasionally shift into the language for brief remarks — “I’m ready to drink tonight,” he said toward the end of one of Sunday’s speeches — but he generally seems to prefer leaving it to Choi.) At the Oscars, Choi joined Bong onstage four times: as he accepted the awards for best director, original screenplay and international feature, and to interpret for Kwak Sin Ae, a producer, in her speech for the film’s best picture win. Choi has been at Bong’s side since May — when “Parasite” won the Palme d’Or, the top prize at the Cannes Film Festival — according to The Korea Herald, an English language newspaper in South Korea. For someone who’s appeared on several awards stages and live television broadcasts, though, Choi doesn’t seem to cherish being in the spotlight — “This is so embarrassing,” she said in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter at the Golden Globes last month when the questions pivoted to her. But Choi has ended up there anyway, thanks to the visibility that comes with critical success and awards domination: “Parasite,” after winning at Cannes, also nabbed best foreign film at the Golden Globes, the Writers Guild Award for original screenplay and best ensemble at the Screen Actors Guild Awards. Bong has another explanation: “She’s perfect, and we all depend on her,” he said in English in The Hollywood Reporter interview. “And she’s also a great filmmaker,” he added. (Choi laughed: “Yes, I want to direct.”) When she’s interpreting — usually on camera, or to crowds of Hollywood royalty, or both — Choi’s voice never seems to waver. (Apparently, she hides her nerves well: “I’m always super anxious,” she said in The Hollywood Reporter interview last month.) Choi’s calm presence under the onstage pressure has caught the attention of online admirers, too. “I know she has a huge fandom,” Bong said in English on Sunday in a red carpet interview with E!. He continued in Korean. “It’s very embarrassing to translate,” Choi said, “but he said that thanks to me, this campaign has been a smooth journey.”",The New York Times
2020,Trapped on a Cruise Ship by the Coronavirus: When Is Breakfast?,"INSIDE THE OUTBREAK A two-week quarantine has left Masako Ishida and hundreds of others dealing with inconveniences and trying to figure out how to pass the time. Get an informed guide to the global outbreak with our daily Coronavirus
 newsletter.
 TOKYO — Hidden away in her cabin, Masako Ishida reckons she doesn’t face much risk from the coronavirus that has stalked her cruise ship, forcing an onboard quarantine of 3,700 passengers and crew members in the port city of Yokohama. Ms. Ishida, 61, is trying to see the bright side as she faces two long weeks stuck inside the ship. She has a window to gaze out of, unlike some passengers. She, like her two traveling companions — her husband and her mother, both in their 80s — is healthy and not in need of any medications. By no means, though, is this going to be easy. After the virus struck, confusion came quickly. Ms. Ishida said she first learned that her two-week cruise might be extended not from the crew, but from an article she read online on Monday. That report said a man from Hong Kong who had disembarked from the ship, the Diamond Princess, in his home city on Jan. 25 had tested positive for the virus. When she asked some crew members about it, they confirmed the news, she said. But it took a while for other passengers to learn that they might have been exposed to the virus, which has killed hundreds in China. “There wasn’t much information,” Ms. Ishida said from the ship on Wednesday during a call via Facebook. Updated Feb. 26, 2020 The Diamond Princess, which has 13 decks and in normal times offers entertainment like movies under the stars and live musical productions, arrived in Yokohama on Monday night and stayed at anchor for two days while the authorities decided what to do. Japanese health workers have begun screening 273 people who displayed symptoms or came into contact with the infected man. So far, 20 of them, including passengers from Japan, Hong Kong, Australia and the United States, have been found to be infected. They were being taken to hospitals. All 3,700 people on board received an initial health screening. Ms. Ishida said the authorities who performed it didn’t seem to take it very seriously. When they first took her husband’s temperature, she said, the reading was 32 degrees Celsius, or 89.6 degrees Fahrenheit, well below a normal temperature of 98.6. Ms. Ishida asked them to retake it. The second reading was 35 degrees Celsius, or 95 Fahrenheit. “They didn’t put the thermometer into our ears properly,” Ms. Ishida said. She has also felt the chaos of the sudden quarantine at mealtimes. Breakfast, delivered by staff members in goggles and masks, didn’t arrive until almost 2 p.m. Then lunch came right on its heels. Nevertheless, the crew members are “serving guests with a smile,” Ms. Ishida said. “That’s giving us some peace of mind.” The ship is steaming back out to sea so it can empty its bilge and supplement its water supplies, its owner, Princess Cruises, said on its website. It will return to port on Thursday to take on food and other supplies as it carries on with the two-week quarantine, which covers the incubation period of the coronavirus. Ms. Ishida and her family enjoy cruises and had been especially looking forward to relaxing aboard the Diamond Princess as it wended its way from Yokohama to Kagoshima, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Taiwan and Okinawa. Now, instead of taking a dip in the freshwater pools or going on a “Chocolate Journey,” Ms. Ishida and her family are whiling away their time playing games on their tablets, reading, watching movies and speaking to family and friends using the ship’s now-free Wi-Fi. Judging by social media, other passengers trapped on board have had more difficult moments. In a Facebook video, David Abel, a passenger from Britain, said on Wednesday morning that he was concerned about how the quarantine might affect his diabetes, saying that he had not eaten in many hours and was fearful that he could fall into a coma. The problem was resolved, he said, after staff members aboard the ship responded to a flood of emails expressing concern about his condition. Earlier that morning, he had been more optimistic. As an announcement about the quarantine came over a loudspeaker, Mr. Abel said that the passengers would be confined to their cabins and that he was looking forward to the free time. “Most of my day will be spent writing and researching and so on,” he said, adding, “What my bar bill is going to be, goodness only knows.” For Ms. Ishida, her biggest worry is about the toll that being stranded on board for such a long time will take on her family. Still, things could be worse. The last time she went on a cruise, she said, everyone caught the flu.",The New York Times

Source: NASA By The New York Times Remember that huge iceberg that broke off an ice shelf on the Antarctic Peninsula in 2017? It made headlines at the time because of its Delaware-ish size and trillion-ish ton weight. Since then the iceberg, now known as A68a following a naming convention established by the National Ice Center, has been drifting slowly northward in the Weddell Sea, along the eastern side of the peninsula. In two and a half years, A68a hasn’t been up to much. But recently it appears to have made some Antarctic tourists, including me, very happy. I was giving lectures aboard a cruise ship in mid-December that sailed from Ushuaia in southern Argentina to the peninsula. After stopping to see some chinstrap penguins in the South Shetland Islands near the peninsula’s northern tip, we sailed east through the Antarctic Sound into the Weddell Sea. Normally at that time of year the area is chockablock with sea ice, the result of a rotating current, or gyre, in the Weddell that keeps much of the ice contained within the sea. It can be a dangerous place: Sir Ernest Shackleton’s ship Endurance was crushed by ice in the Weddell in 1915, leading to one of the greatest survival stories in the history of exploration. But in mid-December our ship, L’Austral, encountered relatively little ice as we sailed into the sea and southward, toward James Ross Island, visiting an Adélie penguin colony at Devil Island along the way. The only chunks there were small and easy to navigate through. The captain and expedition crew were surprised at the conditions, and overjoyed at the opportunity to sail into the Weddell. The captain had only been in the sea once before and had not made it that far south. At the time, A68a, which is roughly 100 miles long by 30 miles wide, was centered about 50 miles southeast of the area we were sailing in, according to data from the National Ice Center. Could it have been blocking ice from the area? According to Jonathan R. Green, an adventure tour expedition leader, that’s precisely what A68a was doing. “We certainly saw it was having a damming effect,” said Mr. Green, who was aboard a ship, the G Expedition, that was in the same area a few days before ours. He and the ship’s captain had been studying satellite images and saw that there was an opportunity to get into the Weddell — and in his ship’s case, actually sail to the iceberg. “There was a two- or three-week window with little ice,” he said. Mr. Green said he believed the G Expedition was the first ship ever to see the iceberg. “It was indescribable,” he said. “From horizon to horizon all you could see was the line of this iceberg disappearing in both directions,” he said. The ship put out an inflatable boat and Mr. Green and others got within 100 yards of A68a, which, while 100 miles long, is only a few hundred yards thick. The low-ice conditions ended later in December, when, according to Mr. Green, high winds drove A68a farther north, freeing up the ice jam. A passenger on a cruise ship that tried to get into the Weddell during the last week of December reported that the route was impenetrable because of ice. Adrian Luckman, a glaciologist at Swansea University in Wales who tracks A68a, said the iceberg probably affected sea ice movement in the Weddell. “But the ice cover is quite variable from year to year, so it is not the most important factor,” he said. Since December, A68a has continued moving north, and is approaching the edge of the perennial Antarctic ice pack, Dr. Luckman said. That should make it more susceptible to being broken up by wave action in the Southern Ocean. As for L’Austral, our captain was interested in sailing farther east to see A68a, but it was decided it would take too long. We had more penguins — and seals, seabirds and other creatures — to see on the peninsula’s western side. There were plenty of icebergs over there as well, just none anywhere near the size of A68a. If you’re paying any kind of attention at all to the presidential campaign or state politics or international politics, you most likely hear politicians talking about achieving “100 percent clean energy” within 20 to 30 years. What you probably don’t hear is that, at the moment, having renewables may also mean having at least a little bit of fossil fuels. If that sounds counterintuitive to you, you’re probably not alone. But think about it: sunlight and wind are not constant, and we like our electricity to be continuous. So, at night or when it’s calm, those solar panels and wind turbines can’t be used to generate electricity — we need something else to provide as much electricity as we use or might need. This is what grid operators and utilities call “balancing the grid.” At the moment, generators or maybe even power plants often fill those gaps created by the inherent variability of renewables. Some utilities, however, are increasing their flexibility in providing power from different sources with batteries, which are becoming less expensive to produce and big enough to store electricity to fill the minutes or hours without wind and sun, according to Nathanael Greene, a renewable energy expert with the Natural Resources Defense Council, but are still not quite cost-effective enough. (There are also a few other storage options, like pumped hydroelectric storage, compressed air energy storage, among others.) So utilities are turning more and more to natural-gas or oil-fired reciprocating engines to provide this flexible electricity. These internal combustion engines work like the ones in our cars, quickly providing relatively small amounts of power. In the last two decades, about three times as many of these engines have been added to the grid as were in the 50 years prior, and most of them are in states with large and growing renewable electricity capacity — like Texas, California and Kansas — according to a report from the Energy Information Administration. The need for stable, reliable electricity to balance out renewables is often played down in conversations about the transition to clean energy, according to Mark P. Mills, a physicist, engineer and senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a free-market think tank, who recently wrote a report that calls ambitions for a transition to 100 percent renewable electricity as an exercise in “magical thinking.” However, according to both Mr. Greene and Mr. Mills, these reciprocating engines may actually be an improvement, both in terms of efficiency and fossil fuel reduction. Typically, the way to balance the variability has been to keep a traditional coal or gas fired power plant running at part load so that there’s no interruption. These reciprocating engines, by contrast, can go from zero to full power in as little as two minutes. (Combined cycle turbines, another type of generator, can take much more time to start up, usually more than 30 minutes, so they are sometimes kept in “spinning reserve,” which means they’re using fuel but not producing electricity. In that way, they’re less efficient, but they’re bigger and can produce more electricity.) For example, Antelope Station, a 165 megawatt electricity producer in Texas, has 18 reciprocating engine generators to balance out wind variability, and can get to full operating capacity in 5 minutes. They can be run individually or together, depending on how much electricity is needed, and, according to their website, save a significant amount of water, which is important in parts of Texas. (Golden Spread Electric Co-Op, which owns Antelope Station, did not respond to an email requesting comment.) What renewable-energy advocates like Mr. Greene are waiting for is a drop in the price of batteries to make them more cost-effective than natural gas, or increased flexibility in the grid market, like in the western grid’s Western Energy Imbalance Market, which, among other things, enables excess renewable electricity to move where it’s needed. To Mr. Greene, these solutions are imminent. To Mr. Mills, they’re unrealistic. Either way, it’s worth remembering that without some investments in battery technology, grid flexibility, and innovative storage ideas, renewable electricity won’t be enough on its own, and may almost always be dependent on fossil fuels.

2020,Treasury to Roll Out Cryptocurrency Rules,"The rules will improve transparency in hopes of stopping money laundering. WASHINGTON — The Trump administration plans to introduce regulations for cryptocurrencies that are intended to crack down on their use in facilitating money laundering and other illicit activities, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Wednesday. Mr. Mnuchin told lawmakers that the regulations were being developed with other agencies and financial regulators to improve transparency surrounding digital currencies like Bitcoin. The administration has expressed growing concern over the use of such currencies to anonymously execute illegal transactions and potentially evade American sanctions on countries like Iran. “We are about to roll out some significant new requirements,” Mr. Mnuchin said during a hearing before the Senate Finance Committee. “We want to make sure that technology moves forward; on the other hand, we want to make sure cryptocurrencies aren’t used for the equivalent of old Swiss secret number banking.” Mr. Mnuchin did not provide details of what the regulations would entail. He said that they would provide greater transparency so that law enforcement could see where money was going and ensure that it was not being used to aid money laundering. After playing down the risks of cryptocurrencies at the beginning of Mr. Trump’s term, Mr. Mnuchin said over the summer that they posed a national security threat. He also said that he had “very serious concerns” about Libra, the digital currency that Facebook is developing. President Trump has also expressed skepticism about cryptocurrencies, declaring last year that he was “not a fan” and that their value was volatile and “based on thin air.” He warned at the time that Facebook must seek a banking charter and follow all bank regulations if it wanted to be in the digital currency business. As part of his effort to more closely police cryptocurrencies, Mr. Mnuchin has been pushing to relocate the Secret Service back to the Treasury Department from the Department of Homeland Security. In the budget proposal the White House released this week, the administration cited the importance of the Treasury Department and Secret Service working together to monitor the use of cryptocurrencies, which it cited as “an emerging threat.” The United States is also exploring the costs and benefits of developing its own digital currency. While Mr. Mnuchin said on Wednesday that he did not believe one was necessary in the next several years, Jerome H. Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve, said at a separate Senate hearing that the central bank had been studying what one would look like. “The benefits would include perhaps greater financial inclusion, lower costs, more convenience,” Mr. Powell said, noting that there would also be a risk for more fraud and reduced privacy. “There’s a lot to weigh and a lot to work on there. Every major central bank in the world right now is doing a deep dive on digital currencies, and we think it is our responsibility to be at the very forefront of knowledge and thinking about a central bank digital currency.” Mr. Powell said that depending on the design of such a currency, the Federal Reserve might need approval from Congress to move forward. “If we conclude that we need more authority, and that this is something appropriate to do, then we’ll ask for that authority,” he said. Despite the Treasury Department’s plans to take a more aggressive approach to dealing with cryptocurrencies, the department’s top job of combating illicit finance is facing a prolonged vacancy. The White House on Wednesday officially withdrew the nomination of Jessie K. Liu, the former United States attorney for the District of Columbia, as under secretary for terrorism and financial crimes. Mr. Mnuchin, who confirmed that Mr. Trump had withdrawn the nomination, would not disclose the reason.",The New York Times
2020,"Treehouses, Glass Igloos and Other Out-of-This-World Spots to Lay Your Head","Your Instagram account will thank you. Gone are the days when a hotel meant simply a bed, a desk and perhaps a minibar. A new wave of accommodations has bumped traditional lodging out of the way by offering unique experiences that are endlessly, irresistibly Instagrammable. Want to cozy up in a glass igloo to watch the Northern Lights? Or hang on for dear life from the side of a cliff in a transparent capsule? You can do all that these days — for a price, of course. Africa is dotted with luxurious safari lodges for guests who want to get as close as possible to the continent’s incredible animal life. But some get you closer than others. At Mfuwe Lodge in Zambia, 18 chalets are arranged around two large lagoons, creating the perfect setting for watching elephants as they visit in the late afternoons. But Africa isn’t the only continent to offer such close encounters of the animal kind. The Jungle Bubbles, at the Anantara Golden Triangle Elephant Camp & Resort in Chiang Rai, Thailand, offers resort guests the chance to spend a night in a transparent bubble, witnessing elephants pass by. But if you live in the United States, you don’t have to travel far to get close to animal life. At the Farm Sanctuary in Watkins Glen, N.Y., guests can reserve one of a handful of tiny houses and mingle with some of the 800 farm animals rescued from abuse and mistreatment. Mfuwe Lodge, from $400 per person; Jungle Bubbles, doubles from $567 plus resort costs; Farm Sanctuary, doubles from $275 per night. Regardless of where you are in the world, there’s a good chance you can stay in a treehouse-style accommodation. At Anavilhanas Jungle Lodge in the Amazon region of Brazil, guests can find themselves cocooned in the canopy of the Amazon, high above the Rio Negro river. Up in the tall trees of the pine forests of Northern Sweden, the Treehotel posits guests in mirrored cubes and cabins perched in the treetops, one of which is even shaped like a U.F.O. On the edge of Kruger National Park in South Africa, the new &Beyond Ngala Treehouse opens this month, giving guests a chance to take a game drive out to the treehouse where they spend the night up high in the bush in a private tower. A different kind of treehouse greets guests in Costa Rica at Hotel Costa Verde, where a decommissioned airplane was reconstructed in the jungle canopy, so that guests actually sleep in a plane in the jungle canopy. But some travelers want to go even higher than the treetops. At Skylodge Adventure Suites in Peru, guests arrive either by hiking over 1,300 feet or 400 meters up, or by zipping in like a superhero on a series of zip lines. The rooms themselves are transparent capsules hanging on the side of a mountain with panoramic views of the Sacred Valley. Anavilhanas Jungle Lodge, from $325 per person for a panoramic suite; Treehotel, doubles from $540; &Beyond Ngala Treehouse, from $695 per person; Hotel Costa Verde, doubles from $260; Skylodge Adventure Suites, from $467 per person with transport. Not into heights? You can always go deep thanks to lodging options that offer an underwater experience. At Conrad Maldives Rangali Island, guests can reserve the Muraka, a two-level hotel room that includes an infinity pool and also reaches 16 feet below sea level.

2020,Trial Guide: The Sept. 11 Case at Guantánamo Bay,"A guide to the prosecution of five men accused of conspiring in the Sept. 11, 2001, hijackings that killed nearly 3,000 people in New York, at the Pentagon and in Pennsylvania. Five men are facing charges in the United States military tribunal at Guantánamo Bay of aiding the 19 men who hijacked passenger planes and crashed them into the World Trade Center, Pentagon and a Pennsylvania field on Sept. 11, 2001. The charges, which carry the death penalty, include conspiracy, murder in violation of the law of war and terrorism. The defendants are accused of directing or training the hijackers or helping provide them money or assistance with travel. They were captured in 2002 and 2003, held incommunicado in a secret C.I.A. prison network and transferred to Guantánamo in September 2006 for trial. The judge has set Jan. 11, 2021, to start selection of the military jury that will hear the case, and has estimated that the trial could last nine months. Although the men were arraigned May 5, 2012, the case is still in a pretrial phase. The prosecution and defense have been litigating what evidence the United States government must provide defense lawyers and what laws apply at the court, which was created by President George W. Bush and subsequently overhauled by President Barack Obama and Congress. Other issues to be decided before trial include what evidence is admissible at trial, notably F.B.I. accounts of what the five men said in interrogations at Guantánamo in 2007, months after their arrival from years in C.I.A. custody, when they were subjected to so-called “enhanced interrogation techniques.” Defense lawyers want all evidence from the F.B.I. interrogations excluded as tainted by torture, arguing that their clients had been conditioned by that point to provide answers that would please their interrogators. Prosecutors call the 2007 questioning “clean-team” interrogations. A total of 2,976 people are named as victims in the charge sheet. That total does not include people who died of diseases blamed on their work at the ruins of the World Trade Center. A liaison to the victims in the chief prosecutor’s office selects five people to observe the proceedings at Guantánamo from a pool of volunteer observers who include spouses, parents and children of those killed on 9/11 as well as designated survivors of the attacks. They are brought to the base to watch a week of hearings on the same aircraft that transports the judge, lawyers and witnesses. More recently, people who lost family members to illnesses attributed to their work at ground zero have also been brought to Guantánamo to watch the hearings. In addition, the Pentagon operates special viewing sites in New York, Massachusetts and Maryland where people with victim status can watch the proceedings on a video feed from Guantánamo. Colonel W. Shane Cohen, an Air Force judge, has been on the case since the summer of 2019. He obtained his law degree from Brigham Young University in 1998, the same year he was commissioned in the Air Force. He is the third military judge to preside in the case since the defendants were arraigned in 2012. He replaced Colonel Keith Parrella, who left the Navy-Marine Corps bench after less than a year on the case. Defense lawyers have gone to federal court to challenge Colonel Parrella’s decisions on the bench because, before his service at Guantánamo, he worked at the National Security Division of the Justice Department, which provides prosecutors to the case. The first trial judge, Colonel James L. Pohl of the Army, now retired, presided for the first six years. Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, nicknamed KSM by the F.B.I., is accused of conceiving of the “Planes Operation” that became the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks. He is alleged to have proposed it to Osama bin Laden in 1996 and to have overseen the plot, including training some hijackers in Afghanistan and Pakistan. He was captured in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, on March 1, 2003, and held in a series of secret C.I.A. prisons, where he was waterboarded 183 times, kept nude, sleep deprived, had his diet manipulated and subjected to other violence. As lead defendant, he sits in the front row of the courtroom. He is a Pakistani citizen of Baluchi descent and the only defendant in the case with children. He has eight. Walid bin Attash, known as Khallad, is accused of training two of the hijackers on hand-to-hand fighting in 1999, researching flights and timetables and testing the ability of a passenger to hide a razor knife on flights to Malaysia, Thailand and China. He was captured in Karachi, Pakistan, on April 29, 2003. Mr. bin Attash was born in Saudi Arabia, and left at age 14 to join the jihad in Afghanistan. He lost his lower right leg fighting against the Northern Alliance in a battle that also claimed the life of an older brother of his. A younger brother, Hassan, is also held at Guantánamo, in a different prison. The two men have never been allowed to meet there. Ramzi bin al-Shibh is accused of organizing the Hamburg, Germany, cell of Sept. 11 hijackers, researching flight schools from Germany and wiring money to Mohammed Atta and other hijackers. He is accused of acting as a go-between for the cell and Mr. Mohammed in Afghanistan, and relaying word to Al Qaeda leaders that Mr. Atta had chosen the date of Sept. 11 for the attack. Mr. bin al-Shibh repeatedly tried, and failed, to get a United States visa to take part in the hijackings. He was the first of the five defendants to be captured, on Sept. 11, 2002, in a security services raid in Karachi, Pakistan. He was held for a time at Guantánamo when the C.I.A. had a station there as part of his four-year odyssey through the agency’s black sites. He is Yemeni. Ammar al-Baluchi is named in the charges as Abd al Aziz Ali. He is accused of transferring money from the United Arab Emirates, where he lived and worked at a computer technology business from 1999 to 2001, to some of the hijackers in the United States for his uncle, Mr. Mohammed. His mother and Mr. Mohammed are brother and sister. He left Dubai at the time of the Sept. 11 attacks and was captured in Karachi, Pakistan, on April 29, 2003, with Mr. Bin Attash. His lawyers say, based on what they know about his abuse in C.I.A. custody — water dousing, walling, sleep deprivation and being hung by his wrists — that the detainee named Ammar who is brutalized in the Hollywood film “Zero Dark Thirty” is based on his experience. Mr. Baluchi was born in Kuwait and has Pakistani citizenship. Mustafa al Hawsawi has the fewest charges against him and therefore sits furthest from the judge, at the back of the courtroom. He is accused of helping some of the hijackers with finances and travel arrangements and frequently waives his right to be in court, his lawyers say, because he suffered rectal damage in C.I.A. custody — his lawyers call it rape — and he finds it painful to sit, even on the doughnut shaped pillow his lawyers bring to court. He is a Saudi citizen. All the lawyers and support staff who work in court — for both the prosecution and defense teams — must be United States citizens. They must also have obtained top secret security clearances with special access to intelligence information, because the defendants were previously held in the secret C.I.A. black site program. Prosecutors have higher level and broader clearances than defense lawyers and, in many instances, get to decide what information and evidence the defense lawyers are entitled to see in trial preparation. Because this is a national security case, the prosecutors collaborate with the C.I.A. and judge at times to redact original case evidence and provide substitutions of original information to the defense lawyers. Brigadier General Mark S. Martins of the Army has been the chief war crimes prosecutor since June 2011. He is a Rhodes Scholar who graduated first in his class at West Point and earned a Harvard law degree alongside a young Barack Obama. General Martins served for five years in Iraq and Afghanistan and helped review detainee policies for President Obama in 2009 before he went to the Office of Military Commissions. He was scheduled to retire from the service on Nov. 1, 2017, but has twice received extensions. General Martins assigned himself to this case. He has two lead prosecutors, both civilians: Edward R. Ryan of the Justice Department and retired Army Colonel Robert L. Swann, a Defense Department employee. Other prosecutors on the case include the civilian lawyers Christopher M. Dysktra, Jeffrey D. Groharing, Nicole A. Tate, and Clayton G. Trivett Jr. Captain Jackson T. Hall of the Air Force and Major Neville F. Dastoor of the Army are also members of the prosecution team. The chief defense counsel is Brig. Gen. John G. Baker of the Marines. He does not actually represent any of the defendants. Instead, his role is to assign lawyers and other staff members to prisoners who are accused of war crimes, to argue for resources and manage the staff of 100 military and 50 civilian employees of the Military Commission Defense Organization. He has held the position since 2015. For Mr. Mohammed, Gary D. Sowards of New York serves as the lead, learned counsel with Lt. Col. Derek A. Poteet of the Marines, Lt. Peter N. Berg of the Navy and David Z. Nevin, Denise “Denny” LeBoeuf, Melanie T. Partow and Rita J. Radostitz. Mr. Sowards previously represented the “Unabomber,” Theodore J. Kaczynski, as part of a capital defense team in a case that ended with Mr. Kaczynski being given a life sentence. For Mr. bin Attash, Cheryl T. Bormann of Chicago serves as lead, learned counsel with Capt. Jay S. Peer of the Air Force, Anisha P. Gupta, William R. Montross Jr. and Edwin A. Perry. Ms. Bormann has been defending capital cases since 1994 and joined the Office of Military Commissions after Illinois abolished the death penalty in 2011. For Mr. bin al-Shibh, James P. Harrington of Buffalo serves as interim lead, learned counsel until a replacement is hired, with Maj. Virginia M. Bare of the Air Force, Lt. Cmdr. Rachel W. Reddick and Lt. Clayton Lawrence of the Navy, Capt. John M. Balouziyeh of the Army and Donna R. Cline, Wyatt A. Feeler and Vivian Hernandez. Mr. Harrington has been defending capital cases since New York reintroduced the death penalty in 1995. He also defended a member of the “Lackawanna 6,” an Al Qaeda case that gained some notoriety after the Sept. 11 attacks. For Mr. al-Baluchi, James G. Connell III of Bethesda, Md., serves as learned counsel with Lt. Col. Sterling R. Thomas and Maj. Ann Marie Bush of the Air Force and Benjamin R. Farley and Alka Pradhan. Mr. Connell handled the habeas corpus proceedings for 2002 D.C. Beltway sniper John Allen Muhammad, who was executed in 2009. For Mr. Hawsawi, Walter B. Ruiz of Arlington, Va., who is a commander in the Navy Reserves but serves as a civilian, is learned counsel, with Lt. Col. Jennifer N. Williams and Maj. Joseph D. Wilkinson II of the Army and Sean M. Gleason and Suzanne M. Lachelier. Mr. Ruiz has defended death-penalty cases in both federal and state court in Florida as a public defender. The military commissions, created by Congress in 2006 and reformed in 2009, are a hybrid of the military court-martial and federal criminal court systems. The judge and jury, called a panel, are members of the United States military. While both the prosecution and defense teams are required to have military lawyers on their teams, civilian lawyers have for years carried much of the load. Security is handled by soldiers who are assigned to the prison and work both inside and outside the court in battle dress uniforms. The men are being tried in a cavernous courtroom at Guantánamo’s Expeditionary Legal Complex that was built specifically to try the Sept. 11 conspiracy case. It has the capacity to try six men at a time, although five are charged in the case. Spectators watch the proceedings from behind triple-pane glass in a gallery behind the court and hear the court proceedings on a 40-second delay — long enough for the judge’s security officer to mute the audio if somebody says something classified. No photography is allowed. Sketching is permitted, with restrictions. A jury of 12 military officers with perhaps as many alternates is to be drawn from a pool of active-duty military officers from any or all of the four services — the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps. The Pentagon overseer of the military commissions, called the Convening Authority, will create the pool from those “best qualified for the duty by reason of age, education, training, experience, length of service, and judicial temperament,” according to the Manual for Military Commissions. One plan is to assemble the would-be panelists in groups of 150 in either Florida or near Washington, D.C., and send them to Guantánamo in batches for selection and elimination because the small base in southeast Cuba doesn’t have space to house and manage the entire pool at one time. In his order directing jury selection to start on Jan. 11, 2021, Colonel Cohen, the judge, has asked the prosecutors to explain how the panel will be sequestered at Guantánamo. The base has 6,000 residents, seven dining rooms, four fast-food restaurants and a combined coffee shop and ice cream parlor.",The New York Times

2020,Tribal Nation Condemns ‘Desecration’ to Build Border Wall,"Construction of a wall on the Arizona border is endangering sacred Indigenous sites — including an oasis that has supported human beings for the last 16,000 years. Saguaro cactuses were cut down in Organ Pipe Cactus Monument, where a wall is being built along the Arizona-Mexico border.Credit... LUKEVILLE, Ariz. — Cut down a saguaro cactus in Arizona and you can face years in prison. But over the past several weeks, work crews have been destroying dozens of the protected cactuses, which can live for 200 years, to build a new wall on the southwestern border. The remains of chopped-up saguaros are now visible along a swath of the Sonoran Desert in southern Arizona, part of what Native American leaders warn is a range of environmental and archaeological threats posed by the Trump administration’s scramble to build the wall. Work along the border, according to tribal leaders of the Tohono O’odham Nation who live on both sides of the border, is blasting ancient burial sites and siphoning an aquifer that feeds a desert oasis where human beings have slaked their thirst for 16,000 years. The outcry by tribal citizens reflects the latest phase in the quarreling over the border wall, after federal courts allowed the Trump administration to speed construction by waiving dozens of laws, including measures protecting endangered species and Native American burial sites. Federal officials have cited President Trump’s national emergency declaration in 2019, aimed at curbing unauthorized immigration, as justification for the waivers. Dynamite blasts are now echoing throughout lands assigned the highest degree of permanent protection by Congress as workers lay the foundation for the wall. To mix concrete, crews are drawing water from a spring near where ancient bone fragments were unearthed last year. The work is occurring at sites inside the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, which President Franklin D. Roosevelt established by proclamation in 1937. The area has been designated by UNESCO, the United Nations cultural organization, as an internationally protected biosphere reserve. “To state it clearly, we are enduring crimes against humanity,” said Verlon M. José, the governor of the Tohono O’odham in northern Mexico and a former vice chairman of the tribal nation on the American side of the border. “Tell me where your grandparents are buried and let me dynamite their graves,” said Mr. José, emphasizing how visceral an issue the blasting has become among O’odham-speaking peoples. “This wall is already putting a scar across our heart.” The Border Patrol, which is overseeing the wall construction within the national monument, is hitting back at such assessments. John Mennell, a Border Patrol spokesman, disputed the claims by O’odham leaders and said that “no biological, cultural or historical sites were identified within the project area.” In a statement, Mr. Mennell added that the agency has “a history of voluntary compliance where it is necessary to minimize impacts,” and that workers were destroying only cactuses “determined not to be in a healthy enough state to be relocated.” At a congressional hearing about these activities on Wednesday, Representative Ruben Gallego, Democrat of Arizona, compared the blasting at sites held to be sacred by Native Americans to the war crime of destroying sacred cultural sites during international conflicts. He also accused federal authorities of “gaslighting” by contending that the construction work was aimed at preserving lands near the border. The government has suggested that building a wall would prevent migrants from trampling over the desert in vehicles and on foot. The White House and Department of Homeland Security did not send representatives to the hearing. On the same day as the hearing, the Border Patrol and Army Corps of Engineers invited reporters to view a controlled detonation during border wall construction. After grievances by O’odham citizens intensified in recent months, Representative Raúl M. Grijalva, a Democrat representing southern Arizona, homed in on the use of explosives at an area of the monument that many O’odham consider a sacred Indigenous site. Citing O’odham leaders, Mr. Grijalva said in a video posted on Twitter that the site, known as Memorial Hill, “is the resting place primarily for Apache warriors that had been involved in battle with the O’odham, and then the O’odham people in a respectful way laid them to rest on Monument Hill.” Objections to the border wall are now multiplying from the some 28,000 enrolled members of Tohono O’odham (pronounced To-HO-no AW-tham). Many live in the tribal nation’s reservation in Arizona, which is near Organ Pipe, while about 2,000 others live in an adjacent area of northern Mexico. Before the American conquest of Arizona in the 1840s, the O’odham homeland encompassed Organ Pipe as well as much of southern Arizona. The border sliced through these lands first as a result of the Mexican-American War, and then the Gadsden Purchase in 1854. Now the stretch of border where work crews are blasting rock and building the wall is creating a gash through the middle of this revered stretch of desert. On a recent day in February, it was possible to see the uprooted remains of an organ pipe cactus, the protected and rare species that resembles a pipe organ. The Border Patrol said workers had relocated hundreds of cactuses within the park, but tribal leaders and environmental activists have documented multiple examples of uprooted cactuses left to decay under the desert sun. Serving as testament to the rise and fall of nations in the borderlands, some of the cactuses destroyed by work crews for the Nebraska construction giant Kiewit were alive before the international border even existed in this part of the Sonoran Desert. The national monument sits at the heart of an ancient Indigenous territory known during colonial times as the Papaguería, according to the Organ Pipe monument’s administrative history, with petroglyphs and rock art scattered throughout the site. In addition to providing the name of the tribal nation, the word “O’odham” roughly means both “saguaro” and “person,” reflecting how O’odham peoples relied on the cactuses as a fruit, cooked over mesquite or fermented into ceremonial wine. “All of the desecration to build this wall constitutes a very personal attack on us,” said Amber Ortega, 33, an O’odham student who lives near the monument. “Why have laws when there is no accountability for these abuses?” To advance the border wall project, the Trump administration has used a little-known section of the Real ID Act that allows the Department of Homeland Security to waive compliance with federal law to expedite construction of barriers along the border. Among the laws being waived is the Endangered Species Act. Laiken Jordahl, a former National Park Service employee who surveyed the wildlife of Organ Pipe, said the at-risk animals in the park include the lesser long-nosed bat and the Sonoran pronghorn, one of the most critically endangered wildlife species in the United States. “This project will change the evolutionary history of this landscape, impacting species migrations, seed dispersal, the flow of water,” said Mr. Jordahl, who now works for the Center for Biological Diversity, an organization focused on saving imperiled species. “It’s painfully obvious that we’re destroying what this place was established to protect,” he said. The push to build the wall stands in contrast to previous infrastructure projects on the border. During construction of a section of border wall in 2008, the Bush administration trucked in water for construction use instead of extracting water from the aquifer feeding the Quitobaquito spring. Authorities were hoping to preserve the Quitobaquito oasis, where O’odham people had lived for generations. Among them was a family that had remained at the site for two decades after the monument was created, until the National Park Service forced them to leave, according to Jared Orsi, a historian at Colorado State University. Last year, bone fragments found near the spring were determined to be from the Classic Hohokam Period, which lasted from A.D. 300 to 1,500. The National Park Service said it planned to repatriate the fragments to the Tohono O’odham Nation. Now workers at the site are pumping water from the aquifer beneath Quitobaquito to mix cement and to water down dirt roads around construction sites. That could endanger not just the spring’s existence but species in its waters such as the Quitobaquito pupfish and Sonoyta mud turtle, according to the National Park Service. Mr. Mennell, the Border Patrol spokesman, said park officials were monitoring the spring to “identify any significant changes in water levels.” He said no groundwater would be used within five miles of Quitobaquito. “People would be unhinged if this were happening someplace else,” said Vana Lewis, 35, a Tohono O’odham teacher. “This fits into a pattern of trampling over our rights on land that was taken from us and was ours since time immemorial.” Around the work sites that are strewn with felled cactuses, the occasional tourist shows up to snap pictures of the wall going up. Signs provide warnings about nearby blasting. Border Patrol agents still search for migrants crossing into the wilderness. On a recent day, Border Patrol agents and employees from the National Park Service picked up a Venezuelan, Coromoto Ureña, who had crossed with her 4-year-old granddaughter, María José, at a remote spot near Quitobaquito. “Our only choice was to come this way,” said Ms. Ureña, 59, a resident of San Cristóbal, Venezuela, clasping the hand of her granddaughter while they were being detained. Ms. Ureña said they were hoping to reunite in the United States with her son, who lives in Denver. O’odham leaders have been grasping for ways of stymieing the project. Ned Norris Jr., the chairman of the Tohono O’odham Nation, requested this month that the Defense Department halt diversion of an estimated $3.8 billion in military funds the administration hopes to use to pay for the wall. As the blasting goes on, anger is building around the country from some members of Congress and their constituents. Tammy Gitter, a yoga instructor from Los Angeles, drove to Organ Pipe to witness what she regarded as a disastrous event. “I didn’t go to New York for 9/11 or New Orleans for Hurricane Katrina, so I felt I had to come here,” said Ms. Gitter, 45. “This tragedy is being carried out in our name,” said Ms. Gitter, tears starting to swell in her eyes as she gazed at Quitobaquito’s waters. “The whole thing just enrages me.”",The New York Times
2020,Tribune Publishing C.E.O. Departs in Management Shake-Up,"The changes come two months after a hedge fund once called “the destroyer of newspapers” bought a 32 percent stake in the company, which owns The Chicago Tribune and other newspapers. Tribune Publishing, the owner of The Chicago Tribune, announced a management shake-up on Monday, naming Terry Jimenez, its chief financial officer, as the chief executive. He succeeds Timothy P. Knight, who will step down after only a year leading the company. The changes come two months after Alden Global Capital, a New York hedge fund once called “a destroyer of newspapers,” acquired the single largest stake in the company and installed two of eight directors on the board. Tribune Publishing has already been cutting staff, eliminating 118 posts through September. Last month, the company asked journalists at its nine news organizations across the country to volunteer for buyouts. Tribune Publishing, which also owns The New York Daily News, The Baltimore Sun and The Orlando Sentinel, has been hit hard by elemental changes to the news business as readers embrace screens for their news, and Facebook and Google siphon away the majority of digital ad dollars. In a memo to staff on Monday, Mr. Knight said the company would have to continue to “realign” its “costs to the current revenue reality,” adding: “These efforts will allow the company to focus resources on our employees and the journalism you produce.” Mr. Knight, who had spent several decades in the news business, said he was “looking forward to finding a new adventure.” Employees represented by the union at The Baltimore Sun had sharp words for company executives. “The cuts being made are only necessary to pad unrealistic profit expectations on Wall Street,” the union said on Twitter in a response to the management changes. “We need to see new leadership better explain how a strategy of cutting to the bone to please Wall Street squares with plans ‘to invest in quality, local journalism.’” Alden Global owns 32 percent of Tribune Publishing and agreed to steer clear of management or personnel matters for the time being. But insiders are wary. Alden, known for gutting newsrooms to improve profits, could buy more stock as soon as July. The fear of the hedge fund has so gripped The Chicago Tribune’s journalists that two of its reporters last month approached several billionaires to be potential white knights and buy the company to fend off Alden. “Now, we are bracing for the sight of colleagues with decades of experience walking out with cardboard boxes in their arms and tears streaming down their faces,” David Jackson and Gary Marx, reporters at The Chicago Tribune, wrote in an Op-Ed for The New York Times last month. Mr. Jimenez, who had been finance chief since 2016, has spent several years working at news publishers, including a stint Newsday and several years as publisher of amNewYork, a free daily paper.",The New York Times
2020,"Tropical Breezes, Pristine Beaches and a Domain Name to Die For","Start-ups want unusual internet addresses to help stand out. One winner: The island of Anguilla, whose “.ai” domain is a favorite of A.I. start-ups. The luxury resorts along serene white-sand beaches have long propped up the economy of Anguilla, a tiny British territory in the Caribbean. But the island is also the lucky financial beneficiary of two hot trends in technology: artificial intelligence and vanity internet addresses. Anguilla is the landlord for internet addresses that end in “.ai” — a suddenly valuable slice of online real estate. Every time a .ai name is registered or renewed — by A.I. start-ups, or by speculators hoping to resell the names to those start-ups, big companies or investors — the island collects a $50-a-year fee, which goes mostly to the government treasury. Those fees added up to $2.9 million in 2018, the most recent official government tally, or nearly as much as the combined salaries of the 127 primary-school teachers, assistants and administrators in the territory. The revenue rose sharply again last year. “It’s really snowballed,” said Vincent Cate, who manages the .ai registry in an office not far from the ocean. Anguilla owes its good fortune to the large, yet obscure and often quirky, market for internet addresses. Start-ups are increasingly willing to take on unusual internet addresses, or domain names like .ai, to stand out. There’s WT.social, a social network started last year by Jimmy Wales, a co-founder of Wikipedia. BenevolentAI, a drug development start-up that has raised $290 million, is at benevolent.ai. Compound, a cryptocurrency lending marketplace with prominent investors, can be found at compound.finance. The marketplace for internet addresses has become attractive even to big investors. A private equity firm in 2018 bought Donuts Inc., a company with the rights to more than 240 newer domain names, like “.technology” and “.engineering.” Another private equity firm has bid for the rights to “.org” — used by most nonprofits — offering more than $1 billion and setting off a controversy over whether the domain should be controlled by a profit-driven company. And Berkshire Hathaway, led by Warren E. Buffett, is the largest shareholder in Verisign, the registry that manages “.com.” “The domain name system is an important part of the plumbing of the internet, and it’s become a big business,” said Matthew Zook, a professor at the University of Kentucky, who has studied the industry for years. Annual registration and renewal fees alone, he estimates, total almost $4 billion. To some degree, search engines like Google, social networks like Facebook and mobile apps like Uber have diminished the role of domain names as the way people navigate online. Gone, for the most part, are the days when getting around online meant painstakingly typing a web address into a browser. Still, the names remain important as digital identifiers and brands. They’re mentioned all the time in ads and mouthed by politicians. Among internet addresses, .com remains the giant, accounting for 40 percent of all registered domain names. But last year, 33 percent of start-ups had domain names other than .com, more than double the percentage five years earlier, according to an analysis by Brex, which provides credit cards for start-ups. Covariant.ai, a start-up developing software that enables robots to adapt to their surroundings, briefly looked at .com names when it was founded in 2017. But Peter Chen, a co-founder, said no apt names were available or affordable. Besides, Mr. Chen said, “we are an A.I. company; .ai gives us a brand and meaning and symbolism that we want. It’s hands-down better than .com.” So Covariant.ai it is. Today’s domain name industry is a legacy of policy choices made by the Bill Clinton administration in the late 1990s. The goal was to allow a promising young technology to flourish, free of rules and taxes that might hinder innovation and investment. In 1998, the United States government led the creation of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, a nonprofit that oversees domain names. ICANN describes itself as a global “bottom-up community” that does not regulate prices or police online content. A relatively small number of well-known domain names, including .com and .org, go back to the 1980s. When ICANN was created, it began overseeing these legacy names and country and territory domains like “.ca” for Canada, “.de” for Germany and, of course, “.ai” for Anguilla. As the internet grew, ICANN created more digital real estate, broadening the domain-name market. Roughly 1,200 new top-level domain names — the letters that appear to the right of the dot — approved by ICANN have begun operating in recent years. There is no way to track precisely how domain names are used, but experts estimate that as few as half are the addresses for websites or email. Big companies buy up thousands of addresses to cover variations of their corporate or brand names, to prevent illicit operators from using them. And speculators own the rights to many millions of other names, hoping to resell them for big payouts. The resale prices range from a few dollars to millions. Last year, voice.com sold for $30 million to Block.one, a start-up building a social media network called Voice. Serkan Piantino, a former director of A.I. research at Facebook, considered buying a .com address when he founded his start-up, Spell, in 2017. But he opted for spell.run instead. Spell’s software tools help developers create products with machine learning technology. And “spell run” is the command users type to move their code into Spell’s cloud software. “The name is not just a brand, but descriptive of what we provide,” Mr. Piantino said. The domain “.run” was one of the options created in recent years. It is owned by Donuts, a registry that raised $100 million to fund an aggressive effort to pick up new internet names. In the last five years, the number of companies and investors using domain names managed by Donuts has more than tripled, to 4.5 million. “These properties are only going to get more valuable as the online world grows,” said Akram Atallah, chief executive of Donuts. ICANN is beginning work on another expansion program, a gradual process that will generate even more online real estate in a few years. “The idea is to create more value and choices for more people,” said Cyrus Namazi, senior vice president of ICANN’s global domains division. “The internet is still very young relative to other life-changing technologies, and it’s not done yet.” It is unclear whether more supply will mean more demand. Too many choices, economists say, can be counterproductive as overwhelmed consumers turn to what is familiar and trusted. Of course, consumers’ tastes change. For years, .ai was a quiet little neighborhood, run as a side job by Mr. Cate, a computer scientist who settled in Anguilla and later became a citizen. But as the global A.I. investment wave took off, so did the demand for .ai internet addresses. To offload that work and market .ai names, he turned to the retailers of the domain industry, places like GoDaddy and 101domain. Those companies are now resellers of .ai names. Mr. Cate still has plenty of work to do. He is planning to move to a new building with more space for computers and more robust, underground cable connections to the internet, a safeguard in a hurricane region. And he marvels at the island’s A.I. windfall. “For years, it wasn’t much,” he said. “It wasn’t a commercial business at all.”",The New York Times
2020,Troy Polamalu Highlights Hall of Fame Class,"The former Steelers safety was selected in his first year of eligibility. Another hard-hitting safety, Steve Atwater, made it in his 16th. MIAMI — He grew his hair so long that it flowed out of his helmet and obscured the name on his jersey. Yet everyone knew where to find Troy Polamalu on Sundays. The Steelers great earned a spot in the Pro Football Hall of Fame on Saturday along with another hard-hitting safety, the longtime Broncos defensive back Steve Atwater. Wide receiver Isaac Bruce, running back Edgerrin James and guard Steve Hutchinson also were selected. Polamalu said he did not cut his hair for at least six years during the prime of his career, which lasted from 2003-14. But as much as for the hair, he earned the nickname Tasmanian devil for how he changed the way people thought about the safety position — bolting around the field, making plays from practically anywhere. No quarterback, runner or receiver was safe. Chosen for induction in his first year of eligibility, Polamalu was a four-time All-Pro, an eight-time Pro Bowl selection and a two-time Super Bowl champion in three trips. His pick-6 against Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco in the A.F.C. championship game after the 2008 season was part of a dominating performance in what might have been his best campaign. He had seven interceptions and the Steelers won the Super Bowl. Polamalu will enter the Hall alongside his former coach, Bill Cowher, and the longtime Steelers defensive back Donnie Shell, each of whom were voted in as part of the Hall’s special centennial class designed to celebrate the N.F.L.’s 100th year. “It’s a huge blessing to go in with Coach Cowher and a tremendous honor to go in with Donnie Shell because the Steelers’ defenses in the ’70s laid our foundation,” Polamalu said. Though game-changing safeties were nothing new to the league, Polamalu could line up near the linebackers, or the defensive linemen, or deep in the defensive backfield, and wreck a game plan from any of those spots. “He’s waking people up to the impact a safety can have in today’s game,” the former safety John Lynch said in an interview while Polamalu was in his prime. Lynch, the 49ers general manager, was also among the 15 modern-era finalists whose résumés were debated by the panel of four dozen voters. But he did not make the cut. Neither did Tony Boselli, the dominant Jaguars offensive lineman whose career lasted only 91 games because of shoulder injuries. The Jaguars, who played their first season in 1995, are still without a player in the hall. Another offensive lineman, however, did make it. Hutchinson, who played for the Seahawks, Vikings and Titans over a 12-year career, had been a finalist in all three years since becoming eligible. This time, he broke through in a class that didn’t include a single quarterback on the list of finalists. “I’ve written the speech the past few years in the shower and it’ll really be about the people who helped me get here,” Hutchinson said. Atwater made it in his 16th year of eligibility. He became the first homegrown Broncos defender to join the Hall. When he got the much-anticipated knock on his hotel door, “it was pretty obvious it wasn’t the maid,” Atwater said, “so I was pretty excited. I’m extremely honored to go in with all these men.” A two-time All-Pro who won two Super Bowls, Atwater prowled the backfield and delivered vicious hits to anyone coming across. One irony of Atwater’s late-recognized greatness is that many of his whiplash-inducing hits would be illegal in today’s N.F.L. Though receivers were mostly at risk, it was his shoulder-to-shoulder disintegration of the 250-pound Chiefs running back Christian Okoye, nicknamed The Nigerian Nightmare, while mic’d up on Monday Night Football in 1990 that truly put Atwater on the map. James may not have had a singular moment like that, but he was a bastion of versatility and durability. He made a name for himself with his ability to carve out room on the ground while playing in Peyton Manning’s offense with the Colts from 1999-2005. James also played three seasons with the Cardinals and seven games with the Seahawks in 2009. ”Started With Gold Teeth, Ended With a Gold Jacket,” James posted on Instagram. James finished with more than 3,300 yards receiving and more than 12,000 yards rushing. He won the N.F.L. rushing title in as a rookie in 1999 and did it again in 2000, no small feat given Manning was revving up his career at the time. James joins Colts wideout Marvin Harrison in the Hall, giving Manning more company next year when he’ll be a shoo-in to join them in his first year of eligibility. Bruce was a headliner in “The Greatest Show on Turf,” the St. Louis Rams’ pass-happy attack run by the Hall of Fame quarterback Kurt Warner. This was Bruce’s sixth season of eligibility and his fourth time as a finalist. His 15,208 yards receiving over 16 seasons ranked second in the N.F.L. record book when he retired after the 2009 season. But he was never selected as an Associated Press All-Pro, and some critics dismissed his stats as being more a sign of his longevity and the passing era in which he played rather than any mark of true greatness. No matter. He was elated. “St. Louis, we headed to Canton!” he said on Twitter. There were no seniors announced Saturday, as they were folded into the centennial class. Others going in with that class, which was announced last month, include the former players Harold Carmichael, Alex Karras, and Cliff Harris, along with the former Cowboys coach Jimmy Johnson and ex-N.F.L.

2020,"Troy Price, Iowa Democratic Party Leader, Resigns Over Caucus Debacle","Mr. Price announced he was stepping down after overseeing the chaotic Iowa caucuses that embarrassed the state and national party. DES MOINES — Troy Price, the beleaguered chairman of the Iowa Democratic Party, resigned on Wednesday, a week after overseeing the chaotic Iowa caucuses that embarrassed the state and national party and left Democrats open to accusations of incompetence by President Trump’s re-election campaign. The Iowa Democratic Party failed to report any results from its first-in-the-nation presidential caucuses on Feb. 3 until the next afternoon. When it did report results, they were filled with errors. Even once the Iowa Democratic Party released what it said were full results, errors remained in the tabulations, and the campaigns of the two victors, former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., and Senator Bernie Sanders, have both asked for a partial recanvass of the results. Mr. Price, 39, has been the public face of the Iowa caucus debacle, as he has struggled to offer reassuring explanations about the integrity of the caucus reporting process and final results. “While it is my desire to stay in this role and see this process through to completion, I do believe it is time for the Iowa Democratic Party to begin looking forward, and my presence in my current role makes that more difficult,” Mr. Price wrote in a letter to party officials. “Therefore, I will resign as chair of the Iowa Democratic Party effective upon the election of my replacement.” The party said its State Central Committee would elect an interim chair on Saturday. While he acknowledged that the failure of the reporting process “was simply unacceptable,” Mr. Price sought to put the best possible light on the events of the past nine days. “By all accounts, the precinct and satellite caucus meetings themselves went well,” he wrote. “In the days following the caucuses, our staff worked under immense pressure to produce a complete report of results from the caucuses and was able to do so in 72 hours. Enduring threats to personal safety, taunts and anger from people around the globe, our staff worked in a professional manner to produce a final result.” The Democratic National Committee and some Iowa Democratic Party leaders have pointed fingers at Mr. Price for not doing more to ensure that changes to the caucus process this year, such as the use of a new results-reporting app, were fully tested and clear to the precinct leaders and many others involved in running the process. In a conference call with his central committee two days after the caucuses, Mr. Price was pressed by two members over the appearance of cronyism because of his friendships, dating to Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign, with a senior adviser to Mr. Buttigieg who is married to the founder of the company that developed the caucus app. (The New York Times was provided with a call-in number for the call.) “We have seen the pictures of you, Troy, with app developers and people with the Buttigieg campaign, and that’s concerning,” said Holly Brown, a committee member. She told Mr. Price he should not be involved in a planned post-mortem of what went wrong. “We’d like to have you removed from this,” she said. Judy Downs, the executive director of the Polk County Democrats — who is not on the State Central Committee — said in an interview that she had been worried about the appearance of cronyism. “Some of the decisions just made it really hard to defend against accusations of cronyism, or conspiracy, frankly,” she said. Sean Bagniewski, the chairman of the Democratic Party in Polk County, which includes Des Moines, said the coziness between state party leaders, vendors and candidates did not originate under Mr. Price. “I think it’s been this way for quite some time,” he said. “It’s kind of like the little families that control petroleum countries. You’ve got access to resources that everybody wants, and you kind of become your own little kingdom of consultants and advisers.” Maggie Astor contributed reporting.

2020,Trump Accuses Media and Democrats of Exaggerating Coronavirus Threat,"The accusations came as other elements of the federal government moved to head off a broader wave of infections like those in China. WASHINGTON — President Trump and members of his administration mobilized on Friday to confront the threat of the coronavirus — not just the outbreak, but the news media and the Democrats they accused of exaggerating its danger. While stock markets tumbled, companies searched for new supply chains and health officials scrambled to prevent a spread of the virus, Mr. Trump and his aides, congressional allies and backers in the conservative media sought to blame the messenger and the political opposition in the latest polarizing moment in the nation’s capital. Mr. Trump said that news outlets like CNN were “doing everything they can to instill fear in people,” while some Democrats were “trying to gain political favor by saying a lot of untruths.” His acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, went even further, telling conservative activists that journalists were hyping the coronavirus because “they think this will bring down the president; that’s what this is all about.” At a campaign rally on Friday evening in South Carolina, the president denounced Democrats, describing the concerns they have expressed about the virus as “their new hoax” after the Russia investigation and then impeachment. “Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus,” he said. “We did one of the great jobs. You say, ‘How’s President Trump doing?’ They go, ‘Oh, not good, not good.’ They have no clue. They don’t have any clue. They cannot even count the votes in Iowa.” The accusations came as other elements of the federal government moved to head off a broader wave of infections like those in China. The State Department urged Americans to reconsider traveling to Italy, where the virus has spread, and health officials reported three more cases of unknown origin, in California, Oregon and Washington State, raising fears of local transmission. The World Health Organization reported cases in 56 countries and warned of a “very high” global risk, while stock markets closed their worst week since the 2008 financial crisis. The Department of Health and Human Services’ inspector general said that it would begin a “comprehensive review” of the federal government’s coronavirus response, speeding up a process that had already been underway to monitor how the health agency was organizing its resources for a potential domestic outbreak. While other presidents in moments like this have sought to transcend politics and assert national leadership, Mr. Trump has framed the issue in partisan terms while playing down the risk to the United States. Privately he has been consumed by concern that his enemies will use the coronavirus and the economic impact it has against him as he seeks re-election. Democrats said that Mr. Trump was making the crisis all about himself rather than the American public. “For Mick Mulvaney to suggest that Americans turn off their TVs and bury their heads in the sand when they’re worried about a global health pandemic is Orwellian, counterproductive, dangerous and would be repeating China’s mistake,” said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader. Tensions over the issue flared on Friday even at a congressional hearing on Iran when Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was quickly hit with questions about the coronavirus rather than the Jan. 3 drone strike that killed Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, the head of Iran’s elite security forces. Democrats argued that the virus posed a greater threat to Americans than General Suleimani, and Representative David Cicilline of Rhode Island asserted that the Trump administration had not been forthcoming about the real risks each presented. “Because of the dishonesty from this administration on this and many other issues, Americans have lost trust in their government,” Mr. Cicilline told the secretary. “Now we’re facing a serious global health crisis in the form of the coronavirus and trust is more important than ever.” Mr. Pompeo bristled at what he considered a political ambush. “We agreed that I’d come today to talk about Iran, and the first question today is not about Iran,” he complained. Republicans defended Mr. Pompeo by going on offense against the Democrats. “This hearing is a joke,” declared Representative Lee Zeldin of New York. With Vice President Mike Pence leading the response to the virus, the administration has moved to coordinate its communication with the public. But officials sought on Friday to dispel the impression that they were clamping down on scientific information or limiting the availability of experts whose tone has suggested more alarm than the president’s. In a briefing with congressional officials on Friday morning, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that he “was not muzzled” by Mr. Pence’s office, but he did say that he had to get permission for roughly a half-dozen television appearances that had already been planned. Administration officials held a briefing at the White House featuring Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services, along with Russell T. Vought, the budget director, and Eric Ueland, the White House legislative director. After each official read off a series of prepared talking points, they took only a handful of questions from journalists. Of the three officials, Mr. Azar went the furthest in suggesting that the United States might face a difficult next phase of the coronavirus, if it spreads. Mr. Trump has repeatedly told advisers he is concerned that Mr. Azar and others in the administration are presenting an “alarmist” view. “The administration has ignored or sidelined expert staff at agencies like the C.D.C. and the N.I.H., offered the public inconsistent and confusing information, and failed to provide clear leadership,” said Dr. Kathleen Rest, the executive director of the Union of Concerned Scientists and a health policy expert, referring to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health. Mr. Pence went to Florida on Friday for a previously scheduled fund-raiser for the state’s Republican delegation, although he planned to give a briefing to Gov. Ron DeSantis while there. He also stopped by the radio broadcaster Rush Limbaugh’s studio to insist that the administration was not focused on politics. “Washington is always going to have a political reflexive response to things,” Mr. Pence said. “But we’re going to tune that out.” Mr. Limbaugh has been among the conservative commentators who have blamed the news media and political opponents for overemphasizing the coronavirus, which he compared to the common cold. “It looks like the coronavirus is being weaponized as yet another element to bring down Donald Trump,” Mr. Limbaugh, who was recently given the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Mr. Trump, said on his show on Monday. That theme has been amplified by some of the president’s favorite Fox News hosts, like Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham, in recent days and animated Mr. Mulvaney’s appearance on Friday at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference in Oxon Hill, Md. “The reason you’re seeing so much attention to it today is that they think this is going to be the thing that brings down the president,” Mr. Mulvaney said. “That’s what this is all about it.” Mr. Mulvaney noted that the administration took action weeks ago to prevent a public health emergency by limiting travel from China, where the worst outbreak has centered. “Why didn’t you hear about it?” Mr. Mulvaney asked. “What was still going on four or five weeks ago? Impeachment, that’s all the press wanted to talk about.” The news media, in fact, has been covering the global spread of coronavirus intensively for months, including the Trump administration’s travel restrictions. Following the president’s lead, Mr. Mulvaney also minimized concerns over the virus. “The flu kills people,” he said. “This is not Ebola. It’s not SARS, it’s not MERS. It’s not a death sentence; it’s not the same as the Ebola crisis.” Mr. Trump sounded off to reporters as he left the White House for the rally in South Carolina. “They’re doing everything they can to instill fear in people, and I think it’s ridiculous,” Mr. Trump said of CNN and other news outlets. “And some of the Democrats are doing it the way it should be done, but some of them are trying to gain political favor by saying a lot of untruths.” His eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., even accused the president’s opponents of wishing for widespread deaths from the virus, citing a New York Times columnist who wrote that the illness should be called Trumpvirus. “For them to try to take a pandemic and seemingly hope that it comes here and kills millions of people so that they can end Donald Trump’s streak of winning is a new level of sickness,” he told Fox News from the conservative conference. That message was quickly picked up and repeated at the conference. “It’s overblown in the media,” said Lee Murphy, a congressional candidate in Delaware and an actor who played a defense secretary once on “House of Cards.” “They want to get at President Trump every chance they can, but this should not be political. I’m tired of it being overblown and being political.” Jeff Jordan, running for Congress in Virginia, said too much has been made of the coronavirus, which he compared with the common flu. “The media at large is not a fan of the president,” he said. “The media will take any opportunity they can to cause damage.” On Capitol Hill, the attacks on coverage drew scorn from Democrats. “The problem is the American people need to be able to trust that their government will tell them the truth, no matter what the truth is,” said Representative Andy Levin of Michigan. “And I’m very concerned that the American people cannot trust this government.” Tony Fratto, who served as a deputy press secretary to President George W. Bush during multiple crises, including the last time the stock markets fell so far so fast, said blaming others in such a situation is counterproductive and urged the White House to keep its attention on the underlying issue. “Focus only on health and safety, and I know they don’t believe this, but if they keep Americans safe, they will definitely get credit for it,” he said. “Because of the White House’s attacks, if things do go poorly, they’re going to be blamed for taking their eye off the ball even if they’ve done all the right things.” Reporting was contributed by Maggie Haberman, Lara Jakes, Catie Edmondson and Noah Weiland.

2020,Trump Accuses Schiff of Leaking Intelligence on Russia’s 2020 Interference,"Without evidence, President Trump accused the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee of leaking intelligence. WASHINGTON — President Trump on Tuesday accused Representative Adam B. Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, of leaking information about Russia’s efforts to interfere in the 2020 election, dismissed the intelligence as “exaggerated” and refused to acknowledge that Moscow was behind similar efforts in 2016. The president made the comments during a news conference at the end of his two-day visit in India. Before he took the first question from a reporter, Mr. Trump said that he did not plan on saying anything controversial. “Schiff leaked it, in my opinion — and he shouldn’t be leaking things like that,” Mr. Trump said without evidence, referring to the California Democrat. The president was responding to a question about recent intelligence briefings about Russia’s meddling in the upcoming election. “And if they don’t stop it, I can’t imagine that people are not going to go after them and find out what’s happening,” Mr. Trump said, reviving his accusation that the committee had been a source of improper leaks. Last week the president also called for an investigation into Mr. Schiff, to which Mr. Schiff responded: “Your false claims fool no one.” Mr. Trump’s dismissals of the 2020 assessment showed the president’s continuing mistrust in his own intelligence officials during another election campaign marred by Russia’s interference. The brush off came after intelligence officials briefed members of the intelligence committee about the persistence of Russia’s efforts to help Mr. Trump get re-elected in 2020, including new information about the Kremlin’s efforts to influence the Democratic primaries to aid Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Mr. Trump was particularly bothered that intelligence officials would share this information with Democrats, especially Mr. Schiff, who led the Trump impeachment inquiries, even though all members of the intelligence committee are entitled to these briefings as part of their oversight role. Mr. Trump privately complained that Democrats would “weaponize” the information. A day after the lawmakers’ briefing, Mr. Trump lashed out at Joseph Maguire, his outgoing director of national intelligence. A few days later, Mr. Trump named a loyalist without intelligence experience, Richard Grenell, to be director of national intelligence until a permanent replacement could be found. Most recently, Mr. Grenell was the American ambassador to Germany, where he had a polarizing reputation. The president’s deflection Tuesday of questions from reporters about the threat from Russia and the ominous remark about “going to go after” lawmakers were extraordinary, not only because of the potential impact on American democracy, but also because he pledged not to say anything that could cause controversy, as he had previously done at the end of other foreign trips. “I’m going to be not at all controversial, because I don’t want to blow the two days plus two days of travel on one answer — one little answer,"" Mr. Trump told reporters before he took questions. The news media, he said, would take something small and “blow it out, and that would be the end of the trip. They won’t even talk about the trip.” Minutes later, the president accused Mr. Schiff of leaking intelligence. transcript From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” Today: U.S. intelligence officials have concluded that the Russian government is supporting two very different candidates in the 2020 presidential race. David Sanger on why Russia is rooting for Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders. It’s Wednesday, February 26. David, tell us about these intelligence briefings. Well, the first one, and in some ways the most interesting one, is shrouded in a lot of mystery. We know that about a month ago, the F.B.I. went to Bernie Sanders. Mm-hmm. The F.B.I. frequently comes around to give general warnings to all the candidates, but that’s not what this was all about. This was about a very specific finding. And their message was, we have reason to believe that the Russians, through their own calculus, have determined that you’re their favorite candidate among the Democrats in the primary. Hmm. And that they may well already be intervening on your behalf. And David, what was Sanders’s reaction, as both a senator and a presidential candidate, to this piece of information? The only reaction that we know about, Michael, is that he decided to keep it secret. He hasn’t said very much about what he thought about it. He just decided to say nothing about it, which itself is a really interesting choice. What do you mean? Well, he said that because it was classified, and he doesn’t talk about classified briefings, he just stayed silent. But there are lots of political reasons for him to stay silent as well. Like what? He doesn’t want to appear or be portrayed by President Trump as Russia’s favorite or Russia’s dupe in the election. If you’re Bernie Sanders and you’re thinking ahead to the general election, you only want one Russian puppet to be in this election, and you want it to be Donald Trump. So he knew right away that Trump would use this as an effort to try to equalize what the Russians were doing on behalf of President Trump in 2016 — Gotcha. — and what we think they will be doing with what they’re doing with Bernie Sanders. Because if the Russians are backing both of them, it’s like the Russians are backing neither of them. OK, so that’s intelligence briefing number one. What about the second one? Well, the second one is bigger, a lot more formal, and we know a lot more about it. It was February 13. [MUSIC]: And good evening. I’m Erin Burnett. We are live from Las Vegas where, in less than an hour, our Democratic presidential town halls will begin. And we have more on that in just a moment. But first, the breaking news. And the Director of National Intelligence Office, Shelby Pierson, has the unenviable job of being the mission manager for election interference for the Director of National Intelligence, goes in to brief the House Intelligence Committee. Hmm. And so the first thing she says is: There is Russian interference underway. The second thing she says is: The Russians had and still have a preference for Donald Trump as president. So unlike the Sanders briefing, this one does leak. This is not a four-year-ago flashback, folks. This is 2020. Well, Democrats are rekindling an old flame — Russia collusion. Yes. I mean, this is so idiotic. And you notice how when they win elections, the Russians didn’t do anything? Mm. So — And a few days after that leaks out, we learn about the Sanders briefing a month before. And of course, as soon as these leak, everyone’s furious. And if this came out a month ago, how do you think it came out now, if you had the briefing a month ago? I’ll let you guess about one day before the Iowa — Nevada caucus. Why do you think it came out? It was The Washington Post? Good friends. Sanders is furious that the news of his briefing came out just before the Nevada caucuses. Right. And blames, among others, corporate media. Because The Washington Post had, I think, first broken this story. President Trump is furious that it’s back in the ether again that the Russians are involved in the election and behind him. Here we go again. Did you see it? This story. Aren’t people bored? And so at a rally in Las Vegas, he says, this is all fabrication. It’s all coming from the Democrats. I was told that was happening. I was told a week ago. They said, you know, they’re trying to start a rumor. It’s disinformation. That’s the only thing they’re good at. They’re not good at anything else. They get nothing done — Do Nothing Democrats. No, actually, it was coming from his own Office of the Director of National Intelligence, all of whom work for him. These people are crazy! So regardless of how this became public — and it seems like both Sanders and Trump are very unhappy that it did become public — it is public now that Russia is supportive of both President Trump and Bernie Sanders. So how did the intelligence community come to that conclusion? What are they seeing out there? Well, we don’t know exactly how they came to it, because this is wrapped up in their sources and methods — the one thing that they protect more than anything. Mm-hmm. We think they have humans sources inside Russia. They certainly did in 2016, a unique human source who had access to the Kremlin. They certainly have lines into Russian networks. That’s what the National Security Agency does. And finally, they get to see some of the product as it shows up on Facebook or Reddit or something like that. Mm-hmm. And here, the differences from 2016 are really fascinating. Like what? Well, in 2016, you’ll remember that there were Russians who were posing as Americans and putting out Facebook ads or going into Facebook posts. They got booted off for inauthentic behavior — they weren’t really Americans. So what are they doing now? They’re putting much of the same kind of propaganda and false charges on forums like Reddit, hoping that they will get picked up by real Facebook users, who are real Americans, and will be repeated on their posts. And of course, Facebook can’t throw them off, because they’re real Americans expressing their political views. They’re protected by First Amendment rights. And it would be pretty unseemly if Facebook began tossing off Americans saying, oh, you heard that from a Russian bot. Hmm. In the Cold War, the Soviets called these people “useful idiots” because they unintentionally picked up a Russian theme, a piece of disinformation, and repeated it until it became organic. Right. In the election, they might call them “useful partisans,” because they’re going to pluck this out of the political ether, repeat it on cable television, presumably in support of Senator Sanders or President Trump, or maybe someone else who emerges. So David, how do you make sense of the fact that Russia is trying to help the two candidates in the race who are about as ideologically far apart as imaginable — Trump, Sanders — at the same time? Well, Michael, I’ve been trying to puzzle this out, because at first, it didn’t seem to make any sense to me. And then, the more interviewing I did with more experts that I trust, they all said, you know, David, actually, it makes perfect sense. And it makes perfect sense for three reasons. So the first one is that both these candidates are at the outer extremes of their own parties. Not the far extreme, but they attract really partisan supporters. And the best way to create chaos is to have two polarized groups of political supporters going after each other. Mm. You know, the Trump supporters and the Sanders supporters, they don’t leave a whole lot of space in the middle. And if you’re the Russians, that’s perfect. It’s the equivalent of creating a drought in the forest, just before you toss in the match. Remember, the Russians don’t go out and create the conditions. All they do is go out and exploit the conditions. Help me understand what the exploitation of a polarized Sanders and Trump electorate looks like. Well, you could take any of a number of issues that are hot-button social issues and use that to further divide Americans. We give hundreds of millions of dollars. You know what they give to us? Nothing. Nothing. They give us nothing. Criminals! You can use immigration, right? On which they differ dramatically. Day one, we will rescind all of Trump’s hateful and racist immigration executive orders. [APPLAUSE] You can use Medicare for All, on which they differ dramatically. You could use the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, on which they differ dramatically. So — And just kind of pump up those issues on social media, on your Reddit page, and hope it gets picked up on Facebook. And just generally make Americans angry at each other over it? Have the country screaming at each other. Bottom line is Donald Trump is dangerous and toxic for this country. For many reasons, I think Bernie Sanders is a dangerous man, but the thing that I thought — I do. I mean, I think he’s a very dangerous man. This is someone who is not stable. And I’ve been saying it from the beginning, and I will continue to say it until somebody looks into his mental stability. The socialist wing has completely taken over and is now in control, where the moderate voices no longer matter at this point in the race. And why is chaos good for Russia? I can tell why it’s bad for us. It makes the United States look like a place that can’t get its act together. It helps lead to charges of election interference and election irregularities that bring American elections down to the level of Russian elections. Hmm. It makes democracy look like a chaotic form of governance that can’t really be trusted to make progress. Best of all, you’re weakening the United States, keeping it consumed in some domestic furor, rather than thinking about pushing back against the Russians in Syria, or elsewhere in the Middle East, or in Crimea, or coming to the support of your allies in NATO. We’ll be right back. OK. So that’s theory number one, which kind of seems to see both of these candidates as co-equals in the creation of a chaotic American political life. That’s right. What is theory number two for why Russia would be rooting for both Trump and Sanders? Well, theory number two is truly cynical, Michael. It’s that the Russians really do favor Trump, and they think that Bernie Sanders is the most beatable Democrat. Hmm. Now, they may be wrong about that. There’s lots of polling that suggest he could win. But the Russians’s calculus at this moment may be that if you want to keep Donald Trump in office, Bernie Sanders is the best candidate to go do that. Gotcha. Now, that then raises the question, why would they continue to support Trump? And I think the answer to that is that Donald Trump is the only member of the Trump administration who doesn’t sign on to the anti-Russian cast of American policy. Official policy is, we push back on the Russians from Ukraine to the Middle East and so forth. Donald Trump doesn’t want to hear any of that. I think that we would have a chance to have a very good relationship with Russia and a very good chance — a very good relationship with President Putin. I would hope — Putin, obviously, likes that. That’s right. Official policy is we continue sanctions on the Russians. A lot of people say having Russia — which is a power — having them inside the room is better than having them outside the room. By the way, there were numerous people during the G7 that felt that way. And we didn’t take a vote or anything, but we did discuss it. My inclination is to say, yes, they should be in. Donald Trump’s been talking to the French about letting Russia back into the G8, the group of eight countries, and beginning to lift sanctions. Official policy is that we keep sanctions on as long as the Russians continue to annex Crimea. You know, the people of Crimea, from what I’ve heard, would rather be with Russia than where they were. And you have to look at that also. Donald Trump’s view is, why do we care about Crimea anyway? Why don’t the other neighbors care about that? So they have all kinds of reasons to believe that Donald Trump in the second term would be a continuation of the Donald Trump in the first term, who wasn’t going to give them a hard time about their territorial or nuclear ambitions. OK, that’s the Trump side of this. What makes the Russians convinced that Sanders is the most beatable Democrat? Because as you said, that’s not exactly what the polling suggests. It isn’t what the polling suggests, and it’s an interesting question why they believe that. Remember, the Russians didn’t think Donald Trump was going to win early in the last presidential cycle and really only came to supporting him in an active way in the very last months of the campaign. So they may not know right now any more than we know. Why would they know? Mm-hmm. You know, when Fidel Castro came into office, you know what he did? He had a massive literacy program. Is that a bad thing? But they look at Bernie Sanders, and they see somebody who talks in ways that other American politicians rarely do. How many other American politicians have come out and said admiring things about Fidel Castro? Mm. You know what? I think teaching people to read and write is a good thing. How many other American candidates have proudly called themselves democratic socialists? So they think that all of these things make Sanders vulnerable to the charge from President Trump that Sanders is actually the Russian-loving socialist in the race. OK, so what is the third explanation for why Russia would support both candidates? Well, the third explanation is life is uncertain, and they could live with Bernie Sanders. Hmm. And why? Today, we are preparing to send soldiers to Afghanistan who were not even born on September 11, 2001. Because, like Donald Trump, he’s got a real aversion to interventions around the world. We have got to stop endless wars. We have got to cut military spending. So that you can pay for Medicare for All and other social programs. So the thinking is that Russia would be quite happy, maybe even elated, with four more years of Donald Trump. But if they’re going to have to live with a Democratic president, they’re perfectly fine with Bernie Sanders. Especially because the Democrats have become the party of anti-Russia sentiment. Hmm. Right? It’s almost a flip from what we thought about in the post-Cold War era where the Democrats were all about integrating Russia into the world community, making them part of the G8, coming up with economic packages, turning them into a European nation. Remember all that? Mm-hmm. You haven’t heard a word of that from any of the Democrats now except Sanders. And so you’re now seeing Bernie Sanders just in the past few days — And what I say to Mr. Putin — if elected president, trust me, you are not going to be interfering in American elections. Senator — — begin to try to sound a bit tougher in his international relations views, precisely because he recognizes this is a big vulnerability. Mr. Putin is a thug. He is an autocrat. He may be a friend of Donald Trump’s. He’s not a friend of mine. Let me tell you — So right now, we still don’t have the evidence. Remember, in the 2016 election, it wasn’t until 2017 — really, after Donald Trump was about to be inaugurated — that we got a sense of the scope of the Russian effort. Mm. What we do know is that Bernie Sanders now has a Russia problem. Mm. And that problem, if anything, is probably going to drive him to sound more hostile to Moscow than he naturally would be or he has been in the past. And how does that serve Russia? I’m not sure it does. Because once influence operations are exposed, it can drive the intended target — in this case, Bernie Sanders and his supporters — to the opposite corner. Mm-hmm. So you know, Donald Trump today is the last politician in America who could actually get behind lifting sanctions against Russia, because everybody would say, you’re in Putin’s pocket. And they run the risk of driving Bernie Sanders from the candidate who wanted to go talk to the Russians, to the candidate who could never talk to the Russians. Hmm. Thank you, David. Thank you. This is — Mayor Buttigieg, we want to bring you into this conversation. Why would the Russians want to be working on behalf of Bernie Sanders? During Tuesday night’s Democratic debate in South Carolina, candidates repeatedly invoked Russia’s support for Trump and Sanders, with Mayor Pete Buttigieg saying that Russia favored them because they represent political extremes. I’ll tell you what the Russians want. They don’t have a political party. They want chaos. And chaos is what is coming our way. I mean, look, if you think the last four years has been chaotic, divisive, toxic, exhausting, imagine spending the better part of 2020 with Bernie Sanders versus Donald Trump. Think about what that will be like for this country. At one point, Mike Bloomberg turned to Sanders and declared that the reason Russia supported Sanders was because its government believed that Sanders would lose to Trump. Vladimir Putin thinks that Donald Trump should be president of the United States. And that’s why Russia is helping you get elected, so you’ll lose to him. Oh, Mr. Bloomberg! Sanders, in response, denounced Russia’s efforts to meddle in the election. And let me tell Mr. Putin, who interfered in the 2016 election, trying to bring Americans against Americans — hey, Mr. Putin, if I’m president of the United States, trust me, you’re not gonna interfere in any more American elections. For highlights and analysis of that debate, listen to this morning’s episode of “The Latest.” You can find it on the “Daily” Feed or by searching for “The Latest” wherever you listen. We’ll be right back. Here’s what else you need to know today. Now, it’s not so much a question of if this will happen anymore, but rather more a question of exactly when this will happen and how many people in this country will become infected. On Tuesday, health officials warned that the coronavirus will almost certainly begin spreading across the United States and that Americans should begin preparations now. During a news conference, Doctor Anne Schuchat of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that an American outbreak might require a wide range of actions, from closing schools to asking employees to work from home. We will be transparent with the public about these measures and the potential that these tools will be necessary. There is literally a playbook for the use of these tools. As of Tuesday night, the U.S. had 57 confirmed cases of the virus, all of whom are in isolation in hospitals. That’s it for “The Daily.” I’m Michael Barbaro. See you tomorrow.

2020,Trump Acquitted of Two Impeachment Charges in Near Party-Line Vote,"As Republicans rallied behind President Trump, Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, the party’s 2012 presidential nominee, joined Democrats in voting to convict, the only senator to cross party lines. WASHINGTON — After five months of hearings, investigations and revelations about President Trump’s dealings with Ukraine, a divided United States Senate acquitted him on Wednesday of charges that he abused his power and obstructed Congress to aid his own re-election, bringing an acrimonious impeachment trial to its expected end. In a pair of votes whose outcome was never in doubt, the Senate fell well short of the two-thirds margin that would have been needed to remove the 45th president. The verdicts came down — after three weeks of debate — almost entirely along party lines, with every Democrat voting “guilty” on both charges and Republicans uniformly voting “not guilty” on the obstruction of Congress charge. Only one Republican, Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, broke with his party to judge Mr. Trump guilty of abuse of power. It was the third impeachment trial of a president and the third acquittal in American history, and it ended the way it began: with Republicans and Democrats at odds. They disagreed over Mr. Trump’s conduct and his fitness for office, even as some members of his own party conceded the basic allegations that undergirded the charges, that he sought to pressure Ukraine to smear his political rivals. But in a sign of the widening partisan divide testing the country and its institutions, the verdict did not promise finality, which members of both parties conceded would come only after the November election. The president himself did not directly address his acquittal, but shortly afterward, he announced on Twitter that he would make a public statement on Thursday at the White House about what he called “our Country’s VICTORY on the Impeachment Hoax.” He then tweeted an attack ad against Mr. Romney that called the senator a “Democrat secret asset.” See how each senator will vote on whether to convict and remove President Trump from office. At the Capitol earlier in the day, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., who presided over the trial, put the question to senators shortly after 4 p.m.: “Senators how say you? Is the respondent, Donald John Trump, president of the United States guilty or not guilty?” Seated at their mahogany desks, senators stood one by one to answer “guilty” or “not guilty” to each of the two articles of impeachment. “It is, therefore, ordered and adjudged that the said Donald John Trump be, and he is hereby, acquitted of the charges in said articles,” declared Chief Justice Roberts after the second article was defeated. Democratic leaders immediately insisted the result was illegitimate, the product of a self-interested cover-up by Republicans, and promised to continue their investigations of Mr. Trump. “The verdict of this kangaroo court will be meaningless,” Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said moments before the vote. “By refusing the facts — by refusing witnesses and documents — the Republican majority has placed a giant asterisk, the asterisk of a sham trial, next to the acquittal of President Trump, written in permanent ink.” transcript From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” Today: President Donald Trump is acquitted of both articles of impeachment. Just one senator crossed party lines to vote to convict him. A conversation with Mitt Romney about that decision. It’s Thursday, February 6. Mark Leibovich, tell me about these conversations that you’ve been having with Senator Mitt Romney. Well, Mitt Romney has always fascinated me as kind of a wild card in his political life as a moderate governor of Massachusetts, as a, quote, “severely conservative” presidential candidate in 2012. Then, as a critic of Donald Trump when Donald Trump took over the party. Then, as a potential Donald Trump cabinet member when he talked to him about being secretary of state in 2016. Then, as a Senate candidate, someone who I wouldn’t say embraced Donald Trump, but someone who certainly didn’t push him away. And then as a senator, someone who has been fairly unshy at times about defying Donald Trump, being critical of him. Right. Somebody who is seen as ideologically malleable. Someone who’s seen as inconsistent. Correct. And in this impeachment proceeding, he has been the ultimate wild card. No one knew what he was going to do really. People had ideas back and forth. But you never know what you’re going to get with Mitt Romney. So I had been asking his office — and I’m certainly not the only reporter who had been asking — whether I could hang around with him a little bit, whether I could actually go through this process with him. Which I figured was a bit of a long shot because he’s been in such demand. And to my surprise last week, right as we were leading up to the big vote on witnesses, Mitt Romney agreed to sit down with me. Wow. Thank you again. [INAUDIBLE] We went up to his hideaway office, which was like a kind of — Hideaway office? It’s like a remote office. Every senator gets one. I mean, here’s the question. Have you every taken a nap in here? I have not. And Mitt Romney’s was filled with M&M’s. Oh my god, peanut M&M’s. This was like a little break in the proceedings. So we didn’t have a lot of time. I feel your body language. So I’m going to be real quick here. And I was amazed at how open he was about the kinds of things he was thinking about. Hello. Hi. It’s good to see you. Good to see you. So just sitting there, you’ve sat there, now, what, a week and a half? No, it’s been a couple of months. [LAUGHS] Well, I know it feels like a a couple of months. Yes, probably. What did we say, nine days? Is that it? Yeah. Does the experience of sitting in the chamber, listening to this day in and day out, intensify the burden at all? Does it make it seem weightier? Does it make it seem less weighty? What’s it been like for you? I think it was most weighty having the chief justice come in the first time. And I think there was a sense of how important this is and how historic it is. We have to do what we feel is right in the case. But I think we also have to think more broadly as to what are the implications nationally and what are the implications for the institution of the Senate. What about the presidency? And the presidency, both. I mean, that’s — I mean, put aside impeachment. What about just the nature of right and wrong? Like what a chief executive of this country should do. I mean, isn’t that on trial to some degree? Well, I think if there were a president that really was going to be removed under the crime or misdemeanor standard, he or she would have done something wrong. By definition that would — Yes, one would hope. But by and large, most matters of right and wrong associated with the president are going to be determined by the electorate in the upcoming election. Impeachment is not to judge right and wrong alone. It is to judge right and wrong in the context of, has there been a high crime and misdemeanor? And one of the last things he brought up to me was a sense of obligation he felt to the United States Constitution. This is — it’s a constitutional issue. I feel a sense of deep responsibility to abide by the Constitution and to determine absent that pulls from the right and pulls from the left. What is the right thing to do? What does the Constitution demand? So it was very clear that this was weighing on him. And I got sort of ushered out of his office. And he had to go back to the floor to continue the trial. O.K., wait. Do we go this way or this way? I’ll show you. We’ll go — We’re walking out. He goes back to the floor. I took a right turn in a hallway. And there was Amy Klobuchar, who was back in Washington for about 36 hours to do her impeachment stuff, taking a break from her presidential campaign. And I said, Senator, can I ask you a few questions about Mitt Romney? Mitt Romney — have you thought of this role here just as kind of a fellow center — not centrist, but someone who is a bit of a wild card in all this? Um, uh, uh — And the name Mitt Romney sort of stopped her in her tracks a little bit. Hold on. I’m sorry. Yes, that’s a good question. So I hope he plays that leadership role that I think John McCain would have played if he was here. I thought like every hour about if Senator McCain was here. And she used this as a prompt to talk about John McCain. The very important role that John McCain, the maverick, played in the United States Senate, as someone who could recruit other potentially dissident Republicans to his side and create a counterforce within the prevailing force that is the Republican Party in the Senate. So she’s raising the specter that Mitt Romney could be a John McCain in this moment, i.e., could buck the party and perhaps even take other Republicans with him in siding with Democrats in impeachment. Correct. She saw him as someone who was genuinely agonizing, someone who could be a leader and someone that no one really had a grip on at this point. Has he demonstrated at all that he could have that like capability to actually play a McCain-like — Well, at least he’s been willing to tell the truth here about the need to have the witness, which I’ve appreciated. This is his moment to shine and hopefully he can bring some people with him. Thank you. So after my conversation with Amy Klobuchar, I left the Hill. I said to Romney’s office, I said, I’d love to keep in touch with him. We did not talk about his ultimate decision. He didn’t want to talk about it yet. He made that pretty clear. But also, I wanted to get a window into his decision-making process. And we had about five days until this was all going to come to a head. So to my surprise and delight, they said, come on back on Wednesday morning. Wow, the day of — The day of the decision. The day of the final vote. Senator — Long time no see. I know. O.K. So on Wednesday morning, what happens? What do you do? Wednesday morning, 10:30. I went into Mitt Romney’s office. Let’s do this. We have a table, table there. We have a table there. I felt myself getting quite nervous, which is interesting because I almost — you always sort of know what you’re going to get in an interview. I just didn’t know how this was going to go. This was a real jump ball. I mean — You called it a wild card. It was a wild card. You could call it whatever you want. But I just didn’t know how this was going to go. He looked exactly like he always looks, which is fresh as a daisy. He hadn’t been sleeping. But you couldn’t tell. He looked ready to go. He didn’t look like he was in a mood for any kind of small talk. I wasn’t either. Anyway, so anyone care about what you have to say today? Probably. Probably. All right, let’s get right to it. Do you have — do you know how you’re going to vote? Yeah, yeah, I’m going to vote yes on the first article. No on the second. He said that he would vote yes to convict the president on charges of abuse of power. And he would vote no on the second impeachment article, which is obstruction of Congress. There’s no question the president fought providing documents and witnesses. But he did so through the use of the law. And the House, in my view, should have gone to the courts to get that resolved. By not going to the courts, they — They forfeited. — I don’t know how they make the case. And as soon as he started talking, I could see the emotion in his face. I could hear him, not choke up, but certainly there was a strain in his voice that I had not heard before. On the first article, I think the case was made. And I believe that attempting to corrupt an election to maintain power is about as an egregious an assault on the Constitution as can be made. And for that reason, it is a high crime and misdemeanor. And I have no choice under the oath I took but to express that conclusion. He said, basically, I think he’d gone back and forth. There’s an old Protestant hymn that we sing in our church called “Do what is right, let the consequence follow.” I’m sure I’m doing the right thing. I don’t know that I can weigh the consequence at this stage. But it’s going to be substantial. Yeah I mean, this is interesting. Wow, I mean — But you know I’m a very religious person. And when you swear an oath before God to apply impartial justice, that’s what I believe I have to do. And by the way, I believe other senators do the same thing. I’m not the only one voting my conscience. But not voting my conscience, in order for me to have a better political and personal benefit, would subject my own conscience to its censure. So I just — I don’t have a choice there. This for me is fundamental to my oath to God and fundamental to how our country must work, which is that people have to be seen as honest in fulfilling that oath that they take. When did you make this decision? I tried to keep from forming a final decision as I listened to both sides — As a juror. — and I went all the way — as a juror. And as I was going, of course, sometimes I’d be swayed one way. Sometimes I’d be swayed the other. I reached my conclusion really after the last day of questions and answers. So that would have been Friday — or Thursday? Yeah, Thursday. But I can tell you that throughout this entire period, there’s not been a morning I’ve gotten up after 4 a.m. Just obviously thinking about how important this, with the consequences. But then also analyzing, going back and looking at the testimony, reading the briefs of the two sides, going back through Federalist Papers. And then applying logic to it. What was it like for you to sit in — or stand, in some cases — through what was a very tribal gathering last night at the State of the Union. And I was watching you quite a bit because I was up in the gallery. It was quite a speech. And you knew what you — the current you were going to be swimming up against in 24 hours. What was that like? I think people have a very hard time understanding how you just don’t vote with the team, and how you can make a decision of this significance, unless you’re just doing it with the team. And it’s like, well, then think back to a jury you may have been on. And ask did you just go with whether it was a male or a female, or a black or a white or Hispanic, or non-Hispanic? Or did you try and apply a partial justice? Did you take your oath seriously? And you take your oath seriously. I agree with most of the things the president has done. The policies he put in with regards to the economy are very close to the policies I campaigned on four years before. I agree with those things. The fact the economy is doing as well as it is in part because of those policies. So he’s going to take a bow for those policies, I — I’m with him. So I’m with the pre — and by the way, I think he’s going to get re-elected. I think if Bernie or Elizabeth is the nominee on the Democratic side, he’ll get elected in a landslide. I will still vote for the policies I agree with. I’ll stand and applaud when he says things that are right. But then he did one thing we know of that was a very seriously wrong thing. And not to call it grievously wrong would be to violate my oath, violate my conscience, subject me to the censure of history. What kind of consequences do you think you’ll endure for this? Unimaginable. I don’t know what they’ll be. There’s some I know. I know there will be consequence. And I just have to recognize that. And do what you think is right. And — What was interesting to me — and this is one of those things that doesn’t pick up so much on tape — but you see his facial expressions. I mean, Mitt Romney is a very smooth character in his own ways. His face got red. He had a bit of dread in his eyes. It was as if he knew that a chandelier was about to drop on his head. Wow. The reason I wanted witnesses — and that was the area that there was a greatest discussion within our caucus, was we don’t get witnesses. The reason I wanted to hear from John Bolton is that I hoped beyond measure that he would say something that would provide reasonable doubt so I wouldn’t have to vote to convict. So you were looking for reasons not to vote for — Look, my personal and political and team affiliation made me very much not want to have to convict. I mean, I want to be with my colleagues in the Senate. I don’t want to be the skunk at the garden party. I don’t want to have the disdain of Republicans across the country. I was at the grocery store this weekend, and a guy went by me and said “traitor.” Where was this? In Utah? No, it was in Florida. I was down at one of Ann’s competitions. Another person yelled from their cars as I was taking my groceries out of the car. Yelled from his car, “Stick with the team!” And so I recognized this is going to be a whole different level. But — Why do you think Mitt Romney did this interview with you? I mean, he could have decided to show up and vote to convict the president. Why sit down with The New York Times and talk about all the agony and explain himself? Well, I mean, one thing I’ve always been interested in with Mitt Romney is that he has always been, not in a self-absorbed way, but he’s always been very aware of his own political narrative. He has been aware of how he was viewed, maybe as a political opportunist. Him maybe doing things out of expediency rather than principle. And I think ultimately, one of the things that this Senate chapter has done for him and his career is it has enabled him to maybe rewrite the ending. Maybe recast himself as someone who did feel as if he was doing the right thing at the expense of whatever the expedient decision at the moment would have been. — any number of issues. Does any of that weigh on you? You’re in your 70s now. This is probably your last job. Maybe this is an important enough issue that I could really take a stand, and I mean, and just do the right thing. I mean, does this — do you ever think about these decisions in light of other decisions you have made when you had more politically to lose? I haven’t given the full analysis to my whole political history. But I will with time, particularly I’m sure in retirement. My guess is that I was influenced in some cases by political benefit. And I regret that. And probably not to the extent to which my opponents tried to characterize it. But looking back, there’s an item or two where I said I wish I had said that differently or taken a different position rather. I don’t mean to make it just seem like just a couple of words. No, take the position that I — and as is often the case, I have found in business, in particular, but also in politics, that when something is in your personal best interest, the ability of the mind to rationalize that that’s the right thing is really quite extraordinary. And I’m talking about myself. And I’ve seen it in others. I’ve seen it in myself. Especially in politics generally. And by the way, and you could swear on a Bible that you are doing exactly what is right. But and that’s because our mind has the capacity to do that. In this case, I worked very hard to prevent my personal feelings and my personal desire from influencing a decision that was going to be an important decision and the most difficult decision I’d ever make. I think history is important to Mitt Romney. It’s important to him for a lot of reasons. I mean, part of it is his ego. I mean, people in the U.S. Senate want to think that everything they do is actually relevant to history. But I think when you’re Mitt Romney — when you’ve lived a lot of history, when you’ve been the nominee of a Republican Party, when you’ve run twice for president and lost, when you’ve held a number of offices — things like how you make a decision that will mark you forever are important in the historical context. And you could argue, you could be a cynic and say, oh, well, they’re just full of themselves, they care about how history will view them. Who does that? But I actually think it was important and a very kind of formative part of the process of coming to this decision for Mitt Romney. Was to just talk about it. Was just to talk about it. Right, you cannot send that off [INAUDIBLE]. Thank you. Thanks. Appreciate it. O.K., all done. As you were leaving the office, he’s just told you what he’s going to do. What are you thinking? Well, I mean, part of it is just pure, straight-ahead, opportunistic reporter think, which is God, I hope they don’t call me and say he changed his mind. Because, you know, he’s going to go on the floor in a few hours and shock the world. I mean, not to put too fine a point on it. But this is a very momentous decision that would be a major headline at the end of a process that people had assumed was over, right? I mean, it wasn’t a major twist. But it was certainly a twist in something that would be remembered here. But beyond your own journalistic — Beyond my own — — self-absorption. — self-absorption. My thought was, I hope he knows what he is in for. We’ll be right back. So Mark, what happens after your interview with Romney on Wednesday morning? O.K. So Wednesday morning becomes Wednesday afternoon. It was probably about 12:20 p.m. in Washington. I walked out of the office. I headed back to the New York Times, Washington bureau. And I knew he was scheduled to speak at 2 o’clock. And he took the mic. Thank you, Mr. President. The Constitution is at the foundation of our Republic’s success. And of course, you want to actually be watching this because, one, you don’t know if what you just learned is going to hold, whether he changed his mind or not. The allegations made in the articles of impeachment are very serious. But the other thing is, how does this look and feel when he’s actually delivering it to the world? And one of things I was struck by is that he looked really nervous. He looked a lot more nervous on the floor than he did with me. I take an oath before God as enormously consequential. And he got emotional at a couple of points. I knew from the outset that being tasked with judging the president, the leader of my own party, would be the most difficult decision I have ever faced. I was not wrong. The people will judge us for how well and faithfully we fulfill our duty. And it took him a while to get through this. Yeah, I was watching it. He was flipping the pages — Absolutely, yeah. — and speaking with all sorts of pregnant pauses. The grave question the Constitution tasked senators to answer is whether the president committed an act so extreme and egregious that it rises to the level of a high crime and misdemeanor. Yes, he did. Absolutely, yeah. And I don’t think he was doing that for any kind of dramatic reason. I think it was just a genuinely hard speech to get through. And at the end of the speech, Mitt Romney invoked his children and his grandchildren. With my vote, I will tell my children and their children that I did my duty to the best of my ability. This is something he does fairly regularly. But it also, you know he’s playing for keeps here. I will only be one name among many, no more no less, to future generations of Americans who look at the record of this trial. We are all footnotes at best in the annals of history. But in the most powerful nation on earth, the nation conceived in liberty and justice, that distinction is enough for any citizen. But I think maybe there’s some false modesty at work here too. I mean, he’s not a footnote. He is a dissenting voice. And the Republican Party has not had many of those at all through this process. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. And then he walked off into history. So, Mark, after Romney’s speech, the full Senate formally reconvenes. The majority leader is recognized. Mr. Chief Justice, the Senate is not ready to vote on the articles of impeachment. And becomes a court of impeachment. Each senator, when his or her name is called, will stand in his or her place and vote “guilty” or “not guilty,” as required by rule 23 of the Senate rules on impeachment. So what happens? Chief Justice John Roberts gives final instructions to the jury, or the U.S. Senate. The formal articles of impeachment are read aloud. The question is on the first article of impeachment. Senators, how say you? Is the respondent Donald John Trump guilty or not guilty? And he calls a vote. A roll call vote is required. The clerk will call the roll. Mr. Alexander. Not guilty. Mr. Alexander, not guilty. Miss Baldwin. Guilty. Miss Baldwin, guilty. On the first article of impeachment, presidential abuse of power — Mr. Romney. Guilty. Mr. Romney, guilty. Mitt Romney votes guilty. He votes to convict. Two-thirds of the senators present not having pronounced him guilty. The Senate ajudges that the respondent, Donald John Trump, president of the United States, is not guilty as charged in the first article of impeachment. On the first article of impeachment, abuse of presidential power, the president was acquitted by a final count of 52 noes, 48 yeses. Two-thirds of the senators present not having pronounced him guilty. The Senate ajudges that respondent Donald John Trump, president of the United States, is not guilty as charged in the second article of impeachment. On the second article of impeachment, which is obstruction of Congress, Mitt Romney voted to acquit the president. The president was acquitted by 53 noes and 47 yeses. Without objection, the motion is agreed to. The Senate sitting as a court of impeachment stands adjourned. Sine die. And in the end, Mitt Romney was the only U.S. senator, and the first senator in U.S. history, to vote to convict a president of his own party of an impeachable offense. You could have hinted at this, Mark. But there is something really intriguing about choosing this moment for Mitt Romney to take a stand. His career — I covered it very closely, covered 2012 campaign — is littered with examples of moments where it seemed he wanted to be on both sides of an issue. Or he evolved in ways that felt opportunistic. Yet, at this moment, he becomes a senator of conscience. And he’s not malleable. But it’s a moment where his vote to convict the president on one of two counts has no impact whatsoever on the process. And when you think back to people like John McCain, as Senator Amy Klobuchar did, he stood for conscience at moments that had huge consequence. The decisive vote in the Affordable Care Act. Was the deciding vote on Affordable Care Act, for example. In this case, Romney is the lone dissenting voice in a case that he can have no influence over. So what do you make of that? Here’s why that’s important. One, Donald Trump has craved some kind of way to say this is just a partisan witch hunt. Every Republican voted to support me. This denies him that opportunity. The other part in the context of Mitt Romney’s career is, again, as you mentioned, this is not something Mitt Romney has traditionally done. Now you could argue the counter-factual. If he was up for re-election in Utah next year, would he vote differently? If he was thinking about running for president and going for the Republican nomination in 2020, would he vote differently? I think at this point, he has lived a long career. He has had a long, long life. And he would say at this point that he is answering to different forces. Regardless of whether it changes any of the dynamics of this Congress and the Republican Party and this president? Yeah, I don’t think it will change any dynamics at all, except that Mitt Romney’s life is going to get a lot more uncomfortable for reasons that I think he can handle, given how he weighed this decision. Well to that point, what has been the reaction for Romney in the hours since he went on the floor, gave that speech and then cast a vote to convict the president? I would say quite unpleasant. Everything from the president of the United States’s son Don Jr. calling for his expulsion from the Senate. His own niece Romney McDaniel, the chair of the Republican National Committee, publicly rebuking him basically on Twitter. His own niece? His own niece, yes, calls for recall elections in Utah. Things like that. Now this is a window into the kinds of things that are in store for someone who dissents from President Trump. And maybe what his colleagues in the Senate deliberately avoided by not — Absolutely. — doing what he did. It is a faith that they have voted to avoid. I mean, it’s obviously — there are a lot of things at work when you decide to make a vote like this. But the noise is an absolutely undeniable part of the experience of voting against the interests of the person who leads your party. Donald Trump. Thank you, Mark. Thank you, Michael. On Tuesday night, President Trump himself began attacking Mitt Romney on Twitter, promoting a video that calls Romney slippery and stealthy, and without any evidence, claims that Romney is, quote, “a secret asset of the Democratic Party.” We’ll be right back. Here’s what else you need to know today. On Wednesday, Democratic officials in Iowa released more results from Monday’s caucuses, which left the position of the candidates unchanged and the final outcome of the vote uncertain. With 97 percent of the results in, Pete Buttigieg maintained a narrow lead over Bernie Sanders that verged on a tie. Meanwhile, in New Hampshire — Donald Trump is desperate to pin the socialist label of socialist, socialist, socialist on our party. We can’t let him do that. But if Senator Sanders is a nominee for the party, every Democrat will have to carry the label Senator Sanders has chosen for himself. Former Vice President Joe Biden, who stands at a distant fourth place in Iowa, attacked both Sanders and Buttigieg as flawed candidates for the Democratic nomination. I have great respect for Mayor Pete and his service of this nation. But I do believe it’s a risk, to be just straight up with you, for this party to nominate someone who’s never held a office higher than mayor of a town of 100,000 people in Indiana. I do believe it’s a risk. That’s it for “The Daily.” I’m Michael Barbaro. See you tomorrow. transcript In the last several weeks I’ve received numerous calls and texts. Many demanded in their words that I stand with the team. I can assure you that thought has been very much on my mind. You see, I support a great deal of what the president has done. I’ve voted with him 80 percent of the time. But my promise before God to apply impartial justice required that I put my personal feelings and political biases aside. Were I to ignore the evidence that has been presented and disregard what I believe my oath and the Constitution demands of me, for the sake of a partisan end, it would, I fear, expose my character to history’s rebuke and the censure of my own conscience. I take an oath before God as enormously consequential. I knew from the outset that being tasked with judging the president, the leader of my own party, would be the most difficult decision I have ever faced. I was not wrong. So the verdict is ours to render under our Constitution. The people will judge us for how well and faithfully we fulfill our duty. The grave question the Constitution tasks senators to answer is whether the president committed an act so extreme and egregious that it rises to the level of a high crime and misdemeanor. Yes, he did. The president’s Republican allies excoriated Democrats for a proceeding they said had damaged the country and its institutions in the name of saving them. “We will reject this incoherent case that comes nowhere near justifying the first presidential removal in history,” said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader. Yet at a news conference after the vote, Mr. McConnell declined several times to answer reporters who asked whether he considered Mr. Trump’s actions appropriate. “This decision has been made,” Mr. McConnell said curtly. “As far as I’m concerned, it’s in the rearview mirror.” As expected, the tally in favor of conviction on each article fell far below the 67-vote threshold necessary for removal. The first charge was abuse of power, accusing Mr. Trump of a scheme to use the levers of government to coerce Ukraine to do his political bidding. It did not even garner a majority vote, failing 48 to 52, with Mr. Romney voting with the Democrats. The second article, charging Mr. Trump with obstruction of Congress for an across-the-board blockade of House subpoenas and oversight requests, failed 47 to 53, strictly on party lines. Like this one, the trials of Presidents Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton also ended in acquittal — a reflection of the Constitution’s high burden for removing a chief executive. But in a stinging rebuke of the country’s leader aimed at history, Mr. Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, said that Mr. Trump’s pressure campaign on Ukraine was “the most abusive and destructive violation of one’s oath of office that I can imagine.” Though he voted against the second article, Mr. Romney became emotional on the Senate floor in the hours before the verdict on Wednesday as he described why he deemed Mr. Trump guilty of abuse of power, calling it a matter of conscience. He was the first senator ever to vote to remove a president of his own party. “I am sure to hear abuse from the president and his supporters,” Mr. Romney said. “Does anyone seriously believe I would consent to these consequences other than from an inescapable conviction that my oath before God demanded it of me?” Mr. Romney’s defection, which he announced a couple of hours before the final vote, was a stark reflection of the sweeping transformation of the Republican Party over the past eight years into one that is now dominated almost entirely by Mr. Trump. And it deprived the president of the monolithic Republican support he had eagerly anticipated. Still, the White House declared victory. “Today, the sham impeachment attempt concocted by Democrats ended in the full vindication and exoneration of President Donald J. Trump,” said Stephanie Grisham, the White House press secretary. “As we have said all along, he is not guilty.” Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign moved quickly to capitalize on the moment, distributing a fund-raising email declaring, “Sorry haters, I’m not going anywhere.” Several Republican senators ultimately acknowledged the heart of the House case — that Mr. Trump undertook a concerted pressure campaign on Ukraine to secure politically beneficial investigations into his rivals, including former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., using nearly $400 million in military aid as leverage. But most argued that the conduct was not sufficiently dangerous to warrant the Senate removing a president from office for the first time in history — and certainly not with an election so near. Others dismissed Democrats’ arguments altogether, insisting their case was merely an attempt to dress up hatred for Mr. Trump and his policies as a constitutional case. Senators Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, two Republican swing votes who have tilted against the president in the past, both voted against conviction and removal. And two Democrats from traditionally conservative-leaning states, Senators Joe Manchin III of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, voted to convict Mr. Trump, denying him the bipartisan acquittal he coveted. Although the verdict was never in doubt, Democrats lobbied to expand the scope of the Senate trial to include witnesses and documents that the president refused to provide during the House inquiry, working to pressure vulnerable Republicans facing challenging re-election contests, like Ms. Collins, to join them or risk being portrayed as beholden to Mr. Trump. All but two Republicans refused, making the trial the first impeachment proceeding in American history to reach a verdict without calling witnesses. As they closed their case, the seven Democratic House managers who prosecuted it warned that Mr. Trump would emerge only emboldened in his monarchical tendencies and that those who appeased him would be judged harshly by history. Republicans, they said, had chosen to leave the president’s future up to voters despite evidence that he had tried to cheat in the election, and would continue to do so. Seldom used in American history, impeachment is the Constitution’s most extreme mechanism for checking a corrupt or out of control officeholder. In unsheathing it, Democrats took on political risk that could backfire in November on their presidential nominee or their incumbents in Congress, including moderates in conservative districts and states where Mr. Trump is popular. At least one Democrat, Senator Doug Jones of Alabama, glancingly acknowledged that his vote to convict would most likely contribute to his loss this fall in deeply conservative Alabama. “There will be so many who will simply look at what I am doing today and say it is a profile in courage,” Mr. Jones said before the vote. “It is not. It is simply a matter of right and wrong.” For now, the impeachment of Mr. Trump appears to have evenly divided the nation. Public opinion polls suggest that even though a growing number of Americans agreed that the president most likely abused his office and acted improperly, more than a slight majority never agreed that he should be removed from office. If Mr. Trump’s standing among the public has been hurt by the trial, it is not yet evident. To the contrary, the latest Gallup poll, released on Tuesday, showed that 49 percent of Americans approved of his job performance — the highest figure since he took office three years ago. The same survey showed that Republicans’ image has improved markedly, with 51 percent viewing them favorably compared with 43 percent in September. The possibility of impeachment has hung over Mr. Trump’s presidency virtually since it began, but Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, initially resisted it. After Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel who investigated Russia’s election interference in 2016 and possible collaboration with the Trump campaign, found 10 instances of potential obstruction of justice by Mr. Trump, she said impeachment was too divisive a remedy to pursue. Her calculations changed in September with the emergence of an anonymous C.I.A. whistle-blower that accused the president of marshaling the powers of government to press Ukraine to investigate Mr. Biden and a theory that Democrats had colluded with Ukraine in the 2016 election. In authorizing the impeachment inquiry, Ms. Pelosi tasked the House Intelligence Committee to investigate the scheme and build a case. Mr. Trump issued a blanket directive to all government agencies not to comply with the inquiry, robbing investigators of key witnesses and facts that could have filled out their case, and ultimately giving rise to the obstruction of Congress charge. Still, more than a dozen administration officials came forward, offering testimony in private and then in scintillating public hearings that confirmed and expanded on the whistle-blower complaint. On Dec. 18, the House impeached Mr. Trump on both counts. To protect his Senate majority as much as the presidency, Mr. McConnell promised a swift acquittal — and he delivered it. It was just 20 days from the time the articles of impeachment were first read on the Senate floor to Wednesday’s vote. By comparison, the Clinton trial in 1999 lasted five weeks, and in 1868, the Senate took the better part of three months to try Johnson. The final shift in defenses by all but the most conservative of Mr. Trump’s allies came last week, when The New York Times reported the first in a series of articles revealing that in August, Mr. Trump told John R. Bolton, the former national security adviser, that he would not release the military aid for Ukraine until the country helped out with investigations into Mr. Biden and other Democrats. Impeachment was seriously contemplated for a president only once in the first two centuries of the American republic; it now has been so three times since the 1970s, and two of the past four presidents have been impeached.

2020,Trump Administration Considering Halting Sales of Aircraft Parts to China,"The review is part of a broader effort to restrict the flow of sensitive technology to China. The Trump administration is considering halting to China the sale of an aircraft engine produced in part by General Electric, two people familiar with the discussions said, part of a broader effort to limit the flow of technology there that could one day give Beijing an economic and security edge. Top Trump administration officials will discuss whether to prevent the sale at a cabinet meeting on Feb. 28, these people said. That meeting will encompass other restrictions on China, including whether to proceed with a rule change that would further curtail the ability of Huawei, the Chinese telecom giant, to have access to American technology. The aircraft license review was first reported by The Wall Street Journal. The Trump administration has been increasingly wary of China’s economic and military ambitions, including a strategy to fuse its defense and commercial economies known as civil-military fusion. Chinese industrial plans like Made In China 2025 have promoted dual-use technologies like aviation, automation and information technology to benefit both the Chinese economy and its military abilities. China’s effort to develop airplanes on par with international competitors like Boeing, Airbus and Bombardier have long fallen short. Instead, CFM, the jet-engine joint venture of General Electric and Safran of France, has been providing engines to China for years as part of that country’s effort to build up its jetliner industry. The United States licenses for the joint venture to ship engines to China date to 2014. The most recent license was issued in March 2019. The licenses are for engines used in test-flight programs by the Chinese aircraft maker Comac. Each license is for a few engines, a model called the LEAP 1C. The Commerce Department had been reviewing the joint venture’s license, but the decision on whether to continue allowing the technology to be sold to China has now been kicked up to cabinet members. The plane that would use the CFM engines is scheduled to go into passenger service in 2021. China, aviation experts say, has been able to make most of the individual components for advanced jet aircraft. But the bigger challenge is integrating complicated technologies into complex mechanical and digital systems for engines and avionics. That integration, they say, is more difficult to build or reverse engineer, and copy. But officials in the Trump administration and elsewhere fear that China might eventually develop the ability to reverse engineer G.E.’s technology. Concerns have risen among officials in the National Security Council, the Defense Department and the State Department about whether the United States should be supporting China’s efforts to develop indigenous aircraft. Stopping such licenses, however, would be a big financial hit to companies like G.E. Officials also plan to discuss at the Feb. 28 policy meeting whether to expand the scope of their restrictions on Huawei. The administration placed the company on a blacklist last May that prevented products made in America from being shipped to the country. But many of Huawei’s suppliers are global companies, and companies like Micron and Qualcomm instead switched to selling the Chinese company products from their overseas operations. The rule change would clamp down on shipments of products made overseas with American components, so that only foreign-made products with less than 10 percent of American parts could be shipped to the company, down from 25 percent of specific types of restricted content before. Some officials in the Defense Department had pushed back against those changes, arguing that they could undermine American technological development by cutting down on a vast source of revenue that the tech industry depends on to fund its research and development. The American military buys much of the technology that goes into military devices from the private sector. But recently, other Pentagon officials including Mark T. Esper, the defense secretary, and John C. Rood, the under secretary of defense for policy, spoke up to overrule those objections, with the support of some officials in the Commerce Department. On Friday, Senator Rick Scott, Republican of Florida, introduced legislation that would accomplish the same change. “We know Huawei is supported and controlled by the communist regime in Beijing, which continues to violate human rights and steal our data, technology and intellectual property,” he said. “Companies in the United States should not be allowed to sell to Huawei, and my legislation will further restrict their ability.” Maggie Haberman contributed reporting.",The New York Times
2020,Trump Administration Considers Punishing Chinese News Organizations,"U.S. officials said they were looking at ways to retaliate for China’s expulsion of three Wall Street Journal reporters, including evicting Chinese journalists who file intelligence reports. WASHINGTON — The Trump administration is considering punishing Chinese journalists and state-run news organizations — as well as Chinese intelligence agencies — because of China’s decision to expel three Wall Street Journal reporters, American officials said on Monday. Those actions could be partly aimed at limiting Chinese intelligence collection efforts in the United States by expelling journalists who have contact with intelligence agencies, people familiar with the discussions said. “The United States condemns Beijing’s expulsion of three Wall Street Journal foreign correspondents,” said John Ullyot, a spokesman for the White House’s National Security Council. “This expulsion is yet another attempt to control the press, and prevent the world’s readers as well as investors from reading important stories about China.” “The United States is considering a range of responses to this egregious act,” he added. Retaliation by the United States could lead to escalating cycles of retribution involving the two governments, private and state-run news organizations and intelligence agencies. The Chinese Foreign Ministry announced on Wednesday that it was expelling the reporters in retaliation for a headline on a Feb. 3 Wall Street Journal opinion column: “China Is the Real Sick Man of Asia.” The column criticized China’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak. Historians say a Chinese reformer, Liang Qichao, coined the phrase “the sick man of Asia” in Chinese in the late 19th century to describe the Qing dynasty, but Chinese officials argued after the column’s publication that it was an insult to the Chinese people and demanded that The Journal apologize. A day before China’s announcement, the United States designated five Chinese state-run news organizations as official foreign government functionaries, subject to similar rules as diplomats stationed in the United States. None of the reporters targeted by Beijing had anything to do with the column or its headline. Like most American newspapers, The Journal maintains a wall between its news-gathering operations and its editorial pages. The Foreign Correspondents’ Club of China said on Wednesday that the government’s decision was “an extreme and obvious attempt by the Chinese authorities to intimidate foreign news organizations by taking retribution against their China-based correspondents.” The organization also said it was aware of nine foreign journalists who had been expelled or forced to leave China because of a nonrenewal of visas since 2013. Mr. Ullyot noted that number in his statement on Monday. American officials were scheduled to meet on Monday afternoon in the White House to discuss recommendations on whether to expel Chinese journalists. Bloomberg News first reported on the scheduling of the meeting. Among the administration’s concerns is a belief that, unlike American journalists, some of the Chinese journalists working for state-run news organizations in the United States are filing reports, at least part of the time, for Chinese intelligence agencies, according to people familiar with the matter. They said many of the Chinese journalists suspected of having those ties occupied a hybrid role, with some accredited journalists possibly serving as full-time intelligence operatives. While the journalists may regularly file news stories, they are believed to also be sending information and analysis back to Chinese intelligence agencies. If the journalists obtain exclusive information, they could be required by officials to provide the information to the agencies rather than write an article, one of the people familiar with the matter said. In recent years, American officials have expressed growing concern over what they call Chinese influence and propaganda efforts in the United States. They have also increasingly scrutinized a variety of Chinese citizens — diplomats, journalists and scientists among them — for intelligence collection operations. In September, the United States secretly expelled two employees of the Chinese Embassy in Washington after the men and their wives drove onto a sensitive military base in Virginia. It appeared to be the first expulsion of Chinese diplomats in more than 30 years. There are hundreds more visas given to Chinese journalists in the United States than there are accredited American journalists in China, U.S. officials said. As of Monday morning, the Trump administration was not considering an expulsion on that scale, officials said. An immediate wave of expulsions might include fewer than a dozen Chinese journalists, one official said. Some U.S. officials have argued that expelling journalists runs counter to the American principle of freedom of the press. Tensions between the United States and China have been high, largely because of President Trump’s trade war. The two countries reached an initial trade deal in December, but American national security officials have continued to push other nations to reject Chinese technology and infrastructure projects, arguing that they pose security risks. President Xi Jinping of China has tightened limits on civil society and free expression since taking power in 2012. That includes greater clampdowns on foreign news organizations. Foreign journalists living in China usually get visas that allow them to have one-year residence permits, but in some cases that has been curtailed to a matter of months — to try to coerce the journalists not to report on issues such as the mass internment of Muslims in the Xinjiang region. Matthew Pottinger, the chief deputy on the National Security Council, is a former reporter in The Wall Street Journal’s Beijing bureau. He has worked for three years on the council, most of the time as senior Asia director, and has been a proponent of aggressive policies toward China. Two of the Journal reporters, Josh Chin, an American and the deputy bureau chief in Beijing, and Philip Wen, an Australian, flew out of Beijing on Monday. The third reporter, Chao Deng, an American, is in the coronavirus containment zone of Wuhan, where she had been reporting. She is unable to leave because of quarantine measures. The expulsions have led to an extraordinary reaction within The Journal. On Thursday, 53 reporters and editors at the newspaper, mostly in mainland China and Hong Kong, sent a letter to William Lewis, the chief executive of Dow Jones and the newspaper’s publisher, and Robert Thomson, the chief executive of News Corp, the Rupert Murdoch-controlled parent company of Dow Jones, criticizing the way that top editors handled the fallout over the Feb. 3 headline. It said the leaders should offer a formal apology. Over the weekend, Mr. Lewis told the letter writers that he empathized with them but would not overrule editorial decision-making. He also pledged to continue pushing to get the expelled journalists’ credentials restored. “I fully understand that the headline we published offended you, some of those closest to you, and many others,” he wrote in an email obtained by The New York Times. “I am sure that you understand why it is inappropriate for the company, or anyone else, to intervene in editorial matters.” He added, “I take seriously the hurt many feel, but this is a complex situation, and the company is caught in a political crossfire.” Marc Tracy contributed reporting from New York.",The New York Times
2020,Trump Administration Faces Economic Test as Coronavirus Shakes Markets,"If the virus spreads in the United States, the Federal Reserve might have to cut rates. But how fiscal policymakers respond is likely to be even more important. Get an informed guide to the global outbreak with our daily Coronavirus
 newsletter.
 WASHINGTON — The global spread of the deadly coronavirus is posing a significant economic test for President Trump, whose three-year stretch of robust growth could be shaken by supply chain delays, a tourism slowdown and ruptures in other critical sectors of the American economy. The outbreak of the virus in China has already disrupted global trade, sending American companies and retailers that rely on Chinese imports scrambling to repair a temporary break in their supply chains. Its spread to South Korea, Italy and beyond has hindered global travel. Economic forecasters say that the effects will hurt growth in the United States this year even if they do not intensify — and that if the virus becomes a global pandemic, it could knock the world economy into recession. Stock markets have plunged this week on fears about the virus, with companies such as Apple and Microsoft among the most prominent businesses that have warned that supply chain disruptions could slow sales. Analysts said this week’s declines were on track to be the steepest since the 2008 financial crisis. The market’s fall presents a challenge for Mr. Trump, whose presidential success has been deeply tied to the economy and a rising stock market that is now experiencing pronounced jitters. For now, Mr. Trump has publicly played down the potential economic fallout, saying woes at the aerospace giant Boeing, a strike last year at General Motors and the Federal Reserve’s reluctance to slash interest rates have done more to hurt the economy. “We have been hurt by General Motors,” Mr. Trump said on Wednesday. “We’ve been hurt by Boeing. And we’ve been hurt by — we’ve been hurt, in my opinion, very badly, by our own Federal Reserve.” Health officials expect a spike in coronavirus cases in the United States, though it remains unclear how soon and how severe an outbreak might occur. Officials have warned the nation to be prepared for the virus to spread. If the infection gains a big foothold in the United States, it could disrupt the economy, which has been expanding steadily with an unemployment rate that has hovered near a 50-year low for more than a year. In an extreme scenario where the virus severely hits the United States, it could keep workers at home and grind production to a halt, hurting revenue streams and tanking even highly leveraged corporations as they fall behind on debt payments. In the least severe case, the current slowdown in China could cause a short-lived growth blip. Updated Feb. 26, 2020 Economists at Goldman Sachs already expect to shave 0.8 percentage points off the United States gross domestic product in the first three months of 2020 because of slumping tourism from China and trade slowdowns. But they expect a quick rebound in the second quarter that will help to make up for the downturn. Other economists, including those at Moody’s Analytics, foresee more drastic fallout if widespread infections appear in other countries. A global recession “is likely” if the virus “becomes a pandemic, and the odds of that are uncomfortably high and rising with infections surging in Italy and Korea,” Mark Zandi, Moody’s chief economist, wrote on Wednesday. Chang-Tai Hsieh, an economist at the University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business who tracks Chinese economic data, said in an interview Thursday that the effects on American growth will be “huge” even in a best-case scenario with the virus. Chinese business activity, he said, is running at about 20 percent of normal levels. “The economic consequences are, everything is down” in China, he said. “Everything is down tremendously.” As forecasts worsen, investor expectations of a Fed cut are quickly increasing. As of Thursday, investors were betting on a March rate cut, a move that seemed highly unlikely as recently as a week ago. Many now expect two cuts by June, market pricing suggests. Democrats on the House Financial Services Committee sent a letter on Thursday to Jerome H. Powell, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, asking for more information about whether an outbreak of the virus in the United States could cause a recession and what tools the central bank had to combat a supply shock to the economy. Central bank policymakers said on Thursday that they were closely monitoring viral developments, though they did not yet signal a coming cut. “It really depends on: What are the medium-term implications for the U.S. economy?” Loretta Mester, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, said in an interview. “If people are temporarily staying home, not traveling, not interacting and purchasing things, that could be a short-term hit. Or it could develop into something broader — and that’s the kind of calculus you have to do when you’re thinking about monetary policy.” But rate cuts may have a limited effect: They work by stimulating demand, which could help if consumers and investors get spooked and stop spending. But cuts will do little to restart factories and correct supply problems. “We’d absolutely expect to see a response from the Federal Reserve, not least to shore up confidence,” said Paul Ashworth, an economist at Capital Economics, a research consultancy. But he pointed out that monetary policy worked on the economy with a six- to nine-month lag, and “it doesn’t deal with the supply-side impact of, say, one-third of your work force catching this.” The more critical response may come from Congress and the Trump administration, which have done little thus far to script a fiscal response. Perhaps the most important thing the government can do to insulate the economy is to stem the outbreak, keeping Americans on the job and spending. If that fails, though, fiscal responses are an option; Hong Kong and China, both hit hard, have rolled out packages to help bolster growth. Tax and spending policies might also encourage demand more than fixing supply, but they can also work more quickly than monetary policy. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, on Thursday morning called for Congress and Mr. Trump to fashion a spending bill meant to “address the spread of the deadly coronavirus in a smart, strategic and serious way.” A response should include interest-free loans for “small businesses impacted by the outbreak.” Such a program would represent targeted relief but not an effort to dramatically increase consumer demand in the economy. But such a plan seems far-off, if not improbable. Democratic and Republican leaders in Congress have not opened talks with the White House or between the House and Senate over any possible package of tax cuts and spending increases that would be meant to stimulate the economy in the event of a virus-related downturn. Top Senate aides said on Thursday that it was too soon for such conversations, with Mr. Trump’s allies noting the persistence of low unemployment and continued economic growth. Michael Zona, a spokesman for the Senate Finance Committee and its chairman, Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, said on Thursday that “at this point, the coronavirus has not had a broad impact on the U.S. economy, and its effects have been limited.” But Mr. Zona said Mr. Grassley and the committee were “ready to consider appropriate tax relief responses if that becomes necessary and the extent of the problem can be determined.” Mr. Trump’s economic advisers had already been working on a package of tax cuts intended to serve as a centerpiece of his 2020 campaign. That package, which is still in flux and probably months away, could include new tax cuts for the middle class and for start-up businesses, along with extensions of some expiring provisions of the 2017 tax cuts. Tax experts who have spoken with the administration do not see the effort as an immediate stimulus package, but more as an attempt to build on the 2017 law and offer voters a contrast between Mr. Trump and his Democratic opponent. On Thursday, the White House added Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Larry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council, to the president’s coronavirus task force. Both officials have been working on the tax plan. The Financial Banking and Information Infrastructure Committee, chartered under the president’s Working Group on Financial Markets and chaired by Treasury, is in regular communication and is also monitoring the economic fallout from the virus. With Democrats controlling the House, there has been little expectation of major tax legislation before the November election. There was no sign on Thursday, from inside or outside the White House, that the coronavirus had changed that. “The bipartisan consensus on Capitol Hill is that substantive tax policy is not happening before the lame duck” session after the election, said George Callas, the managing director at Steptoe & Johnson LLP, who was tax counsel to former House Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin. “I haven’t seen that change in thinking happen yet.”",The New York Times
2020,Trump Administration Freezes Global Entry Enrollment in New York Over Immigration Law,"The move escalates a clash between the administration and the state over a law that allows undocumented immigrants to obtain driver’s licenses. WASHINGTON — The Department of Homeland Security temporarily barred New Yorkers on Wednesday from enrolling in Global Entry and similar programs that allow travelers to speed through borders and airport lines, escalating a conflict between the Trump administration and the state over a law that allows undocumented immigrants to obtain driver’s licenses. Chad Wolf, the acting secretary of homeland security, said in a letter to the New York State government that residents would no longer be able to apply for such programs because of the so-called Green Light Law. That measure prevents agencies like Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which arrests and deports undocumented immigrants, as well as Customs and Border Protection from gaining access to the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles databases without a court order. Mr. Wolf said that access was needed to thoroughly vet applicants for the programs. “Although D.H.S. would prefer to continue our longstanding cooperative relationship with New York on a variety of these critical homeland security initiatives,” he wrote in the letter, “this act and the corresponding lack of security cooperation from the New York D.M.V. requires D.H.S. to take immediate action to ensure D.H.S.’s efforts to protect the homeland are not compromised.” The Trump administration has long taken aim at the state and, more specifically, New York City for “sanctuary city” policies that limit cooperation with ICE. But Mr. Wolf’s decision to suspend enrollment for the programs turned what had most recently been a public relations campaign against local politicians into a punitive policy affecting possibly millions of New Yorkers. “This is obviously political retaliation by the federal government, and we’re going to review our legal options,” Rich Azzopardi, a senior adviser to Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, said late Wednesday night. New Yorkers will not be able to enroll in “Trusted Traveler Programs,” which allow people to cut through long lines at airports if they pass a pre-clearance with the Department of Homeland Security. Participants are granted expedited processing after international travel through the Global Entry program; from Canada through the NEXUS program; and from Canada and Mexico through the SENTRI program. The Green Light Law was passed last year by New York’s Democratic Legislature and was signed by Mr. Cuomo, a third-term Democrat and frequent antagonist of President Trump. Under the new law, county and state motor vehicles departments could accept applications for licenses, regardless of immigration status. It provoked a sharp backlash in some moderate suburban communities as well as in some more conservative areas upstate. Several county officials refused to comply or sued to stop the law, though it proved popular in liberal enclaves like New York City. During negotiations over the bill, which passed by a slim majority in the State Senate, Mr. Cuomo had expressed concerns over federal immigration officials gaining access to D.M.V. records, something that the bill broadly forbade, without a court order. “They’re using that personal data that they get from that database to look up an individual’s date of birth, their photo. They’re using that as they build that case,” Mr. Wolf told the Fox News anchor Tucker Carlson on Wednesday night as he announced the action. “They can no longer do that because of what New York did.” But the state’s attorney general, Letitia James, supported the bill’s passage, saying it was constitutional and contained “ample protections for those who apply for driver’s licenses.” She promised to defend it if it were challenged. Activists and immigrants also celebrated the bill, contending that the ability to obtain a driver’s license was crucial to surviving. Many lined up outside D.M.V. offices after the legislation took effect in December. Mr. Wolf said that the action was the result of “an initial assessment” and that the department would review its response going forward. The administration has also taken aim against New York City leaders, mainly Mayor Bill de Blasio, for not allowing ICE agents to detain undocumented immigrants already in the custody of the New York Police Department. It was one of the cities that the attorney general at the time, Jeff Sessions, threatened in 2017 to revoke law enforcement funding from as retaliation for not cooperating with ICE on deportations. ICE intensified that feud in recent weeks when the agency issued four subpoenas to the city for information about inmates wanted for deportation. Mr. Trump dedicated a portion of his State of the Union address on Tuesday to the matter, claiming the death and rape of a 92-year-old woman could have been prevented if city authorities had held the man accused in her killing for potential deportation. Since the early days of his 2016 campaign, the president has highlighted stories of Americans killed by undocumented immigrants. Stephen Miller, his adviser and a prominent strategist of Mr. Trump’s immigration agenda, has also in the past directed homeland security officials to spotlight crimes committed by undocumented immigrants as a way to gain support for his more restrictionist policies. “Tragically, there are many cities in America where radical politicians have chosen to provide sanctuary for these criminal illegal aliens,” Mr. Trump said Tuesday night. But multiple studies have debunked the theory that sanctuary city policies drive crime. Zolan Kanno-Youngs reported from Washington, and Jesse McKinley from New York.",The New York Times
2020,Trump Administration Sees No Threat to Economy From Monopolies,"The latest Economic Report of the President remains optimistic about growth while clashing with Democrats who have proposed breaking up large companies to improve competition. WASHINGTON — President Trump and his economic team see “no need to hastily rewrite the federal government’s antitrust rules,” drawing a battle line with leading Democratic presidential candidates on an issue that has increasingly drawn the attention of economists, legal scholars and other academics. In their annual Economic Report of the President, released on Thursday, Mr. Trump and his advisers effectively dismiss an emerging line of economic research that finds large American companies increasingly dominate industries like telecommunications and tech, stifling competition and hurting consumers. That research, which President Barack Obama’s economic team championed in 2016, has become fodder for presidential candidates like Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont to call for breaking up big tech companies. In its report, the Trump administration contends that the studies that demonstrate rising market concentration in the economy are flawed — and that the rise of large companies may not be a bad thing for consumers. “Concentration may be driven by economies of scale and scope that can lower costs for consumers,” the report reads. “Also, successful firms tend to grow, and it is important that antitrust enforcement and competition policy not be used to punish firms for their competitive success.” That assessment was consistent with the bright picture that administration officials painted in the report on the health of the economy. They forecast growth of 3.1 percent for the year, measuring fourth quarter over fourth quarter, although that prediction relies on Congress passing a large-scale infrastructure plan and other policy initiatives that appear unlikely in an election year. Without those, the growth forecast falls below 3 percent. This year’s report takes direct aim at the 2016 report presented by Mr. Obama and his Council of Economic Advisers, then led by the Harvard economist Jason Furman, which warned that rising market concentration was hampering economic dynamism and exacerbating inequality. The Trump administration has approved some high-profile corporate mergers, like the marriage of Sprint and T-Mobile, while trying to block others, like AT&T’s purchase of Time Warner. In their report, Mr. Trump’s advisers say federal agencies already have the tools they need to evaluate those mergers and other antitrust cases. It laments that some Americans have come to hold the “mistaken, simplistic view that ‘Big Is Bad.’” New research released Thursday by the University of Chicago’s Becker Friedman Institute for Economics offers new evidence for why populist politicians like Mr. Trump should be concerned with whether market concentration is in fact rising in the economy: The rise hurts blue-collar workers, like those employed in factories, more than everyone else. The research, from the University of Chicago economists Greg Kaplan and Piotr Zoch, does not seek to quantify whether concentration has gone up or down in recent years. Instead, it studies what happens to particular classes of workers when companies increasingly dominate a market and have more power to raise prices. It finds that some workers — those who make things — are hurt in when their employer dominates an industry. The workers who sell or market or design things gain. “It’s leading to an increase in the incomes of white-collar workers,” Mr. Kaplan said in an interview, “at the expense of blue-collar workers.” There’s a relatively simple explanation for why that is. When companies have more pricing power, they make fewer products and sell each one for a higher profit margin. In that case, it’s far more valuable to a company to be an employee working in so-called expansionary positions, like marketing, than in production jobs, like working a factory line — because there’s less production to be done and more salesmanship. Mr. Trump has repeatedly highlighted his administration’s record of delivering for the production workers he targeted in his 2016 campaign promises. The new economic report is no exception. In recent decades, the report says, the government disproportionately regulated industries like manufacturing “that offer fulfilling, blue collar jobs for the majority of Americans who do not have a college degree.” “These misguided policy decisions,” it continues, “imposed real-world costs that created barriers to success and prosperity for hardworking Americans. Those days are over.” Updated Feb. 29, 2020",The New York Times
2020,Trump Administration Will Raise Tariffs on European Aircraft,"The Trump administration announced it would increase tariffs on European aircraft in an effort to ramp up pressure in a long-running airplane subsidy dispute. WASHINGTON — The Trump administration said it would raise tariffs on European aircraft in an effort to pressure Europe in a long-running trade dispute over airplane subsidies. The United States Trade Representative said late Friday that it would increase the duty it had imposed on European aircraft to 15 percent from 10 percent, effective March 18. It also removed prune juice for the list of taxed items, and added a 25 percent tax on French and German butcher and kitchen knives. The annual value of the goods subject to tariffs would remain at $7.5 billion, as before, the trade representative said. The tariffs are part of a 15-year-old complaint over subsidies European governments gave plane maker Airbus, which put its American competitor, Boeing, at a disadvantage. In October, the World Trade Organization granted the United States permission to try to recoup its losses by taxing as much as $7.5 billion of European exports annually. Those tariffs are expected to continue until Europe removes its subsidies or the two governments come to a negotiated resolution. The airplane dispute is just one irritant in an increasingly fraught trading relationship with Europe. The United States and the European Union remain at odds over France’s plan to tax American technology companies. European officials have also been angry that the United States has effectively paralyzed the W.T.O. by refusing to sign off on new appointees to a crucial appeals panel. Despite those disputes, the two governments have continued to negotiate to improve trade terms. After announcing plans for a comprehensive trade deal in 2018, both sides appear to have scaled back their ambitions, with officials saying they might settle on a “mini-deal” that would focus on a few sectors. In a news conference with President Trump in Davos, Switzerland, in January, the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said she was expecting to reach a trade agreement that she could sign with the United States “in a few weeks.” But details on such an agreement have since been scarce, with few visible high-level meetings. The tariff changes could put more pressure on Europe to reach a deal. Under U.S. law, the United States Trade Representative is required to periodically revisit and revise tariffs put in place as part of a W.T.O. dispute, to put more pressure on negotiating partners to reach a resolution. The tariffs that the United States imposed on Europe in October included a 10 percent tax on aircraft from Britain, France, Germany and Spain, and a 25 percent tax on wine, cheese, pork, whiskey, olives and other agricultural products. Although these levies are permitted under the rules of the W.T.O., they have still raised an outcry from consumers and industries in the United States. “The Trump administration’s threat of a tariff ‘carousel’ — shifting even one new product onto a list hit with new import taxes — generates even more of the uncertainty that haunts American business and workers,” said Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute. “Even though there were few changes today, little was resolved, and the administration has made sure that much of that uncertainty will remain.” Some industries that had been hoping for relief were disappointed when the administration announced their changes to the tariffs Friday night. Harry Root, founder of the U.S.-Wine Trade Alliance, a group that represents wine distributors and other professions in the United States, said wine tariffs had done disproportionate damage to American businesses and consumers — and that European winemakers had responded by shipping more products to China instead. Mr. Root said that the administration had heard the industry’s message “loud and clear,” that wine tariffs were inefficient. But when the trade representative published its list Friday night, the 25 percent tariff on European wine remained in place. American and European negotiators have met to discuss the possibility of a resolution — potentially in the context of negotiations toward a broader trade deal — but so far have failed to reach an agreement. Airbus’s chief executive, Guillaume Faury, said that regardless of the Trump administration’s tariff adjustments on Friday, the bigger issue for the company was whether Europe and the United States could strike a settlement this summer. The W.T.O. is expected to rule as early as May on a parallel case, in which Europe has claimed that the United States provides its own unfair subsidies to Boeing. The W.T.O. is expected to give the European Union the go-ahead to apply counter tariffs on American imports to Europe. Mr. Faury acknowledged that U.S. penalties on products like cognac, wine and other agricultural goods and industrial products hurt small producers. A 10 percent tax applies to European aircraft, though Mr. Faury added Airbus had managed to keep costs “manageable” for U.S. customers. “It’s a lose-lose situation,” Mr. Faury said. “We think 2020 is the year to put this behind us and move forward as an industry with no tariffs and good competition.” As tensions have heated up with Europe, the Trump administration has calmed its trade disputes on other fronts. The Trump administration’s initial trade deal with China went into effect on Friday, with tariffs on more than $110 billion of Chinese goods dropping from 15 percent to 7.5 percent. Tariffs on roughly $250 billion worth of Chinese goods will remain at the 25 percent rate. Liz Alderman contributed reporting from Paris.",The New York Times
2020,Trump Adviser Pushes Utah Congressman for Top Intelligence Post,"The acting director of national intelligence is required by law to step down by next month, forcing the Trump administration to make a decision on the job. WASHINGTON — A Utah congressman has emerged as a top contender to be the next director of national intelligence in the weeks before the acting intelligence chief must by law give up the post, people briefed on the matter said on Tuesday. President Trump’s national security adviser, Robert C. O’Brien, is pushing him to nominate Representative Chris Stewart, Republican of Utah and a member of the House Intelligence Committee, for the job, the people said. Current and former officials cautioned that the discussions were fluid. A spokeswoman for Mr. Stewart did not comment. Joseph Maguire, the director of the National Counterterrorism Center, has filled in as the acting director of national intelligence since Dan Coats resigned in August. But under current law limiting the duration of postings for acting cabinet-level officials, Mr. Maguire must step down next month. Mr. Trump has not nominated a permanent replacement for Mr. Coats since his early pick, Representative John Ratcliffe, Republican of Texas, withdrew in August after questions about whether he exaggerated his résumé. Mr. Stewart, like other Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee, vigorously defended Mr. Trump during impeachment hearings in the fall that focused on the president’s pressure campaign on Ukraine. And he has been sharply critical of the handling by the Justice Department and F.B.I. of an investigation into the Trump campaign’s ties to Russian interference in the 2016 election. “They want to take away my vote and throw it in the trash,” Mr. Stewart said of Democrats just before the impeachment vote in the House. “They want to take away my president and delegitimize him so he cannot be re-elected.” Mr. Stewart, 59, has long been interested in the post of intelligence chief, people close to him said. He is well-liked by congressional Republicans and is thought to enjoy support from Senate Republicans, who would confirm him if he is nominated. But Democrats are likely to balk at the selection of a House lawmaker with such a political track record. Senate Republicans could have the votes to approve on their own a nominee like Mr. Stewart, but some have said they want to see a nominee with bipartisan support. Senator Richard Burr, Republican of North Carolina, who leads the Senate Intelligence Committee, was cool to Mr. Ratcliffe’s nomination and is likely to influence the White House’s ultimate choice. The clock is ticking on a decision. Mr. Maguire cannot serve past March 11 under federal law. Before then, the administration must have a director nominated and confirmed or be forced to find a new acting director. The White House could still decide to nominate Mr. Maguire, according to the current and former officials. Mr. Maguire, a retired Navy admiral, has support within the administration. His counterterrorism expertise is also considered an asset to Mr. Trump, who has been focused on strikes against terrorist leaders. What is not clear, however, is whether the president sees Mr. Maguire’s role in handling the anonymous whistle-blower complaint about Mr. Trump’s dealings with Ukraine that helped prompt the impeachment inquiry as an asset or a liability. Mr. Maguire followed the advice of administration lawyers and initially blocked the complaint from being sent to Congress, drawing the ire of Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. But soon after, he engineered an agreement to provide the complaint to Congress. That move, along with the release of the reconstructed transcript of Mr. Trump’s call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, helped prompt the impeachment inquiry. Mr. Trump has not publicly criticized Mr. Maguire, and the acting director was not among the officials dismissed in the immediate aftermath of the president’s acquittal by the Senate. He has continued to brief the president and participate in decision-making such as the move to kill the Iranian general Qassim Suleimani in an airstrike last month. If Mr. Maguire were nominated for the permanent post, he would have to step down as the acting secretary while the Senate considered his nomination. That could take weeks or, like Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper’s nomination, be completed in a few days. While Mr. Ratcliffe’s nomination quickly raised questions, many congressional officials view Mr. Stewart as a stronger candidate. A retired Air Force officer and a prolific novelist, Mr. Stewart has served longer on the Intelligence Committee than Mr. Ratcliffe has. He also has a good reputation inside the intelligence agencies as a committee member who comes prepared to briefings and asks serious, well-informed questions. However, it is not clear if he would be willing to leave Congress to take the job. And if he did, he might not be willing to resign and give up his seat early. Mr. Stewart faces both a primary challenge and a Democratic opponent if he decides to run again in his Utah district. While Mr. Stewart was a stalwart defender of the president during the impeachment proceedings, he was critical of Mr. Trump during the 2016 campaign. In a speech in Utah in 2016, Mr. Stewart compared Mr. Trump to Benito Mussolini, the fascist former leader of Italy, and said he did not represent “Republican ideals.” Talk about Mr. Stewart has intensified as the deadline approaches for Mr. Maguire to stop serving as an acting director. Should Mr. Trump and his adviser not select Mr. Stewart, Mr. Maguire or someone else for the job, they will need to find another acting director. Under current law, they must choose a senior civil servant or one of the two officials in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. The two Senate-confirmed officials were, however, intimately involved in the whistle-blower case. Michael Atkinson, the inspector general for the intelligence community, did the initial investigation and tried to send his report to Congress, prompting Mr. Trump to privately contemplate firing him. Jason Klitenic, the general counsel of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, made the legal recommendation that Mr. Atkinson’s report on the whistle-blower could not be sent to Congress. Appointing him to the acting job would prompt sharp questions by congressional Democrats. The nomination of a permanent director or appointment of a new acting director has complicated negotiations over public testimony by the intelligence chief. Testimony last year by Mr. Coats and Gina Haspel, the C.I.A. director, was widely seen as contradicting Mr. Trump’s views of Iran, North Korea and other countries. The president responded with a series of Twitter posts saying the intelligence chiefs should “go back to school.” Mr. Maguire’s staff originally tried to make the testimony this year behind closed doors, an offer rebuffed by members of Congress. Mr. Schiff then requested a hearing for Wednesday. While that hearing will not take place, Congress and the administration continue to discuss a date for one in the future.",The New York Times
2020,Trump Budget Calls for New Nuclear Warheads and 2 Types of Missiles,"The president’s spending proposal requests money for a new arms race with Russia and China, and restores nuclear weapons as central to military policy. WASHINGTON — The Trump administration has begun to put a price tag on its growing arms race with Russia and China, and the early numbers indicate that restoring nuclear weapons to a central role in American military strategy will cost tens of billions of dollars over the next decade. In the 2021 budget released on Monday, the administration revealed for the first time that it intended to create a new submarine-launched nuclear warhead, named the W93. Its development is part of a proposed 19 percent increase this year, to $19.8 billion, for the National Nuclear Security Administration, the Energy Department agency that maintains the nuclear stockpile and develops new nuclear warheads. More tellingly, that is a jump of more than 50 percent since 2017, President Trump’s first year in office. There is $15.5 billion scheduled for development and deployment of new space assets — part of the new Space Force created by Mr. Trump — that are central to detecting incoming launches and for the command and control of American offensive weapons. Buried in the budget is a significant new effort to develop intermediate-range missiles — largely conventional weapons — that were prohibited by the Intermediate Nuclear Forces treaty with Moscow that Mr. Trump withdrew from last year. The budget also proposes $3.2 billion for hypersonic weapons, a 23 percent increase in research and development meant to compete with a growing number of similar Russian weapons. The missiles are particularly hard to defend against because they follow an unpredictable path to a target, at tremendous speed. But there were few specifics about whether the American versions would be fielded around the time that Russia’s weapons roll out, now scheduled for later in this decade, or whether they would follow by a number of years. The increases reflect more than budget priorities. They reveal a significantly different philosophy, rooted in Mr. Trump’s own belief that the United States should maintain the world’s most powerful nuclear force — and perhaps enlarge it. When President Barack Obama’s administration signed the New START agreement with Russia nearly a decade ago, Mr. Obama declared that it was United States policy “to reduce the role of nuclear weapons in our national security strategy and focus on reducing the nuclear dangers of the 21st century.” At the same time, he pledged to maintain a “safe, secure and effective nuclear deterrent.” As Mr. Obama struggled to reconcile those two goals, he did not authorize new weapons. Instead, he renovated the weapons laboratories — part of the political deal that resulted in passage of the New START treaty — and deferred decisions about new bombers, ground-based missiles and nuclear-equipped submarines. “This started under President Obama, but they consciously made no choices because the bill wasn’t due yet,” said Stephen Young, the Washington representative of the global security program at the Union of Concerned Scientists. “Now the Trump administration has put new projects on the table.” The Trump budget also proposes putting significant funds into reinvigorating old systems. For years, strategists have debated whether the United States could abandon its ground-based nuclear missiles, spread out in silos across the West. They are considered highly vulnerable and so old — many of them date to the 1970s — that they are a hazard. But Mr. Trump has produced a base budget of $1.5 billion in 2021 to prepare for deploying a new generation of missiles in the late 2020s. That is a nearly threefold increase from last year. In fact, the administration has put so many new projects in front of the Energy Department and the Pentagon that it seems unlikely many of them will get done, at least on the schedule Mr. Trump envisioned in his budget plan. The W93 weapon would not go into production until 2034, or nearly a decade after Mr. Trump would leave office if elected to a second term. Another new nuclear warhead, called the 87-1, a redesign of a 40-year-old thermonuclear weapon made for ground-based missiles, would not begin production until 2030. “The bottom line is that N.N.S.A. has more work on its plate than it can perform,” Mr. Young said of the National Nuclear Security Administration. “They are attempting to rebuild the entire nuclear stockpile, while building new components. And their history is that they do not perform big projects on time and on budget.” It is possible that Mr. Trump’s plan could be upended by the next president, or the president after that. But for now, the message being sent abroad is that the United States is back in the nuclear weapons business, either because it wants to bolster its arsenal or because Mr. Trump wants a stronger hand in negotiations. At the same time, American allies are going in the other direction. France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, said in a speech on Friday that his country’s arsenal had dropped below 300 weapons, and that he would seek other cuts. “These decisions are in line with our rejecting any type of arms race and our keeping the format for our nuclear deterrent at a level of strict sufficiency,” he said. He also called for “an autonomous and competitive industrial defense base,” so that France is less dependent on American technology. The key decision over the next year will not be what weapons to manufacture, but whether the restraints on creating a new, larger arsenal will expire a year from now. That is when the New START treaty is scheduled to expire, unless Mr. Trump and Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, decide on a five-year extension, a move that would not require a Senate vote. So far, Mr. Trump has said he would take that step only if China — which did not sign the accord — joins it, along with other nuclear powers. China has expressed no interest in doing so, and notes that its arsenal is one-fifth the size of Washington’s and Moscow’s, each of which is limited to 1,550 deployed weapons under the treaty. The administration has not explained whether it envisioned allowing China to significantly expand its arsenal to match the Russian and American levels, which seems unlikely, or to diminish the arsenals of the two largest superpowers, which is also hard to imagine. “Time is critical,” a former secretary of state, Madeleine K. Albright, and a former Russian foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, wrote in a New York Times Op-Ed column on Monday. “Doing nothing while waiting for a ‘better’ agreement is a recipe for disaster: We could lose New START and fail to replace it. The treaty’s agreed limits on nuclear arsenals are too important to be put at risk in a game of nuclear chicken.” But many of Mr. Trump’s advisers appear to disagree. They believe that the threat of a nuclear arms race will force Russia and China into a new negotiation, one that will result in a broader treaty.",The New York Times
2020,Trump Budget Would Fray Social Safety Net,"Proposals for cuts in food stamps, housing and education could exacerbate inequality in the United States. WASHINGTON — President Trump, since before his 2016 campaign, has broken with other Republicans to promise to protect America’s most prominent social safety net programs, but his budget request for fiscal year 2021 would trim government programs that millions of Americans depend upon. If enacted, the proposals would probably widen the gap between rich and poor. Many of the ideas have already been proposed by Mr. Trump and rejected by Congress. But some are being enacted by regulation. Taken together, they underscore the president’s desire to chip away at the nation’s social safety net while increasing spending on the military and border security. Although Mr. Trump said Social Security would remain unscathed, he does suggest measures to cut spending on the program. Mr. Trump’s budget emphasizes increasing labor force participation of people with disabilities and addressing fraud. In recent years, the improving economy has drawn many Americans with disabilities back into the labor force; the budget argues there is room for further movement in that direction. One policy the budget proposes is the establishment of an “expert panel” to develop and test new programs that would get more disabled people working. It does not specify what those strategies would be but estimates that such a program could save $47 billion over a decade. The proposal would also simplify the rules surrounding the effects of returning to work on benefits, arguing the current system deters people with disabilities from even attempting to find employment. The budget also seeks to address a “loophole” that allows people to receive both unemployment insurance and disability insurance for the same period of joblessness. Mr. Trump’s budget says that the unemployment insurance benefits should be taken into account when disability insurance benefits are awarded. It would save $10 billion by reducing the period of retroactive payments once a person is deemed eligible for the disability insurance program, from 12 months to six months. Overall, Mr. Trump estimates that overhauling federal disability programs and addressing fraud would save more than $75 billion between 2021 and 2030. The White House also wants to take a knife to the federal food stamp program, once again calling for reductions in the number of adults who can qualify for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. The 2021 budget proposes cutting SNAP funding by about $15 billion from last year. The White House has been making changes to the program on its own, raising eligibility requirements and tightening rules to prevent states from obtaining waivers from work requirements. That includes a rule change that goes into effect in April, which will require many adults without children who are able to work to find employment quickly or risk losing their food stamps. The administration estimates nearly 700,000 people across the country would lose access to the program. The 2021 budget proposes one set of work requirements for adults ages 18 to 65 who are able to work, rather than making a distinction on whether those adults have children or not. All adults who are able to work would have to engage in “at least 20 hours or more” of work or training to qualify for benefits. Money for low-income housing would also be depleted, as Mr. Trump’s budget proposed a 15.2 percent decrease from last year in gross discretionary funding for the Department of Housing and Urban Development, eliminating several block grant programs and reducing funding for rental assistance for low-income people. The budget would eliminate the Choice Neighborhoods program, which awards grants to neighborhoods with deteriorating public and federally assisted housing, arguing that states and local governments are better able to revitalize neighborhoods. Mr. Trump also requested less money for rental assistance programs, such as Housing Choice Vouchers, and proposed that tenants who can work contribute 35 percent of their income to rent instead of 30 percent. Ben Carson, the housing and urban development secretary, made the case that removing people from government programs was healthy for the economy. “We must remember, compassion is not always how many people we can get on a government program,” Mr. Carson said, “but rather how many people we can help graduate out of a program and into financial independence.” Other such programs would shrink if the White House’s budget office had its way. Mr. Trump called for reducing the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families block grant by 10 percent and imposing new measures to hold states accountable for achieving employment outcomes for the people who receive the cash assistance. Many of the cost-cutting measures pitched by Mr. Trump have long been championed by Republicans who have in the past expressed concern about rising deficits. “If Democrats are actually concerned about the deficit, they should work with Republicans on realistic approaches to get Washington’s spending under control while strengthening our safety net,” said Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the top Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee. But Democrats seized on the proposals on Monday as evidence that the president was out of touch with the plight of working families. “Once again, the president is showing just how little he values the good health, financial security and well-being of hard-working American families,” Speaker Nancy Pelosi said. Tom Perez, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, accused Mr. Trump of breaking his promises to the middle class by prioritizing his border wall over food stamps. “He’s going after critical funding for education and SNAP benefits while prioritizing funding for his unnecessary border wall and putting our national security at risk with massive cuts to resources for international aid and diplomacy,” Mr. Perez said.

2020,Trump Called for Paid Family Leave. Here’s Why Few Democrats Clapped.,"The bill he supported is limited; it works by allowing people to borrow from their future selves. President Trump called for paid family leave in the State of the Union on Tuesday, the first Republican president to do so. But the bill he supported does not offer what has generally been considered paid family leave. It is a bipartisan bill, introduced in December by Senator Kyrsten Sinema, Democrat of Arizona, and Senator Bill Cassidy, Republican of Louisiana. And it would enable new parents to collect a portion of their future child tax credits early and receive a smaller credit for the next 10 to 15 years. Here’s why it’s different from most paid family leave proposals. It does not provide a new source of funding to pay parents during leave; instead, they borrow from their future selves. It covers only leaves for babies or newly adopted children under 6; it does not cover care for sick family members or to take care of personal medical problems. And it does not guarantee that a person’s job is protected when taking the leave. Supporters of the bill describe it as a partial solution and a place to start, and say it doesn’t preclude Congress from pursuing more comprehensive paid leave. It has some important advantages, they say: Its sponsors are bipartisan, which is rare on this issue. It doesn’t raise taxes or create a mandate for businesses, two top priorities for Republicans. It also gives parents the freedom to use the money as they see fit, whether as wage replacement while on leave or to pay for infant or adoption expenses. “Not only is it a good solution, but it’s possible in the political world we live in today,” Senator Sinema said at an American Enterprise Institute and Brookings event in September. Since first campaigning for president, Mr. Trump has expressed support for some kind of paid parental leave, and it has been a policy goal of his daughter Ivanka Trump. Until Monday, the White House had said it was keeping every plan under consideration. This is the first time it endorsed one. Traditionally, Republicans haven’t supported paid leave — voicing concern about spending on new government programs and burdening businesses. So why is a Republican administration doing so? Politically, analysts say, it appeals to a group of voters they need: suburban women, especially those who voted for Mr. Trump in 2016 but have considered Democrats since then. “Everyone’s talking about suburban female voters because they’re deciding elections,” said Olivia Perez-Cubas, a spokeswoman for the Winning for Women Action Fund, a political group dedicated to electing Republican women. “They’re a coveted demographic in elections, and policies like paid family leave are important to them.” Paid leave, in general, is an easy sell with voters. Families need it — 72 percent of mothers and 93 percent of fathers with children at home are in the labor force — and a large majority of voters support it. But Americans, like their elected representatives, disagree on the details, particularly how to pay for it. In the State of the Union, Mr. Trump called paid parental leave for federal workers, a Democratic initiative he signed into law in December, “a model for the rest of the country.” But it has almost nothing in common with any of the paid leave bills in Congress, including the one he endorsed. The leave for federal workers, which will start in October, is financed by the government, and workers pay nothing (this is similar to companies that voluntarily give employees paid leave). There is one model of government-run paid leave that has already been successfully adopted in the United States. In eight states and the District of Columbia, paid leave has been financed by a small payroll tax increase, paid by employees and employers. This is also the model that Democrats have proposed for all Americans, in a bill called the Family Act. The child tax credit is worth up to $2,000 per child. If the Trump-backed bill passed, the average worker with a new child could receive $5,000, and then collect $500 less in child tax credits each year for 10 years. Workers earning less than $11,000 a year, who don’t qualify for the full child tax credit, could also get up to $5,000, and pay it back over 15 years. Under the Democrat-backed Family Act, average workers would pay an additional $120 in annual payroll taxes, according to analysis by Vicki Shabo, a senior fellow on paid leave policy and strategy at New America, a left-leaning policy group. If they took leave, they would receive $9,920 for 12 weeks. Those with income of less than $11,000 a year would receive two-thirds of their pay, roughly $1,840, and their payroll taxes would increase around $22 a year, according to the analysis. So far, the Family Act has minimal Republican support, and the deal breaker is the tax increase. “A payroll tax increase is not going to be passed into law anytime soon,” Ivanka Trump said on Face the Nation on CBS in December. Republicans have instead focused on ways to let people borrow from their future federal benefits. One idea, tapping Social Security early, has been unpopular, because it would mean receiving less money in retirement. The bill that Mr. Trump endorsed is different, its supporters say, because parents would just be shifting the timing of money that was already designated for helping them raise children, in the form of the child tax credit. But opponents say that it would just delay parents’ financial stressors, because they would collect smaller tax credits for the first decade of their children’s lives, when they still had significant expenses like child care, clothes and food. “Republicans have really painted themselves into a corner on taxes,” said Kathleen Romig, a senior policy analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning research group. “They know voters want it, constituents need it, but they don’t have anywhere to go for funding except for anything that already exists.” The Trump administration, in supporting the bill, wants to show support for working families, particularly women. Opponents of the bill fear it would end momentum for paid family leave — without actually achieving it.",The New York Times
2020,Trump Dismisses Warning of Russian 2020 Meddling as a Democratic ‘Hoax’,"The president described the intelligence finding that Russia was meddling in the 2020 election, delivered last week to House lawmakers, as a partisan “misinformation campaign.” LAS VEGAS — President Trump said Friday that the disclosure by American intelligence officials that Russia was again meddling in a presidential election in his favor was merely another partisan attack against him, continuing a pattern in which he has sought to dismiss warnings of foreign interference in American elections. “Another misinformation campaign is being launched by Democrats in Congress saying that Russia prefers me to any of the Do Nothing Democrat candidates who still have been unable to, after two weeks, count their votes in Iowa,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. “Hoax number 7!” He was responding to reports of a classified briefing in which intelligence officials told members of the House Intelligence Committee that Russia was interfering in the 2020 presidential campaign to aid his re-election. Republicans on the committee challenged the conclusions and Mr. Trump berated Joseph Maguire, the outgoing acting director of national intelligence, for allowing the briefing to happen. Intelligence officials have also concluded that the Russians are seeking to help Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont in the Democratic presidential primaries. At an afternoon campaign rally in Las Vegas, Mr. Trump continued with his accusations that Democrats were behind the reports and said they were trying to “poison our democracy” and were circulating “vile” hoaxes. “I was told a week ago,” the president said. “They said, ‘You know they’re trying to start a rumor.’ It’s disinformation. That’s the only thing they’re good at. They’re not good at anything else. They get nothing done. Do nothing Democrats.” During the final event of a four-day swing through the West, Mr. Trump suggested that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia would prefer Mr. Sanders. Mr. Trump claimed, inaccurately, that Mr. Sanders “honeymooned in Moscow.” And while Mr. Sanders did visit Yaroslavl in the Soviet Union in 1988 a day after his wedding, the trip was made to work out a sister-city relationship between Yaroslavl and Burlington, Vt., where Mr. Sanders was mayor at the time. In his 1997 autobiography, Mr. Sanders described the trip as a “very strange honeymoon,” but he and his wife went on a more traditional honeymoon a year later in St. Lucia, in the Caribbean. Mr. Trump, who has been cheerful in public and private about his re-election prospects, used the trip to raise millions from high-dollar donors and charm his political base at rallies in three states. And by returning every night to Las Vegas and holding his final rally there, he also tried to divert attention from Saturday’s Democratic caucuses in Nevada. The president has visited every state that has held a primary or caucus so far this year, making trolling Democratic candidates a cornerstone of his campaign strategy. At his rally on Friday, the president called up members of the 1980 “Miracle on Ice” men’s hockey team to take the stage behind him and waxed at length about his reality show “The Apprentice.” “Speaking also of reality television: This is the greatest show of all time, huh?” the president said. “I have to get back to Washington and work. I feel guilty. This is too much fun.” Mr. Trump spoke for nearly two hours and fired the crowd up with a litany of claims about his accomplishments during his first three years in office, many of them exaggerated or misleading. During an extended discussion about the dangers of illegal immigration, Mr. Trump noted that “illegal crossings are down 75 percent from last spring.” He did not mention that the decrease followed a huge surge in border apprehensions on his watch, leaving the number about where it was when he took office. Aside from appearing unbound and ebullient on the campaign trail, Mr. Trump also used the trip as an opportunity to take on some favorite targets, casting doubt on assorted institutions at every turn. He voiced his suspicions about Saturday’s Nevada caucuses, comparing it to the disastrous ones held in Iowa earlier this month. “I hear their computers are all messed up just like they were in Iowa,” he said. The president described members of the media as “the most dishonest human beings in the world” and accused law enforcement of harboring “dirty cops.” He also repeatedly joked with the crowd that he would stay president longer than two terms, a comment he has made at other events. Mr. Trump has a long history of dismissing the assessments made by intelligence agencies that he has deemed unfair or unflattering. Multiple agencies have determined that Russia meddled in the 2016 election, and, before the 2018 midterms, delivered warnings that Russia was prepared to do it again. Early in his presidency, Mr. Trump grudgingly accepted those assessments before falling back on personal assurances from Mr. Putin. “He said he didn’t meddle,” Mr. Trump said in November 2017. “I asked him again. You can only ask so many times. Every time he sees me, he says, ‘I didn’t do that.’ And I believe, I really believe, that when he tells me that, he means it.” Since then, Mr. Trump, with the assistance of his Justice Department, has moved to retaliate against the intelligence community rather than Mr. Putin. A federal prosecutor is scrutinizing how intelligence officials assessed Russia’s 2016 election interference, targeting the former C.I.A. director John O. Brennan in particular. Mr. Trump’s anger at the intelligence assessment delivered on Feb. 13 to lawmakers was magnified by the presence at the briefing of Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California, who is the chairman of the Intelligence Committee and played a lead role in the impeachment proceedings against Mr. Trump. The president’s decision to remove Mr. Maguire and install Richard Grenell, the ambassador to Germany and a fervent loyalist, was also seen as a direct outcome of the briefing. On Thursday evening, Mr. Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One that Representative Doug Collins of Georgia, an ally and a vocal opponent of impeachment, was one of the candidates under consideration as a permanent successor. By Friday morning, Mr. Collins said he was not interested. “This is not a job that interests me; at this time, it’s not one that I would accept because I’m running a Senate race down here in Georgia,” Mr. Collins said in an interview on Fox News. Mr. Trump then wrote on Twitter that he had a list of four candidates to succeed Mr. Grenell, and that he would make his decision in the coming weeks. Michael D.

2020,Trump Campaign Sues New York Times for Libel,"The lawsuit concerns an essay published a year ago and headlined “The Real Trump-Russia Quid Pro Quo.” President Trump’s re-election campaign sued The New York Times for libel on Wednesday, alleging that an Op-Ed article published by the newspaper falsely asserted a “quid pro quo” between Russian officials and Mr. Trump’s 2016 campaign. Mr. Trump often threatens to sue media organizations but rarely follows through. The lawsuit, filed in New York State court in Manhattan, is the first time his political operation has taken legal action against an American news outlet since he took office. The lawsuit concerns an essay published by the Opinion section of The Times in March 2019. The article, headlined “The Real Trump-Russia Quid Pro Quo,” was written by Max Frankel, who served as executive editor of The Times from 1986 to 1994. (The Opinion section of The Times operates separately from its newsroom.) In the essay, Mr. Frankel wrote about communications between Mr. Trump’s inner circle and Russian emissaries in the lead-up to the 2016 election. He concluded that, rather than any “detailed electoral collusion,” the Trump campaign and Russian officials “had an overarching deal”: “the quid of help in the campaign against Hillary Clinton for the quo of a new pro-Russian foreign policy.” The Trump lawsuit argues that this conclusion “is false” and that The Times published the essay “knowing it would misinform and mislead its own readers.” The suit also accuses The Times, without evidence, of harboring “extreme bias against and animosity toward” Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign. The Times responded on Wednesday that it would fight the suit. “The Trump campaign has turned to the courts to try to punish an opinion writer for having an opinion they find unacceptable,” Eileen Murphy, a spokeswoman for The Times, said in a statement. “Fortunately, the law protects the right of Americans to express their judgments and conclusions, especially about events of public importance,” Ms. Murphy added. “We look forward to vindicating that right in this case.” Mr. Trump, whose vilification of the news media has little precedent among past presidents, has ratcheted up his attacks on the press over the past year. He has accused The Times of “treason,” tweeted the term “fake news” hundreds of times and threatened to pull broadcast licenses. Asked about the lawsuit at a news conference at the White House on Wednesday night, Mr. Trump doubled down on his criticism of The Times. “It’s beyond an opinion,” he said of Mr. Frankel’s Op-Ed article. “That’s not an opinion. That’s something much more than an opinion.” “They did a bad thing,” the president added, “and there’ll be more coming.” Earlier Wednesday, several media law experts reacted with skepticism about the Trump campaign’s chances of succeeding in the suit. “A publisher cannot be held liable for commentary based on public facts,” said Brian Hauss, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union. Frederick Schauer, a law professor at the University of Virginia, said public figures who sue for libel must show that a publisher either “knew it was false before publishing, or had actual suspicion of falsity and went ahead anyway.” Proving that in court, he said, “is virtually impossible.” The lawsuit was filed on behalf of the Trump campaign by Charles J. Harder, a lawyer with a reputation for waging aggressive legal battles against prominent news organizations. Mr. Harder is best known for representing Terry G. Bollea, the former professional wrestler known as Hulk Hogan, in a lawsuit against Gawker Media that was secretly underwritten by the tech investor Peter Thiel. The suit, which concerned the publication of a sex video, resulted in a $140 million decision that led to Gawker Media’s bankruptcy and forced the site’s sale. Mr. Harder also represented Melania Trump, Mr. Trump’s wife, when she sued The Daily Mail, a British tabloid, in 2016 over what she said were “false and defamatory statements,” including that a modeling agency she worked for in the 1990s was also an escort service. The Daily Mail ultimately apologized, retracted the article and paid damages in a settlement. This is not Mr. Trump’s first time going to court against a journalist. In 2006, he sued Timothy L. O’Brien for libel after the publication of Mr. O’Brien’s biography, “TrumpNation: The Art of Being the Donald.” The case was dismissed three years later. (Mr. O’Brien, who previously worked as a reporter and editor at The Times, is a senior adviser to Michael R. Bloomberg’s presidential campaign.) The Times is also defending itself in a defamation suit brought by Sarah Palin, the former Republican vice-presidential nominee, over an editorial published in the Opinion pages that incorrectly linked her to a 2011 mass shooting that severely wounded Representative Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona. Ms. Palin’s case was dismissed by a Federal District Court, but an appellate court reinstated the suit last year. Nicole Hong contributed reporting, and Alain Delaquérière contributed research.

2020,Trump Campaign Will Open Storefronts in Swing States to Reach Black Voters,"The centers will register voters, sell campaign merchandise and promote policies that have benefited African-Americans, the campaign said. WASHINGTON — In its latest attempt to win over African-American voters, President Trump’s 2020 campaign said Wednesday it would lease 15 retail properties in predominantly black neighborhoods across swing states like Florida and Pennsylvania, where it will build welcoming “community centers” that sell merchandise, register voters and spread the word about Trump policies that have helped black communities. On Wednesday afternoon, senior Trump campaign officials offered reporters a tour through a mock-up storefront it built inside its campaign headquarters in Arlington, Va. Hoodies bearing the slogan “WOKE” were on display for sale in the mock community center. A large television screen played a stream of testimonials from black voters talking about why they supported Mr. Trump. Posters featuring smiling African-American supporters highlighted the administration’s work overhauling the criminal justice system, its funding of historically black colleges and universities, and the country’s unemployment rate, the lowest in 50 years. Colorful pamphlets advertised Mr. Trump as “a builder of communities and the American Dream,” and a rendering showed a possible exterior design for a center inside of what looked like a mall. The centers, which will be about the size of a small storefront, are planned for Jacksonville, Orlando, Tampa, and Miami, Fla.; Atlanta, Ga.; Detroit, Mich.; Columbus and Cleveland, Ohio; Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, Pa.; Charlotte, Raleigh and Greensboro, N.C.; and Milwaukee, Wis. “It’s a woke concept,” said Katrina Pierson, a senior campaign adviser. “For decades you have had a community that has been controlled by the Democratic Party. Republicans haven’t even gone in to deliver their message.” Mr. Trump won just 8 percent of African-American voters in the 2016 election. Senior campaign officials said they are spending millions of dollars on the new retail spaces in order to increase his support among black voters. Trump advisers say they do not need to increase his support significantly to make a difference in a handful of critical battleground states in November. The plan is the latest outreach from the Trump campaign to court African-Americans. Trump advisers often point to unemployment data as his main selling point. But even some Trump advisers concede that the president’s team has tactics but not a strategy when it comes to appealing to black voters, many of whom have recoiled from his rhetoric and some of his policies, such as cuts to social safety net programs. “He clearly is very desperate for black support,” said Adrianne Shropshire, executive director of BlackPAC, a progressive group. “This is not something we’ve ever seen before, in terms of opening offices in black communities. There is a reality that we know that some black voters are going to vote for Trump.” The outreach is not guaranteed to help the president. Ms. Shropshire said that a recent internal poll conducted by her organization showed that about one-third of respondents had been contacted in some way by the Trump campaign. But, she said, “the majority of folks in our survey said the contact made them less likely to vote for Trump.” Part of the disconnect, she said, was that the message about a surging economy and low unemployment rate was at odds with many people’s lived experience of holding multiple jobs but still struggling to be financially stable. And then there’s the elephant in the room when it comes to Mr. Trump and black support. “A number of our polls and other national polls show that black voters simply think he’s a racist,” Ms. Shropshire said. “You can show up, but most people believe you’re a racist and that you fundamentally don’t have the interests of black people at heart.” Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump’s campaign manager, however, said all of the outreach has already increased support. “At a minimum, we’re double where we were in 2016,” he said on Wednesday. Later, the Republican National Committee said it was funding the outreach centers, which officials said would help Republicans up and down the ballot. Senior campaign officials said they were also considering opening Latinos for Trump offices down the line. Updated Feb. 29, 2020",The New York Times
2020,"Trump Campaign and R.N.C. Spent $9 Million in 4th Quarter, Mostly on Digital Ads","The groups supporting the president’s re-election bid also made 150 payments to Trump-owned entities and properties, Federal Election Commission filings show. WASHINGTON — President Trump’s campaign and the Republican National Committee together spent more than $9 million on polling, digital ads and fees paid to Trump-owned properties in the last three months of 2019, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission released on Friday. The filings detail how the Trump campaign, the Trump Victory committee, a third entity called the Trump Make America Great Again Committee and the national party committee spent their cash from October through the end of December. Together, they previously reported raising $154 million over those months, and closed the year with $195 million in cash on hand. The Trump apparatus has raised an outsize sum, but it has faced questions about how, exactly, it is spending its reserves. Even though he is not funding his own bid this time around, Mr. Trump has repeatedly grilled his advisers about where and how they are spending money. According to a New York Times analysis, the biggest expenditure in the final three months of the year was on digital advertising. From October to December, the campaign spent more than $6 million on digital ads. The T-MAGA committee spent another $3.2 million on digital ads. The campaign also spent $525,000 on polling in that period. The Republican National Committee spent $2.2 million on polling. The Trump campaign spent about $194,000 at Trump-owned properties. The filings show that the groups supporting Mr. Trump’s re-election together made 150 separate payments to Trump-owned entities and properties, totaling nearly $600,000 for the three-month period, and $1.7 million for the year. One of the biggest changes in the last quarter of 2019 was to the compensation of the campaign manager, Brad Parscale, whose company had been paid more than $16 million through the various Trump entities and the national committee last year, according to the filings. But in the past three months, his company made just over $200,000 from the four committees, a drastic scaling back that came after scrutiny of how much he was making, including questions raised by Mr. Trump himself. Campaign officials have said the money paid to Mr. Parscale’s company in the past was for employee salaries, and they have insisted that Mr. Parscale is not pocketing a percentage of either donations or the ad buys. They also noted the sharp reduction to the amount of money his company was bringing in. “For as much transparency as possible, Brad Parscale has severely limited the pass-throughs going through his firm,” Tim Murtaugh, a campaign spokesman, said about the change. “As has always been the case, he is paid a salary by the campaign and takes no percentages.” Among the top candidates vying for the Democratic nomination, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont raised the most money in the fourth quarter of 2019 ($34.4 million) and entered January with the most cash on hand ($18.2 million). Mr. Trump’s spending demonstrates his advantage as an incumbent with no competitive primary race. The Trump campaign was vastly outspent by Michael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York City who is self-financing a campaign. Mr. Bloomberg spent an eye-popping $188 million of his own money in the fourth quarter. The president also spent less in the last quarter then some of the top-tier Democratic candidates running more traditional races, who went on sprees as they tried to break out in a tight primary. Mr. Sanders, for example, spent $50 million last quarter. Over all, the Democratic candidates spent more than $500 million.

2020,"Trump Can Withhold Millions From ‘Sanctuary’ States, Court Rules","The Justice Department hailed the decision as a victory for public safety. Three other appeals courts had ruled against the administration on the issue. The Trump administration can withhold millions of dollars from law enforcement agencies in states and cities that do not cooperate with U.S. immigration authorities, a federal appeals court ruled on Wednesday. The decision, by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Manhattan, was the first by an appellate court to side with the administration’s argument that it can impose conditions on the release of the money, which comes in the form of grants. Three other appeals courts have previously affirmed lower court rulings that it was unlawful for the White House to tie the grant money to state and local governments’ cooperation with the federal authorities. Administration officials hailed the ruling. “Today’s decision rightfully recognizes the lawful authority of the attorney general to ensure that Department of Justice grant recipients are not at the same time thwarting federal law enforcement priorities,” Alexei Woltornist, a Justice Department spokesman, said. Officials with the jurisdictions that filed the lawsuit that led to the decision vowed to continue battling the administration. “President Trump’s latest retaliation against his hometown takes away security funding from the number one terrorist target in America,” Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York City said in a statement, “all because we refuse to play by his arbitrary rules.” “We’ll see President Trump back in court,” he added. “And we will win.” Gurbir S. Grewal, the attorney general of New Jersey, said he was “disappointed by the ruling” and he, too, indicated that the fight was not over. “It’s unfortunate that the federal government has decided to weaponize the federal grant funding process in order to carry out the president’s anti-immigrant agenda,” Mr. Grewal said, “but I’m confident that we will ultimately prevail in the courts.” The decision comes amid an escalating crackdown by the administration on so-called sanctuary policies, which limit the extent to which state and local law enforcement agencies can help federal immigration authorities. New York City, Chicago, Philadelphia, California and other places that have such policies have seen increased activity this year by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, which has diverted agents from the southern border to assist with arrests in some areas. The agency has also issued subpoenas to law enforcement authorities in sanctuary jurisdictions seeking information on immigrants in their custody, and its acting director, Matthew T. Albence, has denounced the policies in sharply worded statements as threatening public safety. The Second Circuit ruling, by a unanimous three-judge panel and written by Judge Reena Raggi, reversed a lower court judge’s decision, and found that the federal government had the discretion to impose conditions when distributing grant money. The appellate opinion, which applies only to the jurisdictions that filed the suit, noted that the Supreme Court had repeatedly observed that the federal government has power over states where immigration policy is concerned. Judge Raggi, who wrote in her opinion that the case involved “several of the most divisive issues confronting our country,” was appointed to the federal bench by President Ronald Reagan and elevated to the appeals court by President George W. Bush. Also on the panel were Judge Ralph K. Winter Jr., who was appointed to the Second Circuit by Mr. Reagan, and Judge José A. Cabranes, who was appointed by President Bill Clinton. The case was brought by New York and several other states after the Justice Department announced that it would withhold grant money from localities that denied federal immigration authorities access to jails, among other conditions. Judge Edgardo Ramos of Federal District Court in Manhattan ruled in favor of the plaintiffs in 2018, saying that the Trump administration did not have the “lawful authority” to impose such conditions on funding. Judge Ramos blocked the administration from enforcing its conditions on New York City, New York State, New Jersey and five other states that joined the lawsuit: Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Virginia and Washington. It was unclear on Wednesday which of two options the states involved in the New York case might pursue: requesting review from the full Second Circuit, or asking the Supreme Court, which typically resolves conflicting rulings among federal appeals courts, to take up the case. The grants in question, the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grants, are the biggest source of federal law enforcement funding to state and local jurisdictions. New York City has received about $4 million a year in such funding. The money has, among other things, paid the salaries of emergency responders and covered the cost of drug prosecutions. The dispute has its origins in an executive order issued by Mr. Trump early in his term that directed the attorney general and the Department of Homeland Security to make sanctuary jurisdictions ineligible for federal grants. The order was successfully challenged. In July 2017, Jeff Sessions, the attorney general at the time, zeroed in on the Byrne grants, imposing a set of conditions that effectively rendered sanctuary jurisdictions ineligible for the money. The conditions included requiring grant recipients to allow federal agents to interview immigrants in their custody and to provide the federal authorities with notice when immigrants were scheduled to be released. The three appeals courts that previously ruled against the administration, in Chicago, Philadelphia and San Francisco, all found that such restrictions were improper. “This decision is a total break on what has been a unanimous decision from courts and judges across the country that this is illegal,” said Cody Wofsy, a staff lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union Immigrants’ Rights Project, which filed an amicus curiae, or friend of the court, brief in the case. Mr. Wofsy said the limits on grant money were “part of the administration’s larger campaign to coerce and force” states and local governments “to become part of the federal deportation system.” Under the U.S. Constitution, he said, “states have the privilege to refuse.” The crackdown on states with policies and laws that shield undocumented immigrants has been felt acutely in New York in recent months. After a law went into effect allowing such immigrants to get driver’s licenses, and barring federal agencies from gaining access to a motor vehicles database, the administration barred New Yorkers from enrolling in Trusted Traveler programs like Global Entry and halted the export of cars with New York titles. In a statement, Steven Choi, the executive director of the New York Immigration Coalition, said, “Today’s ruling essentially sanctions the federal administration’s extortion of cities who have enacted policies to ensure local control of law enforcement dollars and protect immigrant communities.” The Byrne grant program, which dispenses more than $250 million a year, was created in 2006 and named for a New York police officer who was fatally shot while guarding the home of a cooperating witness. “Officer Eddie Byrne’s legacy reminds us that maintaining strong relationships with immigrant communities keeps all New Yorkers safe,” Bitta Mostofi, the city’s immigrant affairs commissioner, said.",The New York Times

It’s going to you, and you will soon be heading to the school of your choice.” [applause] Throughout his speech, Trump struck an optimistic tone, not once mentioning his impeachment trial. “Jobs are booming, incomes are soaring, poverty is plummeting, crime is falling, confidence is surging, and our country is thriving and highly respected again.” The optimism was a way to make his case for re-election. “We are moving forward at a pace that was unimaginable just a short time ago, and we are never, ever going back.” [applause] In foreign policy, he touted the killing of adversaries. “The bloodthirsty killer known as al-Baghdadi is dead. And the U.S. military executed a flawless precision strike that killed Suleimani and terminated his evil reign of terror forever.” He also sent a message to Venezuela’s government by inviting the opposition leader. “… Juan Guaidó.” [applause] Democrats had their own message, many wearing white, a symbol of women’s suffrage and empowerment. [chanting] “We are curbing the opioid epidemic —” Trump ended his speech looking to the future. “This nation is our canvas, and this country is our masterpiece. We look at tomorrow and see unlimited frontiers just waiting to be explored.” After he was through, Speaker Pelosi sent one final message with her copy of his speech. [applause] WASHINGTON — President Trump claimed credit for a “great American comeback” in a speech to Congress on Tuesday night, boasting of a robust economy, contrasting his successes with the records of his predecessors and projecting optimism in the face of a monthslong Democratic effort to force him from office. Mr. Trump, who lamented what he called “American carnage” when he was inaugurated in January 2017, described a different country today, declaring in his third State of the Union address that the nation’s future was once again “blazing bright.” “In just three short years, we have shattered the mentality of American Decline and we have rejected the downsizing of America’s destiny,” Mr. Trump said in a speech that lasted 78 minutes. “We have totally rejected the downsizing. We are moving forward at a pace that was unimaginable just a short time ago, and we are never, ever going back!” “The state of our union,” Mr. Trump declared, “is stronger than ever before.” Welcomed by enthusiastic applause from Republican lawmakers, the president marched confidently into the same historic chamber where he was impeached 49 days earlier. Mr. Trump described the nation as enjoying what he called a “blue-collar boom,” fueled by trade agreements and his success in “restoring our nation’s manufacturing might.” On the eve of a Senate vote expected to acquit him, Mr. Trump never mentioned the impeachment inquiry that has threatened his presidency and consumed Washington. But his interactions on Tuesday night with Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who started the investigation by Democrats that has forever stained his legacy, underscored the deep bitterness between them. As he arrived at the rostrum, Mr. Trump turned to hand copies of his speech to Ms. Pelosi and Vice President Mike Pence. But when Ms. Pelosi offered her hand to shake, the president pointedly turned away without taking it. Seated just behind the president, Ms. Pelosi grimaced and shook her head several times during his address. Moments after Mr. Trump finished and was basking in applause from Republicans, the speaker ripped up the pages of his speech, holding them high for the cameras to catch her unmistakable statement of scorn. With the theatrical touches of a showman-turned-president, Mr. Trump surprised the wife of an Army soldier with the soldier’s return home from battle, highlighted the story of a 100-year-old Tuskegee airman and his 13-year-old great-grandson, and — in a remarkable moment — awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Rush Limbaugh, the combative conservative talk radio host and for decades a villain to the left. Standing next to Mr. Limbaugh, who recently learned he has advanced lung cancer, Melania Trump, the first lady, draped the medal around his neck as Mr. Trump thanked him for “decades of tireless devotion to our country.” As the president fights for a second term in an election that will require him to broaden his appeal, he boasted of increasing funding for historically black colleges and singled out several African-Americans in the House chamber for praise, a striking departure for a president who derided African nations as “shithole countries” and repeatedly criticized the city of Baltimore, represented at the time by one of the nation’s leading black politicians, Representative Elijah E. Cummings, who died last year. At the same time, Mr. Trump used the speech as a clarion call to his most conservative supporters, prompting some Republicans in the chamber to chant, “Four more years.” The president also boasted that he was building “a long, tall and very powerful wall” across the southwestern border and vowed to oppose what he called a “socialist takeover” of the health care system by Democrats in Washington and those running to replace him in the White House. “To those watching at home tonight, I want you to know: We will never let socialism destroy American health care!” Mr. Trump declared. Even as he delivered his remarks, it was Democrats who were in disarray, still unable to declare a final winner in the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucuses. State officials said they expected to release more results later Tuesday evening in a botched election process that Mr. Trump was quick to mock online. “The Democrat Caucus is an unmitigated disaster,” the president crowed on Twitter earlier in the day. “Nothing works, just like they ran the Country. Remember the 5 Billion Dollar Obamacare website, that should have cost 2% of that. The only person that can claim a very big victory in Iowa last night is ‘Trump.’” Mr. Trump was not the first president to face his accusers even as they try to remove him from office. In 1999, President Bill Clinton delivered his State of the Union address to Congress in the middle of his impeachment trial on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice stemming from a sexual harassment lawsuit. Mr. Clinton did not mention the Senate trial, then still underway. Like Mr. Clinton, Mr. Trump did not use the nationally televised address to reprise his daily rants about impeachment, his made on Twitter. Instead, Mr. Trump — who is infamous for his rambling, invective-filled speeches at his rallies — largely stuck to an optimistic, if not always bipartisan, script. The president did not unveil any major new initiatives, but called on Congress to pass bills to encourage school choice, lower prescription drug prices, provide a small amount of funding for neonatal research, ban late-term abortions and work toward improving the nation’s roads, bridges and tunnels. As he has done each year, Mr. Trump focused a large part of the speech on immigration. He called on Congress to ban “free government health care for illegal aliens” and to pass legislation allowing the victims of crimes by undocumented immigrants to sue so-called sanctuary cities. The president described a “gruesome spree of deadly violence” by an undocumented immigrant in California and introduced the brother of one of the victims, Rocky Jones, who was shot eight times. “Our hearts weep for your loss,” Mr. Trump told the victim’s brother, Jody Jones, “and we will not rest until you have justice.” The title of the president’s speech was “The Great American Comeback,” a more formal slogan that combines the sentiments of “Make America Great Again,” the president’s viral phrase from the 2016 campaign, and the more recent “Keep America Great” mantra that he has used to fire up crowds at rallies. In his speech, he bragged about significant economic successes, even “though predictions were that this could never be done.” But his boast to have added 12,000 new factories overstated his claim to delivering an economic miracle to white working-class voters in the industrial Midwest. Employment in construction, manufacturing and mining combined grew more slowly last year than at almost any other point in the current expansion. Manufacturing employment growth slowed to less than 50,000 jobs for the year in 2019, the worst rate of his presidency and the second-worst of the long recovery from recession. Turning to trade, he said he had succeed in revising the North American Free Trade Agreement, something supported by many Democrats as well as Republicans. “Many politicians came and went, pledging to change or replace NAFTA, only to do absolutely nothing,” Mr. Trump said, asserting the successes without acknowledging the more nuanced reality. “But unlike so many who came before me, I keep my promises.” In the official Democratic response to Mr. Trump’s speech, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan challenged the president’s boasts about the economy. “It doesn’t matter what the president says about the stock market,” Ms. Whitmer said. “What matters is that millions of people struggle to get by or don’t have enough money at the end of the month after paying for transportation, student loans or prescription drugs.” Many of the female Democratic lawmakers attending the speech were dressed in white, symbolizing the suffragist movement and women’s rights. Several Democratic lawmakers, including Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Ayanna S. Pressley of Massachusetts, were not in attendance after announcing they were boycotting it. “I will not use my presence at a state ceremony to normalize Trump’s lawless conduct & subversion of the Constitution,” Ms. Ocasio-Cortez tweeted. While discussing national security, Mr. Trump celebrated in macabre terms two targeted killings he had ordered in recent months. He hailed the October raid leading to the death of the Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, whom Mr. Trump called “a bloodthirsty killer” and whose demise he cast as justice for the murder of Kayla Mueller, a young American humanitarian worker kidnapped in Syria in 2013. Mr. Trump said that Ms. Mueller, whose parents he introduced, was “tortured and enslaved by ISIS” after “more than 500 horrifying days of captivity.” The president also recalled with relish the Jan. 3 missile strike that killed the Iranian commander Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, a “ruthless butcher” who Mr. Trump said had “orchestrated the deaths of countless men, women and children.” He cast Mr. Suleimani’s death as another act of patriotic vengeance, recalling the Iranian’s role in supplying bombs believed to have killed hundreds of American soldiers during the Iraq war, and telling the story of an American soldier, Christopher Hake, “who made the ultimate sacrifice for his country” when his Bradley vehicle was hit by a roadside bomb. And in a brief passage noting his desire to withdraw troops from Afghanistan, Mr. Trump assured that he was “not looking to kill hundreds of thousands of people” in the country, “many of them innocent.” The president introduced a parade of guests during his speech, including a 13-year-old boy with aspirations to join the Space Force and Charles McGee, his 100-year-old great-grandfather, one of the last surviving Tuskegee Airmen. Mr. Trump said he promoted Mr. McGee to brigadier general in a ceremony at the White House before the speech. In addition to Mr. McGee, the president highlighted the story of Tony Rankins, an Army veteran who fought back from drug addiction, and Stephanie Davis, to whom he granted an Opportunity Scholarship for her fourth-grade daughter, Janiyah, to go to the school of her choice. All were African-American. Mr. Trump also introduced the wife and son of an Army staff sergeant who died in Iraq by a roadside bomb supplied by General Suleimani. At another point, the president singled out Juan Guaidó, the leader of Venezuela’s opposition movement, who received his most visible show of support yet from Mr. Trump: a seat in the president’s guest box for the State of the Union. Many White House aides had hoped to have the impeachment trial behind them before Mr. Trump’s speech. But as it turned out, his third State of the Union address was part of a remarkable political collision on the calendar: He delivered the speech a day before the final impeachment vote and a day after Iowans participated in the first voting of the 2020 campaign season. There is no question that the president will be acquitted on Wednesday by the Republican-controlled Senate, giving him the chance to claim vindication in what he views as an attempted political assassination by his enemies. But he will forever be the third impeached president in American history and only the first to ask voters for re-election after being charged with committing high crimes and misdemeanors. Set in motion last year by Ms. Pelosi after Democrats took control of the House in 2018, the move to impeachment was directed by House managers during a two-week Senate trial. It was built on damning evidence that the president withheld security aid for Ukraine and a coveted Oval Office meeting as leverage for investigations that could damage the political fortunes of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son, Hunter Biden. Tuesday was the second day that senators announced their judgments on the president’s behavior, delivering speeches on the Senate floor. Notable among them were the condemnations of Republicans who accepted the truth of the accusations against Mr. Trump even as they said they planned to vote to acquit him. “The president’s behavior was shameful and wrong,” Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, said Monday night on the Senate floor even as she denounced an unfair, fiercely partisan process and announced, “I cannot vote to convict.” Reporting was contributed by Peter Baker, Jim Tankersley, Lara Jakes, Michael Crowley and Maggie Haberman.",The New York Times
2020,How Trump’s Relationship With Barr Got So Complicated,"A whipsaw week of charged decisions by the Justice Department, some favored by the president and others not, has bewildered much of Washington. WASHINGTON — When President Trump learned that the Justice Department was dropping a case against a former F.B.I. official whom he considered one of his longtime enemies, his immediate response was anger. As he flipped on the television Friday and watched how the story was being covered, that anger only mounted. Since taking office, Mr. Trump has searched for an attorney general who would function much as Roy Cohn did for him as his personal lawyer and fixer in the 1970s — a warrior committed to protecting him and going after his foes. The president thought he had found that person in William P. Barr. But now, people close to Mr. Trump say, he is not so sure. The president was cheered this week when Mr. Barr moved to reduce the sentence of a convicted presidential friend, only to be shocked when the attorney general publicly called on Mr. Trump to stop tweeting about it. And after his livid reaction to the Justice Department’s decision to drop a separate case, which he heard about without any advance notice, he learned that Mr. Barr was intervening more favorably on behalf of another presidential ally. The whipsaw events of recent days have bewildered much of Washington, including some of the people around the president and his attorney general. Once seen as a lock step partnership, it now may be the most complicated relationship in town. The six blocks between the White House and the Robert F. Kennedy Department of Justice Building have become a political buffer zone and no one can be entirely sure what comes next. Critics assume it is all a Kabuki dance, cynical theater meant to preserve Mr. Barr’s credibility as he executes Mr. Trump’s personal political agenda while pretending to look independent. And it is certainly true that, even now, Mr. Barr continues to demonstrate a willingness to personally take charge of cases with Mr. Trump’s interests at stake. But insiders insist the tension is real, with potentially profound consequences for an administration that has redrawn the lines at the intersection of politics and law enforcement. Barely a week after being acquitted in a Senate impeachment trial, Mr. Trump is demanding that some of the people whose actions he believes led to his troubles be charged, convicted and sent to prison, and it is not clear that even Mr. Barr is willing or able to go as far as the president wants. In his only comment on the matter on Friday, Mr. Trump pushed back against Mr. Barr a day after the attorney general told ABC News that the president was making it “impossible for me to do my job” by tweeting about criminal cases and declared that he was “not going to be bullied.” Mr. Trump cited another comment Mr. Barr made in the same interview affirming that the president had never actually asked for any specific actions in a criminal case. “This doesn’t mean that I do not have, as President, the legal right to do so, I do, but I have so far chosen not to!” Mr. Trump added. The “so far” in there, of course, hung online as a kind of sword of Damocles waiting to fall. Only in the hours after that tweet did the news emerge that Mr. Barr’s department was dropping a case against Andrew G. McCabe, the former deputy F.B.I. director blamed by Mr. Trump for his role in the investigation into Russian election interference. Two people close to the matter said the Justice Department did not give the president a heads up about the decision. Then came the more welcome news for the Oval Office that Mr. Barr had ordered a re-examination of the case of Michael T. Flynn, the president’s former national security adviser who pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. about his contacts with Russia. The new review raised the question of whether Mr. Flynn will actually go to prison. Mr. Trump has bitterly decried “what Flynn has gone through” while believing that Mr. McCabe has unfairly walked, people close to him said. The president on Friday was angrier about the decision not to prosecute Mr. McCabe than he was at Mr. Barr’s comments in his interview, the people said. Mr. Trump made no mention of any of those newer developments on Twitter or in several encounters with reporters before flying to Florida for the weekend. But he sometimes waits to publicly respond to such news until after an evening watching Fox News or hearing from friends. On the fifth floor of the Justice Department, Mr. Barr’s team braced for what they feared would be a stream of critiques and humiliations from the president in what one predicted could be a death by a thousand cuts, not unlike what happened to the last attorney general, Jeff Sessions, who was tormented by the president after recusing himself from the Russia investigation. Mr. Sessions, like other cabinet members, stoically absorbed Mr. Trump’s invectives, rarely standing up for himself or his employees, even as the president paralyzed, undercut and neutered him. Like other original cabinet members, he left the administration publicly humiliated and vastly diminished. Mr. Barr faced many risks in speaking out on ABC, according to people close to him. But he knew that no amount of public fealty would stave off a public drubbing or even an abrupt dismissal. For now, though, there is no expectation at the Justice Department or the White House of an escalation to that level. While Lou Dobbs on Fox Business Network excoriated Mr. Barr for rebuking the president, other Fox hosts who have Mr. Trump’s ear, like Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham, were generally supportive of the attorney general. Tucker Carlson, another trusted television personality, treated Mr. Barr’s ABC interview like a nonevent on his Fox News show Thursday night. Ms. Ingraham, who is close to Mr. Barr, said the attorney general was not breaking with the president but, in effect, reassuring him that the Justice Department’s leadership would carry out Mr. Trump’s wishes to clean up what they see as the corruption of his predecessor and that the tweets were neither necessary nor helpful. “Barr was basically telling Trump, ‘Don’t worry, I got this,’” Ms. Ingraham said on her show. Some of the attorney general’s critics saw it the same way. Nine Democratic senators, including two presidential candidates, Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, sent a letter to Mr. Barr on Friday calling on him to resign. His protestations of independence were not credible, they wrote, given his department’s behavior. “It demonstrates that you lied to Congress during your confirmation hearing when you stated that you would ‘keep the enforcement process sacrosanct from political influence,’ and it reveals your unwillingness or inability to maintain the integrity of the D.O.J. and to uphold justice and the rule of law,” the senators wrote. Ms. Warren and three other Democratic senators also unveiled legislation barring an attorney general and other top Justice Department officials appointed by a president from participating in matters related to the president, his family or his campaign associates. Although Mr. Trump and Mr. Barr both said the president has not directly asked for any specific inquiries, the president has long pressured law enforcement officials both publicly and privately to open investigations into political rivals and to drop inquiries into him or his associates. Since Watergate, past presidents in both parties have had a tradition in place aimed at preventing political influence from the White House on Justice Department investigations, especially criminal inquiries that involved administration officials or friends of the president. “It tries to prevent the interference by forcing all White House contact to go through a funnel at the top of the Justice Department,” said John Yoo, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley who served in the Justice Department under President George W. Bush. Mr. Trump’s first White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, issued similar rules in a Jan. 27, 2017, memo that prohibited White House officials from communicating with most Justice Department officials about “ongoing or contemplated cases.” Only the president, vice president or White House counsel was allowed to initiate such communications, Mr. McGahn wrote, and they must be directed to the attorney general or three other top Justice Department officials. “In order to ensure that D.O.J. exercises its investigatory and prosecutorial functions free from the fact or appearance of improper political influence, these rules must be strictly followed,” Mr. McGahn wrote. But scholars said Mr. Trump is right that he has the power to intervene if he chooses. Under Article II of the Constitution, any president has the authority to directly oversee criminal cases carried out by the Justice Department. There are no statutes that limit the contact between the White House and the Justice Department. “The president can do what he wants,” said Bruce Green, a law professor at Fordham University. “His only restraints are self imposed. There are no legislative restraints.” The only real recourse, he added, would be impeachment. “If a president attempted to misuse the Justice Department and its criminal justice power for private ends, that’s an abuse of power that is potentially impeachable,” Mr. Green said. “We can guess in 2020 how that would play out.” Maggie Haberman contributed reporting from New York, and Katie Benner and Michael Crowley from Washington.",The New York Times
2020,"Trump Grants Clemency to Blagojevich, Milken and Kerik","The president also pardoned or commuted the sentences of eight others on Tuesday, including Edward DeBartolo, a former owner of the San Francisco 49ers. WASHINGTON — President Trump, citing what he said was advice from friends and business associates, granted clemency on Tuesday to a who’s who of white-collar criminals from politics, sports and business who were convicted on charges involving fraud, corruption and lies — including the financier Michael R. Milken. The president pardoned Mr. Milken, the so-called junk bond king of the 1980s, as well as the former New York City police commissioner Bernard B. Kerik and Edward J. DeBartolo Jr., a former owner of the San Francisco 49ers. He also commuted the sentence of Rod R. Blagojevich, a former Democratic governor of Illinois. Their political and finance schemes made them household names, and three received prison terms while Mr. DeBartolo paid a $1 million fine. Mr. Trump also pardoned David Safavian, the top federal procurement official under President George W. Bush, who had been sentenced in 2009 to a year in prison for lying about his ties to the lobbyist Jack Abramoff and obstructing the sprawling investigation into Mr. Abramoff’s efforts to win federal business. The president also granted clemency to six other people. Mr. Trump has repeatedly stated his commitment to a criminal justice overhaul and addressing the excessive sentences given to minorities. At the urging of Kim Kardashian West in 2018, he pardoned Alice Marie Johnson, a 63-year-old African-American woman serving a life sentence for a nonviolent drug conviction. Ms. Johnson was the centerpiece of a TV ad the Trump campaign ran this month during the Super Bowl. But the president’s announcements on Tuesday were mostly aimed at wiping clean the slates of rich, powerful and well-connected white men. And they came after years of sophisticated public relations campaigns aimed at persuading Mr. Trump to exercise the authority given to him under the Constitution. Patti Blagojevich, the wife of the former Illinois governor, frequently appeared on Fox News calling for Mr. Trump to commute her husband’s sentence. Mr. Kerik, a regular on Fox News, appeared on the network as recently as Monday night. Mr. Milken has sought to rebrand himself as a philanthropist in recent years as allies campaigned on his behalf for a pardon. In conversations with his advisers, Mr. Trump has also raised the prospect of commuting the sentence of Roger J. Stone Jr., his longtime adviser, who was convicted in November of seven felony charges, including tampering with a witness and lying under oath in order to obstruct a congressional inquiry into whether the Trump campaign conspired with Russia to influence the 2016 election. Asked about a pardon for Mr. Stone on Tuesday, Mr. Trump insisted that “I haven’t given it any thought.” Democrats pounced on the president’s announcements. “Today, Trump granted clemency to tax cheats, Wall Street crooks, billionaires and corrupt government officials,” said Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont, the leading Democratic candidate for president. “Meanwhile, thousands of poor and working-class kids sit in jail for nonviolent drug convictions. This is what a broken and racist criminal justice system looks like.” Representative Bill Pascrell Jr., Democrat of New Jersey, said in a statement that the president abused the pardon power by using it to reward friends and repair the reputations of felons who do not deserve it. “The pardoning of these disgraced figures should be treated as another national scandal by a lawless executive,” he said. But Mr. Trump defended his grants of clemency on Tuesday. He was particularly critical of the 14-year prison sentence for Mr. Blagojevich, who was convicted of trying when he was governor of Illinois to essentially sell the Senate seat vacated by Barack Obama when he became president. Mr. Blagojevich also once appeared on the reality TV series “The Celebrity Apprentice,” which Mr. Trump hosted. “That was a tremendously powerful, ridiculous sentence, in my opinion,” Mr. Trump said after announcing that Mr. Blagojevich would go free after serving eight years. The president alleged that the former governor was a victim of the same forces that investigated him for years, citing James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, and Patrick Fitzgerald, the U.S. attorney in Chicago who prosecuted Mr. Blagojevich. “It was a prosecution by the same people — Comey, Fitzpatrick, the same group,” Mr. Trump told reporters, misstating Mr. Fitzgerald’s name. Mr. Trump gave no indication that he relied on the usual vetting process that guides presidents making use of their constitutional authority to wipe away criminal convictions or commute prison sentences. Traditionally, the Justice Department’s pardons office would make recommendations about pardons and commutations to the deputy attorney general, who would weigh in and then pass the department’s final determinations to the White House. Instead, Mr. Trump told reporters that he followed “recommendations” in making his decisions. Those recommendations, according to a White House statement, came from the president’s longtime friends, business executives, celebrities, campaign donors, sports figures and political allies. In pardoning Mr. Kerik, who pleaded guilty to tax fraud and lying to the government, Mr. Trump said he heard from more than a dozen people, including Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York mayor and Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer; Geraldo Rivera, a Fox TV personality; and Eddie Gallagher, a former Navy SEAL and accused war criminal whose demotion was overturned by Mr. Trump last year. Mr. Kerik had a pardon application pending and Mr. Blagojevich had a commutation application pending, but a source close to the pardons office did not believe that the pardon attorney had given either of those applications full-throated support. Mr. Milken, whose dealings contributed to the collapse of the savings-and-loan industry, fought for decades to reverse his conviction for securities fraud. Richard LeFrak, a billionaire real estate magnate and longtime friend; Sheldon G. Adelson, a prominent Republican donor; and Nelson Peltz, a billionaire investor who hosted a $10 million fund-raiser for the president’s 2020 campaign on Saturday, were among those who suggested that Mr. Trump pardon him. Mr. Milken did not have a pardon or commutation application pending at the Justice Department’s pardons office, meaning that the president made that decision entirely without official Justice Department input. Two previous applications had been denied and closed. The football greats Jerry Rice and Joe Montana — as well as the singer-songwriter Paul Anka — urged the president to pardon Mr. DeBartolo, who pleaded guilty in 1998 to concealing an extortion attempt. Mr. DeBartolo avoided prison but was fined $1 million and was suspended for a year by the N.F.L. He later handed over the 49ers to his sister Denise DeBartolo York. transcript “We have commuted the sentence of Rod Blagojevich. He served eight years in jail — it’s a long time. And I watched his wife on television. I don’t know him very well. I met him a couple of times — he was on, for a short while, on ‘The Apprentice’ years ago. Seemed like a very nice person. Don’t know him. But he served eight years in jail — has a long time to go. Many people disagree with the sentence — he’s a Democrat, he’s not a Republican. It was a prosecution by the same people: Comey, Fitzpatrick, the same group.” Reporter: “Are you planning to pardon Roger Stone?” “I haven’t given it any thought. In the meantime, he’s going through a process. But I think he’s been treated very unfairly.” “You have to see the recommendations,” Mr. Trump said on Tuesday before boarding Air Force One for a four-day trip to the West Coast, where he was scheduled to hold three campaign rallies. “I rely on recommendations.” Previous presidents have often waited until the final moments of their presidencies to wield the pardon power on behalf of their friends. President Bill Clinton pardoned Marc Rich, a hedge fund manager and financier who was convicted of tax evasion and other crimes, on Jan. 20, 2001, Mr. Clinton’s last day in office. Others, including Mr. Bush and Mr. Obama, largely reserved their clemency authority for people convicted of nonviolent, low-level drug crimes and other offenses who were identified as part of a rigorous process run by a team of Justice Department lawyers. Mr. Trump, however, has shrugged off those traditions and the controversy that sometimes comes with the use of the pardon power. He issued a “full and unconditional pardon” to Joe Arpaio, the Arizona sheriff and immigration hard-liner convicted of contempt of court, in August 2017. Less than a year later, he did the same for I. Lewis Libby Jr., a former aide to Mr. Bush who was convicted of obstructing justice and perjury. In addition to helping erase the convictions of the well connected and powerful, Mr. Trump also pardoned on Tuesday a tech executive who pleaded guilty to conspiracy, the owner of a construction company who underpaid his taxes and a woman convicted of stealing cars. The president also commuted the sentences of a woman convicted of drug distribution, another woman who was part of a marijuana smuggling ring and a minority-owner of a health care company who was sentenced to 35 years for a scheme to defraud the government. Their relative anonymity was a sharp contrast to the prominence of the four men highlighted by the president. Mr. Milken, who was credited in the 1980s with using junk bonds to finance big debt-laden corporate buyouts, pleaded guilty to securities reporting violations and tax offenses, and the Securities and Exchange Commission banned him for life. The investigation came to highlight that decade’s corporate excesses on Wall Street. In the years since his conviction, Mr. Milken has emerged as a major cancer philanthropist and is the founder of the Milken Institute, a nonpartisan think tank that holds a popular conference in Los Angeles that convenes the world’s most powerful people in government, industry and finance. Mr. Kerik, a police detective, served as Mr. Giuliani’s bodyguard and chauffeur during the 1993 mayoral race and later served in a series of high-ranking positions in New York City’s Department of Correction. Eventually, Mr. Giuliani named Mr. Kerik correction commissioner in 1997 and police commissioner in 2000. In 2004, Mr. Kerik’s bid to become homeland security secretary in the Bush cabinet collapsed amid scandals. In June 2006, he pleaded guilty in State Supreme Court in the Bronx to two misdemeanors tied to renovations done on his apartment. Four years later, Mr. Kerik pleaded guilty to tax fraud and making false statements. Mr. DeBartolo presided over the golden era of the 49ers when the team won five Super Bowl championships under the coach Bill Walsh, with legendary players like Mr. Montana, Steve Young, Ronnie Lott and Mr. Rice. Mr. DeBartolo was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2016 despite his conviction. But in the late 1990s, Mr. DeBartolo was an investor in the Hollywood Casino Corp., a Dallas company seeking permission for a riverboat casino in Louisiana. On March 12, 1997, he met Edwin W. Edwards, the influential former governor of Louisiana, for lunch in California and handed over $400,000 that Mr. Edwards had demanded for his help in securing a license. The next day, the Gaming Board granted it. A month later, federal agents raided Mr. Edwards’s house and office, seizing the $400,000. “Why do it? It actually was just plain stupidity, and I should have just walked away from it,” Mr. DeBartolo told NFL Films for a biographical documentary in 2012. “I was as much to blame because I was old enough to know better and too stupid to do anything about it.” Michael D. Shear reported from Washington, and Maggie Haberman from New York.

2020,Trump Continues Attack on Federal Case Against Friend Roger Stone,"President Trump threatened to sue “everyone all over the place” involved in the special counsel inquiry and continued public attacks on the case against his associate Roger J. Stone Jr. WASHINGTON — President Trump threatened on Tuesday to sue “everyone” involved in the now-closed special counsel inquiry and continued his attacks on the federal case against his longtime friend and adviser Roger J. Stone Jr. “If I wasn’t President, I’d be suing everyone all over the place. BUT MAYBE I STILL WILL. WITCH HUNT,” Mr. Trump wrote in a series of Twitter posts, after lumping a string of perceived and disproved miscarriages of justice dating back to the 2016 presidential campaign. Mr. Trump also quoted a Fox News legal analyst, Andrew Napolitano, who opined Tuesday morning on “Fox and Friends” that the judge overseeing the Stone case, Justice Amy Berman Jackson of the U.S. District Court in the District of Columbia, should approve Mr. Stone’s recent request for a new trial. The president’s tweets come just days after two extraordinary pleas related to the Justice Department’s case against Mr. Stone. On Thursday, Attorney General William P. Barr complained publicly that the president’s tweets undermined his work at the department. And on Sunday, more than 1,100 former federal prosecutors called on Mr. Barr to step down from his post after he interfered to lower a sentencing recommendation from the Justice Department for Mr. Stone. Four prosecutors working the Stone case, which stems from the special counsel investigation into Russian election meddling, quit in protest of the Justice Department’s actions. Later Tuesday morning, Judge Jackson is expected to hold a conference call with lawyers on the case, including the four prosecutors. Mr. Stone was convicted last year of lying to Congress and witness tampering in an effort to prevent investigators from learning how officials from Mr. Trump’s 2016 campaign sought to benefit from the release of documents stolen from Democrats.",The New York Times
2020,Trump Contradicts Advisers on China Technology Fears,"The president, in a series of tweets, said the U.S. would not restrict sales to the country, a sharp shift in administration policy. WASHINGTON — President Trump publicly objected to efforts within his own administration to restrict the sales of American technology to China over national security concerns, insisting on Tuesday that such fears were an “excuse” and that the United States was open for business. Mr. Trump’s comments appeared to represent a striking reversal of his administration’s aspirations to curb China’s ascent as a global leader in technology and came as cabinet officials were expected to discuss tougher restrictions on China later this month. That meeting, set for Feb. 28, was expected to include a discussion about whether to halt sales to China of an aircraft engine produced in part by General Electric by blocking its license to export the technology. Officials were also expected to consider new rules that would further curtail the ability of Huawei, the Chinese telecom giant, to have access to American technology, including semiconductors. But on Tuesday, Mr. Trump seemed to scuttle such moves. Two people familiar with the matter said that the late February meeting was on hold and that the United States would not block G.E.’s ability to sell jet engine parts to China. “The United States cannot, & will not, become such a difficult place to deal with in terms of foreign countries buying our product, including for the always used National Security excuse, that our companies will be forced to leave in order to remain competitive,” Mr. Trump wrote. “We want to sell product and goods to China and other countries.” “As an example, I want China to buy our jet engines, the best in the World,” he said in another tweet. “I have seen some of the regulations being circulated, including those being contemplated by Congress, and they are ridiculous.” Speaking on the tarmac at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, Mr. Trump insisted that he cared deeply about America’s national security but suggested that the term was being wielded too broadly and at the expense of the U.S. economy. “I think people were getting carried away with it,” Mr. Trump said. “I want our companies to be allowed to do business,” he added, referring specifically to chip-makers, which have complained about lost sales to Huawei, a large buyer of American semiconductors. “Things are put on my desk that have nothing to do with national security.” Mr. Trump said that he had been “very tough on Huawei” but that he wanted American companies “to be able to sell all of this incredible technology.” The about-face is the latest blow to the China hawks in the Trump administration and another win for more moderate advisers like Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who has been pushing for greater accommodation of Beijing amid pressure from corporate America. The administration’s efforts to restrict the flow of American technology to China has triggered objections from companies, who say it undermines their ability to compete on a global scale. Foreign firms have already taken steps to limit the American components in their products over concerns that access to parts they need could be cut off. And some American companies say they may begin to do more research and development outside the United States to avoid running afoul of the administration’s stricter China rules. General Electric, in response to media reports on Saturday about the administration’s review of its export license, said in a statement that it would comply with any requirements imposed by the United States but played down concerns about the risks of sales to China. “We aggressively protect and defend our intellectual property and work closely with the U.S. government to fulfill our responsibilities and shared security and economic interests,” General Electric said in a statement. “G.E. has provided products and services in the global marketplace for decades.” The potential U.S. restrictions have gotten China’s attention. Geng Shuang, spokesman for China’s foreign ministry, criticized the U.S. proposal to halt the jet engine deliveries during a news conference on Tuesday. “It would expose certain U.S. officials’ ignorance in science and technology, disregard of the market principle, and anxiety with China’s development,” he said during a briefing. “It will be another example of the U.S. using political means to undermine bilateral commercial cooperation and wantonly oppress China.” Mr. Trump’s description of national security as an “excuse” for interfering in international commerce is surprising given the president’s decision to routinely link economic and national security. Mr. Trump has cited the need to protect national security in his decision to impose tariffs on foreign metals and to consider placing them on foreign autos. The U.S. has also cited national security in expanding its ability to block international mergers and acquisitions. The shift in position is also notable given the administration’s ongoing efforts to crack down on Huawei, the Chinese telecom giant that is on a government blacklist. Administration officials were expected to further restrict American sales to Huawei by closing a loophole that has allowed technology companies like Intel and Micron to continue shipping chips, software and other products to Huawei. While the Pentagon initially opposed the tighter rules, fearing it could hurt defense suppliers, it has now reversed its position under pressure from other administration officials. That reversal came amid tougher words toward China from top Trump administration officials, who in recent days have expressed growing concern about China’s technology dominance. Speaking at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday, Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper assailed China for stealing technology and then developing its own systems to dominate critical sectors. “Huawei and 5G are today’s poster child for this nefarious activity,” Mr. Esper said. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo took the criticism of China a step further at the conference, referring to Chinese state-backed technology companies as “Trojan horses for Chinese intelligence.” It appeared that Mr. Trump shared that sentiment. Richard Grenell, the American ambassador to Germany, said on Twitter on Sunday that the president had just called him from Air Force One and asked him to make clear that “any nation who chooses to use an untrustworthy 5G vendor will jeopardize our ability to share Intelligence and information at the highest level.” But Mr. Mnuchin — a close confidante of Mr. Trump who has repeatedly warned against pursuing draconian measures that would stifle business and inhibit the United States economy during an election year — appeared to have influenced the president’s decision. The Treasury Department had no comment. Michael Pillsbury, a China scholar at the Hudson Institute who advises the Trump administration, said that Mr. Trump’s comments reflected the president’s focus on increasing trade, boosting jobs and making Americans wealthy. “The president has been clear about wanting American companies to get rich in China,” Mr. Pillsbury said. “President Trump frequently says he doesn’t want China to surpass us but he never said he wants to put them out of business or be vindictive.” On Tuesday, business groups cheered the shift in tone, which came suddenly and took some by surprise. “We applaud President Trump’s tweets supporting U.S. companies being able to sell products to China and opposing proposed regulations that would unduly curtail that ability,” John Neuffer, president and chief executive of the Semiconductor Industry Association, said in a statement. “As we have discussed with the administration, sales of nonsensitive, commercial products to China drive semiconductor research and innovation, which is critical to America’s economic strength and national security.” Jacob Parker, senior vice president of the US-China Business Council, said that the administration was notorious for giving mixed messages on such policies and that he was hopeful that the White House would put out a formal notification that the tighter rules affecting companies that sell components to Huawei are off the table. “We hope that the message that this is undermining the ability of companies to invest in long-term research and development is beginning to resonate with those in the administration,” Mr. Parker said. However, signs that Mr. Trump is softening his stance on China could draw backlash from both Republican and Democratic lawmakers who have been urging him to keep pressure on Beijing. “The Chinese Communist Party is engaged in a whole-of-state effort to supplant the United States and our critical industries by stealing intellectual property and through state-owned or state-directed enterprises,” said Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican from Florida. “The United States must ensure our current export controls are sufficient to prevent handing over sensitive technologies to Beijing.” Julian Barnes and David McCabe contributed reporting",The New York Times
2020,Trump Criticizes Media for Coverage of Coronavirus,"The president seeks to reassure the public while blaming the media and Democrats for trying to score points by exaggerating the threat of the outbreak. Get an informed guide to the global outbreak with our daily Coronavirus
 newsletter.
 WASHINGTON — President Trump complained on Friday that Democrats and the news media were trying to scare Americans about the coronavirus to score political points against him but asserted that the outbreak had been relatively limited because of his action to stem infections. “They’re doing everything they can to instill fear in people, and I think it’s ridiculous,” Mr. Trump told reporters, referring to CNN and other news outlets. “And some of the Democrats are doing it the way it should be done, but some of them are trying to gain political favor by saying a lot of untruths.” Speaking on the White House lawn before heading to South Carolina for a campaign rally, the president said the spread of the virus had been limited in the United States because of his order limiting travel from China. “We haven’t lost anybody yet, and hopefully we can keep that intact,” he said. “There’ve been no deaths in the United States at all. A lot of that’s attributable to the fact that we closed the border very early. Otherwise it could be a very different story.” “Some people are giving us credit for that and some people aren’t,” Mr. Trump added. “But the only ones who aren’t, they don’t mean it. It’s political. It’s politics.” Updated Feb. 29, 2020 Addressing the tumbling stock markets barely a half-hour after they finished their worst week since the 2008 financial crisis, the president attributed investor unease to uncertainty about the virus but also fear of Democratic presidential candidates. “After we win, you’ll see a rise in the stock market like you haven’t seen before,” he said. Mr. Trump spoke hours after Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, likewise blamed the news media for exaggerating the seriousness of coronavirus because “they think this will bring down the president, that’s what this is all about.” Speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference, an annual gathering of conservative activists, Mr. Mulvaney played down concerns about the virus that is spreading around the globe and panicking investors. Mr. Mulvaney said the administration took “extraordinary steps four or five weeks ago,” to prevent the spread of the virus when it declared a rare public health emergency and barred entry by most foreign citizens who had recently visited China. “Why didn’t you hear about it?” Mr. Mulvaney said of travel restrictions that were widely covered in the news media. “What was still going on four or five weeks ago? Impeachment, that’s all the press wanted to talk about.” The news media has been covering the global spread of coronavirus for months. But Mr. Mulvaney claimed that the news media was too preoccupied covering impeachment, he said, “because they thought it would bring down the president.” The media’s focus switched to the coronavirus for the same reason, he continued. “The reason you’re seeing so much attention to it today is that they think this is going to be the thing that brings down the president,” he added. “That’s what this is all about it.” Following the president’s lead, Mr. Mulvaney also brushed off concerns over the virus; there have been 60 cases identified in the United States. “The flu kills people,” he said. “This is not Ebola. It’s not SARS, it’s not MERS. It’s not a death sentence, it’s not the same as the Ebola crisis.” Mr. Mulvaney also criticized the news media for generally not wanting to portray Mr. Trump in a positive light. But he chose a bizarre example, claiming it refuses to cover what he described as Mr. Trump’s loving relationship with his 13-year-old son, Barron. He said Mr. Trump is in frequent contact with his youngest son, calling to check in on him and let him know of his whereabouts. But, Mr. Mulvaney said, “the press would never show you that because it doesn’t fit that image of him, the press wants him to be this terrible monster.” Mr. Mulvaney’s decision to discuss Barron Trump was curious, especially when Melania Trump, the first lady, and senior White House officials have gone to great lengths to make sure he enjoys the privacy afforded to other children of presidents growing up in the uncomfortable spotlight of the White House. The White House press corps has generally agreed to grant Barron Trump the same privacy. “He’s huge, but he’s still very young,” Mr. Mulvaney said of Barron, who is sometimes seen boarding Air Force One with his parents, but who often departs the plane after his father to avoid being photographed. “He was 10 or something like that when the president was elected.” Mr. Mulvaney, who was interviewed onstage by Stephen Moore, whose expected nomination by the president to the Federal Reserve Board was withdrawn over concerns about his treatment of women, also asserted that Mr. Trump did not sleep on the overnight plane trip home from India or during the day before his news conference on coronavirus Wednesday night. “He said, ‘I’ve only got eight years, I’m going to get as much out of it as I can,’” Mr. Mulvaney said.",The New York Times
2020,Trump Defends Closing Borders to Travelers to Fight Coronavirus,"In an interview with Sean Hannity of Fox News, President Trump insulted his potential 2020 rivals, lamented impeachment and defended his administration’s coronavirus policies. Get an informed guide to the global outbreak with our daily Coronavirus
 newsletter.
 WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — President Trump defended a decision that would bar foreign nationals who had recently visited China from entering the United States as his administration continued to assess the growing threat of a coronavirus outbreak. Sitting with the Fox News personality Sean Hannity, Mr. Trump used a roughly nine-minute interview taped on Saturday evening at Mar-a-Lago, his private club in Florida, and broadcast on Sunday as an opportunity to condense his usual rally-speak into Super Bowl pregame chatter. The topics included the virus, his impeachment and quick-paced insults of his potential 2020 rivals. “We pretty much shut it down coming in from China,” Mr. Trump said of the coronavirus. “But we can’t have thousands of people coming in who may have this problem, the coronavirus. We’re going to see what happens, but we did shut it down, yes.” He said his administration was offering the Chinese “tremendous help” to contain the spread of the virus. On Sunday afternoon, the administration put into effect a rule that would also essentially quarantine American travelers who had visited China within the past two weeks, diverting them to seven airports “to implement enhanced screening procedures,” according to guidelines issued Sunday by the Department of Homeland Security. There have been seven confirmed coronavirus cases in the United States, but no deaths. Earlier in the day, Robert C. O’Brien, Mr. Trump’s national security adviser, appeared on television to advise Americans that there was “no reason to panic” about the spread of the virus. Indeed, during his Fox sit-down, both Mr. Trump and his interviewer seemed more interested in allowing the president to focus on his grievances over impeachment and his re-election effort rather than elaborate on a global public health crisis. “It’s been very unfair from the day I won,” Mr. Trump said. “Mostly it was unfair to my family.” He derided the impeachment effort as “a hoax” and said he had not thought to delay his annual State of the Union address before the culmination this week of his Senate trial — an expected acquittal that Mr. Hannity framed as a “fait accompli.” Mr. Trump then spent a large part of the interview insulting a slate of potential Democratic rivals. He and Mr. Hannity played a lightning round where Mr. Hannity invited the president to say whatever came to mind about Democratic presidential candidates, including former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Michael R. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York. Mr. Trump falsely called Mr. Sanders a “communist” and claimed that he had been married in Russia. “I think of communism when I think of Bernie,” Mr. Trump said. “Didn’t he get married in Moscow?” Mr. Sanders married in Burlington, Vt., before traveling to the Soviet Union soon after, and the trip has been used as fodder by his critics as evidence that he has communist leanings. At one point, Mr. Trump falsely claimed that Mr. Bloomberg had requested a “box” to stand on should he attend a Democratic debate, a comment that drew sharp rebukes from both Mr. Bloomberg and his spokeswoman, Julie Wood, who called the president a “pathological liar who lies about everything: his fake hair, his obesity and his spray-on tan.” Mr. Trump also called Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who oversaw the impeachment effort into his presidency, a “very confused, very nervous woman,” adding that Ms. Pelosi would not last in office: “I think the radical left is going to take over.”",The New York Times
2020,Trump Demands 2 Liberal Supreme Court Justices Recuse Themselves From His Cases,"The president ratcheted up a fight with a judicial system he sees as biased against him. NEW DELHI — President Trump lashed out at two liberal Supreme Court justices on Tuesday, escalating his battle with the judicial system to new heights despite entreaties by his attorney general to refrain from attacks that complicate the administration’s legal fights. Weighing in on a domestic matter as he began a day of ceremony, meetings and a joint appearance with Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, Mr. Trump seized on a dissenting opinion last week by Justice Sonia Sotomayor and a years-old comment by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg to demand that the two Democratic-appointed jurists recuse themselves from any cases involving him. “I just thought it was so inappropriate, such a terrible statement for a Supreme Court justice,” the president said. Besides ignoring the entreaties of Attorney General William P. Barr, the president’s attack on the two justices also risked provoking a reaction from Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. In 2018, Chief Justice Roberts admonished Mr. Trump for calling a federal judge who ruled against one of his administration’s policies, “an Obama judge.” “We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges,” he said at the time. “What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them. That independent judiciary is something we should all be thankful for.” Kathleen Arberg, a Supreme Court spokeswoman, said Chief Justice Roberts, Justice Ginsburg and Justice Sotomayor declined to comment. Mr. Trump did not confine his criticism to the two justices. At his news conference, he also renewed his calls for an investigation into his longtime foil, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Adam B. Schiff, for what he said without evidence was Mr. Schiff’s improper disclosure of information provided to the committee at a briefing from intelligence officials. It is unusual for presidents to fixate on domestic issues while overseas on a state visit, but Mr. Trump has veered from that tradition so much that it has come to be expected. Before he took the first question from a reporter during the Tuesday appearance, Mr. Trump said that he did not plan on saying anything controversial. And then he attacked two liberal Supreme Court justices and called for an investigation into a political rival. “Schiff leaked it, in my opinion — and he shouldn’t be leaking things like that,” Mr. Trump said referring to the California Democrat. The president was responding to a question about recent intelligence briefings about Russia’s meddling in the upcoming election. “And if they don’t stop it, I can’t imagine that people are not going to go after them and find out what’s happening,” Mr. Trump said, reviving his accusation that the committee had been a source of improper leaks. Last week the president also called for an investigation into Mr. Schiff, to which Mr. Schiff responded: “Your false claims fool no one.” Justice Sotomayor issued her dissent issued last week against an order by the court allowing the Trump administration to proceed with a plan to deny green cards to immigrants who are deemed likely to become “public charges” reliant on government aid programs. In her seven-page opinion, Justice Sotomayor wrote that the Trump administration had become too quick to run to the Supreme Court after interim losses in the lower courts. “Claiming one emergency after another, the government has recently sought stays in an unprecedented number of cases, demanding immediate attention and consuming limited court resources in each,” she wrote. “And with each successive application, of course, its cries of urgency ring increasingly hollow.” Writing on Twitter Tuesday morning, Mr. Trump cited Laura Ingraham’s show on Fox News: “‘Sotomayor accuses GOP appointed Justices of being biased in favor of Trump.’” “This is a terrible thing to say. Trying to ‘shame’ some into voting her way? She never criticized Justice Ginsberg when she called me a ‘faker’. Both should recuse themselves on all Trump, or Trump related, matters!” “While ‘elections have consequences,’” he added, “I only ask for fairness, especially when it comes to decisions made by the United States Supreme Court!” Later, during the news conference at his hotel, he added of Justice Sotomayor, “Her statement was so inappropriate.” “When you’re a justice of the Supreme Court — it’s almost what she’s trying to do is take the people that do feel a different way and get them to vote the way that she would like them to vote,” he said. But Justice Sotomayor did not overtly accuse Republican-appointed justices of being biased in favor of Mr. Trump, as the president asserted. She complained in her dissent that the court “is partly to blame for the breakdown in the appellate process,” because it “has been all too quick to grant the government’s” reflexive requests. She added: “Perhaps most troublingly, the court’s recent behavior on stay applications has benefited one litigant over all others,” a reference to the Trump administration. The five justices who voted in the majority in the case were all appointed by Republicans, but Justice Sotomayor did not frame her disagreement in partisan terms, and her dissent was written in much the same way as others by justices who lose divided rulings. Mr. Trump did not seem familiar with what Justice Sotomayor actually wrote but instead seemed to be reacting to a television chryon that characterized her statement in a far balder, more political way than she had. Asked by a reporter what exactly he found inappropriate, Mr. Trump demurred, saying “you know what the statement was.” When the reporter accurately summarized part of the justice’s dissent, the president said, “No, I don’t think that was it.” In adding Justice Ginsburg to his attacks on Twitter and at the news conference, Mr. Trump resumed a four-year-old feud with the longest-serving liberal on the court. During the 2016 presidential campaign, Justice Ginsburg called Mr. Trump a “faker” and said she could not imagine him as president. He responded at the time that she should resign. She did not, but expressed regret, saying her remarks were “ill advised” for a Supreme Court justice and promised that “in the future I will be more circumspect.” The head of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, Kristen Clarke, said the president’s call for Justices Ginsburg and Sotomayor to recuse themselves was “deeply disturbing and unprecedented.” “No president in modern times,” she said “has shown greater disrespect for or worked to actively undermine the independence of the judiciary than President Trump.” The justices are highly unlikely to comply with Mr. Trump’s latest demand that they recuse themselves from the many cases involving him that come before their court. But the president’s attack raised the temperature of his continuing assault on the law enforcement and justice systems, which he has tried to bend to his will in increasingly bold ways. In recent days, he has repeatedly attacked Judge Amy Berman Jackson, who is overseeing the case of his friend Roger J. Stone Jr., who was sentenced to more than three years in prison for lying to Congress and intimidating a witness. He targeted her again on Tuesday, reposting a Twitter message from a Fox News host that said, “Roger Stone judge’s bias may have jeopardized entire trial,” and later posting another message of his own calling the judge and the jury forewoman “totally biased.” Mr. Barr has gone on television to ask Mr. Trump to stop weighing in on legal cases involving his friends, because it was making it “impossible” for him to do his work. A group of federal judges convened an emergency conference call because of the attacks on Judge Jackson. Adam Liptak and Eileen Sullivan contributed reporting from Washington.",The New York Times
2020,Trump Denounces Oscar Winner ‘Parasite’,"“And the winner is a movie from South Korea,” the president said at a rally. “What the hell was that all about?” President Trump delivered a nationalistic cultural rant at his rally in Colorado on Thursday night, veering off script to attack the Academy Awards for giving the Best Picture Oscar to a South Korean film, “Parasite.” “How bad were the Academy Awards this year?” the president said, throwing up his hands as the crowd roared at his rally in Colorado Springs. “Did you see? And the winner is a movie from South Korea. What the hell was that all about?” “Parasite,” the acclaimed thriller by Bong Joon Ho about class tensions boiling over in a wealthy family’s home, this month became the first film not in the English language to win the Academy Award for best picture in the 92-year history of the competition. The film also won best director, original screenplay and international feature, marking a moment of pride for many Asian-Americans and a turning point in the academy’s long history of embracing stories told by white filmmakers. Mr. Trump, however, was clearly not impressed. “We’ve got enough problems with South Korea, with trade,” he said. “On top of it, they give them the best movie of the year? Was it good? I don’t know.” Mr. Trump expressed nostalgia for Hollywood films from a bygone era. “Let’s get ‘Gone With the Wind.’ Can we get, like, ‘Gone With the Wind’ back, please?” he said, lauding the 1939 romantic saga set in the South around the Civil War, which won a host of Academy Awards, including best picture. He also mentioned “Sunset Boulevard,” the 1950 Billy Wilder film noir, which was nominated for best picture but did not win. (It won in other categories.) “So many great movies,” Mr. Trump said. “The winner is from South Korea. I thought it was best foreign film, right? Best foreign movie. No. Did this ever happen before?” Hollywood and the Academy Awards have long been a favorite target for Republicans who decry the film industry as a bastion of liberalism. And the awards ceremony this year featured speeches by celebrities attacking Mr. Trump. In his rally, Mr. Trump singled out for particular criticism Brad Pitt, who had referred to Mr. Trump’s impeachment trial in the Senate when accepting his award this year for best supporting actor for “Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood.” “They told me I only have 45 seconds up here, which is 45 seconds more than the Senate gave John Bolton this week,” Mr. Pitt said in his speech. Firing back at his rally, Mr. Trump said he was “never a fan” of Mr. Pitt and added that the actor “got up and said a little wiseguy statement.” “He’s a little wiseguy,” Mr. Trump said. Mr. Trump’s attack on “Parasite” prompted a response from the Democratic National Committee. “Parasite is a foreign movie about how oblivious the ultrarich are about the struggles of the working class, and it requires two hours of reading subtitles,” the committee wrote on Twitter. “Of course Trump hates it.” Neon, the independent film distributor behind “Parasite,” also responded to Mr. Trump’s broadside with an acid reference to the movie’s English subtitles. “Understandable,” the company wrote on Twitter. “He can’t read.”",The New York Times
2020,Trump Dismisses Warning of Russian 2020 Meddling as a Democratic ‘Hoax’,"The president described the intelligence finding that Russia was meddling in the 2020 election, delivered last week to House lawmakers, as a partisan “misinformation campaign.” LAS VEGAS — President Trump said Friday that the disclosure by American intelligence officials that Russia was again meddling in a presidential election in his favor was merely another partisan attack against him, continuing a pattern in which he has sought to dismiss warnings of foreign interference in American elections. “Another misinformation campaign is being launched by Democrats in Congress saying that Russia prefers me to any of the Do Nothing Democrat candidates who still have been unable to, after two weeks, count their votes in Iowa,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. “Hoax number 7!” He was responding to reports of a classified briefing in which intelligence officials told members of the House Intelligence Committee that Russia was interfering in the 2020 presidential campaign to aid his re-election. Republicans on the committee challenged the conclusions and Mr. Trump berated Joseph Maguire, the outgoing acting director of national intelligence, for allowing the briefing to happen. Intelligence officials have also concluded that the Russians are seeking to help Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont in the Democratic presidential primaries. At an afternoon campaign rally in Las Vegas, Mr. Trump continued with his accusations that Democrats were behind the reports and said they were trying to “poison our democracy” and were circulating “vile” hoaxes. “I was told a week ago,” the president said. “They said, ‘You know they’re trying to start a rumor.’ It’s disinformation. That’s the only thing they’re good at. They’re not good at anything else. They get nothing done. Do nothing Democrats.” During the final event of a four-day swing through the West, Mr. Trump suggested that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia would prefer Mr. Sanders. Mr. Trump claimed, inaccurately, that Mr. Sanders “honeymooned in Moscow.” And while Mr. Sanders did visit Yaroslavl in the Soviet Union in 1988 a day after his wedding, the trip was made to work out a sister-city relationship between Yaroslavl and Burlington, Vt., where Mr. Sanders was mayor at the time. In his 1997 autobiography, Mr. Sanders described the trip as a “very strange honeymoon,” but he and his wife went on a more traditional honeymoon a year later in St. Lucia, in the Caribbean. Mr. Trump, who has been cheerful in public and private about his re-election prospects, used the trip to raise millions from high-dollar donors and charm his political base at rallies in three states. And by returning every night to Las Vegas and holding his final rally there, he also tried to divert attention from Saturday’s Democratic caucuses in Nevada. The president has visited every state that has held a primary or caucus so far this year, making trolling Democratic candidates a cornerstone of his campaign strategy. At his rally on Friday, the president called up members of the 1980 “Miracle on Ice” men’s hockey team to take the stage behind him and waxed at length about his reality show “The Apprentice.” “Speaking also of reality television: This is the greatest show of all time, huh?” the president said. “I have to get back to Washington and work. I feel guilty. This is too much fun.” Mr. Trump spoke for nearly two hours and fired the crowd up with a litany of claims about his accomplishments during his first three years in office, many of them exaggerated or misleading. During an extended discussion about the dangers of illegal immigration, Mr. Trump noted that “illegal crossings are down 75 percent from last spring.” He did not mention that the decrease followed a huge surge in border apprehensions on his watch, leaving the number about where it was when he took office. Aside from appearing unbound and ebullient on the campaign trail, Mr. Trump also used the trip as an opportunity to take on some favorite targets, casting doubt on assorted institutions at every turn. He voiced his suspicions about Saturday’s Nevada caucuses, comparing it to the disastrous ones held in Iowa earlier this month. “I hear their computers are all messed up just like they were in Iowa,” he said. The president described members of the media as “the most dishonest human beings in the world” and accused law enforcement of harboring “dirty cops.” He also repeatedly joked with the crowd that he would stay president longer than two terms, a comment he has made at other events. Mr. Trump has a long history of dismissing the assessments made by intelligence agencies that he has deemed unfair or unflattering. Multiple agencies have determined that Russia meddled in the 2016 election, and, before the 2018 midterms, delivered warnings that Russia was prepared to do it again. Early in his presidency, Mr. Trump grudgingly accepted those assessments before falling back on personal assurances from Mr. Putin. “He said he didn’t meddle,” Mr. Trump said in November 2017. “I asked him again. You can only ask so many times. Every time he sees me, he says, ‘I didn’t do that.’ And I believe, I really believe, that when he tells me that, he means it.” Since then, Mr. Trump, with the assistance of his Justice Department, has moved to retaliate against the intelligence community rather than Mr. Putin. A federal prosecutor is scrutinizing how intelligence officials assessed Russia’s 2016 election interference, targeting the former C.I.A. director John O. Brennan in particular. Mr. Trump’s anger at the intelligence assessment delivered on Feb. 13 to lawmakers was magnified by the presence at the briefing of Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California, who is the chairman of the Intelligence Committee and played a lead role in the impeachment proceedings against Mr. Trump. The president’s decision to remove Mr. Maguire and install Richard Grenell, the ambassador to Germany and a fervent loyalist, was also seen as a direct outcome of the briefing. On Thursday evening, Mr. Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One that Representative Doug Collins of Georgia, an ally and a vocal opponent of impeachment, was one of the candidates under consideration as a permanent successor. By Friday morning, Mr. Collins said he was not interested. “This is not a job that interests me; at this time, it’s not one that I would accept because I’m running a Senate race down here in Georgia,” Mr. Collins said in an interview on Fox News. Mr. Trump then wrote on Twitter that he had a list of four candidates to succeed Mr. Grenell, and that he would make his decision in the coming weeks. Michael D.

2020,Trump Effort to Keep U.S. Tech Out of China Alarms American Firms,"The administration wants to protect national security by restricting the flow of technology to China. But technology companies worry it could undermine them instead. WASHINGTON — The Trump administration’s push to prevent China from dominating the market for advanced technologies has put it on a collision course with the same American companies it wants to protect. Firms that specialize in microchips, artificial intelligence, biotechnology and other industries have grown increasingly alarmed by the administration’s efforts to restrict the flow of technology to China, saying it could siphon expertise, research and revenue away from the United States, ultimately eroding America’s advantage. The concerns, which have been simmering for months, have taken on new urgency as the Commerce Department considers adopting a sweeping proposal that would allow the United States to block transactions between American firms and Chinese counterparts. Those rules, on top of new restrictions on Chinese investment in the United States and proposed measures that would prevent American companies from exporting certain products and sharing technology with foreign nationals, have the tech industry scrambling to respond. The Trump administration’s crackdown has already prompted foreign firms to shun American components and technology over concerns that access to parts they need could be abruptly cut off. American companies are watching warily as the United States considers restricting export licenses for companies that sell products or share intellectual property with China, including General Electric, which sells aircraft parts to China as part of a joint venture with Safran, a French firm. Top administration officials plan to meet on Feb. 28 to discuss further restrictions on China, including whether to block G.E.’s license to sell jet engines and whether to further curtail the ability of Huawei, the Chinese telecom giant, to have access to American technology. There is growing bipartisan consensus in Washington that China poses a security threat and that the United States must protect domestic industries to retain a technological edge. While President Trump’s trade war with China was aimed at forcing Beijing to end practices that gave Chinese industries an advantage, the initial deal signed last month did little to address the security concerns. The tech industry has warned that limiting access to China, both in terms of selling and buying products, could cripple American companies and end up undercutting the United States as the biggest global hub of research and development. Companies, along with the lawyers and consultants who advise them, say firms increasingly have no choice but to locate more research and development outside the United States, to ensure that they have uninterrupted access to China, a fast-growing consumer market and the center of the global electronics supply chain. New investment dollars are being funneled to research hubs near University of Waterloo in Canada, as well as Israel, Britain and other places beyond the reach of the American government, they say. “Anyone who thinks our concerns are exaggerated should talk to the U.S. semiconductor industry workers who are already losing their jobs due to walling off our largest market,” said John Neuffer, the president and chief executive of the Semiconductor Industry Association, which represents chip makers. “Revenue from that big market fuels our big research investments, which allows us to innovate and drive America’s economic growth and national security.” The RISC-V Foundation, a nonprofit that has created an open-source software standard for the chips that power smartphones and other electronics, acknowledged in recent months that it had chosen to move its incorporation from Delaware to Switzerland because of concerns from its members about more stringent regulations in the United States. “If this administration proceeds with the current trajectory, we’ll see more defections of companies, of scientists,” said Scott Jones, a nonresident fellow with the Stimson Center. “They’ll take their toys and they’ll go elsewhere, and other economies will be the beneficiary of that.” The most recent source of concern stems from a Commerce Department plan to vet and potentially block technology transactions that pose a risk to the United States. The proposed rule would allow the commerce secretary to block transactions involving technology that was tied to a “foreign adversary” and that posed a significant risk to the United States. The rule grew out of an executive order Mr. Trump signed last year to try to shut out Huawei by authorizing the commerce secretary to bar any purchase of technology designed by a “foreign adversary” that put America at risk. American companies say the regulations are written so broadly that they could give the United States authority to block transactions or unwind existing ones in areas far afield from telecom gear. While tech companies say they support efforts to protect U.S. national security, dozens of companies and industry lobbying groups have expressed concerns about the proposal. IBM, in a January comment letter, told the Commerce Department to “go back to the drawing board” and said the rules “will lead to a broad disengagement of U.S. business from global markets and suppliers.” “Its reach, breadth and vagueness are unprecedented,” IBM said. The Internet Association, which counts Google and Facebook among its members, said the proposal lacked “substantive safeguards.” The Motion Picture Association warned that it could affect Hollywood’s ability to pursue transactions around special effects or animation. The Commerce Department said in a statement that the process would ensure that “all points of view have been considered and the U.S. national security considerations are balanced against corporate commercial interests.” The tougher measures have come in response to what the administration and even the tech industry view as a rising economic and security threat. China is gaining ground in a range of technologies that experts say could give the country an economic and military edge, including artificial intelligence, facial recognition, microchips and quantum computing. To try to dominate these advanced industries, China has deployed subsidies, targeted acquisitions of American firms and created industrial plans like Made in China 2025 to leap ahead. The administration has repeatedly accused China and its companies of engaging in corporate espionage, hacking and intellectual property theft. Last week, the U.S. government charged Huawei and two of its subsidiaries with federal racketeering and conspiracy to steal trade secrets from six American companies. It also charged four members of China’s military with hacking into Equifax, one of the nation’s largest credit reporting agencies, and stealing trade secrets and the personal data of about 145 million Americans in 2017. Beijing’s actions have created an overwhelming fear in Washington that China will come to dominate advanced industries and put American competitors out of business, in the same way it did for steel, furniture and solar panels. But the stakes are even higher this time, given that many of these new technologies are critical for the military. “The Chinese have long been a commercial people, but for China, purely economic success is not an end in itself,” Attorney General William P. Barr said in a speech this month. “It is a means to wider political and strategic objectives.” The Trump administration’s response has been to offer a new definition of national security, one that encompasses economic threats. The distinction has allowed the United States to enact powerful rules restricting commercial exchanges with China. Mr. Trump has cited national security in his decision to tax foreign metals, propose new limits on the technology that can be transferred outside the United States and bar Chinese companies like Huawei from buying American components. While tech companies found a way around the initial Huawei ban, the administration is considering much more severe restrictions. A new proposal would extend the reach of the U.S. government to regulate products made around the world, prohibiting companies from using American components and technologies in foreign-made products that are then supplied to Huawei. The proposals have set off panic within the technology industry, which fears the new restrictions will hamper its ability to tap into the Chinese market. Industry lawyers and trade groups have begun warning that, unless the administration can persuade its allies to adopt similar restrictions, companies will decide the safest course is to try to limit their use of American technology. Critics point to past incidents where tight regulation pushed American industries offshore — including machine tool makers in the 1990s, and commercial satellites in the 2000s. While it is illegal for companies to move existing operations abroad to try to circumvent export control rules, there are no such constraints on new investments. “Their incentive is shareholder value and making money,” Jim McGregor, the chairman of greater China for APCO Worldwide, said of America’s biggest technology companies. “It’s not defending what is good for America. You can say that’s terrible, but that’s the way our system works.” Mr. McGregor said the economic incentives of the Chinese market would encourage companies to “decouple from America.” Chinese companies are also working to weed American components out of their supply chains — a long-running effort toward self-sufficiency that has accelerated under the threat of harsher U.S. measures. In recent months, some Chinese companies have begun asking their suppliers to certify that their products are made with a minimal amount of American content, so they are not at risk from American export controls, people familiar with the conversations say. Chinese telecom companies have been asked to find an alternative to using Oracle’s software in their systems. And CITIC Capital, a giant investment management firm with deep links in China, has embraced helping Chinese companies find alternatives to American technology as an investment theme for this year. Some who favor tougher China rules say companies are exaggerating the potential impact in an attempt to influence new regulations. They say that the United States retains big advantages in research and development, and that companies are trying to scare the government into loosening rules by saying they will leave. Others say the national security threat from China is so serious that some short-term revenue loss is warranted. “You can’t avoid paying that price,” said Clyde Prestowitz, a former Reagan administration official who led trade negotiations with Japan and China. “Your only choice is to pay it now or later. Now, you still have a cutting-edge industry that will take a hit, but that can survive and prosper if high tech does not become a Chinese playground.” The administration’s view is not monolithic. Within the Commerce Department, some are pressing for stricter rules while others say crippling American business will do more to endanger national security. The Pentagon is also split, with some officials calling for tighter regulations and others saying the government should not put innovation at risk, given that military technologies typically draw on commercial products. Some China experts say that American companies are deluding themselves and that, without safeguards, China will eventually steal their technology and drive them out of business. “We’ve seen what happens to many foreign firms who ‘have to be there’ in steel, telecom, et cetera,” Derek Scissors, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, said of China. “They get progressively more desperate, until they die.”",The New York Times
2020,Opinion | Trump Emboldened,"Listen and subscribe to our podcast from your mobile device: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Google Play | RadioPublic | Stitcher Less than a month after the end of his impeachment trial, are we witnessing an emboldened President Trump? This week on “The Argument,” the columnists discuss Trump’s cascade of norm-breaking following his acquittal by the Senate — and what it portends for the run-up to the November election. Ross Douthat thinks Trump’s latest transgressions — purging bureaucrats he perceives as disloyal and leaning on the Department of Justice to interfere in the criminal sentencing of his ally Roger Stone — hew more closely to his pre-impeachment behavior than to a dangerous new standard. Were they observed in another country, such acts would be seen as a prelude to authoritarianism, argues Michelle Goldberg. And David Leonhardt argues that Attorney General Bill Barr’s protestations in the face of Trump’s meddling are more a matter of optics than of conviction. Then, would a proposed executive order aimed at “making federal buildings beautiful again” be an aesthetic win for democracy, or mark a descent into architectural kitsch? And finally, Ross recommends getting up close and personal with your wild side. Background Reading: Ross on why a proposed executive order on government buildings would make Washington’s architecture more democratic and discussing our age of decadence Michelle on how Trump has corrupted the Department of Justice to protect his allies and pursue his foes and why Vladimir Putin might regret boosting Bernie Sanders’s 2020 candidacy David on Trump pardoning people with ties to him, the post-Watergate norms Trump is trampling and the motive behind William Barr’s public break from Trump I’ve been an Op-Ed columnist since 2009, and I write about politics, religion, pop culture, sociology and the places where they all intersect. I’m a Catholic and a conservative, in that order, which means that I’m against abortion and critical of the sexual revolution, but I tend to agree with liberals that the Republican Party is too friendly to the rich. I was against Donald Trump in 2016 for reasons specific to Donald Trump, but in general I think the populist movements in Europe and America have legitimate grievances and I often prefer the populists to the “reasonable” elites. I’ve written books about Harvard, the G.O.P., American Christianity and Pope Francis; I’m working on one about decadence. Benedict XVI was my favorite pope. I review movies for National Review and have strong opinions about many prestige television shows. I have three small children, two girls and a boy, and I live in New Haven with my wife. I’ve been an Op-Ed columnist at The New York Times since 2017, writing mainly about politics, ideology and gender. These days people on the right and the left both use “liberal” as an epithet, but that’s basically what I am, though the nightmare of Donald Trump’s presidency has radicalized me and pushed me leftward. I’ve written three books, including one, in 2006, about the danger of right-wing populism in its religious fundamentalist guise. (My other two were about the global battle over reproductive rights and, in a brief detour from politics, about an adventurous Russian émigré who helped bring yoga to the West.) I love to travel; a long time ago, after my husband and I eloped, we spent a year backpacking through Asia. Now we live in Brooklyn with our son and daughter. I’ve worked at The Times since 1999 and have been an Op-Ed columnist since 2016. I caught the journalism bug a very long time ago — first as a little kid in the late 1970s who loved reading the Boston Globe sports section and later as a teenager working on my high school and college newspapers. I discovered that when my classmates and I put a complaint in print, for everyone to see, school administrators actually paid attention. I’ve since worked as a metro reporter at The Washington Post and a writer at Businessweek magazine. At The Times, I started as a reporter in the business section and have also been a Times Magazine staff writer, the Washington bureau chief and the founding editor of The Upshot. My politics are left of center. But I’m also to the right of many Times readers. I think education reform has accomplished a lot. I think two-parent families are good for society. I think progressives should be realistic about the cultural conservatism that dominates much of this country. Most of all, however, I worry deeply about today’s Republican Party, which has become dangerously extreme. This country faces some huge challenges — inequality, climate change, the rise of China — and they’ll be very hard to solve without having both parties committed to the basic functioning of American democracy.

2020,Trump Fires Impeachment Witnesses Gordon Sondland and Alexander Vindman in Post-Acquittal Purge,"Emboldened by his victory and determined to strike back, the president removed Mr. Sondland as ambassador to the European Union after the White House earlier on Friday dismissed Colonel Vindman. WASHINGTON — President Trump wasted little time on Friday opening a campaign of retribution against those he blames for his impeachment, firing two of the most prominent witnesses in the House inquiry against him barely 48 hours after being acquitted by the Senate. Emboldened by his victory and determined to strike back, Mr. Trump ordered Gordon D. Sondland, the founder of a hotel chain who donated $1 million to the president’s inaugural committee, recalled from his post as the ambassador to the European Union on the same day that Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman, a decorated Iraq war veteran on the National Security Council staff, was marched out of the White House by security guards. The ousters of Mr. Sondland and Colonel Vindman — along with Mr. Vindman’s brother, Lt. Col. Yevgeny Vindman, an Army officer who also worked on the National Security Council staff — may only presage a broader effort to even accounts with the president’s perceived enemies. In the two days since his acquittal in the Senate, Mr. Trump has railed about those who stood against him, calling them “evil,” “corrupt” and “crooked,” while his press secretary declared that those who hurt the president “should pay for” it. Even as he began purging administration officials who testified in the House impeachment inquiry, Mr. Trump assailed a Democratic senator who he had hoped would side with him during the trial but did not and called on the House to “expunge” his impeachment because he deems it illegitimate. The flurry of actions and outbursts drew quick condemnation from Democrats, who said the president was demonstrating that he feels unleashed, and complicated the politics of impeachment for moderate Republicans who stood by him while arguing that he had learned his lesson and would be more restrained in the future. “There is no question in the mind of any American why this man’s job is over, why this country now has one less soldier serving it at the White House,” David Pressman, Colonel Vindman’s lawyer, said in a statement. “Lt. Col. Vindman was asked to leave for telling the truth. His honor, his commitment to right, frightened the powerful.” Colonel Vindman spoke publicly only once, after being ordered to under subpoena, Mr. Pressman added. “And for that, the most powerful man in the world — buoyed by the silent, the pliable and the complicit — has decided to exact revenge.” transcript From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” Today: President Trump has undertaken a campaign of retribution against those who crossed him during the impeachment inquiry and favors for those who have tried to protect him. Peter Baker on the post-acquittal presidency. It’s Friday, February 14. [HORNS] Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States. Peter, I want to begin with retribution. How does that start? Well, thank you very much, everybody. Wow. The day after his acquittal in the Senate, the president gathers people in the East Room of the White House for an event. It’s not quite a press conference. It’s not quite a speech. It’s really kind of a mix, a mix of a celebration of his acquittal but a venting session of his grievances. I want to start by thanking some of — and I call them friends, because you develop friendships and relationships when you’re in battle and war. And he wants to thank the people who stood behind him, names them in the audience. Mitch McConnell, I want to tell you, you did a fantastic job. [APPLAUSE] Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader who did more than anybody to secure his acquittal in the trial. And he mentions Jim Jordan — When I first got to know Jim, I said, huh, he never wears a jacket. What the hell’s going on? He’s obviously very proud of his body. [LAUGHTER] — and other members of the House, the Freedom Caucus, the conservative Republicans who always stood by him in the most aggressive and assertive and staunch way. And then, of course, he turns to his enemies. The people he blames for his ordeal, the people he thinks have treated him so unfairly, have plotted against him, been disloyal or what have you. And he names ones that you would expect, of course. Nancy Pelosi is a horrible person. Nancy Pelosi, he says she’s a horrible person. A corrupt politician named Adam Schiff made up my statement to the Ukrainian president. He brought it out of thin air — just made it up. They say he’s a screenwriter, a failed screenwriter. He names, of course, Adam Schiff, the lead House prosecutor. And then you have some that used religion as a crutch. They never used it before. He names Mitt Romney, the Republican, the only Republican senator to vote for conviction. But, you know, it’s a failed presidential candidate, so things can happen when you fail so badly running for president. These two now, of course, are really at odds. And you see the visceral anger in the president in this moment. And he mentions Colonel Alexander Vindman, a member of his own staff, a detailee from the Pentagon working on Ukraine issues, and his twin brother Yevgeny Vindman, who also works at the N.S.C. staff. He says it almost in passing. Lieutenant Colonel Vindman and his twin brother, right? And he says it with such dripping disdain in his voice. You’d get the sense immediately, of course, that this is somebody who’s really angry at the president, and he’s got his attention. And remind us what puts Vindman in this list of enemies. Colonel Vindman was one of the members of the White House staff, the National Security Council staff who were subpoenaed by the House to testify in the impeachment inquiry. He didn’t come forward voluntarily. He was required to by law to give his testimony to the committee. And during his testimony, he told about being on the famous July 25 call between the president and President Zelensky of Ukraine when the president asked him to investigate Joe Biden and the Democrats. And Colonel Vindman told the committee that he thought that was inappropriate, and he reported it to his superiors at the N.S.C. And for that, he has been on the target list of President Trump and his allies ever since. Painted as disloyal, painted as even treasonous to the country. His patriotism questioned even though he’s a decorated veteran of the Iraq War, injured in battle, and really, a kind of a symbol to both sides of sort of where this fight has evolved. Our country is just respected again, and it’s an honor to be with the people in this room. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. And so he comes to the end of this sort of rambling, meandering talk that goes on for an hour and two minutes. And you get the sense that this is not the end and that there’s more to come. Well, President Trump has begun his revenge in the wake of his impeachment trial. Colonel Vindman, the same witness he had just talked about so dismissively at the East Room event finds himself escorted out of the White House by security guards and told his services are no longer needed — Wow. — exiled back to the Pentagon from which he came. Not just him — Escorted out of his job and off the White House grounds, as was his twin brother, who was also assigned to the N.S.C. His brother Yevgeny Vindman — who didn’t do anything, had nothing to do with the impeachment hearings at all, except to show up and sit behind his brother just as a matter of family support — also dismissed from his post at the National Security Council, marched out at the same time by security and sent back to the Pentagon. Today, Vindman’s lawyer issued a statement saying, quote, “The truth has cost him his job, his career and his privacy.” You can understand why a president might not want somebody on his staff who had testified an impeachment hearing against him. But it was handled in a way that was meant to maximize the public message, right? I’ll tell you what I mean by that. The N.S.C. is currently undergoing a downsizing. And in fact, the plan was to move Colonel Vindman out as part of that, or at least to use that as the cover to to say, it’s not about reprisal. It’s not about his role in impeachment. It’s just part of this overall restructuring. And that’s frankly how other presidents might have handled a situation like that. Come up with a rationale. Come up with a rationale, come up with a public face-saving kind of storyline, a narrative, at least, that even though people would see through it, would at least have the veneer of looking professional rather than vindictive. That was not what the president wanted. He made sure they did this separate from that reorganization. They did not explain it as part of that reorganization. And they did not deny when we called them that day that this was what it looked like, which was, of course, an act of retribution. OK, so what happens next? Well, we thought that was the story for the day, these two brothers being marched out of there. Right. And then we discover as the evening arrives that it’s not over. Now we’re getting word that the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, he is out as well. Gordon Sondland, you may remember him. He was the ambassador to the European Union, who had been deeply involved in the Ukraine pressure campaign, on the phone with the president and required to testify, became a key witness in the House hearings. He said that they were operating on the order of the president himself. He said that it was clearly a quid pro quo, and he said that everyone was in the loop. Suddenly, it turns out he’s out as well. Now, as with Vindman, there was a way to do this that would have minimized the public kerfuffle. Gordon Sondland actually was ready to leave. He had told his superiors at the State Department that he was ready to step down on his own. And he got word that Friday you have to resign today, they told him. But he says, no. I don’t want to resign on the same day that you’re pushing out these Vindmans as if I’m part of some sort of purge. Wow. If you want me today, you’re going to have to fire me. And they called back and said, OK, you’re fired. So at this point, it’s clear that this is a vindictive purge of anyone who did anything that put the president in a negative light during the impeachment process. And what is the reaction to that, that very clear and deliberate message from the president inside Washington? Certainly among Democrats, even among a few Republicans who say what’s the message you’re sending? If you respond to a subpoena, as ordered by the law, and you give your testimony, you shouldn’t be punished for doing that. The president’s view is, why should I have people I can’t trust working for me? It’s my right as the president to have a staff that serves my interests that I believe is loyal. And he’s made clear that loyalty is a number one when it comes to this president. There’s no other quality that matters more to him. And, Peter, as somebody who’s covered many White Houses, is he right about that? Is it ultimately a presidential prerogative to decide if someone testified against you, that, you know, you no longer want them around, you don’t want them in those jobs anymore, especially presidential appointments? It’s a good question, right? Because it does feel like it would be untenable to have testified and provided damaging testimony against the president, and then come to work every day afterwards. You would think, in fact, you might not want to necessarily do that. But the question isn’t what’s the right place then for that person to work. The question is what the message the president is trying to send by what he’s doing, right? Right. This president has made a point of making sure everybody knows these people are out, and they’re out because of him and because he will not tolerate disloyalty. OK, so that is the campaign of retribution so far, post acquittal, which brings us to the campaign of protection for the president’s allies. Right. It’s not enough just to go after his perceived enemies. Now it’s time to do something to protect his friends. And for him, this is going to start with a colorful character and longtime friend and adviser named Roger Stone, who’s about to go to prison. We’ll be right back. So, Peter, before we get to how the president is trying to protect Roger Stone, remind us who Roger Stone is. Roger Stone has been in American politics going back decades. He is somebody who calls himself a dirty trickster. I’m certainly guilty of bluffing and posturing and punking the Democrats. Unless they pass some law against [BLEEP] and I missed it, I’m engaging in tradecraft. It’s politics. He’s a self-proclaimed fan of Richard Nixon. Even to this day, he has a Richard Nixon tattoo. Right. He’s somebody who’s involved early on in some of the Reagan and Dole campaigns, but over the years kind of drifted off into the side, really kind of more of a fringe character, a conspiracy theorist, a provocateur. In 1980, Stone began a lobbying firm with Paul Manafort that unapologetically catered to human rights abusers. He has these maxims on how he conducts his political strategy. One of his rules is never turn down an opportunity to have sex or be on television. We’ve seen a lot of colorful characters in the world of political consulting, none more colorful than Roger Stone. And that is the most charitable adjective you can apply to the single weirdest man possibly in the history of political consulting. He’d been friends for years with Donald Trump. And like Roger Stone, Trump comes from the outside, right? He was not part of the Republican establishment. But suddenly, he’s powering forward toward a presidential bid. And he brings with him people like Roger Stone, who had not been in the center of American politics now for years. Right. And my recollection is that it’s during that campaign that Roger Stone gets into very significant trouble. Right. He becomes wrapped up in the whole story about the Russian hacking of the Democratic emails. Hillary Clinton’s campaign dealing with more email problems. The email account of campaign chairman John Podesta was hacked and many of the emails released. Things he said gave the impression that he might have known about it in advance. Right. So were you surprised when John Podesta’s emails came out, as you seemed to predict ahead of time? I was interested, like the rest of the country. Were you surprised? No, I wouldn’t say that I was surprised. And that puts him right in the heart of this. Is he a link between the Trump campaign and Russia through perhaps WikiLeaks, which is the cutout that the Russians used to get these emails out. And so, once the president wins and comes into office, his friend Roger Stone finds himself under investigation for what he knew and when he knew it. And then Congress jumps in. They call Stone to testify at the House Intelligence Committee. And this is where he really gets into trouble. We had a very frank exchange. I answered all of the questions. I made the case that the accusation that I knew about John Podesta’s email hack in advance was false, that I knew about the content and source of the WikiLeaks disclosures regarding Hillary Clinton was false. He starts telling things that are demonstrably not true. And he ultimately ends up getting charged with lying to Congress. He also tries to get an associate of his to not tell the truth, threatens him even, threatens to kill his dog. Whoa. And he was put on trial. And last fall Roger Stone was convicted of seven crimes, seven felonies, including lying to Congress and witness intimidation. And these are conditions on very serious charges of obstructing a congressional investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. That’s right. I remember thinking when that happened, like, whoa. This is the big leagues for Roger Stone. Exactly. And the question is, why is he lying? Why is he obstructing? Is he trying to protect the president? This is how this all fits together, right? This goes back to the whole Russian interference. This goes back to the Mueller probe. This goes back to the things that have dominated this presidency for three years and frustrated this president for three years. So he sees Roger Stone’s conviction as an illegitimate shot at him, at himself, the president. A way of trying to take him down because they couldn’t take him down any other way. OK. So Peter, how does the president try to protect Stone after this conviction? So even as he’s in the middle of this campaign of retribution against the Vindman brothers and Gordon Sondland, he is increasingly aware that the sentencing for Roger Stone is coming up. And then, when Monday comes around and the prosecutors present their recommendation for a sentence to the court, the prosecutors ask for seven to nine years behind bars. That’s the normal sentence that would be required under the sentencing guidelines passed by Congress for crimes of the type that Roger Stone was convicted of. So they didn’t go outside of those guidelines. They simply said we want to sentence him to what the guidelines say. That doesn’t mean the judge would go along with it, but that was their recommendation. Well, that set the president off. The president expressed his outrage on Twitter, calling it a very unfair situation, adding, “Cannot allow this miscarriage of justice!” In the middle of the night, he starts sending out tweets, angry tweets. How can this happen? Nine years, this is outrageous. And they’re going after him. How come they don’t go after my enemies but they go after him? And that just sort of sets the town ablaze. Controversy in the nation’s capital now over a sentencing recommendation for President Trump’s longtime friend Roger Stone. Here’s a president weighing in directly on a court case involving a friend of his. This is something that we have not seen really since Watergate. Presidents don’t, especially publicly, weigh in on prosecutions of people that they are personally connected to, at least except in the venue of issuing pardons at some point, which they sometimes do. So this has shocked a lot of people. But what really shocked a lot of people in Washington was when they woke up a few hours later on Tuesday and they saw not only these tweets, but they saw that the attorney general of the United States, Bill Barr, had essentially overruled the career prosecutors. Breaking news involving President Trump. A stunning reversal in the sentencing recommendation for Trump confidant Roger Stone. And said, no, we’re not going to ask for a sentence this heavy. We’re going to ask for something lighter. So not seven to nine years, something less. Not seven to nine years, something less. It doesn’t specify what, but something below what the guidelines would normally call for. And so this is causing a huge furor in the U.S. attorney’s office in Washington. What is going on? President Trump knows how to get away with stuff when we’re not watching. The four career prosecutors who worked on the Stone case, all four of them, quit. We’re following some truly stunning, breaking news, still developing by the minute this hour. Federal prosecutors in the Roger Stone criminal case have resigned this afternoon. One after the other. One, two, three, four, just like that. This does not happen. Prosecutors don’t resign just days before they go to sentencing after a case that they’ve worked so hard on. One of them actually quits his job altogether, leaves the Justice Department as a whole. In protest. Well, they don’t say it, but that’s the obvious conclusion. Yes, they’re protesting the overruling of their recommendation. And I think that they felt like they had an ethical obligation. If they had told the court this is the sentence we think is appropriate, and then suddenly a day later the same department is coming and saying, no, we don’t — how is that tenable for them to continue on that case? And, Peter, given what has just happened — the firing of Vindman, Sondland, Vindman’s brother — what is the reaction to this intervention? Not just the retribution, but this protection? Well, in effect, the Democrats are saying we told you so, right? No serious person believes President Trump has learned any lesson. He doesn’t learn any lessons. He does just what he wants, what suits his ego at the moment. Senator Schumer, the Democratic leader in the upper chamber goes to the floor and gives a pretty passionate speech in which he says that the natural consequence of acquitting the president on the Ukraine matter means that he feels completely unleashed and empowered to do whatever he thinks is right for his own political interests. We are witnessing a crisis in the rule of law in America, unlike one we have ever seen before. It’s a crisis of President Trump’s making, but it was enabled and emboldened by every Senate Republican. Even amongst some Republicans, you’re seeing you know some discomfort, particularly among moderate Republicans who tried to give the president the benefit of the doubt by standing with him in the impeachment trial. A couple of them had said even, well, maybe he’ll have learned a lesson from all of this and he’ll be more measured, he’ll be more restrained in the future and that that would be a good thing. Well, what you’re hearing a lot of people saying is that doesn’t seem to be the case. And I think that the question going forward is going to be, is it just a burst of energy and lashing out in the days after the acquittal, or is this the beginning of a month’s long recalibration of his administration? What is he going to do going forward? Right. Is this the post-aquittal presidency, one in which enemies are punished and allies are at all costs protected? Right, exactly. And that the instruments of government are to serve the president’s interests, not just the public’s interests. Peter, what you have described here is what an old school political terms might be called a strategy of carrots and sticks, but on steroids, right? You protect those who have done right by you, and you punish those who have somehow wronged you. And in the case of the president, that “steroided up” strategy clearly worked when it came to impeachment. And we talked to you. We talked to many of our colleagues about the fact that there was genuine fear of crossing this president, and that that influenced how the Senate voted in the impeachment trial. So if this strategy is working — and by all accounts, it is working — why shouldn’t the president keep it up? Well, it’s a great question. I think one of the things we’ve learned about the last three years is that the norms, the standards, the lines that we used to think of that constrained a president were more aspirational and conceptual than they were legal. You go look. You go back far enough, you’re going to find plenty of presidents who punished their enemies and protected their friends. But in the post-Watergate period in particular, when we put in new guardrails, we put a new laws, we put in new systems, we thought that that had been minimized at the very least, right? That, yeah, you’re going to probably give an appointment to somebody who’s been good to you. And you’re going to maybe take away a grant from the state of somebody who crossed you on a vote. These things happen. They happen under any presidency. This is that, as you put it, on steroids. And it’s overt. It’s right out there in the open. He wants everybody to know what he’s doing. He wants everybody to understand. You are loyal to this president or you should get out. And that’s true of people in government. That’s true of people even in Congress. He’s made very clear that the Republican Party has no room for anybody who is not on his side. You’re either in his camp or you’re not. And, of course, there’s a larger context here, which is we’re in the middle of a presidential election. And I wonder how this behavior by the president fits into his re-election strategy. You say that all this fits into a broader approach by this presidential politics. It’s not about unifying. It’s about dividing. It’s about us versus them. And this is what the appeal is to his constituents. It is: I am fighting for you. And they are trying to stop me. It’s the deep state, it’s the Democrats, it’s the fake news media. They’re all trying to stop me, and by extension, you. And that’s why you should stick with me in this election this fall. So this idea that Washington is all alarmed by retributions and protections of friends because it violates norms doesn’t hurt his appeal to many of his voters out there, because it’s part of this larger argument that he’s making. And the larger argument is I am a force of disruption. I am a force that is shaking things up. And the reason why you’re seeing things in the news that are bad about me is because they’re fighting back. And you should stay with me because it’s not just me. It’s about you too. Peter, thank you. OK, thank you. On Thursday, in an interview with ABC News, Attorney General Bill Barr said that the president’s interference in cases like Roger Stone’s was making it all but impossible for him to run the Department of Justice. To have public statements and tweets made about the department, about people in the department, our men and women here, about cases pending in the department and about judges before whom we have cases, make it impossible for me to do my job and to assure the courts and the prosecutors and the department that we’re doing our work with integrity. But Barr did not directly criticize the president, and confirmed in the interview that he had overruled prosecutors to recommend a more lenient sentence for Stone. We’ll be right back. Here’s what else you need to know today. Are there any senators in the chamber wishing to change their vote? If not, the yeas are 55, the nays are 45. The joint resolution as amended is passed. On Thursday, a bipartisan majority in the Senate passed a resolution requiring President Trump to seek authorization from Congress before taking further military action against Iran. The legislation, which was already passed by the House, is an unusual move to restrain presidential power and reflected the growing unease within Congress over Trump’s approach to Iraq, which many fear could lead to all-out war. It follows Trump’s decision six weeks ago to kill Qassim Suleimani, a top Iranian military commander, without the authorization of Congress. “The Daily” is made by Theo Balcomb, Andy Mills, Lisa Tobin, Rachel Quester, Lynsea Garrison, Annie Brown, Clare Toeniskoetter, Paige Cowett, Michael Simon Johnson, Brad Fisher, Larissa Anderson, Wendy Dorr, Chris Wood, Jessica Cheung, Alexandra Leigh Young, Jonathan Wolfe, Lisa Chow, Eric Krupke, Marc Georges, Luke Vander Ploeg, Adizah Eghan, Kelly Prime, Julia Longoria, Donna Summer, Jazmin Aguilera, M.J.

That’s it for “The Daily.” I’m Michael Barbaro. See you on Tuesday after the holiday. Mr. Sondland took a more measured approach, confirming that he had been dismissed without offering any protest. “I was advised today that the president intends to recall me effective immediately as United States ambassador to the European Union,” he said in a statement hours after Colonel Vindman’s dismissal. “I am grateful to President Trump for having given me the opportunity to serve, to Secretary Pompeo for his consistent support and to the exceptional and dedicated professionals at the U.S. Mission to the European Union.” Mr. Sondland and Colonel Vindman were key witnesses in the House impeachment hearings. Mr. Sondland, who was deeply involved in the effort to pressure Ukraine to announce investigations into Mr. Trump’s Democratic rivals, testified that “we followed the president’s orders” and that “everyone was in the loop.” Colonel Vindman, who was on Mr. Trump’s July 25 phone call with Ukraine’s president, testified that it was “improper for the president” to coerce a foreign country to investigate a political opponent. It may have been untenable for them to keep working for a president with whom they broke so publicly, but the White House made no effort to portray the ousters as anything other than reprisals. Mr. Trump foreshadowed Colonel Vindman’s fate hours ahead of time when asked if he would be pushed out. “Well, I’m not happy with him,” the president told reporters. “You think I’m supposed to be happy with him? I’m not.” The president continued to assail lawmakers who voted for conviction, targeting Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, who bitterly disappointed Mr. Trump by sticking with his party. “I was told by many that Manchin was just a puppet for Schumer & Pelosi,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter, referring to Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, and Speaker Nancy Pelosi. “That’s all he is!” Even as Mr. Trump flew to North Carolina to highlight his economic record, he called on the House to “expunge” his impeachment, an idea with no precedent or basis in the Constitution. “They should because it was a hoax,” he told reporters. “It was a total political hoax.” And he accused Ms. Pelosi of committing a crime by ripping up a copy of his State of the Union address. “She broke the law,” he asserted. The president’s critics had warned that he would feel unbound if acquitted, and some said the dismissals proved their point, quickly calling them “the Friday night massacre,” as Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, put it. “These are the actions of a man who believes he is above the law,” said Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and the lead House impeachment manager. Mr. Schumer said the White House was running from the truth. “This action is not a sign of strength,” he said. “It only shows President Trump’s weakness.” Ms. Pelosi said, “This goes too far.” At the Democratic presidential debate in New Hampshire, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. asked the audience to stand in support of Colonel Vindman. The White House would not discuss the Vindman decision. “We do not comment on personnel matters,” said John Ullyot, a spokesman for the National Security Council. Donald Trump Jr., the president’s eldest son, celebrated the dismissals, offering mock thanks to Mr. Schiff. “Were it not for his crack investigation skills, @realDonaldTrump might have had a tougher time unearthing who all needed to be fired,” he tweeted. “The president had every right to make the moves that he did today,” Representative Lee Zeldin, Republican of New York, said in an interview. “Moving Lt. Col. Vindman, for example, is a good move based on the fact that there is a lack of trust. He disagrees with the president’s policies.” As for Mr. Sondland, “the president can recall an ambassador at any time with or without cause, and in the case of Gordon Sondland, the guy was a hot mess, anyway.” Representative Matt Gaetz, Republican of Florida, expressed no regrets over Mr. Sondland’s dismissal. “Somehow I think America will be able to deliver foreign policy without Gordon Sondland,” he said by text message. Other witnesses have left with less drama recently. Marie L. Yovanovitch, the ambassador to Ukraine who was recalled from her post last spring because she was seen as an obstacle to the president’s plans, retired last month from the Foreign Service. William B. Taylor Jr., who replaced her in an acting capacity, was essentially brought back early, as well. And Jennifer Williams, a career official working for Vice President Mike Pence, quietly returned to the Defense Department. Several had already left government, like Fiona Hill, the Europe policy chief at the National Security Council, and Kurt D. Volker, the special envoy for Ukraine, who resigned days before testifying. But others remain, including George P. Kent at the State Department, Laura Cooper at the Defense Department and David Holmes at the embassy in Ukraine. Mr. Sondland began discussions with senior officials about leaving shortly after he testified in November, according to two people briefed on the matter. He believed that remaining would be unrealistic given his role in impeachment and hoped to exit gracefully. A decision on timing was postponed until after impeachment, but on Friday, State Department officials told Mr. Sondland that they wanted him to resign, the people said. Mr. Sondland relayed to them that he would not step down amid what was clearly a purge of impeachment witnesses and that he would have to be fired, they said. In response, State Department officials recalled him. Colonel Vindman’s brother seemed to be collateral damage. Yevgeny Vindman, who goes by Eugene, worked as a lawyer for the National Security Council and had no role in the impeachment hearings other than showing up to sit behind his brother when he appeared in November. He was given no explanation for his dismissal “despite over two decades of loyal service to this country,” said Mr. Pressman, the lawyer. “He deeply regrets that he will not be able to continue his service at the White House.” Both Vindmans, whose White House tours were scheduled to last until July, will retain their Army ranks and return to military service. Alexander Vindman, who had been expecting the move and had begun removing personal items, was told he would go to the Pentagon before moving to the National War College in July as originally planned. Yevgeny Vindman was more surprised and was told he would report to the office of the Army general counsel. Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper said service members who return to the military would be welcomed back. “We protect all of our persons, service members, from retribution or anything like that,” he told reporters. Mr. Trump, on the other hand, has made clear his personal antipathy for both Vindmans. “Lieutenant Colonel Vindman and his twin brother, right?” he said on Thursday during a rambling hourlong venting session at the White House, his voice dripping with disdain. “We had some people that — really amazing.” On Friday, Mr. Trump retweeted a message from a supporter advocating Alexander Vindman’s dismissal: “Vindman’s behavior is a scandal. He should be removed from the @RealDonaldTrump White House ASAP to protect our foreign policy from his machinations.” Senator Susan Collins of Maine, a Republican who voted to acquit the president but expressed hope that he would learn a lesson from the impeachment, said witnesses should not be punished. “I obviously am not in favor of any kind of retribution against anyone who came forward with evidence,” she said in Maine, according to The Portland Press Herald. Colonel Vindman has been subjected to virulent attacks on his patriotism on Fox News and social media. The president called him a “Never Trumper,” a term the colonel rejected. Fox aired a segment suggesting his service in the White House might amount to “espionage.” And Senator Marsha Blackburn, Republican of Tennessee, attacked him on Twitter: “How patriotic is it to badmouth and ridicule our great nation in front of Russia, America’s greatest enemy?” With impeachment over, Mr. Trump is debating additional personnel changes. Some advisers are encouraging him to part ways with his acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, who was involved in freezing security aid to Ukraine, which paved the way for impeachment. Other advisers are telling Mr. Trump to delay major changes until after the November election. Some hope that Representative Mark Meadows, Republican of North Carolina, will join the White House as a senior adviser. Mr. Meadows traveled with the president on Friday to North Carolina. Mr. Trump denied that Mr. Mulvaney would be pushed out in favor of Mr. Meadows. “I have a great relationship with Mick,” the president told reporters on Friday. “I have a great relationship with Mark. And it’s false.” Peter Baker and Michael S. Schmidt reported from Washington, and Maggie Haberman and Danny Hakim from New York.

2020,Trump Fires Impeachment Witnesses Gordon Sondland and Alexander Vindman in Post-Acquittal Purge,"Emboldened by his victory and determined to strike back, the president removed Mr. Sondland as ambassador to the European Union after the White House earlier on Friday dismissed Colonel Vindman. WASHINGTON — President Trump wasted little time on Friday opening a campaign of retribution against those he blames for his impeachment, firing two of the most prominent witnesses in the House inquiry against him barely 48 hours after being acquitted by the Senate. Emboldened by his victory and determined to strike back, Mr. Trump ordered Gordon D. Sondland, the founder of a hotel chain who donated $1 million to the president’s inaugural committee, recalled from his post as the ambassador to the European Union on the same day that Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman, a decorated Iraq war veteran on the National Security Council staff, was marched out of the White House by security guards. The ousters of Mr. Sondland and Colonel Vindman — along with Mr. Vindman’s brother, Lt. Col. Yevgeny Vindman, an Army officer who also worked on the National Security Council staff — may only presage a broader effort to even accounts with the president’s perceived enemies. In the two days since his acquittal in the Senate, Mr. Trump has railed about those who stood against him, calling them “evil,” “corrupt” and “crooked,” while his press secretary declared that those who hurt the president “should pay for” it. Even as he began purging administration officials who testified in the House impeachment inquiry, Mr. Trump assailed a Democratic senator who he had hoped would side with him during the trial but did not and called on the House to “expunge” his impeachment because he deems it illegitimate. The flurry of actions and outbursts drew quick condemnation from Democrats, who said the president was demonstrating that he feels unleashed, and complicated the politics of impeachment for moderate Republicans who stood by him while arguing that he had learned his lesson and would be more restrained in the future. “There is no question in the mind of any American why this man’s job is over, why this country now has one less soldier serving it at the White House,” David Pressman, Colonel Vindman’s lawyer, said in a statement. “Lt. Col. Vindman was asked to leave for telling the truth. His honor, his commitment to right, frightened the powerful.” Colonel Vindman spoke publicly only once, after being ordered to under subpoena, Mr. Pressman added. “And for that, the most powerful man in the world — buoyed by the silent, the pliable and the complicit — has decided to exact revenge.” transcript From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” Today: President Trump has undertaken a campaign of retribution against those who crossed him during the impeachment inquiry and favors for those who have tried to protect him. Peter Baker on the post-acquittal presidency. It’s Friday, February 14. [HORNS] Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States. Peter, I want to begin with retribution. How does that start? Well, thank you very much, everybody. Wow. The day after his acquittal in the Senate, the president gathers people in the East Room of the White House for an event. It’s not quite a press conference. It’s not quite a speech. It’s really kind of a mix, a mix of a celebration of his acquittal but a venting session of his grievances. I want to start by thanking some of — and I call them friends, because you develop friendships and relationships when you’re in battle and war. And he wants to thank the people who stood behind him, names them in the audience. Mitch McConnell, I want to tell you, you did a fantastic job. [APPLAUSE] Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader who did more than anybody to secure his acquittal in the trial. And he mentions Jim Jordan — When I first got to know Jim, I said, huh, he never wears a jacket. What the hell’s going on? He’s obviously very proud of his body. [LAUGHTER] — and other members of the House, the Freedom Caucus, the conservative Republicans who always stood by him in the most aggressive and assertive and staunch way. And then, of course, he turns to his enemies. The people he blames for his ordeal, the people he thinks have treated him so unfairly, have plotted against him, been disloyal or what have you. And he names ones that you would expect, of course. Nancy Pelosi is a horrible person. Nancy Pelosi, he says she’s a horrible person. A corrupt politician named Adam Schiff made up my statement to the Ukrainian president. He brought it out of thin air — just made it up. They say he’s a screenwriter, a failed screenwriter. He names, of course, Adam Schiff, the lead House prosecutor. And then you have some that used religion as a crutch. They never used it before. He names Mitt Romney, the Republican, the only Republican senator to vote for conviction. But, you know, it’s a failed presidential candidate, so things can happen when you fail so badly running for president. These two now, of course, are really at odds. And you see the visceral anger in the president in this moment. And he mentions Colonel Alexander Vindman, a member of his own staff, a detailee from the Pentagon working on Ukraine issues, and his twin brother Yevgeny Vindman, who also works at the N.S.C. staff. He says it almost in passing. Lieutenant Colonel Vindman and his twin brother, right? And he says it with such dripping disdain in his voice. You’d get the sense immediately, of course, that this is somebody who’s really angry at the president, and he’s got his attention. And remind us what puts Vindman in this list of enemies. Colonel Vindman was one of the members of the White House staff, the National Security Council staff who were subpoenaed by the House to testify in the impeachment inquiry. He didn’t come forward voluntarily. He was required to by law to give his testimony to the committee. And during his testimony, he told about being on the famous July 25 call between the president and President Zelensky of Ukraine when the president asked him to investigate Joe Biden and the Democrats. And Colonel Vindman told the committee that he thought that was inappropriate, and he reported it to his superiors at the N.S.C. And for that, he has been on the target list of President Trump and his allies ever since. Painted as disloyal, painted as even treasonous to the country. His patriotism questioned even though he’s a decorated veteran of the Iraq War, injured in battle, and really, a kind of a symbol to both sides of sort of where this fight has evolved. Our country is just respected again, and it’s an honor to be with the people in this room. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. And so he comes to the end of this sort of rambling, meandering talk that goes on for an hour and two minutes. And you get the sense that this is not the end and that there’s more to come. Well, President Trump has begun his revenge in the wake of his impeachment trial. Colonel Vindman, the same witness he had just talked about so dismissively at the East Room event finds himself escorted out of the White House by security guards and told his services are no longer needed — Wow. — exiled back to the Pentagon from which he came. Not just him — Escorted out of his job and off the White House grounds, as was his twin brother, who was also assigned to the N.S.C. His brother Yevgeny Vindman — who didn’t do anything, had nothing to do with the impeachment hearings at all, except to show up and sit behind his brother just as a matter of family support — also dismissed from his post at the National Security Council, marched out at the same time by security and sent back to the Pentagon. Today, Vindman’s lawyer issued a statement saying, quote, “The truth has cost him his job, his career and his privacy.” You can understand why a president might not want somebody on his staff who had testified an impeachment hearing against him. But it was handled in a way that was meant to maximize the public message, right? I’ll tell you what I mean by that. The N.S.C. is currently undergoing a downsizing. And in fact, the plan was to move Colonel Vindman out as part of that, or at least to use that as the cover to to say, it’s not about reprisal. It’s not about his role in impeachment. It’s just part of this overall restructuring. And that’s frankly how other presidents might have handled a situation like that. Come up with a rationale. Come up with a rationale, come up with a public face-saving kind of storyline, a narrative, at least, that even though people would see through it, would at least have the veneer of looking professional rather than vindictive. That was not what the president wanted. He made sure they did this separate from that reorganization. They did not explain it as part of that reorganization. And they did not deny when we called them that day that this was what it looked like, which was, of course, an act of retribution. OK, so what happens next? Well, we thought that was the story for the day, these two brothers being marched out of there. Right. And then we discover as the evening arrives that it’s not over. Now we’re getting word that the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, he is out as well. Gordon Sondland, you may remember him. He was the ambassador to the European Union, who had been deeply involved in the Ukraine pressure campaign, on the phone with the president and required to testify, became a key witness in the House hearings. He said that they were operating on the order of the president himself. He said that it was clearly a quid pro quo, and he said that everyone was in the loop. Suddenly, it turns out he’s out as well. Now, as with Vindman, there was a way to do this that would have minimized the public kerfuffle. Gordon Sondland actually was ready to leave. He had told his superiors at the State Department that he was ready to step down on his own. And he got word that Friday you have to resign today, they told him. But he says, no. I don’t want to resign on the same day that you’re pushing out these Vindmans as if I’m part of some sort of purge. Wow. If you want me today, you’re going to have to fire me. And they called back and said, OK, you’re fired. So at this point, it’s clear that this is a vindictive purge of anyone who did anything that put the president in a negative light during the impeachment process. And what is the reaction to that, that very clear and deliberate message from the president inside Washington? Certainly among Democrats, even among a few Republicans who say what’s the message you’re sending? If you respond to a subpoena, as ordered by the law, and you give your testimony, you shouldn’t be punished for doing that. The president’s view is, why should I have people I can’t trust working for me? It’s my right as the president to have a staff that serves my interests that I believe is loyal. And he’s made clear that loyalty is a number one when it comes to this president. There’s no other quality that matters more to him. And, Peter, as somebody who’s covered many White Houses, is he right about that? Is it ultimately a presidential prerogative to decide if someone testified against you, that, you know, you no longer want them around, you don’t want them in those jobs anymore, especially presidential appointments? It’s a good question, right? Because it does feel like it would be untenable to have testified and provided damaging testimony against the president, and then come to work every day afterwards. You would think, in fact, you might not want to necessarily do that. But the question isn’t what’s the right place then for that person to work. The question is what the message the president is trying to send by what he’s doing, right? Right. This president has made a point of making sure everybody knows these people are out, and they’re out because of him and because he will not tolerate disloyalty. OK, so that is the campaign of retribution so far, post acquittal, which brings us to the campaign of protection for the president’s allies. Right. It’s not enough just to go after his perceived enemies. Now it’s time to do something to protect his friends. And for him, this is going to start with a colorful character and longtime friend and adviser named Roger Stone, who’s about to go to prison. We’ll be right back. So, Peter, before we get to how the president is trying to protect Roger Stone, remind us who Roger Stone is. Roger Stone has been in American politics going back decades. He is somebody who calls himself a dirty trickster. I’m certainly guilty of bluffing and posturing and punking the Democrats. Unless they pass some law against [BLEEP] and I missed it, I’m engaging in tradecraft. It’s politics. He’s a self-proclaimed fan of Richard Nixon. Even to this day, he has a Richard Nixon tattoo. Right. He’s somebody who’s involved early on in some of the Reagan and Dole campaigns, but over the years kind of drifted off into the side, really kind of more of a fringe character, a conspiracy theorist, a provocateur. In 1980, Stone began a lobbying firm with Paul Manafort that unapologetically catered to human rights abusers. He has these maxims on how he conducts his political strategy. One of his rules is never turn down an opportunity to have sex or be on television. We’ve seen a lot of colorful characters in the world of political consulting, none more colorful than Roger Stone. And that is the most charitable adjective you can apply to the single weirdest man possibly in the history of political consulting. He’d been friends for years with Donald Trump. And like Roger Stone, Trump comes from the outside, right? He was not part of the Republican establishment. But suddenly, he’s powering forward toward a presidential bid. And he brings with him people like Roger Stone, who had not been in the center of American politics now for years. Right. And my recollection is that it’s during that campaign that Roger Stone gets into very significant trouble. Right. He becomes wrapped up in the whole story about the Russian hacking of the Democratic emails. Hillary Clinton’s campaign dealing with more email problems. The email account of campaign chairman John Podesta was hacked and many of the emails released. Things he said gave the impression that he might have known about it in advance. Right. So were you surprised when John Podesta’s emails came out, as you seemed to predict ahead of time? I was interested, like the rest of the country. Were you surprised? No, I wouldn’t say that I was surprised. And that puts him right in the heart of this. Is he a link between the Trump campaign and Russia through perhaps WikiLeaks, which is the cutout that the Russians used to get these emails out. And so, once the president wins and comes into office, his friend Roger Stone finds himself under investigation for what he knew and when he knew it. And then Congress jumps in. They call Stone to testify at the House Intelligence Committee. And this is where he really gets into trouble. We had a very frank exchange. I answered all of the questions. I made the case that the accusation that I knew about John Podesta’s email hack in advance was false, that I knew about the content and source of the WikiLeaks disclosures regarding Hillary Clinton was false. He starts telling things that are demonstrably not true. And he ultimately ends up getting charged with lying to Congress. He also tries to get an associate of his to not tell the truth, threatens him even, threatens to kill his dog. Whoa. And he was put on trial. And last fall Roger Stone was convicted of seven crimes, seven felonies, including lying to Congress and witness intimidation. And these are conditions on very serious charges of obstructing a congressional investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. That’s right. I remember thinking when that happened, like, whoa. This is the big leagues for Roger Stone. Exactly. And the question is, why is he lying? Why is he obstructing? Is he trying to protect the president? This is how this all fits together, right? This goes back to the whole Russian interference. This goes back to the Mueller probe. This goes back to the things that have dominated this presidency for three years and frustrated this president for three years. So he sees Roger Stone’s conviction as an illegitimate shot at him, at himself, the president. A way of trying to take him down because they couldn’t take him down any other way. OK. So Peter, how does the president try to protect Stone after this conviction? So even as he’s in the middle of this campaign of retribution against the Vindman brothers and Gordon Sondland, he is increasingly aware that the sentencing for Roger Stone is coming up. And then, when Monday comes around and the prosecutors present their recommendation for a sentence to the court, the prosecutors ask for seven to nine years behind bars. That’s the normal sentence that would be required under the sentencing guidelines passed by Congress for crimes of the type that Roger Stone was convicted of. So they didn’t go outside of those guidelines. They simply said we want to sentence him to what the guidelines say. That doesn’t mean the judge would go along with it, but that was their recommendation. Well, that set the president off. The president expressed his outrage on Twitter, calling it a very unfair situation, adding, “Cannot allow this miscarriage of justice!” In the middle of the night, he starts sending out tweets, angry tweets. How can this happen? Nine years, this is outrageous. And they’re going after him. How come they don’t go after my enemies but they go after him? And that just sort of sets the town ablaze. Controversy in the nation’s capital now over a sentencing recommendation for President Trump’s longtime friend Roger Stone. Here’s a president weighing in directly on a court case involving a friend of his. This is something that we have not seen really since Watergate. Presidents don’t, especially publicly, weigh in on prosecutions of people that they are personally connected to, at least except in the venue of issuing pardons at some point, which they sometimes do. So this has shocked a lot of people. But what really shocked a lot of people in Washington was when they woke up a few hours later on Tuesday and they saw not only these tweets, but they saw that the attorney general of the United States, Bill Barr, had essentially overruled the career prosecutors. Breaking news involving President Trump. A stunning reversal in the sentencing recommendation for Trump confidant Roger Stone. And said, no, we’re not going to ask for a sentence this heavy. We’re going to ask for something lighter. So not seven to nine years, something less. Not seven to nine years, something less. It doesn’t specify what, but something below what the guidelines would normally call for. And so this is causing a huge furor in the U.S. attorney’s office in Washington. What is going on? President Trump knows how to get away with stuff when we’re not watching. The four career prosecutors who worked on the Stone case, all four of them, quit. We’re following some truly stunning, breaking news, still developing by the minute this hour. Federal prosecutors in the Roger Stone criminal case have resigned this afternoon. One after the other. One, two, three, four, just like that. This does not happen. Prosecutors don’t resign just days before they go to sentencing after a case that they’ve worked so hard on. One of them actually quits his job altogether, leaves the Justice Department as a whole. In protest. Well, they don’t say it, but that’s the obvious conclusion. Yes, they’re protesting the overruling of their recommendation. And I think that they felt like they had an ethical obligation. If they had told the court this is the sentence we think is appropriate, and then suddenly a day later the same department is coming and saying, no, we don’t — how is that tenable for them to continue on that case? And, Peter, given what has just happened — the firing of Vindman, Sondland, Vindman’s brother — what is the reaction to this intervention? Not just the retribution, but this protection? Well, in effect, the Democrats are saying we told you so, right? No serious person believes President Trump has learned any lesson. He doesn’t learn any lessons. He does just what he wants, what suits his ego at the moment. Senator Schumer, the Democratic leader in the upper chamber goes to the floor and gives a pretty passionate speech in which he says that the natural consequence of acquitting the president on the Ukraine matter means that he feels completely unleashed and empowered to do whatever he thinks is right for his own political interests. We are witnessing a crisis in the rule of law in America, unlike one we have ever seen before. It’s a crisis of President Trump’s making, but it was enabled and emboldened by every Senate Republican. Even amongst some Republicans, you’re seeing you know some discomfort, particularly among moderate Republicans who tried to give the president the benefit of the doubt by standing with him in the impeachment trial. A couple of them had said even, well, maybe he’ll have learned a lesson from all of this and he’ll be more measured, he’ll be more restrained in the future and that that would be a good thing. Well, what you’re hearing a lot of people saying is that doesn’t seem to be the case. And I think that the question going forward is going to be, is it just a burst of energy and lashing out in the days after the acquittal, or is this the beginning of a month’s long recalibration of his administration? What is he going to do going forward? Right. Is this the post-aquittal presidency, one in which enemies are punished and allies are at all costs protected? Right, exactly. And that the instruments of government are to serve the president’s interests, not just the public’s interests. Peter, what you have described here is what an old school political terms might be called a strategy of carrots and sticks, but on steroids, right? You protect those who have done right by you, and you punish those who have somehow wronged you. And in the case of the president, that “steroided up” strategy clearly worked when it came to impeachment. And we talked to you. We talked to many of our colleagues about the fact that there was genuine fear of crossing this president, and that that influenced how the Senate voted in the impeachment trial. So if this strategy is working — and by all accounts, it is working — why shouldn’t the president keep it up? Well, it’s a great question. I think one of the things we’ve learned about the last three years is that the norms, the standards, the lines that we used to think of that constrained a president were more aspirational and conceptual than they were legal. You go look. You go back far enough, you’re going to find plenty of presidents who punished their enemies and protected their friends. But in the post-Watergate period in particular, when we put in new guardrails, we put a new laws, we put in new systems, we thought that that had been minimized at the very least, right? That, yeah, you’re going to probably give an appointment to somebody who’s been good to you. And you’re going to maybe take away a grant from the state of somebody who crossed you on a vote. These things happen. They happen under any presidency. This is that, as you put it, on steroids. And it’s overt. It’s right out there in the open. He wants everybody to know what he’s doing. He wants everybody to understand. You are loyal to this president or you should get out. And that’s true of people in government. That’s true of people even in Congress. He’s made very clear that the Republican Party has no room for anybody who is not on his side. You’re either in his camp or you’re not. And, of course, there’s a larger context here, which is we’re in the middle of a presidential election. And I wonder how this behavior by the president fits into his re-election strategy. You say that all this fits into a broader approach by this presidential politics. It’s not about unifying. It’s about dividing. It’s about us versus them. And this is what the appeal is to his constituents. It is: I am fighting for you. And they are trying to stop me. It’s the deep state, it’s the Democrats, it’s the fake news media. They’re all trying to stop me, and by extension, you. And that’s why you should stick with me in this election this fall. So this idea that Washington is all alarmed by retributions and protections of friends because it violates norms doesn’t hurt his appeal to many of his voters out there, because it’s part of this larger argument that he’s making. And the larger argument is I am a force of disruption. I am a force that is shaking things up. And the reason why you’re seeing things in the news that are bad about me is because they’re fighting back. And you should stay with me because it’s not just me. It’s about you too. Peter, thank you. OK, thank you. On Thursday, in an interview with ABC News, Attorney General Bill Barr said that the president’s interference in cases like Roger Stone’s was making it all but impossible for him to run the Department of Justice. To have public statements and tweets made about the department, about people in the department, our men and women here, about cases pending in the department and about judges before whom we have cases, make it impossible for me to do my job and to assure the courts and the prosecutors and the department that we’re doing our work with integrity. But Barr did not directly criticize the president, and confirmed in the interview that he had overruled prosecutors to recommend a more lenient sentence for Stone. We’ll be right back. Here’s what else you need to know today. Are there any senators in the chamber wishing to change their vote? If not, the yeas are 55, the nays are 45. The joint resolution as amended is passed. On Thursday, a bipartisan majority in the Senate passed a resolution requiring President Trump to seek authorization from Congress before taking further military action against Iran. The legislation, which was already passed by the House, is an unusual move to restrain presidential power and reflected the growing unease within Congress over Trump’s approach to Iraq, which many fear could lead to all-out war. It follows Trump’s decision six weeks ago to kill Qassim Suleimani, a top Iranian military commander, without the authorization of Congress. “The Daily” is made by Theo Balcomb, Andy Mills, Lisa Tobin, Rachel Quester, Lynsea Garrison, Annie Brown, Clare Toeniskoetter, Paige Cowett, Michael Simon Johnson, Brad Fisher, Larissa Anderson, Wendy Dorr, Chris Wood, Jessica Cheung, Alexandra Leigh Young, Jonathan Wolfe, Lisa Chow, Eric Krupke, Marc Georges, Luke Vander Ploeg, Adizah Eghan, Kelly Prime, Julia Longoria, Donna Summer, Jazmin Aguilera, M.J.

That’s it for “The Daily.” I’m Michael Barbaro. See you on Tuesday after the holiday. Mr. Sondland took a more measured approach, confirming that he had been dismissed without offering any protest. “I was advised today that the president intends to recall me effective immediately as United States ambassador to the European Union,” he said in a statement hours after Colonel Vindman’s dismissal. “I am grateful to President Trump for having given me the opportunity to serve, to Secretary Pompeo for his consistent support and to the exceptional and dedicated professionals at the U.S. Mission to the European Union.” Mr. Sondland and Colonel Vindman were key witnesses in the House impeachment hearings. Mr. Sondland, who was deeply involved in the effort to pressure Ukraine to announce investigations into Mr. Trump’s Democratic rivals, testified that “we followed the president’s orders” and that “everyone was in the loop.” Colonel Vindman, who was on Mr. Trump’s July 25 phone call with Ukraine’s president, testified that it was “improper for the president” to coerce a foreign country to investigate a political opponent. It may have been untenable for them to keep working for a president with whom they broke so publicly, but the White House made no effort to portray the ousters as anything other than reprisals. Mr. Trump foreshadowed Colonel Vindman’s fate hours ahead of time when asked if he would be pushed out. “Well, I’m not happy with him,” the president told reporters. “You think I’m supposed to be happy with him? I’m not.” The president continued to assail lawmakers who voted for conviction, targeting Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, who bitterly disappointed Mr. Trump by sticking with his party. “I was told by many that Manchin was just a puppet for Schumer & Pelosi,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter, referring to Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, and Speaker Nancy Pelosi. “That’s all he is!” Even as Mr. Trump flew to North Carolina to highlight his economic record, he called on the House to “expunge” his impeachment, an idea with no precedent or basis in the Constitution. “They should because it was a hoax,” he told reporters. “It was a total political hoax.” And he accused Ms. Pelosi of committing a crime by ripping up a copy of his State of the Union address. “She broke the law,” he asserted. The president’s critics had warned that he would feel unbound if acquitted, and some said the dismissals proved their point, quickly calling them “the Friday night massacre,” as Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, put it. “These are the actions of a man who believes he is above the law,” said Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and the lead House impeachment manager. Mr. Schumer said the White House was running from the truth. “This action is not a sign of strength,” he said. “It only shows President Trump’s weakness.” Ms. Pelosi said, “This goes too far.” At the Democratic presidential debate in New Hampshire, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. asked the audience to stand in support of Colonel Vindman. The White House would not discuss the Vindman decision. “We do not comment on personnel matters,” said John Ullyot, a spokesman for the National Security Council. Donald Trump Jr., the president’s eldest son, celebrated the dismissals, offering mock thanks to Mr. Schiff. “Were it not for his crack investigation skills, @realDonaldTrump might have had a tougher time unearthing who all needed to be fired,” he tweeted. “The president had every right to make the moves that he did today,” Representative Lee Zeldin, Republican of New York, said in an interview. “Moving Lt. Col. Vindman, for example, is a good move based on the fact that there is a lack of trust. He disagrees with the president’s policies.” As for Mr. Sondland, “the president can recall an ambassador at any time with or without cause, and in the case of Gordon Sondland, the guy was a hot mess, anyway.” Representative Matt Gaetz, Republican of Florida, expressed no regrets over Mr. Sondland’s dismissal. “Somehow I think America will be able to deliver foreign policy without Gordon Sondland,” he said by text message. Other witnesses have left with less drama recently. Marie L. Yovanovitch, the ambassador to Ukraine who was recalled from her post last spring because she was seen as an obstacle to the president’s plans, retired last month from the Foreign Service. William B. Taylor Jr., who replaced her in an acting capacity, was essentially brought back early, as well. And Jennifer Williams, a career official working for Vice President Mike Pence, quietly returned to the Defense Department. Several had already left government, like Fiona Hill, the Europe policy chief at the National Security Council, and Kurt D. Volker, the special envoy for Ukraine, who resigned days before testifying. But others remain, including George P. Kent at the State Department, Laura Cooper at the Defense Department and David Holmes at the embassy in Ukraine. Mr. Sondland began discussions with senior officials about leaving shortly after he testified in November, according to two people briefed on the matter. He believed that remaining would be unrealistic given his role in impeachment and hoped to exit gracefully. A decision on timing was postponed until after impeachment, but on Friday, State Department officials told Mr. Sondland that they wanted him to resign, the people said. Mr. Sondland relayed to them that he would not step down amid what was clearly a purge of impeachment witnesses and that he would have to be fired, they said. In response, State Department officials recalled him. Colonel Vindman’s brother seemed to be collateral damage. Yevgeny Vindman, who goes by Eugene, worked as a lawyer for the National Security Council and had no role in the impeachment hearings other than showing up to sit behind his brother when he appeared in November. He was given no explanation for his dismissal “despite over two decades of loyal service to this country,” said Mr. Pressman, the lawyer. “He deeply regrets that he will not be able to continue his service at the White House.” Both Vindmans, whose White House tours were scheduled to last until July, will retain their Army ranks and return to military service. Alexander Vindman, who had been expecting the move and had begun removing personal items, was told he would go to the Pentagon before moving to the National War College in July as originally planned. Yevgeny Vindman was more surprised and was told he would report to the office of the Army general counsel. Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper said service members who return to the military would be welcomed back. “We protect all of our persons, service members, from retribution or anything like that,” he told reporters. Mr. Trump, on the other hand, has made clear his personal antipathy for both Vindmans. “Lieutenant Colonel Vindman and his twin brother, right?” he said on Thursday during a rambling hourlong venting session at the White House, his voice dripping with disdain. “We had some people that — really amazing.” On Friday, Mr. Trump retweeted a message from a supporter advocating Alexander Vindman’s dismissal: “Vindman’s behavior is a scandal. He should be removed from the @RealDonaldTrump White House ASAP to protect our foreign policy from his machinations.” Senator Susan Collins of Maine, a Republican who voted to acquit the president but expressed hope that he would learn a lesson from the impeachment, said witnesses should not be punished. “I obviously am not in favor of any kind of retribution against anyone who came forward with evidence,” she said in Maine, according to The Portland Press Herald. Colonel Vindman has been subjected to virulent attacks on his patriotism on Fox News and social media. The president called him a “Never Trumper,” a term the colonel rejected. Fox aired a segment suggesting his service in the White House might amount to “espionage.” And Senator Marsha Blackburn, Republican of Tennessee, attacked him on Twitter: “How patriotic is it to badmouth and ridicule our great nation in front of Russia, America’s greatest enemy?” With impeachment over, Mr. Trump is debating additional personnel changes. Some advisers are encouraging him to part ways with his acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, who was involved in freezing security aid to Ukraine, which paved the way for impeachment. Other advisers are telling Mr. Trump to delay major changes until after the November election. Some hope that Representative Mark Meadows, Republican of North Carolina, will join the White House as a senior adviser. Mr. Meadows traveled with the president on Friday to North Carolina. Mr. Trump denied that Mr. Mulvaney would be pushed out in favor of Mr. Meadows. “I have a great relationship with Mick,” the president told reporters on Friday. “I have a great relationship with Mark. And it’s false.” Peter Baker and Michael S. Schmidt reported from Washington, and Maggie Haberman and Danny Hakim from New York.

2020,"Trump Gives Conditional Go Ahead on Peace Deal With Taliban, Officials Say","If the Taliban fulfill a promise to reduce violence, the United States would then sign a deal that would begin the gradual withdrawal of American troops. KABUL, Afghanistan — More than 18 years after the United States invaded Afghanistan, President Trump has conditionally approved a peace deal with the Taliban that would withdraw the last American troops from the country, potentially beginning the end of America’s longest war, according to Afghan and American officials. But the deal will only be signed if the Taliban prove their commitment to a durable reduction of violence over a test period of about seven days later this month. If the Taliban do end hostilities and a deal is signed, the United States would then begin a gradual withdrawal of American troops, and direct negotiations would start between the Taliban and Afghan leaders over the future of their country. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo informed Afghanistan’s top leaders in separate phone calls on Tuesday that Mr. Trump had given tentative approval to this approach, according to a senior Afghan official briefed on one of the calls. A senior American official aware of the developments also confirmed Mr. Trump had given his preliminary approval for a deal on Monday, dependent on a cessation of violence, the same day he visited Dover Air Force Base to receive the remains of the latest American fatalities in the war, which has killed tens of thousands of Afghans and more than 3,500 American and coalition troops since the United States drove the Taliban from power in 2001. A senior diplomat in Washington described the deal as 95 percent agreed to in principle, but that the possibility of a final agreement will become clearer in a matter of couple weeks. A senior Taliban official informed of the negotiations said there were now “positive movements,” but declined to discuss details because the group’s internal deliberations were continuing. While the move could mark a significant moment in Mr. Trump’s pledge to end what he has described as “endless wars,” the talks have long remained fragile and previously broke down just as a signing was near. After nearly a year of negotiations, the two sides were on verge of a similar deal last September. Mr. Trump suddenly called off the talks, citing a Taliban attack that killed an American and NATO soldier and nearly a dozen Afghans. But officials said it was largely because Mr. Trump’s grand gesture of inviting the Taliban to Camp David to finalize the deal fell apart. After that, it took months of trust-building work, including a prisoner swap, to get back to the negotiating table. The deal’s details — including the timeline of the troop withdrawal and how much of the agreement had changed since the two sides were on verge of a signing last September — remained tightly guarded. “This is a welcoming development and I am pleased that our principal position on peace thus far has begun to yield fruitful results,” President Ashraf Ghani said in a statement announcing his call with Secretary Pompeo. “Our primary objective is to end the senseless bloodshed.” Mr. Ghani said Mr. Pompeo had informed him of “notable progress made in the ongoing peace talks” and of the “Taliban’s proposal with regards to bringing a significant and enduring reduction in violence.” Abdullah Abdullah, the Afghan government’s chief executive who had also received a call, said Mr. Pompeo had “expressed optimism that a reduction in violence and progress with current talks could lead to an agreement.” For the past month, American negotiators, led by the veteran diplomat Zalmay Khalilzad, have been camped out in the Gulf state of Qatar, trying to persuade the Taliban to come to terms. The most recent sticking point had been an American demand for the Taliban to significantly reduce their attacks across the country during the signing and after — when the peace process moves to its next stage. The Taliban have signaled their willingness to sit down with the Afghan government and other leaders to discuss the political future of the country — but only after the Americans agree to leave the country. Aboard Air Force One on the way to the ceremony on Monday at Dover Air Force Base, Mr. Trump discussed his Afghanistan strategy with a small group of aides and supporters, including Ivanka Trump, his daughter, and Senator Rand Paul, a Republican of Kentucky who is among the Senate’s most staunch voices against keeping American troops in Afghanistan. “I absolutely believe his sentiment is an overall desire not to be involved in a war,” Mr. Paul said in an interview in his office on Tuesday, adding that the president had witnessed a “very emotional” event in Dover the evening before. Mr. Paul added that while he believed the president wanted to ultimately issue a green light for troop withdrawal, he was skeptical about the amount of support he would receive from his other close allies in Congress. “We’re dominated by people who want unlimited checks to the military and never-ending intervention,” Mr. Paul said.

2020,Trump Gives Venezuela’s Guaidó the Embrace He Wanted,"A guest appearance at the State of the Union and meeting at the White House put to rest talk that President Trump had lost patience with Juan Guaidó’s campaign to oust Nicolás Maduro. WASHINGTON — Venezuela’s opposition leader, Juan Guaidó, has long hoped to land a meeting with President Trump that would demonstrate the United States’ support for his claim to being the country’s rightful president. He struck out when he and Mr. Trump were both in Davos, Switzerland, last month, and then again when they were both in South Florida last weekend. The near misses fueled speculation that Mr. Trump had lost interest in supporting the chief rival of Venezuela’s leftist president, Nicolás Maduro, with whom Mr. Guaidó had been locked in a yearslong political stalemate. But Mr. Guaidó’s visit to Washington this week more than made up for those disappointments when Mr. Trump gave him two moments in the spotlight that could lift him at home. First Mr. Trump hosted Mr. Guaidó at his State of the Union address on Tuesday night and in his speech delivered one of his most forceful endorsements of the opposition, describing Mr. Guaidó as “the true and legitimate president of Venezuela” and promising that Mr. Maduro’s “grip on tyranny will be smashed and broken.” In one of the night’s few bipartisan moments, Republicans and Democrats stood to applaud Mr. Guaidó. Then on Wednesday, Mr. Trump met with Mr. Guaidó at the White House, which released photos of the two leaders walking together and of Mr. Guaidó in a separate meeting with Vice President Mike Pence. A scheduled meeting with reporters was canceled at the last minute. [Update: The U.S. has imposed sanctions on the Russian oil company supporting Venezuela’s leader.] Mr. Trump has backed Mr. Guaidó as part of his effort to topple the authoritarian rule of Mr. Maduro, whom he calls a “socialist dictator” who has destroyed his oil-rich nation’s once-vibrant economy. In addition to punishing sanctions, the Trump administration has tried to pressure Mr. Maduro’s foreign allies, including Cuba and Russia, to withdraw their support for his rule. The appearances suggest that the two men’s needs remain closely aligned. Mr. Guaidó, who has struggled to maintain momentum in and outside Venezuela since declaring himself the country’s interim president last year, has been hunting for big international endorsements to regain that momentum. Mr. Trump needs support in voter-rich South Florida, home to America’s largest community of Venezuelan immigrants, many of whom oppose Mr. Maduro. It is also home to voters who have fled other left-wing governments in Latin America, including tens of thousands of Cuban-Americans who resent Havana’s steadfast support for Mr. Maduro. Shannon K. O’Neil, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations who focuses on Latin America, doubted that Mr. Trump’s new show of support for Mr. Guaidó would make “any difference on the ground in Venezuela. It might make some difference in Southern Florida in November.” “A handshake is great and the State of the Union — awesome. But what is the Trump administration really going to do?” she added. Mr. Trump’s national security adviser, Robert C. O’Brien, did signal on Wednesday that more substantive action might be on the way. Speaking at the Meridian International Center in Washington, Mr. O’Brien said the United States could impose sanctions on Russia’s state-owned oil company, Rosneft, one of several energy giants that continue to do business with Mr. Maduro’s government. “We’re letting the Russians and we’re letting the company know that their support of the Maduro regime is not a good business decision, but it’s also immoral, what it’s doing to the people of Venezuela,” he said. “I think you’re going to see some action either voluntarily from the company or the U.S. will likely take action in the near future.” A Trump official speaking on the condition of anonymity said later that other energy companies that do business with the Maduro government, including Chevron, should also be on notice that the United States is not finished with its pressure campaign. The official said the United States would not engage in direct talks with the Maduro government except to negotiate his exit from power. And he warned it not to “interfere with” Mr. Guaidó’s return to Venezuela. In and around Caracas on Wednesday, Mr. Guaidó’s appearances in Washington were met with mixed reviews. Mr. Maduro delivered an emphatic verdict, releasing a statement condemning what he called Mr. Trump’s “interventionist expressions.” The president’s statements, he said, represent an “effort to revive the failed strategy of government change by force” amid the United States’ “circuslike electoral spectacle.” A year ago, many Venezuelans received Mr. Guaidó with open arms, believing he would be the one to finally force Mr. Maduro’s departure. Then came a series of political missteps, including a failed effort to win over the military. But in recent weeks, as Mr. Maduro has tightened his grip on the country, Mr. Guaidó has been a source of frustration for many Venezuelans. In a suburb outside Caracas called San Antonio de los Altos, Jesús Niños, 70, a retired radio announcer, said that he thought Mr. Trump’s words would “revive Guaidó’s power to bring people to the streets,” helping to “foment the breakdown of the government.” Others were more skeptical that anything would change as a result of Mr. Trump’s threats. “They’re just words,” said José Álvarez, 47, a security guard, “and they’re a joke on Venezuela, just like Maduro is playing a joke on the people of Venezuela.” “If the United States and Guaidó had any power,” he said, “they would have already done something.” Michael Crowley reported from Washington, and Julie Turkewitz from Caracas, Venezuela.

2020,Opinion | Trump Goes Easy on White-Collar Crime. Outrage or Same Old?,"Cheaters sometimes prosper, especially when they know the president. Mr. Bokat-Lindell is a writer in The New York Times Opinion section. This article is part of the Debatable newsletter. You can sign up here to receive it on Tuesdays and Thursdays. In the 1980s, the “junk bond king” Michael Milken became both the highest-paid person on Wall Street and his generation’s most famous white-collar criminal. Sentenced in 1990 to 10 years in prison, he served less than two and today is worth an estimated $3.8 billion. On Tuesday, Mr. Milken became one of 11 people to whom President Trump granted clemency, a list that reads like “a who’s who of white-collar criminals from politics, sports and business who were convicted on charges involving fraud, corruption and lies,” my Times colleagues Michael D. Shear and Maggie Haberman write. The decision drew widespread condemnation, with Jennifer Rubin of The Washington Post accusing the Republican Party of having “unleashed an ethical monster” in Mr. Trump. But how groundbreaking is it that a powerful rich person — even the president — lent an exculpatory hand to other powerful, well-connected, corrupt rich people? Here’s some context for Mr. Trump’s clemency and how people are making sense of it. Mr. Trump’s presidency has unfolded in a golden age of impunity for the rich that is unprecedented in modern history, Michael Hobbes writes in HuffPost. Since Mr. Trump took office, he notes, white-collar prosecutions have fallen to a record low, and what few cases are prosecuted mostly concern low-level con artists. In 2018, nearly 19,000 people were sentenced in federal court for drug crimes alone, he says, but prosecutors convicted just 37 corporate criminals who worked at companies with more than 50 employees. “An entrenched, unfettered class of superpredators is wreaking havoc on American society,” he argues. “And in the process, they’ve broken the only systems capable of stopping them.” Amnesty for corrupt elites may have worsened under Mr. Trump, but it didn’t start with him, as the Times editorial board has written. It cited Jesse Eisinger’s book “The Chickenshit Club” — James Comey’s description of prosecutors who never lost a case because they avoided those they might lose — which documented how the Department of Justice had “lost the will and indeed the ability to go after the highest-ranking corporate wrongdoers.” The board wrote, “Industrial-level fraud by America’s banks nearly brought the world economy to its knees in 2008, and no senior executive was even charged.” Nor is Mr. Trump’s clemency for well-connected criminals entirely without precedent, as the journalist Glenn Greenwald has noted on Twitter. George H.W. Bush, for example, pardoned six Reagan administration officials implicated in the Iran-contra scandal, including Elliott Abrams, who now serves as the special Representative for Venezuela at the State Department. Mr. Greenwald also raised the case of Marc Rich, a financier who was convicted of evading $48 million in taxes and other crimes. Mr. Rich’s wife, Denise Rich, was a prominent fund-raiser for the Clintons and the Democratic Party, and President Bill Clinton pardoned Mr. Rich on his last day in office. The New York Times editorial board called it “a shocking abuse of presidential power.” A similar dynamic seemed to be at play in at least one of Mr. Trump’s recent pardons, as The Daily Beast reports: Paul Pogue, who pleaded guilty in 2010 to underpaying his taxes and was sentenced to three years in prison, and whose family has donated hundreds of thousands of dollars in direct contributions and in-kind air travel to the Trump Victory Committee. As in the Marc Rich case, the president gave no indication that he relied on the Justice Department’s vetting process before extending clemency to a benefactor. Mr. Trump’s use of presidential pardon powers smacks more flagrantly of cronyism than that of his predecessors, according to Chris Cillizza at CNN. Past presidents have pardoned or commuted the sentences of those in their social circles, and many have done so more frequently than Mr. Trump, he says. “But no past president has been as transparently transactional in doling out clemency than Trump. Friend? Friend of a friend? Famous? You’ve got a very good chance of being considered for a pardon in Trump world,” he writes, pointing as an example to the case of Alice Marie Johnson, whose sentence Mr. Trump commuted at the request of Kim Kardashian West. This episode of clemency could portend pardons for Michael Flynn, Roger Stone, Paul Manafort and others implicated in the Mueller investigation, writes Jennifer Rubin in The Washington Post. “Trump wants vindication and secrecy, so what better way than to direct senators not to hear evidence of his own misdeeds, delegitimize the convictions of his associates and then, by pardon, obtain their silence and gratitude?” The corollary of pardoning friends is punishing enemies, adds Jeffrey Toobin in The New Yorker: “The point of authoritarianism is to concentrate power in the ruler, so the world knows that all actions, good and bad, harsh and generous, come from a single source,” he writes. “That’s the real lesson — a story of creeping authoritarianism — of today’s commutations and pardons by President Trump.” “This is the second time in half a century that a lawless chief executive has tested the nation’s fundamental constitutional design,” The New York Times editorial board writes. “The first time, we passed. But now we know that the mechanisms put in place after Watergate were not sufficient.” And Mr. Trump’s pardons aren’t just for white-collar crimes, as Adam Serwer has pointed out on Twitter. In November, for example, the president cleared three service members who were accused or convicted of war crimes. “The bigger issue here,” Mr. Serwer asserted, “is that Trump uses pardons to destigmatize the types of crimes he and his allies are accused of, while pursing the harshest possible punishments against poor, black and brown people, and rewarding others who commit crimes against the same groups.” Mr. Greenwald and Mr. Serwer had the following exchange on Twitter: Mr. Milken’s pardon, at least, was legitimate, argues The Wall Street Journal editorial board. In its view, Mr. Milken was one of the great financial innovators of the 20th century, as well as a philanthropist, having contributed millions to cancer research. When he was convicted, “the political air was also thick with a desire to punish the wealthy. Such vapors are easy to ride, but they don’t equate with justice,” the board writes. “In the long run of history, Mike Milken has done more good for more people with his financial innovations and philanthropy than all the scribes of envy politics ever will.” Many have also argued that the punishment of Rod Blagojevich — the former Illinois governor who was convicted of essentially selling Barack Obama’s former Senate seat and whose sentence Mr. Trump also commuted — was excessive for the sort of crime that many politicians have committed, as Benjamin Hart writes for New York magazine. Irrespective of Mr. Trump, the American criminal justice system could benefit from more clemency, the Times columnist David Leonhardt writes. “Clemency is rarely an easy decision for a president or governor, because it involves freeing somebody convicted of breaking society’s rules, sometimes violently so,” he says. “But in a legal system that errs far too often on the side of harshness, clemency is vital. It’s a way to correct abuses, albeit one case at a time, until true criminal justice reform can occur.” And clemency must extend to white-collar criminals, even to people like Bernie Madoff, if mass incarceration is to end, writes Colleen P. Eren. “If our societal goal is to reduce incarceration, we are going to have to confront the inconvenient truth that retribution cannot be our only penological aim, and justice for victims has to be much more extensive than the incarceration of those who have caused them harm,” she writes. “We desperately need to shift our cultural impulse to punish harshly and degradingly, and for long periods.” Do you have a point of view we missed?

I think I can live with that.” Will from New York (via email): “Virtually all voices you cited who had positive views of Bloomberg would generally be described as conservative-centrists or conservatives. I think their sense of the pulse of this country is almost comically flawed.” Constance from New York: “As a New York City public employee, I worked under Mayor Bloomberg. Yes, he is an authoritarian and no, he doesn’t like organized labor. Ask any of us who had to wait until Mayor de Blasio to settle a contract he stiffed us teachers on in his third term. … We don’t need another anti-union, New York billionaire for President! If Bloomberg gets the Democratic nomination, I will cross over as a Democrat and vote Green.”",The New York Times
2020,Opinion | Trump Got His Wish. Mexico Is Now the Wall.,"The American immigration system needs a complete makeover, but López Obrador’s government shouldn’t act as an extension of the Border Patrol. Mr. Ramos is a contributing opinion writer and an anchor for the Univision network. Mexico is now the wall. President Trump got his wish. The heart-wrenching images documenting a recent confrontation in the state of Chiapas, near the border with Guatemala, are evidence of this. Dozens of Mexican National Guard troops equipped with helmets, batons and transparent shields coalesced on the highway connecting the Mexican cities of Ciudad Hidalgo and Tapachula to stop a caravan of migrants heading to the United States from Central America. The guardsmen used pepper spray on the caravan, which as of mid-January included about 4,000 people, many of them women and children. In the end, hundreds were detained, sent back to Guatemala or deported to Honduras. A spokeswoman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights condemned the actions of the National Guard, saying that the use of force to stop and disperse immigrants should be avoided. Mexico has effectively turned into an extension of Mr. Trump’s immigration police beyond American territory. And this is the case on multiple fronts: On the southern border with Guatemala, they prevent Central American migrants from coming into Mexico; on the northern one, they block those seeking entry to the United States from leaving. The decision of Mexico’s President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, also known as AMLO, to follow this approach is misguided. He should let migrants continue their journey north. Under the Migrant Protection Protocols program, which the Trump administration introduced in January 2019, asylum seekers who attempt to enter the United States at the U.S.-Mexico border may be required to stay in Mexico while the authorities make a decision regarding their case. As of November 2019, over 56,000 people had been sent back to Mexico to wait for the outcome of their applications, according to Human Rights Watch. This is a radical change in immigration policy for the United States. In the past, Central American asylum seekers were allowed to remain on American soil while waiting for their cases to be processed. Central American immigration has always been a source of frustration for the United States. But the most powerful country in the world holds a certain degree of responsibility for what goes on in its hemisphere, and it is perfectly capable of accepting the most vulnerable people on the continent. It has done it before, and can still do it. So when did the United States’ problem become Mexico’s problem? Everything changed because of Donald Trump. By mid-2019, a number of Central American caravans were traveling across Mexico. The president, comparing them to an invasion, warned Mexico that they should do something to stop them, and that he would slap tariffs on all Mexican imports if it didn’t. “Their right to make a living, to not be abused, to be protected, helped, and supported should be safeguarded,” Mr. López Obrador, then president-elect, said in October 2018 of the Central American migrants heading north. Unfortunately, he has since backtracked, pulling back on his promises to the migrants. When a journalist asked him during one of his daily news conferences about the harassment and intimidation of Central American migrants in southern Mexico, AMLO refused to take the victims’ side. And Kenneth T. Cuccinelli II, acting deputy secretary of Homeland Security, said that the Trump administration had seen more cooperation from Mexico “than anyone thought was possible.” Mr. Cuccinelli is right. Over a year ago, few would have thought that a leftist president like AMLO (author of a critical book titled “Oye, Trump” and defender of Central Americans crossing Mexico) would suddenly become Mr. Trump’s main ally in immigration matters. Mr. López Obrador has said that he favors a “peace and love” policy toward the United States and will avoid confrontation with Mr. Trump. There’s nothing wrong with wanting a good relationship with a powerful neighbor who also happens to be your main trade partner. But we should also remember that Mexico has been exporting immigrants to the United States for decades. Millions of us live on American soil. That’s why I am surprised by the indifference shown by so many Mexicans over the abuses of the National Guard and the vicious attacks on social media aimed at Central Americans. Those xenophobic comments remind me of those I have been hearing for decades here in the United States, and of the appalling mistreatment of Mexican immigrants in recent years. Such abuses should not be forgotten or used to justify a similar treatment of migrants in Mexico. Northward migration is hardly a new phenomenon. For decades it has provided the United States with a much-needed labor force, and the migrants and refugees who put everything on the line to make the journey with an opportunity to improve their lives. I am fully aware that the American immigration system is far from perfect. It is in dire need of a complete makeover. But Mexico shouldn’t be an extension of the Border Patrol. That makes things worse for everybody. What should Mexico be doing with migrants from Central America? Just let them go through and protect them as they do so, instead of repressing them. They are fleeing extreme poverty and gang violence. Their only hope is to get to the United States. The Trump administration, not the López Obrador administration, should be receiving them and deciding whether they should be granted political asylum.

2020,"Trump Grants Clemency to Blagojevich, Milken and Kerik","The president also pardoned or commuted the sentences of eight others on Tuesday, including Edward DeBartolo, a former owner of the San Francisco 49ers. WASHINGTON — President Trump, citing what he said was advice from friends and business associates, granted clemency on Tuesday to a who’s who of white-collar criminals from politics, sports and business who were convicted on charges involving fraud, corruption and lies — including the financier Michael R. Milken. The president pardoned Mr. Milken, the so-called junk bond king of the 1980s, as well as the former New York City police commissioner Bernard B. Kerik and Edward J. DeBartolo Jr., a former owner of the San Francisco 49ers. He also commuted the sentence of Rod R. Blagojevich, a former Democratic governor of Illinois. Their political and finance schemes made them household names, and three received prison terms while Mr. DeBartolo paid a $1 million fine. Mr. Trump also pardoned David Safavian, the top federal procurement official under President George W. Bush, who had been sentenced in 2009 to a year in prison for lying about his ties to the lobbyist Jack Abramoff and obstructing the sprawling investigation into Mr. Abramoff’s efforts to win federal business. The president also granted clemency to six other people. Mr. Trump has repeatedly stated his commitment to a criminal justice overhaul and addressing the excessive sentences given to minorities. At the urging of Kim Kardashian West in 2018, he pardoned Alice Marie Johnson, a 63-year-old African-American woman serving a life sentence for a nonviolent drug conviction. Ms. Johnson was the centerpiece of a TV ad the Trump campaign ran this month during the Super Bowl. But the president’s announcements on Tuesday were mostly aimed at wiping clean the slates of rich, powerful and well-connected white men. And they came after years of sophisticated public relations campaigns aimed at persuading Mr. Trump to exercise the authority given to him under the Constitution. Patti Blagojevich, the wife of the former Illinois governor, frequently appeared on Fox News calling for Mr. Trump to commute her husband’s sentence. Mr. Kerik, a regular on Fox News, appeared on the network as recently as Monday night. Mr. Milken has sought to rebrand himself as a philanthropist in recent years as allies campaigned on his behalf for a pardon. In conversations with his advisers, Mr. Trump has also raised the prospect of commuting the sentence of Roger J. Stone Jr., his longtime adviser, who was convicted in November of seven felony charges, including tampering with a witness and lying under oath in order to obstruct a congressional inquiry into whether the Trump campaign conspired with Russia to influence the 2016 election. Asked about a pardon for Mr. Stone on Tuesday, Mr. Trump insisted that “I haven’t given it any thought.” Democrats pounced on the president’s announcements. “Today, Trump granted clemency to tax cheats, Wall Street crooks, billionaires and corrupt government officials,” said Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont, the leading Democratic candidate for president. “Meanwhile, thousands of poor and working-class kids sit in jail for nonviolent drug convictions. This is what a broken and racist criminal justice system looks like.” Representative Bill Pascrell Jr., Democrat of New Jersey, said in a statement that the president abused the pardon power by using it to reward friends and repair the reputations of felons who do not deserve it. “The pardoning of these disgraced figures should be treated as another national scandal by a lawless executive,” he said. But Mr. Trump defended his grants of clemency on Tuesday. He was particularly critical of the 14-year prison sentence for Mr. Blagojevich, who was convicted of trying when he was governor of Illinois to essentially sell the Senate seat vacated by Barack Obama when he became president. Mr. Blagojevich also once appeared on the reality TV series “The Celebrity Apprentice,” which Mr. Trump hosted. “That was a tremendously powerful, ridiculous sentence, in my opinion,” Mr. Trump said after announcing that Mr. Blagojevich would go free after serving eight years. The president alleged that the former governor was a victim of the same forces that investigated him for years, citing James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, and Patrick Fitzgerald, the U.S. attorney in Chicago who prosecuted Mr. Blagojevich. “It was a prosecution by the same people — Comey, Fitzpatrick, the same group,” Mr. Trump told reporters, misstating Mr. Fitzgerald’s name. Mr. Trump gave no indication that he relied on the usual vetting process that guides presidents making use of their constitutional authority to wipe away criminal convictions or commute prison sentences. Traditionally, the Justice Department’s pardons office would make recommendations about pardons and commutations to the deputy attorney general, who would weigh in and then pass the department’s final determinations to the White House. Instead, Mr. Trump told reporters that he followed “recommendations” in making his decisions. Those recommendations, according to a White House statement, came from the president’s longtime friends, business executives, celebrities, campaign donors, sports figures and political allies. In pardoning Mr. Kerik, who pleaded guilty to tax fraud and lying to the government, Mr. Trump said he heard from more than a dozen people, including Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York mayor and Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer; Geraldo Rivera, a Fox TV personality; and Eddie Gallagher, a former Navy SEAL and accused war criminal whose demotion was overturned by Mr. Trump last year. Mr. Kerik had a pardon application pending and Mr. Blagojevich had a commutation application pending, but a source close to the pardons office did not believe that the pardon attorney had given either of those applications full-throated support. Mr. Milken, whose dealings contributed to the collapse of the savings-and-loan industry, fought for decades to reverse his conviction for securities fraud. Richard LeFrak, a billionaire real estate magnate and longtime friend; Sheldon G. Adelson, a prominent Republican donor; and Nelson Peltz, a billionaire investor who hosted a $10 million fund-raiser for the president’s 2020 campaign on Saturday, were among those who suggested that Mr. Trump pardon him. Mr. Milken did not have a pardon or commutation application pending at the Justice Department’s pardons office, meaning that the president made that decision entirely without official Justice Department input. Two previous applications had been denied and closed. The football greats Jerry Rice and Joe Montana — as well as the singer-songwriter Paul Anka — urged the president to pardon Mr. DeBartolo, who pleaded guilty in 1998 to concealing an extortion attempt. Mr. DeBartolo avoided prison but was fined $1 million and was suspended for a year by the N.F.L. He later handed over the 49ers to his sister Denise DeBartolo York. transcript “We have commuted the sentence of Rod Blagojevich. He served eight years in jail — it’s a long time. And I watched his wife on television. I don’t know him very well. I met him a couple of times — he was on, for a short while, on ‘The Apprentice’ years ago. Seemed like a very nice person. Don’t know him. But he served eight years in jail — has a long time to go. Many people disagree with the sentence — he’s a Democrat, he’s not a Republican. It was a prosecution by the same people: Comey, Fitzpatrick, the same group.” Reporter: “Are you planning to pardon Roger Stone?” “I haven’t given it any thought. In the meantime, he’s going through a process. But I think he’s been treated very unfairly.” “You have to see the recommendations,” Mr. Trump said on Tuesday before boarding Air Force One for a four-day trip to the West Coast, where he was scheduled to hold three campaign rallies. “I rely on recommendations.” Previous presidents have often waited until the final moments of their presidencies to wield the pardon power on behalf of their friends. President Bill Clinton pardoned Marc Rich, a hedge fund manager and financier who was convicted of tax evasion and other crimes, on Jan. 20, 2001, Mr. Clinton’s last day in office. Others, including Mr. Bush and Mr. Obama, largely reserved their clemency authority for people convicted of nonviolent, low-level drug crimes and other offenses who were identified as part of a rigorous process run by a team of Justice Department lawyers. Mr. Trump, however, has shrugged off those traditions and the controversy that sometimes comes with the use of the pardon power. He issued a “full and unconditional pardon” to Joe Arpaio, the Arizona sheriff and immigration hard-liner convicted of contempt of court, in August 2017. Less than a year later, he did the same for I. Lewis Libby Jr., a former aide to Mr. Bush who was convicted of obstructing justice and perjury. In addition to helping erase the convictions of the well connected and powerful, Mr. Trump also pardoned on Tuesday a tech executive who pleaded guilty to conspiracy, the owner of a construction company who underpaid his taxes and a woman convicted of stealing cars. The president also commuted the sentences of a woman convicted of drug distribution, another woman who was part of a marijuana smuggling ring and a minority-owner of a health care company who was sentenced to 35 years for a scheme to defraud the government. Their relative anonymity was a sharp contrast to the prominence of the four men highlighted by the president. Mr. Milken, who was credited in the 1980s with using junk bonds to finance big debt-laden corporate buyouts, pleaded guilty to securities reporting violations and tax offenses, and the Securities and Exchange Commission banned him for life. The investigation came to highlight that decade’s corporate excesses on Wall Street. In the years since his conviction, Mr. Milken has emerged as a major cancer philanthropist and is the founder of the Milken Institute, a nonpartisan think tank that holds a popular conference in Los Angeles that convenes the world’s most powerful people in government, industry and finance. Mr. Kerik, a police detective, served as Mr. Giuliani’s bodyguard and chauffeur during the 1993 mayoral race and later served in a series of high-ranking positions in New York City’s Department of Correction. Eventually, Mr. Giuliani named Mr. Kerik correction commissioner in 1997 and police commissioner in 2000. In 2004, Mr. Kerik’s bid to become homeland security secretary in the Bush cabinet collapsed amid scandals. In June 2006, he pleaded guilty in State Supreme Court in the Bronx to two misdemeanors tied to renovations done on his apartment. Four years later, Mr. Kerik pleaded guilty to tax fraud and making false statements. Mr. DeBartolo presided over the golden era of the 49ers when the team won five Super Bowl championships under the coach Bill Walsh, with legendary players like Mr. Montana, Steve Young, Ronnie Lott and Mr. Rice. Mr. DeBartolo was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2016 despite his conviction. But in the late 1990s, Mr. DeBartolo was an investor in the Hollywood Casino Corp., a Dallas company seeking permission for a riverboat casino in Louisiana. On March 12, 1997, he met Edwin W. Edwards, the influential former governor of Louisiana, for lunch in California and handed over $400,000 that Mr. Edwards had demanded for his help in securing a license. The next day, the Gaming Board granted it. A month later, federal agents raided Mr. Edwards’s house and office, seizing the $400,000. “Why do it? It actually was just plain stupidity, and I should have just walked away from it,” Mr. DeBartolo told NFL Films for a biographical documentary in 2012. “I was as much to blame because I was old enough to know better and too stupid to do anything about it.” Michael D. Shear reported from Washington, and Maggie Haberman from New York.

2020,Trump Hails Acquittal and Lashes Out at His ‘Evil’ and ‘Corrupt’ Opponents,"As President Trump renewed his attacks on Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Democrats, his press secretary threatened payback against them. transcript We’ve been going through this now for over three years. It was evil. It was corrupt, it was dirty cops. It was leakers and liars, and this should never, ever happen to another president, ever. I don’t know that other presidents would have been able to take it. Some people said, no they wouldn’t have. But I can tell you at a minimum, you have to focus on this because it can get away very quickly, no matter who you have with you. It can get away very quickly. So I have always said they’re lousy politicians, but they do two things: They’re vicious and mean — vicious. These people are vicious. Adam Schiff is a vicious, horrible person. Nancy Pelosi is a horrible person, and she wanted to impeach a long time ago. When she said, “I pray for the president. I pray for the president —” she doesn’t pray. She may pray, but she prays for the opposite. But I doubt she prays at all. So I just want to thank my family for sticking through it. This was not part of the deal. And Mitch McConnell, I want to tell you, you did a fantastic job. WASHINGTON — President Trump and his Republican allies focused on exacting payback against his political opponents on Thursday after his acquittal in his Senate impeachment trial, signaling that the conflict that has consumed Washington for months may only escalate rather than recede. Choosing retaliation over reconciliation, Mr. Trump lashed out at Democrats and the one Republican senator who voted for conviction. He turned a prayer breakfast into a launching pad for political attacks and then staged a long, rambling venting session at the White House where he denounced “evil” and “crooked” lawmakers and the “top scum” at the F.B.I. for trying to take him down. Mr. Trump’s team indicated that his desire to turn the tables on his foes may go beyond just tough language. The White House press secretary declared that Democrats “should pay for” impeaching the president, and the Trump administration worked to facilitate a Senate Republican investigation of Hunter Biden, the son of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the goal of Mr. Trump that was at the heart of his impeachment. “It was evil,” Mr. Trump said of the investigations that led to his Senate trial in an hourlong stream-of-consciousness address to supporters in the East Room of the White House, tossing aside the more calibrated text prepared by his staff. “It was corrupt. It was dirty cops. It was leakers and liars, and this should never ever happen to another president, ever. I don’t know that other presidents would have been able to take it.” Democrats showed little sign of backing down either. House Democrats have already said they are likely to resume their investigation into Mr. Trump’s efforts to pressure Ukraine to incriminate the Bidens, while a Senate Democrat on Thursday called for an inquiry into whether the administration covered up related information by improperly classifying it. Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who sat just feet from Mr. Trump as he questioned her faith during the annual National Prayer Breakfast, later pushed back against his implication that she was disingenuous for saying she prayed for him. Some of his remarks, she said, were “particularly without class” and “so inappropriate at a prayer breakfast.” She also suggested that Mr. Trump appeared to be on medication during his State of the Union address on Tuesday. “He looked to me like he was a little sedated,” she told reporters. “Looked that way last year, too.” Mr. Trump’s vituperative performance on Thursday was the diametrical opposite of how President Bill Clinton responded to his own acquittal after a Senate impeachment trial in 1999. On the day he was cleared of charges of perjury and obstruction of justice, Mr. Clinton appeared alone in the Rose Garden, said he was “profoundly sorry” and called for “reconciliation and renewal.” His Republican opponents at the time were just as eager to move on, feeling burned after losing seats in midterm elections and watching not one but two of their House speakers step down. One important difference is that Mr. Clinton was in his second term, while Mr. Trump is seeking re-election in a campaign framed in part by the impeachment debate. For Mr. Trump, the Senate’s rejection of the two articles of impeachment against him on Wednesday was marred by the fact that Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah, was the only senator to break rank, joining every Democrat in voting to convict Mr. Trump for abuse of power. Angry at Mr. Romney’s defection, Mr. Trump waited a day to appear in person with supporters in the East Room in a ceremony that veered between celebration and confrontation. Mr. Trump held up a copy of The Washington Post to show its banner headline, “Trump Acquitted,” then reviewed the long litany of investigations against him over the last three years, dismissing them as partisan efforts to stop him from serving as president. “We first went through Russia, Russia, Russia,” he said, mocking the investigations into the Kremlin’s interference in the 2016 presidential election on his behalf and ties between his campaign and Moscow. “It was all bullshit,” he said, the first time he or any president has been known to use that profanity in a formal event on camera in the East Room, according to Factba.se, a research service. transcript From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” Today: President Trump has undertaken a campaign of retribution against those who crossed him during the impeachment inquiry and favors for those who have tried to protect him. Peter Baker on the post-acquittal presidency. It’s Friday, February 14. [HORNS] Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States. Peter, I want to begin with retribution. How does that start? Well, thank you very much, everybody. Wow. The day after his acquittal in the Senate, the president gathers people in the East Room of the White House for an event. It’s not quite a press conference. It’s not quite a speech. It’s really kind of a mix, a mix of a celebration of his acquittal but a venting session of his grievances. I want to start by thanking some of — and I call them friends, because you develop friendships and relationships when you’re in battle and war. And he wants to thank the people who stood behind him, names them in the audience. Mitch McConnell, I want to tell you, you did a fantastic job. [APPLAUSE] Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader who did more than anybody to secure his acquittal in the trial. And he mentions Jim Jordan — When I first got to know Jim, I said, huh, he never wears a jacket. What the hell’s going on? He’s obviously very proud of his body. [LAUGHTER] — and other members of the House, the Freedom Caucus, the conservative Republicans who always stood by him in the most aggressive and assertive and staunch way. And then, of course, he turns to his enemies. The people he blames for his ordeal, the people he thinks have treated him so unfairly, have plotted against him, been disloyal or what have you. And he names ones that you would expect, of course. Nancy Pelosi is a horrible person. Nancy Pelosi, he says she’s a horrible person. A corrupt politician named Adam Schiff made up my statement to the Ukrainian president. He brought it out of thin air — just made it up. They say he’s a screenwriter, a failed screenwriter. He names, of course, Adam Schiff, the lead House prosecutor. And then you have some that used religion as a crutch. They never used it before. He names Mitt Romney, the Republican, the only Republican senator to vote for conviction. But, you know, it’s a failed presidential candidate, so things can happen when you fail so badly running for president. These two now, of course, are really at odds. And you see the visceral anger in the president in this moment. And he mentions Colonel Alexander Vindman, a member of his own staff, a detailee from the Pentagon working on Ukraine issues, and his twin brother Yevgeny Vindman, who also works at the N.S.C. staff. He says it almost in passing. Lieutenant Colonel Vindman and his twin brother, right? And he says it with such dripping disdain in his voice. You’d get the sense immediately, of course, that this is somebody who’s really angry at the president, and he’s got his attention. And remind us what puts Vindman in this list of enemies. Colonel Vindman was one of the members of the White House staff, the National Security Council staff who were subpoenaed by the House to testify in the impeachment inquiry. He didn’t come forward voluntarily. He was required to by law to give his testimony to the committee. And during his testimony, he told about being on the famous July 25 call between the president and President Zelensky of Ukraine when the president asked him to investigate Joe Biden and the Democrats. And Colonel Vindman told the committee that he thought that was inappropriate, and he reported it to his superiors at the N.S.C. And for that, he has been on the target list of President Trump and his allies ever since. Painted as disloyal, painted as even treasonous to the country. His patriotism questioned even though he’s a decorated veteran of the Iraq War, injured in battle, and really, a kind of a symbol to both sides of sort of where this fight has evolved. Our country is just respected again, and it’s an honor to be with the people in this room. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. And so he comes to the end of this sort of rambling, meandering talk that goes on for an hour and two minutes. And you get the sense that this is not the end and that there’s more to come. Well, President Trump has begun his revenge in the wake of his impeachment trial. Colonel Vindman, the same witness he had just talked about so dismissively at the East Room event finds himself escorted out of the White House by security guards and told his services are no longer needed — Wow. — exiled back to the Pentagon from which he came. Not just him — Escorted out of his job and off the White House grounds, as was his twin brother, who was also assigned to the N.S.C. His brother Yevgeny Vindman — who didn’t do anything, had nothing to do with the impeachment hearings at all, except to show up and sit behind his brother just as a matter of family support — also dismissed from his post at the National Security Council, marched out at the same time by security and sent back to the Pentagon. Today, Vindman’s lawyer issued a statement saying, quote, “The truth has cost him his job, his career and his privacy.” You can understand why a president might not want somebody on his staff who had testified an impeachment hearing against him. But it was handled in a way that was meant to maximize the public message, right? I’ll tell you what I mean by that. The N.S.C. is currently undergoing a downsizing. And in fact, the plan was to move Colonel Vindman out as part of that, or at least to use that as the cover to to say, it’s not about reprisal. It’s not about his role in impeachment. It’s just part of this overall restructuring. And that’s frankly how other presidents might have handled a situation like that. Come up with a rationale. Come up with a rationale, come up with a public face-saving kind of storyline, a narrative, at least, that even though people would see through it, would at least have the veneer of looking professional rather than vindictive. That was not what the president wanted. He made sure they did this separate from that reorganization. They did not explain it as part of that reorganization. And they did not deny when we called them that day that this was what it looked like, which was, of course, an act of retribution. OK, so what happens next? Well, we thought that was the story for the day, these two brothers being marched out of there. Right. And then we discover as the evening arrives that it’s not over. Now we’re getting word that the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, he is out as well. Gordon Sondland, you may remember him. He was the ambassador to the European Union, who had been deeply involved in the Ukraine pressure campaign, on the phone with the president and required to testify, became a key witness in the House hearings. He said that they were operating on the order of the president himself. He said that it was clearly a quid pro quo, and he said that everyone was in the loop. Suddenly, it turns out he’s out as well. Now, as with Vindman, there was a way to do this that would have minimized the public kerfuffle. Gordon Sondland actually was ready to leave. He had told his superiors at the State Department that he was ready to step down on his own. And he got word that Friday you have to resign today, they told him. But he says, no. I don’t want to resign on the same day that you’re pushing out these Vindmans as if I’m part of some sort of purge. Wow. If you want me today, you’re going to have to fire me. And they called back and said, OK, you’re fired. So at this point, it’s clear that this is a vindictive purge of anyone who did anything that put the president in a negative light during the impeachment process. And what is the reaction to that, that very clear and deliberate message from the president inside Washington? Certainly among Democrats, even among a few Republicans who say what’s the message you’re sending? If you respond to a subpoena, as ordered by the law, and you give your testimony, you shouldn’t be punished for doing that. The president’s view is, why should I have people I can’t trust working for me? It’s my right as the president to have a staff that serves my interests that I believe is loyal. And he’s made clear that loyalty is a number one when it comes to this president. There’s no other quality that matters more to him. And, Peter, as somebody who’s covered many White Houses, is he right about that? Is it ultimately a presidential prerogative to decide if someone testified against you, that, you know, you no longer want them around, you don’t want them in those jobs anymore, especially presidential appointments? It’s a good question, right? Because it does feel like it would be untenable to have testified and provided damaging testimony against the president, and then come to work every day afterwards. You would think, in fact, you might not want to necessarily do that. But the question isn’t what’s the right place then for that person to work. The question is what the message the president is trying to send by what he’s doing, right? Right. This president has made a point of making sure everybody knows these people are out, and they’re out because of him and because he will not tolerate disloyalty. OK, so that is the campaign of retribution so far, post acquittal, which brings us to the campaign of protection for the president’s allies. Right. It’s not enough just to go after his perceived enemies. Now it’s time to do something to protect his friends. And for him, this is going to start with a colorful character and longtime friend and adviser named Roger Stone, who’s about to go to prison. We’ll be right back. So, Peter, before we get to how the president is trying to protect Roger Stone, remind us who Roger Stone is. Roger Stone has been in American politics going back decades. He is somebody who calls himself a dirty trickster. I’m certainly guilty of bluffing and posturing and punking the Democrats. Unless they pass some law against [BLEEP] and I missed it, I’m engaging in tradecraft. It’s politics. He’s a self-proclaimed fan of Richard Nixon. Even to this day, he has a Richard Nixon tattoo. Right. He’s somebody who’s involved early on in some of the Reagan and Dole campaigns, but over the years kind of drifted off into the side, really kind of more of a fringe character, a conspiracy theorist, a provocateur. In 1980, Stone began a lobbying firm with Paul Manafort that unapologetically catered to human rights abusers. He has these maxims on how he conducts his political strategy. One of his rules is never turn down an opportunity to have sex or be on television. We’ve seen a lot of colorful characters in the world of political consulting, none more colorful than Roger Stone. And that is the most charitable adjective you can apply to the single weirdest man possibly in the history of political consulting. He’d been friends for years with Donald Trump. And like Roger Stone, Trump comes from the outside, right? He was not part of the Republican establishment. But suddenly, he’s powering forward toward a presidential bid. And he brings with him people like Roger Stone, who had not been in the center of American politics now for years. Right. And my recollection is that it’s during that campaign that Roger Stone gets into very significant trouble. Right. He becomes wrapped up in the whole story about the Russian hacking of the Democratic emails. Hillary Clinton’s campaign dealing with more email problems. The email account of campaign chairman John Podesta was hacked and many of the emails released. Things he said gave the impression that he might have known about it in advance. Right. So were you surprised when John Podesta’s emails came out, as you seemed to predict ahead of time? I was interested, like the rest of the country. Were you surprised? No, I wouldn’t say that I was surprised. And that puts him right in the heart of this. Is he a link between the Trump campaign and Russia through perhaps WikiLeaks, which is the cutout that the Russians used to get these emails out. And so, once the president wins and comes into office, his friend Roger Stone finds himself under investigation for what he knew and when he knew it. And then Congress jumps in. They call Stone to testify at the House Intelligence Committee. And this is where he really gets into trouble. We had a very frank exchange. I answered all of the questions. I made the case that the accusation that I knew about John Podesta’s email hack in advance was false, that I knew about the content and source of the WikiLeaks disclosures regarding Hillary Clinton was false. He starts telling things that are demonstrably not true. And he ultimately ends up getting charged with lying to Congress. He also tries to get an associate of his to not tell the truth, threatens him even, threatens to kill his dog. Whoa. And he was put on trial. And last fall Roger Stone was convicted of seven crimes, seven felonies, including lying to Congress and witness intimidation. And these are conditions on very serious charges of obstructing a congressional investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. That’s right. I remember thinking when that happened, like, whoa. This is the big leagues for Roger Stone. Exactly. And the question is, why is he lying? Why is he obstructing? Is he trying to protect the president? This is how this all fits together, right? This goes back to the whole Russian interference. This goes back to the Mueller probe. This goes back to the things that have dominated this presidency for three years and frustrated this president for three years. So he sees Roger Stone’s conviction as an illegitimate shot at him, at himself, the president. A way of trying to take him down because they couldn’t take him down any other way. OK. So Peter, how does the president try to protect Stone after this conviction? So even as he’s in the middle of this campaign of retribution against the Vindman brothers and Gordon Sondland, he is increasingly aware that the sentencing for Roger Stone is coming up. And then, when Monday comes around and the prosecutors present their recommendation for a sentence to the court, the prosecutors ask for seven to nine years behind bars. That’s the normal sentence that would be required under the sentencing guidelines passed by Congress for crimes of the type that Roger Stone was convicted of. So they didn’t go outside of those guidelines. They simply said we want to sentence him to what the guidelines say. That doesn’t mean the judge would go along with it, but that was their recommendation. Well, that set the president off. The president expressed his outrage on Twitter, calling it a very unfair situation, adding, “Cannot allow this miscarriage of justice!” In the middle of the night, he starts sending out tweets, angry tweets. How can this happen? Nine years, this is outrageous. And they’re going after him. How come they don’t go after my enemies but they go after him? And that just sort of sets the town ablaze. Controversy in the nation’s capital now over a sentencing recommendation for President Trump’s longtime friend Roger Stone. Here’s a president weighing in directly on a court case involving a friend of his. This is something that we have not seen really since Watergate. Presidents don’t, especially publicly, weigh in on prosecutions of people that they are personally connected to, at least except in the venue of issuing pardons at some point, which they sometimes do. So this has shocked a lot of people. But what really shocked a lot of people in Washington was when they woke up a few hours later on Tuesday and they saw not only these tweets, but they saw that the attorney general of the United States, Bill Barr, had essentially overruled the career prosecutors. Breaking news involving President Trump. A stunning reversal in the sentencing recommendation for Trump confidant Roger Stone. And said, no, we’re not going to ask for a sentence this heavy. We’re going to ask for something lighter. So not seven to nine years, something less. Not seven to nine years, something less. It doesn’t specify what, but something below what the guidelines would normally call for. And so this is causing a huge furor in the U.S. attorney’s office in Washington. What is going on? President Trump knows how to get away with stuff when we’re not watching. The four career prosecutors who worked on the Stone case, all four of them, quit. We’re following some truly stunning, breaking news, still developing by the minute this hour. Federal prosecutors in the Roger Stone criminal case have resigned this afternoon. One after the other. One, two, three, four, just like that. This does not happen. Prosecutors don’t resign just days before they go to sentencing after a case that they’ve worked so hard on. One of them actually quits his job altogether, leaves the Justice Department as a whole. In protest. Well, they don’t say it, but that’s the obvious conclusion. Yes, they’re protesting the overruling of their recommendation. And I think that they felt like they had an ethical obligation. If they had told the court this is the sentence we think is appropriate, and then suddenly a day later the same department is coming and saying, no, we don’t — how is that tenable for them to continue on that case? And, Peter, given what has just happened — the firing of Vindman, Sondland, Vindman’s brother — what is the reaction to this intervention? Not just the retribution, but this protection? Well, in effect, the Democrats are saying we told you so, right? No serious person believes President Trump has learned any lesson. He doesn’t learn any lessons. He does just what he wants, what suits his ego at the moment. Senator Schumer, the Democratic leader in the upper chamber goes to the floor and gives a pretty passionate speech in which he says that the natural consequence of acquitting the president on the Ukraine matter means that he feels completely unleashed and empowered to do whatever he thinks is right for his own political interests. We are witnessing a crisis in the rule of law in America, unlike one we have ever seen before. It’s a crisis of President Trump’s making, but it was enabled and emboldened by every Senate Republican. Even amongst some Republicans, you’re seeing you know some discomfort, particularly among moderate Republicans who tried to give the president the benefit of the doubt by standing with him in the impeachment trial. A couple of them had said even, well, maybe he’ll have learned a lesson from all of this and he’ll be more measured, he’ll be more restrained in the future and that that would be a good thing. Well, what you’re hearing a lot of people saying is that doesn’t seem to be the case. And I think that the question going forward is going to be, is it just a burst of energy and lashing out in the days after the acquittal, or is this the beginning of a month’s long recalibration of his administration? What is he going to do going forward? Right. Is this the post-aquittal presidency, one in which enemies are punished and allies are at all costs protected? Right, exactly. And that the instruments of government are to serve the president’s interests, not just the public’s interests. Peter, what you have described here is what an old school political terms might be called a strategy of carrots and sticks, but on steroids, right? You protect those who have done right by you, and you punish those who have somehow wronged you. And in the case of the president, that “steroided up” strategy clearly worked when it came to impeachment. And we talked to you. We talked to many of our colleagues about the fact that there was genuine fear of crossing this president, and that that influenced how the Senate voted in the impeachment trial. So if this strategy is working — and by all accounts, it is working — why shouldn’t the president keep it up? Well, it’s a great question. I think one of the things we’ve learned about the last three years is that the norms, the standards, the lines that we used to think of that constrained a president were more aspirational and conceptual than they were legal. You go look. You go back far enough, you’re going to find plenty of presidents who punished their enemies and protected their friends. But in the post-Watergate period in particular, when we put in new guardrails, we put a new laws, we put in new systems, we thought that that had been minimized at the very least, right? That, yeah, you’re going to probably give an appointment to somebody who’s been good to you. And you’re going to maybe take away a grant from the state of somebody who crossed you on a vote. These things happen. They happen under any presidency. This is that, as you put it, on steroids. And it’s overt. It’s right out there in the open. He wants everybody to know what he’s doing. He wants everybody to understand. You are loyal to this president or you should get out. And that’s true of people in government. That’s true of people even in Congress. He’s made very clear that the Republican Party has no room for anybody who is not on his side. You’re either in his camp or you’re not. And, of course, there’s a larger context here, which is we’re in the middle of a presidential election. And I wonder how this behavior by the president fits into his re-election strategy. You say that all this fits into a broader approach by this presidential politics. It’s not about unifying. It’s about dividing. It’s about us versus them. And this is what the appeal is to his constituents. It is: I am fighting for you. And they are trying to stop me. It’s the deep state, it’s the Democrats, it’s the fake news media. They’re all trying to stop me, and by extension, you. And that’s why you should stick with me in this election this fall. So this idea that Washington is all alarmed by retributions and protections of friends because it violates norms doesn’t hurt his appeal to many of his voters out there, because it’s part of this larger argument that he’s making. And the larger argument is I am a force of disruption. I am a force that is shaking things up. And the reason why you’re seeing things in the news that are bad about me is because they’re fighting back. And you should stay with me because it’s not just me. It’s about you too. Peter, thank you. OK, thank you. On Thursday, in an interview with ABC News, Attorney General Bill Barr said that the president’s interference in cases like Roger Stone’s was making it all but impossible for him to run the Department of Justice. To have public statements and tweets made about the department, about people in the department, our men and women here, about cases pending in the department and about judges before whom we have cases, make it impossible for me to do my job and to assure the courts and the prosecutors and the department that we’re doing our work with integrity. But Barr did not directly criticize the president, and confirmed in the interview that he had overruled prosecutors to recommend a more lenient sentence for Stone. We’ll be right back. Here’s what else you need to know today. Are there any senators in the chamber wishing to change their vote? If not, the yeas are 55, the nays are 45. The joint resolution as amended is passed. On Thursday, a bipartisan majority in the Senate passed a resolution requiring President Trump to seek authorization from Congress before taking further military action against Iran. The legislation, which was already passed by the House, is an unusual move to restrain presidential power and reflected the growing unease within Congress over Trump’s approach to Iraq, which many fear could lead to all-out war. It follows Trump’s decision six weeks ago to kill Qassim Suleimani, a top Iranian military commander, without the authorization of Congress. “The Daily” is made by Theo Balcomb, Andy Mills, Lisa Tobin, Rachel Quester, Lynsea Garrison, Annie Brown, Clare Toeniskoetter, Paige Cowett, Michael Simon Johnson, Brad Fisher, Larissa Anderson, Wendy Dorr, Chris Wood, Jessica Cheung, Alexandra Leigh Young, Jonathan Wolfe, Lisa Chow, Eric Krupke, Marc Georges, Luke Vander Ploeg, Adizah Eghan, Kelly Prime, Julia Longoria, Donna Summer, Jazmin Aguilera, M.J.

That’s it for “The Daily.” I’m Michael Barbaro. See you on Tuesday after the holiday. The talk included a greatest-hits string of attacks on some of Mr. Trump’s top villains, including the former F.B.I. director James B. Comey (“that sleazebag”), his onetime deputy Andrew G. McCabe, the former F.B.I. officials Lisa Page and Peter Strzok (“two lowlifes”), the former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele, as well as Hunter Biden, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. He called Ms. Pelosi “a horrible person,” Mr. Romney “a failed presidential candidate” who used “religion as a crutch” and Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and the lead House manager, a “corrupt politician.” The president thanked his lawyers and congressional Republicans, praising them one by one for their support. In particular, he highlighted Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader and his most important defender in the Senate. “You did a fantastic job,” Mr. Trump told him. He called out more than a dozen other Republican defenders, including Representatives Kevin McCarthy of California, the minority leader; Jim Jordan of Ohio; Mark Meadows of North Carolina; and Elise Stefanik of New York. Noticeably absent, and unmentioned by the president, were Rudolph W. Giuliani, his personal lawyer at the center of the Ukraine pressure campaign, and Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, one of his most outspoken allies. “This is sort of a day of celebration, because we went through hell,” Mr. Trump said. “But I’m sure they’ll try and cook up other things,” he added of the Democrats, “because instead of wanting to heal our country and fix our country, all they want to do — in my opinion, it’s almost like they want to destroy our country. We can’t let it happen.” In the wake of Mr. Trump’s acquittal, Republican senators pressed their inquiries into Hunter Biden’s finances, seeking to prove that the president was right to insist that Ukraine investigate him and the former vice president. A spokeswoman for Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said the Treasury Department had readily complied with a request by the Republican majority for documents related to Hunter Biden’s business dealings in Ukraine, contrasted with the administration’s refusal to provide papers for the House impeachment inquiry. For their part, Democrats were still seeking investigations, too. Senator Christopher S. Murphy of Connecticut asked the Government Accountability Office to review whether the Trump administration misused classification power to hide information about the president’s Ukraine pressure campaign. And House Democrats have already said they will probably subpoena John R. Bolton, the former national security adviser, to ask about Ukraine. Stephanie Grisham, the White House press secretary, said Democrats should be made to answer for what she called a dishonest attack on Mr. Trump. “Maybe people should pay for that,” she said on Fox News. Asked to elaborate, she equated Mr. Trump with the United States. “People should be held accountable for anything they do to hurt this country and this president,” she said. Mr. Trump’s speech at the National Prayer Breakfast was as overtly political as any president has delivered at the annual event, traditionally a bipartisan affair marked by talk of faith and common ground. He triumphantly held up newspapers reporting his acquittal, cited rising stock markets, boasted about his approval rating and urged the audience to vote in the fall. Mr. Trump’s speech followed a keynote address by Arthur Brooks, a Harvard professor and prominent conservative thinker, who called on Americans to “love your enemies.” At one point, Mr. Brooks asked the audience, “How many of you love somebody with whom you disagree politically?” Hands around the room shot up. “I’m going to round that off to 100 percent,” he said. But Mr. Trump did not raise his hand. “Contempt is ripping our country apart,” Mr. Brooks continued. “We’re like a couple on the rocks in this country.” Without directly mentioning Mr. Trump, Mr. Brooks added: “Ask God to take political contempt from your heart. And sometimes when it’s too hard, ask God to help you fake it.” Mr. Trump made no effort to fake it. “Arthur, I don’t know if I agree with you,” he said when he took the microphone. “I don’t know if Arthur is going to like what I’m going to say.” He then launched into his grievances. “As everybody knows, my family, our great country and your president have been put through a terrible ordeal by some very dishonest and corrupt people,” he said. Without naming them, Mr. Trump singled out Mr. Romney and Ms. Pelosi. “I don’t like people who use their faith as justification for doing what they know is wrong,” Mr. Trump said of Mr. Romney. Then, referring to Ms. Pelosi, he said, “Nor do I like people who say, ‘I pray for you,’ when they know that’s not so.” It was the first time the speaker and the president had appeared together since the State of the Union address, when Mr. Trump refused to shake Ms. Pelosi’s hand before his speech and she ripped up her copy of his speech after he gave it. When Ms. Pelosi gave a short talk at Thursday’s breakfast about the poor and persecuted, Mr. Trump refused to look at her, glowering with undisguised antipathy. By the end of his own speech at the prayer breakfast, Mr. Trump recognized that his message did not fit the love-your-enemies theme. “I apologize. I’m trying to learn,” he said. “It’s not easy. It’s not easy. When they impeach you for nothing, then you’re supposed to like them? It’s not easy, folks. I do my best.” At a news conference later at the Capitol, Ms. Pelosi dismissed Mr. Trump’s comments. “I don’t know if the president understands about prayer,” she told reporters, but said she prays “hard for him because he’s so off the track of our Constitution, our values.” “He really needs our prayers,” she added. “He can say whatever he wants. But I do pray for him.” Reporting was contributed by Sheryl Gay Stolberg, Alan Rappeport, Michael Crowley and Maggie Haberman. Updated Feb. 29, 2020",The New York Times
2020,Trump Sees Commitment to Religious Freedom in India as Riots Break Out,"The president stressed the strength of his relationship with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in meetings long on symbolism and short on concrete agreements. NEW DELHI — In the lush garden of Hyderabad House, President Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi celebrated their friendship and talked of a modern, diverse and unified India. Across town, an explosion of anger over Mr. Modi’s sectarian policies set a neighborhood on edge, leaving a trail of dead bodies and a widening religious rift. The two sides of New Delhi on display on Tuesday underscored the disparity between the hopes of Mr. Trump’s trip and the tensions outside the fortified environs of world leaders. Just miles from the pomp of a presidential visit, a mob of hot-tempered Hindu men wielding iron bars hunted their Muslim neighbors on streets littered with scraps of bricks. As he completed his two-day stay, Mr. Trump focused only on the positive, offering validation of Mr. Modi as a champion of religious liberty even as the Indian government has adopted Hindu-first policies targeting Muslims. The president publicly accepted Mr. Modi’s word that he treats the 1.3 billion people in his diverse country fairly without regard to faith and made no mention of the months of protests by those who think otherwise. “We did talk about religious freedom, and I will say that the prime minister was incredible on what he told me,” Mr. Trump told reporters. “He wants people to have religious freedom, and very strongly.” “They have really worked hard on religious freedom,” Mr. Trump added. “We talked about it for a long time and I really believe that’s what he wants.” His reluctance to criticize Mr. Modi sharply contrasted with his willingness to assail his domestic critics even while abroad. During his concluding news conference, Mr. Trump attacked Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the former first lady Michelle Obama, Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California, and the unnamed whistle-blower whose disclosures led to the president’s impeachment. He also confirmed that his White House had embarked on a hunt for disloyal officials to purge in the aftermath of his acquittal in a Senate trial but said it would not be “very many people,” without estimating how many. “We want to have people that are good for the country, are loyal to our country,” he said. “Because that was a disgraceful situation.” The president’s embrace of Mr. Modi came at a time when the government has revoked the statehood of Kashmir, the disputed majority Muslim territory; rounded up Muslim leaders there; and enacted a law giving preference to non-Muslim migrants naturalizing as citizens. Protests over the citizenship law culminated in street violence that cost at least 11 lives since Sunday. Mr. Trump made no public mention of those actions until asked and even then professed no view of them. Instead, he framed his first visit to India as president on terms he preferred. Just as religious disputes drew no outward concern, the president insisted that the two leaders had made “tremendous progress” toward the landmark trade agreement he has sought even though there was no evident sign of breakthrough on the major issues that have divided negotiators for months. “We think we’re at a point where our relationship is so special with India, it has never been as good as it is now,” Mr. Trump said. “We feel very strongly about each other, and we have done something that is very unique.” The president often personalizes his relations with foreign leaders. His willingness to accept Mr. Modi’s version of events recalled Mr. Trump’s deference to President Vladimir V. Putin’s denials that Russia had intervened in the 2016 presidential election and his professed belief in Kim Jong-un’s vague promises to give up North Korea’s nuclear weapons. Even Mr. Trump’s boasts about the scale of his reception in India were extravagant. He claimed before his arrival that Mr. Modi had promised him crowds of up to 10 million people. The actual number lining the streets of Ahmedabad on Monday was well under one-tenth that amount. Despite saying he had been told his greeting was the greatest “ever given to any head of state from any country,” Mr. Trump was not even the top-drawing American president to visit India looking back to Dwight D. Eisenhower’s crowds. Only after he was no longer in Mr. Modi’s presence did Mr. Trump return to some of his longstanding complaints about India’s trade policies, complaining to reporters that New Delhi maintained unfairly high tariffs on American goods, including Harley Davidson motorcycles. But while the two leaders were together, it was all sunshine, long on florid language about the strength of their relationship and short on concrete results. Mr. Trump and Mr. Modi celebrated a series of modest agreements that were set before the visit, including a $3 billion arms purchase and a letter of cooperation between Exxon Mobil and India’s energy sector. They agreed to create a joint counternarcotics working group to reduce opioid abuse. During his news conference, Mr. Trump also addressed growing alarm over the coronavirus and the return of 14 Americans infected with coronavirus to the country last week. He defended that action, even though he was privately furious about it. “I felt that we should bring them back,” he said. “They’re Americans — we should bring them back.” During the 2014 Ebola epidemic in Africa, Mr. Trump tweeted in outrage that Americans infected with that virus should not be allowed into the country. Asked whether his current view clashed with his prior one, he rejected the comparison. “There’s a vast difference” between the two epidemics, Mr. Trump said, noting that Ebola was nearly always fatal while the death rate among those infected with the new coronavirus has been relatively low. “At that time, nobody had ever even heard of Ebola or ever conceived of something where you basically — the people would disintegrate.” (Ebola was widely known by 2014.) Mr. Trump also vowed not to accept foreign assistance during his re-election campaign and rejected American intelligence assessments that Russia was already working to help him as it did in 2016. “I want no help from any country, and I haven’t been given help from any country,” Mr. Trump said. Mr. Modi welcomed Mr. Trump to the presidential palace on Tuesday with the roar of guns and an honor guard of red-uniformed soldiers on horseback and later hosted him at a lavish state banquet. “President Trump’s contribution in raising our relations to this level have been invaluable,” Mr. Modi said. Mr. Trump basked in the visit. “Nobody else that came here got the kind of reception we got,” Mr. Trump said. The two leaders declined to answer questions at their joint appearance before the news media. Although Mr. Modi has taken questions from reporters while overseas next to other world leaders, he is the first prime minister in recent memory to not have held any news conferences in India. And so Mr. Trump waited until later to meet reporters on his own. He did gently urge Mr. Modi’s government to respect freedom on the internet, which the Indian government has shut down repeatedly. Talking about the need for secure 5G wireless, the president added that it should be “a tool for freedom, progress, prosperity — not to do anything where it could be even conceived as a conduit for suppression and censorship.” A trade deal with India has been a priority for two years for Mr. Trump, who would like another economic agreement to show while campaigning before the November election. But the two sides have been divided over farm products, medical devices, digital trade and new tariffs. Mr. Trump has complained that India treats the United States unfairly and called Mr. Modi a “tough negotiator.” “Our teams have made tremendous progress on a comprehensive trade agreement, and I’m optimistic we can reach a deal that will be of great importance to both countries,” Mr. Trump told reporters, without elaborating. For Mr. Trump, it was a day to emphasize the optimism. It was, he said, “a very special visit — unforgettable, extraordinary.”",The New York Times
2020,Trump Has Reshaped the Judiciary. Here’s How the 2020 Democrats Would Address That.,"The Trump administration has reshaped the courts through conservative judicial appointments. In a candidate forum, Democrats described how they would respond. CONCORD, N.H. — Though an impeachment trial, a Russia investigation, an Iran crisis and other daily turmoil, President Trump has repeatedly been able to point to one consistent success that has united Republicans — moving conservative justices onto all levels of the federal judiciary. The count now stands at more than 180 judges — many of whom are endorsed by the conservative legal group, the Federalist Society. About 50 of the judges sit on the nation’s appeals courts. (By comparison, President Barack Obama appointed about that many circuit court judges during his entire eight-year term.) Mr. Trump’s ability to push through judges has been possible in large part because of the success that Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, has had in holding open seats during the Obama administration and pushing nominees through after Mr. Trump took office. On Saturday, eight of the presidential candidates still in the Democratic primary race took turns outlining their views on the federal judiciary; they argued about how and whether they would work with Republicans, if elected, and how they would protect reproductive rights and other Democratic priorities. But for all of the focus on the critical importance of the courts, the candidates recognized the limits of what even a Democratic president could do, if Republicans and Mr. McConnell remained in control of the Senate. “The best solution to the Senate is to make sure that in 2021, Mitch McConnell is no longer in the majority, or preferably not in the Senate at all,” former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., told the gathering on Saturday. He added, “This is our chance, this is our only chance.” “We are going to be, I think, just about No. 1 by the time we finish — No. 1 of any president, any administration,” Mr. Trump bragged in November, releasing a fact sheet about his success in confirming judicial nominees. As a result, Democrats fear reversals on a wide array of labor law, civil rights and environmental cases as the courts move steadily to the right. Perhaps no issue has garnered more attention than reproductive rights, in which Democrats fear a conservative-leaning Supreme Court can significantly restrict or even remove the constitutional right to abortion. “We have courts that are completely out of balance that have been taken over by activist judges who certainly, absolutely want to end Roe and criminalize abortion,” said Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, which co-sponsored the forum on Saturday. “But abortion is always the tip of the spear on human rights.” At the event Saturday, Democratic candidates largely were unified in their pledge to try to balance Mr. Trump’s judicial appointments with ones of their own. Several candidates, including Senators Bernie Sanders, of Vermont, and Amy Klobuchar, of Minnesota, said they would be in favor of creating their own lists of qualified justices who they would be ready to push forward on the first day of their administrations. “Let’s give Trump and Mitch McConnell some credit,” Mr. Sanders said. “They were well organized; they knew what they were doing. As a member of the Senate, I can tell you, you know what we do every day? We vote for right-wing, extremist judges.” As Tom Steyer, the former hedge fund executive, put it: “Someone’s got a steamroller. And they’re going right over us.” Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts attacked the qualifications of the judges appointed by Mr. Trump, calling them “beyond unqualified” and arguing that they would not have been acceptable in previous presidential administrations. Asked by a moderator whether she would seek to appoint young progressive justices to the court to balance conservative appointments by Mr. Trump, she said she would. “I want judges who believe in democracy, who believe in justice, who believe in the rights of individuals,” she said, “because that is the job of a justice.” The Democratic candidates were repeatedly pressed by moderators to explain how they planned to make any changes to the courts or to enshrine threatened civil rights legislation into law if the Senate remained controlled by Republicans. The most common answer involved winning elections. “If we don’t change Congress, we’re screwed.” Mr. Buttigieg said. “Power is the only language the Senate G.O.P. responds to right now,” he said. “Our party’s sense of fair play has come back to bite us.” Ms. Klobuchar argued that her experience in the Senate had given her insight into how to work the levers of Congress and, if necessary, to conduct a pressure campaign to get judicial openings filled with candidates of her choosing. “It’s a game that’s been going on,” Ms. Klobuchar said. “You’ve got to be creative.” All of the candidates staunchly backed a woman’s right to choose, and most pledged to do whatever they could to codify Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court case that established theconstitutional right to abortion. Ms. Warren said that over the years, the rights afforded by the case had become narrower and narrower, “like we’re standing on a ledge, and every couple of months another rock sort of breaks loose and falls off.” And she argued that simply seeking to protect the reproductive rights through the courts was no longer sufficient. “When you’ve got a tilted Supreme Court and a tilted court system, we’ve got to start putting a lot more emphasis on what we can do through Congress,” she said. “In a democracy, when three out of four people want to see something be the law, then it’s time for us to mobilize and make it the law.” Updated Feb. 29, 2020",The New York Times
2020,Trump Has a Problem as the Coronavirus Threatens the U.S.: His Credibility,"News Analysis Even his allies worry that President Trump has undermined his ability to appear presidential in a moment of national emergency. Get an informed guide to the global outbreak with our daily Coronavirus
 newsletter.
 WASHINGTON — When Hurricane Dorian crashed into the Atlantic Coast in September, President Trump assumed a take-charge role in response. But he undermined his own effectiveness after it became apparent that before displaying a map in front of the television cameras in the Oval Office, he had altered it with a Sharpie pen to match his inaccurate forecast of where the storm was headed. For years, experts have warned that Mr. Trump has been squandering the credibility he could need in a moment of national emergency, like a terrorist attack or a public health crisis. Now, as the coronavirus races across the globe and has begun to threaten the United States, Mr. Trump could face a moment of reckoning. Maintaining a calm and orderly response during an epidemic, in which countless lives could be at stake, requires that the president be a reliable public messenger. “I think the president has a unique opportunity to dispel fears and calm the situation — if people believe he is telling the truth,” said Kathleen Sebelius, who served as secretary of health and human services in the Obama administration. “And I think that’s really where a great disconnect occurs.” On Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump delivered an almost casual account of the administration’s response to the coronavirus, leaving it to the experts appearing with him to relay the real information and assure a jittery public. Still, he kept trying to suggest the risk was low. “We will see what happens,” the president said as he addressed the nation. “But we are very, very ready for this, for anything.” Mr. Trump said that Johns Hopkins University rated the United States “No. 1 for being prepared,” holding up a chart printed on an 8 ½ by 11 sheet of paper. “This will end,” he said, comparing the coronavirus to the everyday flu. “We really have done a very good job.” During a crisis, presidents are looked to for direct and honest assessments of threats and for reassurance to the public about their impact. During the swine flu outbreak of 1976, President Gerald R. Ford announced at a news conference that the government planned to vaccinate “every man, woman and child in the United States.” Mr. Ford himself was photographed receiving the vaccine in the White House as part of a public awareness campaign. Updated Feb. 29, 2020 Responding to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa in 2014, President Barack Obama visited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta to announce that the administration would send as many as 3,000 people to the region. Mr. Trump, in contrast, contradicted his own health experts in a news conference Wednesday evening, insisting that the spread of the virus was not inevitable, and excoriating two of his favorite foils, Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer, the minority leader, for “trying to create a panic.” For three and a half years, Mr. Trump has repeatedly proved an unreliable narrator on a range of subjects. At times, he has exaggerated threats, like talking up the caravans of migrants he claimed were storming the southern border before the 2018 midterm elections. Other times, he has minimized potentially serious dangers that could be politically damaging, like the renewed nuclear threat posed by North Korea after the failure of his talks with its leader, Kim Jong-un, and now, the global spread of the coronavirus, which he has persistently tried to play down. In his response to the coronavirus, Mr. Trump has made inaccurate or questionable claims, twice misstating the number of Americans infected with the virus and insisting that it “miraculously goes away” when warmer spring weather arrives — a prediction that health experts have said is premature. He based that prediction on a comment made at one of his briefings, when an expert noted that temperatures can affect the spread of viruses. Mr. Trump has used that data point as evidence in saying in public and in private to guests at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Fla., that the global outbreak will be behind him by April. The president, as he often does, has also focused on coverage of his response, complaining that he is being treated unfairly and blaming the news media. “If the virus disappeared tomorrow, they would say we did a really poor, and even incompetent, job,” he tweeted on Tuesday. “Not fair, but it is what it is. So far, by the way, we have not had one death. Let’s keep it that way!” Before he took office, Mr. Trump was an outspoken critic of the Obama administration’s handling of the Ebola outbreak, arguing that infected people should not be allowed back into the United States. Current Trump allies said the fact that the president chose to address the growing public health crisis quickly after returning from a trip to India showed how seriously he was taking the outbreak. But privately, they say he has been reluctant to give in to what he has called an “alarmist” view of the virus’s potential to cause damage as he warily watches the effect of the outbreak on the stock market. He has been rattled by the Wall Street reaction to the spread of the virus in places like Italy, lashing out at the news media in tweets and accusing journalists of intentionally trying to harm the stock market. And polls show that Mr. Trump’s credibility with much of the United States is low after an impeachment inquiry in which a majority of voters said they did not believe that he was telling the truth about his actions involving Ukraine. Federal health officials had been bracing for the arrival of the virus in the country with minimal intervention by the White House. As Ebola presented both a health and political threat to his administration in 2014, Mr. Obama carefully hewed to proven science, which he repeatedly invoked in his carefully calibrated public messages. “We have to be guided by the science. We have to remember the basic facts,” he said in an October 2014 radio message. Mr. Trump, in contrast, has not been focused on scientific detail. The secretary of health and human services, Alex M. Azar II, has told officials they should give the notoriously impatient president simple, paint-by-numbers briefings on coronavirus. But a larger fear among experts in the field has been that he would contradict scientific experts. “That’s where Trump is most pernicious, potentially,” said Ron Klain, who served as Mr. Obama’s “Ebola czar,” and now is an adviser to the presidential campaign of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. “When he contradicts those experts, when he suggests they have biases, or when he intimidates them not to be straight, that’s when the risk really grows.” As Mr. Trump faces this emergency, his history of issuing false claims could make it harder to sell the public on any plans to address coronavirus. “When you’re trying to build trust in the government’s response, people have to have trust,” said Leslie Dach, a senior counselor at health and human services during the Ebola outbreak. “Making false promises and them turning out not to be true undermines people’s confidence,” Mr. Dach said. He pointed to Mr. Trump’s claim this month about the virus that, “We did shut it down, yes.” As recently as this week, the president appeared to simply want to put the coronavirus response in his rearview mirror. “I think that’s a problem that’s going to go away,” he said in remarks on Tuesday to a group of business leaders in New Delhi. On Wednesday, before Mr. Trump’s news conference, his allies on television and radio appeared to be speaking to the proverbial “audience of one” as they sought to give their unsolicited advice to the president. Jason Miller, a top adviser to Mr. Trump’s 2016 campaign who hosts a podcast that is currently focused on the coronavirus, tweeted that the president had to “make clear full Administration working around the clock on this, and explain in everyday, layman’s terms what we need to both do and avoid to remain safe.” On Fox News, daytime hosts noted the news conference presented an “opportunity for him to act presidential.” Mr. Trump, however, chose to conduct the news conference his own way. “It is what it is,” he said of the potential for a virus with a higher fatality than the flu to spread through communities. “We’ve got the greatest people in the world.” Noah Weiland contributed reporting from Washington, and Donald G.

2020,Opinion | Trump Is Waiting and He Is Ready,"‘Alternative facts’ are becoming a reality, which works to the president’s advantage. Mr. Edsall contributes a weekly column from Washington, D.C. on politics, demographics and inequality. There are three crucial developments working in Donald Trump’s favor in the 2020 presidential campaign. These include what a group of Harvard economists — Alberto Alesina, Stefanie Stantcheva and Armando Miano — describe in a recent paper as “The Polarization of Reality.” They write: Evidence is growing that Americans are polarized not only in their views on policy issues and attitudes toward government and society, but also in their perceptions of the same, factual reality accompanying it. As a result, “Republicans and Democrats (as well as Trump and non-Trump voters since 2016) view the same reality through a different lens.” In fact, the differences in perception of reality between Trump and non-Trump voters “are wider than between Democrats and Republicans overall.” The emergence of these conflicting realities explains why Democrats and Republicans “hold different views about policies and what should be done to address different economic and social issues.” Add to the polarization of reality a related development: A large segment of the American electorate has come to tolerate, and in many cases to willingly accept, politicians who lie. Double talk is key to Trump’s governing strategy. In their 2017 paper “Liars, Damned Liars, and Zealots: The Effect of Moral Mandates on Transgressive Advocacy Acceptance,” two psychologists at the University of Illinois, Allison B. Mueller and Linda J. Skitka, cite “transgressive advocacy” — which they define as “norm-violating means, i.e., lying, to achieve a preferred end” — as a critical aspect of contemporary political competition: People’s perceptions of others’ transgressive advocacy were uniquely shaped by their moral convictions. Although honesty was positively valued by all respondents, transgressive advocacy that served a shared moral end was more accepted, and advocacy in the service of a non-preferred end was more condemned, regardless of its truth. Referring specifically to Trump, Mueller and Skitka write: A troubling and timely implication of these findings is that political figures may be able to act in corrupt ways without damaging their images (at least in the eyes of their supporters). This was blatantly apparent in the 2016 Presidential election. The toleration of lying by supporters of political leaders has been central to Trump’s success in marketing provable falsehoods and an alternate reality. The Washington Post’s fact checker, Glenn Kessler, has documented that Trump made 16,241 false or misleading claims in his first three years. Third, there are the advances in the technology of campaigning that allow candidates and parties to communicate below the radar on social media, especially through Facebook and Twitter. Campaigns using these technologies capitalize on their ability to mobilize individual voters and to register nonvoters by tracking as many as 3,000 consumer, social and political markers — from gun ownership to Vanity Fair subscriptions — and by making use of chatbots and what are known as generative adversarial networks (a means of purveying fake news) to get out the vote and push donations. Henry Farrell, a political scientist at George Washington, raised a different set of concerns about lying in a digital era: Even if there is little evidence that this stuff can be persuasive in terms of getting many people to really change their views, there is some reason to suspect that it can have consequences for their second order beliefs about others’ beliefs, and about whether the system is fair or not. These second order beliefs — “that votes are going to be fairly counted, that the other side is minimally committed to democracy, etc.” — are “important to democracy — we need to believe if we are to maintain our own commitments.” But such beliefs, Farrell argues, are “vulnerable to weaponized bullshit.” Trump has shown other politicians, Farrell continued, that it is now “far easier to get away with lying and untruth and not lose support from your voters.” As a result, efforts by the Democrats to criticize Trump by harking back to norms of civility and truth may be relatively ineffective. Truth has become a partisan football, at least for the moment. David Karpf, a professor of media and public affairs at George Washington, makes a parallel argument in an article titled “On Digital Disinformation and Democratic Myths”: The first-order effects of digital disinformation and propaganda, at least in the context of elections, are debatable at best. But disinformation does not have to sway many votes to be toxic to democracy. The second-order effects undermine the democratic myths and governing norms that stand as a bulwark against elite corruption and abuse of power. An illustration of the effectiveness of the Trump truth-defying operation can be found in an article by McKay Coppins in the current issue of The Atlantic, “The Billion-Dollar Disinformation Campaign to Re-elect the President.” Using a false name and portraying himself as an unwavering Trump loyalist, Coppins inserted himself into the digital underworld of the Trump campaign and its maze of interlocking websites, data analytics, text messaging and novel electronic paraphernalia. Coppins, an astute critic of the Trump administration, found he was becoming strangely and unexpectedly disoriented: There were days when I would watch, live on TV, an impeachment hearing filled with damning testimony about the president’s conduct, only to look at my phone later and find a slickly edited video — served up by the Trump campaign — that used out-of-context clips to recast the same testimony as an exoneration. Wait, I caught myself wondering more than once, is that what happened today? Coppins assumed that my skepticism and media literacy would inoculate me against such distortions. But I soon found myself reflexively questioning every headline. It wasn’t that I believed Trump and his boosters were telling the truth. It was that, in this state of heightened suspicion, truth itself — about Ukraine, impeachment, or anything else — felt more and more difficult to locate. With each swipe, the notion of observable reality drifted further out of reach. The Trump campaign, free of any serious primary challenge, has the resources — in time and money — to focus on one candidate and a single coherent message. The campaign and the movement it represents will be able to spend 2020 in a drive to imprint on targeted voters its preferred view of reality, the strengths of its candidates and the liabilities of opponents. As the Washington Post pointed out on Jan. 3, President Trump’s political operation headed into 2020 with nearly $200 million on hand, according to party officials, giving him a financial war chest that vastly outstrips the resources of his Democratic opponents. In terms of preparing for the general election, time and money are just what the Democratic candidates — embroiled in what may turn out to be a long and costly fight for the nomination — do not have. When the party finally settles on a nominee, he or she can expect a huge surge in donations. But as both John McCain and Mitt Romney discovered in 2008 and 2012, receiving cash late makes it virtually impossible to catch up in the time-consuming process of constructing a campaign’s digital infrastructure. In addition, as Coppins points out in his Atlantic essay, the Trump campaign and the right generally are determined to discredit and vilify the media: What’s notable about this effort is not that it aims to expose media bias. Conservatives have been complaining — with some merit — about a liberal slant in the press for decades. In the Trump era, Coppins continues, instead of trying to reform the press, or critique its coverage, today’s most influential conservatives want to destroy the mainstream media altogether. Coppins cited a July 2017 speech at the Heritage Foundation by Matthew Boyle, the Washington political editor of Breitbart: The goal eventually is the full destruction and elimination of the entire mainstream media. We envision a day when CNN is no longer in business. We envision a day when The New York Times closes its doors. Boyle goes on to declare: Journalistic integrity is dead. There is no such thing anymore. So, everything is about weaponization of information. One clear signal to Democrats of the effectiveness of the Trump campaign can be found in Wisconsin. Partisan trends there, in a battleground state where Trump is making an all-out effort to repeat his 2016 victory, are revealing. Surveys of Wisconsin voters released by Marquette University Law School in January show a steady movement over the past nine years to the right. Marquette compared the percentages of self-identified Republicans and Democrats over the five years from 2012 to 2016 with the percentages in the four-year period from 2017 to 2020. In the earlier period, Democrats held a five point advantage in partisan identification, 48-43. In the more recent period, Republicans pulled slightly ahead, 45-44, as the accompanying chart shows. Partisan makeup of the state’s electorate, 2012-19. 50% 48 45 Republicans 43 44 Democrats 40 30 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS 20 10 Independents 10 8 2012 ’14 2016 ’18 '19 50% 48 45 Republicans 44 Democrats 43 40 30 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS 20 10 Independents 10 8 2012 ’14 2016 ’18 '19 By The New York Times | Source: Marquette University Law School Poll This trend has accelerated in recent months. The Republican advantage held during the first eight months of last year, but in the most recent seven month period, from August 2019 to the present, Republicans have pulled ahead by four points, 47 to 43. There is an additional way to explain why so many voters are willing to tolerate Trump’s lies: that on the issues that matter intensely to Trump’s most loyal white supporters, Trump defies norms of political correctness by telling his backers what they firmly believe is the truth — their truth — about race, crime and immigration. In this view, when Trump vilifies immigrants (as The Washington Post put it “Trump’s most insulting — and violent — language is often reserved for immigrants”) or calls Baltimore a “rodent infested mess,” he is the populist right’s truth teller, and in this scheme politically correct liberals who denounce his comments are the liars. A 2019 study, “Tell it like it is: When politically incorrect language promotes authenticity,” found that “being politically incorrect makes communicators appear more authentic — specifically, less susceptible to external influence — albeit also less warm.” The three authors — Michael Rosenblum and Juliana Schroeder, both at Berkeley’s Haas School of Business, and Francesca Gino, of Harvard Business School — conclude that speaking politically incorrectly makes observers more likely to infer that the communicator’s beliefs are truly held and therefore makes them feel more certain about how the communicator will behave in the future. Trump’s lies and his defiance of politically correct norms have enabled him to capitalize on a groundswell of anti-elite populist animosity — an animosity that Ronald Inglehart and Pippa Norris, authors of “Trump, Brexit, and the Rise of Populism,” call counterrevolutionary retro backlash, especially among the older generation, white men, and less educated sectors, who sense decline and actively reject the rising tide of progressive values, resent the displacement of familiar traditional norms, and provide a pool of supporters potentially vulnerable to populist appeals. The 2020 election will determine whether this retro backlash has run its course or whether Trump’s malign and mendacious political skills, together with the prominence within the Democratic Party of a vociferous left cadre, will return the 45th president to a second term.

2020,"Trump Kicks Off the Daytona 500, and a Race for Florida Votes","The appearance at the NASCAR event, complete with flyovers and a trip around the track in the presidential limousine, was a highly choreographed showing by the president. DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. — President Trump put his showmanship skills on full display on Sunday at the Daytona International Speedway, leading the famous stock car drivers in a lap around the 2.5-mile racetrack. A sold-out crowd of 101,500 people cheered his appearance in a state he must win this year to secure re-election. Serving as the grand marshal for the kickoff race of the NASCAR season, which was ultimately interrupted and then postponed because of rain, Mr. Trump arrived at the packed stands after a rare Air Force One flyover and later rounded the track in his limousine, nicknamed The Beast, to raucous cheers from the crowd. Shortly after the president told drivers to “start your engines,” Air Force Thunderbirds roared overhead. “NASCAR fans never forget that no matter who wins the race, what matters most is God, family and country,” Mr. Trump said to the thousands in the stand and group of invited guests and members of the military at Victory Lane before the race started. He called it a moment of “pure American glory” and said “the cars will take to the tracks, the tires will screech, rubber will burn, fans will cheer.” “Good luck, and may the best team win,” he said. As Mr. Trump was leaving the speedway and the 40-car field was approaching the green flag to start 200 laps of racing, rain started to fall. After an hour delay, the race began and continued for 20 laps until rain again interrupted. With heavier showers arriving and continual bands of storms in the forecast for the next several hours, officials announced at about 6:50 p.m. that the rest of the race would be completed on Monday, starting at 4 p.m. Mr. Trump’s appearance at the NASCAR event, also known as the Great American Race, was a highly choreographed showing by the sitting president and part of a concerted effort by his re-election campaign to solidify support among his core voters. Mr. Trump won Florida’s 29 electoral votes in 2016, narrowly defeating Hillary Clinton in a state that was critical to his victory. Late last year, Mr. Trump announced that he was moving his official residence from New York to Florida, where he owns several golf clubs and his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach. Recent polls in Florida show Mr. Trump hovering around 49 percent or 50 percent when matched against the leading Democratic presidential candidates, underscoring how close the state is likely to be again this year. A survey at the end of January showed Mr. Trump defeating all four of the top Democratic contenders. Much of that support probably comes from conservative parts of Florida, where NASCAR racing is extremely popular. The Daytona speedway, known as the World Center of Racing, is the main center for the sport. The 500-mile, 200-lap competition is the start of the NASCAR racing season. Last year, Mr. Trump welcomed Joey Logano, the 2018 winner of the NASCAR Cup Series, at the White House, honoring him alongside his No. 22, bright yellow Ford Fusion in which he dominated the season. “NASCAR is not only a thrilling display of skill and power, but a celebration of the American spirit. So true,” Mr. Trump said in April. “No matter who wins the race, you never forget what matters most: God, family and country. And nobody embodies that more than you folks, I’ll tell you.” Previous presidents have also made appearances at Daytona International Speedway. President George W. Bush served as the grand marshal of the Daytona 500 as he campaigned for re-election in 2004. As a candidate in 1992, Bill Clinton campaigned at the Southern 500 in Darlington, S.C., but was booed by many in the crowd upset by his lack of military service in Vietnam, which was an issue in the campaign at the time. Mr. Clinton made an appearance at the Daytona International Speedway as president years later, but not on a race day. He delivered a speech about climate change in 1998 after huge forest fires ravaged parts of Florida. Firefighters had used the speedway as the base of their operations to fight the fires. Like those of Mr. Trump and Mr. Bush, Mr. Clinton’s motorcade made its way around the racetrack, though not at the usual speeds of a NASCAR driver. J.E. Garrett contributed reporting.

2020,"Trump, at National Prayer Breakfast, Lashes Out at Impeachment Foes","The president denounced the “corrupt people” who pushed for his impeachment. Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the president seemed “a little sedated” during his State of the Union address. WASHINGTON — President Trump, a day after being acquitted in a Senate impeachment trial, used a National Prayer Breakfast on Thursday to lash out at his political opponents, accusing them of being “very dishonest and corrupt people” who are trying to destroy him and the country. Explicitly rejecting the message of tolerance offered at the National Prayer Breakfast just moments before he took the lectern, Mr. Trump — without naming them — singled out Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who was sitting just a few feet away at the head table, and Senator Mitt Romney, the Republican from Utah who voted to convict him, accusing them of hypocrisy for citing their faith while supporting his impeachment. “As everybody knows, my family, our great country and your president have been put through a terrible ordeal by some very dishonest and corrupt people,” Mr. Trump said. He then seemed to target Mr. Romney, who cited his faith in announcing his decision to vote for conviction. “I don’t like people who use their faith as justification for doing what they know is wrong,” Mr. Trump said. Then, in a clear reference to Ms. Pelosi, who has said she prays for Mr. Trump, the president said, “Nor do I like people who say, ‘I pray for you,’ when they know that’s not so.” transcript This morning, the president said when people use faith as an excuse to do — I don’t know if he said “bad things” — but whatever he said was just so completely inappropriate, especially at a prayer breakfast. I don’t know if the president understands about prayer or people who do pray. But we do pray for the United States of America, I pray for him. I pray for President Bush still, President Obama — because it’s a heavy responsibility. And I pray hard for him because he’s so off the track of our Constitution, our values. That was not a State of the Union. That was a state — his state of mind — we wanted a state of the union. Where are we? Where are we going? Hours later at the Capitol, Ms. Pelosi responded that Mr. Trump’s remarks about Mr. Romney were “particularly without class” and “so inappropriate at a prayer breakfast.” As for his remarks about her, she said, “I don’t know if the president understands about prayer,” but that she prays “hard for him because he’s so off the track of our Constitution, our values.” “He really needs our prayers,” she added, “He can say whatever he wants. But I do pray for him.” The back-and-forth came two days after the president’s State of the Union address, when Mr. Trump refused to shake Ms. Pelosi’s hand and she ripped up her copy of his speech. “That was not a State of the Union,” Ms. Pelosi said Thursday. “That was his state of mind.” She also said the president “looked to me like he was a little sedated” at the State of the Union, adding, “he looked that way last year too.” Mr. Trump’s speech on Thursday morning was as overtly a political talk as any president has made at the National Prayer Breakfast, traditionally a bipartisan affair where members of both parties put aside their disagreements for an hour or two to focus on their shared beliefs. When he arrived, he held up two newspapers with banner headlines that said, “Acquitted” and “Trump Acquitted.” In addition to his outburst on impeachment, Mr. Trump cited rising stock markets, boasted about his approval rating in the latest Gallup poll and urged the audience to vote in the fall. Mr. Trump’s remarks came hours before he plans to make a statement about the outcome of the impeachment trial at the White House at noon. While Ms. Pelosi gave a short speech at the breakfast on behalf of the poor and persecuted, Mr. Trump seemed to glower and stared straight ahead, not looking at her. When it came time for him to speak, Mr. Trump immediately followed a keynote address by Arthur Brooks, a Harvard professor and prominent conservative thinker, who delivered a passionate plea to Americans to put aside hatred in national life and “love your enemies.” At one point, Mr. Brooks asked the audience, “How many of you love somebody with whom you disagree politically?” Hands around the room shot up. “I’m going to round that off to 100 percent,” he said. But what he did not seem to notice was that Mr. Trump was among those who did not raise his hand. “Contempt is ripping our country apart,” Mr. Brooks went on. “We’re like a couple on the rocks in this country.” Without mentioning Mr. Trump specifically, Mr. Brooks added: “Ask God to take political contempt from your heart. And sometimes when it’s too hard, ask God to help you fake it.” Mr. Trump made no effort to fake it. While the rest of the room gave Mr. Brooks a standing ovation, he clapped politely but remained seated until finally rising at the end. “Arthur, I don’t know if I agree with you,” Mr. Trump said when he took the microphone. “I don’t know if Arthur is going to like what I’m going to say.” He then launched into his grievances about impeachment. By the end of his speech, which included many of the lines from his campaign events about his policies in addition to comments more specifically about religious freedom, Mr. Trump seemed to acknowledge that his message was not in keeping with the love-your-enemies theme. “I apologize, I’m trying to learn,” he said. “It’s not easy. It’s not easy. When they impeach you for nothing, then you’re supposed to like them? It’s not easy, folks. I do my best.” Sheryl Gay Stolberg contributed reporting.",The New York Times
2020,"Trump Lashes Out at Manchin, and He Pushes Back","The West Virginia Democrat, who dashed President Trump’s hopes for a bipartisan acquittal, said his vote to convict was not about politics. WASHINGTON — Senator Joe Manchin III votes with President Trump more than any other Democrat in the Senate. But his vote last week to convict Mr. Trump of impeachable offenses has eclipsed all of that, earning him the rage of a president who coveted a bipartisan acquittal. In the days since Mr. Manchin, a West Virginian who was one of the few swing votes on impeachment, supported Mr. Trump’s removal, the president has laced into the senator with a zeal that is startling even by his standards. He called Mr. Manchin a “puppet Democrat Senator” who was “weak & pathetic.” He gave the senator a new nickname: “Joe Munchkin.” He suggested that Mr. Manchin was too stupid to understand a transcript of his telephone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, the central piece of evidence in the case. And to add insult to injury, he took credit for the senator’s signature legislative achievement: a bipartisan bill to secure miners’ pensions. On Monday, Mr. Manchin made clear that he had had enough. “The people of America and the people of West Virginia want some adults in the room,” he said in an interview, but he said that Mr. Trump was not behaving like one. Then, the senator — who at 6-foot-3 is roughly the same height as Mr. Trump, though considerably thinner — took his own shot. “Munchkin means that you’re small, right?” he said. “I’m bigger than him — of course he has me by weight, now, he has more volume than I have by about 30 or 40 pounds. I’m far from being weak and pathetic, and I’m far from being a munchkin, and I still want him to succeed as president of the United States.” Mr. Trump’s litany of insults reflects his dashed hopes of counting a Democratic defector among his supporters on impeachment, a crucial piece of the president’s claims that impeachment was a partisan “hoax” so extreme that it had no legitimacy. And it underscores his disappointment that Mr. Manchin, who has at times broken with his party to support parts of the president’s agenda, refused to back him during this particular fight. Given the politics of West Virginia, a state Mr. Trump won with 68 percent of the vote in 2016, Mr. Manchin was among a very small group of Democrats who were seen as possible votes to acquit. But Mr. Manchin said he did not base his choice on electoral politics. “I knew the politics of my state,” the senator said. “If I was going to make a political decision, I’d have voted to acquit.” Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, the only Republican to vote to convict Mr. Trump, said much the same thing, and has been relegated to Mr. Trump’s enemies list as a result. “The president is entitled to say whatever he thinks,” Mr. Romney said on Monday in a brief hallway interview in the Capitol. “I’m not going to try to direct what he says.” Democrats accused Mr. Trump of abusing his oath of office and obstructing Congress by trying to get Ukraine to help him win re-election and then covering up his actions. Central to the case was the phone call in which he asked Mr. Zelensky to “do us a favor though” and investigate his political rivals, including former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., a contender for the Democratic presidential nomination. Days before the final verdict in the impeachment trial, Mr. Manchin stood up in a closed-door lunch with his Democratic colleagues and delivered an impassioned speech about the dilemma he faced. He was struggling, Mr. Manchin told his colleagues, and quoted from a statement made by Robert C. Byrd, a West Virginia Democrat who spent more than half a century in the Senate until his death in 2010. During President Bill Clinton’s impeachment trial, Mr. Byrd warned that the Senate might sink “further into the mire because of this partisanship.” There was some applause and very little pushback, according to two people with knowledge of the exchange. Mr. Manchin, who has long prided himself on working across party lines, later repeated Mr. Byrd’s words on the Senate floor, warning that “there will be no winners on this vote.” In that sense, he was right; the vote has certainly not been a winner for him. “It has been incredibly hot,” said Hoppy Kercheval, a conservative West Virginia talk show host, describing the reaction to Mr. Manchin’s vote. “I got more texts about Manchin’s vote than anything I’ve talked about in a year — most of them angry and some of them unrepeatable.” Mr. Manchin, a former governor, has long had a reputation for bipartisanship on Capitol Hill. According to the website FiveThirtyEight, Mr. Manchin has voted with Mr. Trump 53 percent of the time. His votes, though, are hard to predict. At the outset of the administration, Mr. Trump courted Mr. Manchin and tried to persuade him to become a Republican. But Mr. Manchin stuck with Democrats in voting against the repeal of the Affordable Care Act and against Mr. Trump’s tax bill. Then he crossed party lines to become the lone Democratic vote in favor of confirming Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. Some Democrats said Mr. Manchin’s guilty vote on impeachment surprised them. He had floated the possibility of a censure in the days before the final vote. In the interview, he said he thought it might be a way to get some bipartisan consensus that Mr. Trump’s call with Mr. Zelensky was hardly “perfect,” as the president had repeatedly said. “I don’t think there was a person among those 100 senators who believed the president had a perfect phone call and didn’t do anything wrong. I believe they all know something was wrong,” he said. “I thought censure would be the way we could get a majority of the vote, and I couldn’t even get one Republican to sign on.” Mike Plante, a Democratic strategist in West Virginia, said he took the talk of censure as an indication that Mr. Manchin was thinking of voting to acquit. “People were pleasantly surprised and happy that he took this step,” Mr. Plante said, referring to Democrats. “He clearly recognized that this was more than politics as usual. This was history, and he did not miss that moment.” But Nick Casey, the former chairman of the West Virginia Democratic Party and a close Manchin ally, said he was not surprised. “Joe has never been shy about going into the belly of the beast if he does something that he is very comfortable with. And if people disagree with him, that’s their right. He got elected to make decisions, and he made one.” His vote caused a bit of a dust-up between Mr. Manchin and the state’s other senator, Shelley Moore Capito, a Republican. In an interview on Fox News last week, she said the vote was “not being received well here at home” and said that Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, had probably “just pulled the noose a little tight and said, ‘Come on, everybody, we’re going to jump off this cliff together.’” The suggestion rankled Mr. Manchin, who made his own appearance on Fox News the next day to push back. “Shelley knows me well enough that no one can pull my chain, tie a noose around me or any of that.” In the Capitol on Monday, Ms. Capito — and many other Republicans — said they had no interest in getting in the middle of a dispute between Mr. Trump and Mr. Manchin. “That’s between him and the president,” she said. “I don’t agree with Joe’s vote — he knows that — but everybody’s entitled to their opinion and I just think we need to move on.” At 72, Mr. Manchin, who won re-election narrowly in 2018, has not said whether he will run again in 2024. Mr. Plante said his vote to convict the president could make it harder for him to do so. But Mr. Manchin says he is comfortable with his decision. “I’ve only taken two oaths since I’ve been a senator,” he said. “One was to protect and defend the Constitution and the other was to do impartial justice, and I think I did. I can sleep on that.” Nicholas Fandos and Emily Cochrane contributed reporting.",The New York Times
2020,Opinion | Trump Makes Us Ill,"Going viral is not a good thing this time. Opinion Columnist Donald Trump was right. Germs are scary. For three decades, I talked to Trump about his fear of germs. When I interviewed him at the Trump Tower restaurant during the 2016 race, the famous germophobe had a big hospital-strength bottle of hand sanitizer on the table, next to my salad, ready to squirt. He told me about the nightmarish feeling he had when a man emerged from the bathroom in a restaurant with wet hands and shook his hand. He couldn’t eat afterward. Today, in a stunning twist of fate, germs are infecting his presidency and threatening a bad prognosis for his re-election prospects. Trump is the first president to use the stock market as a near-daily measure of his success — and his virility — and now the market is slumping. If you want to own it on the way up, you have to own it on the way down. Investors, who worried when Trump began to rise in politics, soon realized that he had their backs. He was just a corporate vessel pretending to be a populist; the stock market was his sugar high. Now Trump is learning the hard way what my fatalistic Irish mother taught me: The thing you love most is the first to go. As Mike Bloomberg points out, investors have factored in Trump’s incompetence, and that is contributing to the market cratering. The president urged the Fed to do something soon to mitigate the stock market losses. Socialism for the rich! The scaremonger in chief has been downplaying the possibility of a coronavirus pandemic and joining Fox News hosts in accusing the “anti-Trump” media and “Do Nothing Democrats” of scaremongering about the virus. At the CPAC convention, Mick Mulvaney told a cheering crowd that impeachment was the “hoax of the day” and now the press thinks the coronavirus “is going to be what brings down the president.” The media, he said, should spend more time on positive stories, like the president’s “caring” relationship with his teenage son, Barron, even though White Houses usually frown on stories about young presidential offspring. Mike Huckabee went on the attack, asserting that Trump “could personally suck the virus out of every one of the 60,000 people in the world, suck it out of their lungs, swim to the bottom of the ocean and spit it out, and he would be accused of pollution for messing up the ocean.” On Fox, Don Jr. said the Democrats “seemingly hope” the virus kills millions to stop Trump’s winning streak. Rush Limbaugh chimed in that the media “would love for the coronavirus to be this deadly strain that wipes everybody out so they could blame Trump for it.” There are 2,800 dead worldwide and disturbing stories showing how federal criteria delayed the diagnosis of a California woman and how federal health employees interacted with Americans who had possibly been exposed to the virus in China without proper training or gear. Yet Trump seems more consumed with how the Democrats might blame him for a coronavirus recession than with the virus itself. Trump had tweet-shrieked at President Barack Obama about how he should handle Ebola. (“Obama should apologize to the American people & resign!”) Yet he was so relaxed about the coronavirus threat that he spent 45 minutes Thursday chatting in the Oval with the authors of a little play called “FBI Lovebirds: Undercovers,” inspired by the texts of Peter Strzok and Lisa Page. The play’s leads, Dean Cain of “Superman” fame and the “Buffy the Vampire Slayer” actress Kristy Swanson, were also in the meeting. Trump joked that he’d be willing to be Cain’s understudy, the actor said. The president got together the same day with a group that included his social media boosters Diamond and Silk. At the White House press conference, Trump preened: “Because of all we’ve done, the risk to the American people remains very low.” He later said that one day, like a miracle, the virus “will disappear.” His top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, pushed the crisis as an opportunity: “Stocks look pretty cheap to me.” Trump won’t be able to deflect and project and create a daft alternative narrative. The virus won’t respond to conspiracy theories from Rush Limbaugh or nasty diatribes from Sean Hannity or nicknames from Donald Trump. This will be a deus ex machina test of Trump’s authoritarian behavior. Epidemics are not well suited to authoritarian regimes and propaganda, as we saw this week when Beijing’s use of propaganda tactics to suppress information about the outbreak failed spectacularly and when Iran tamped down news about the virus for political reasons even as it ravaged top officials. The reality of the coronavirus spreading will reflect poorly on Trump — his cavalier dismantling of vital government teams for health response and his disdain for experts and science. Trump tried to make federal agencies complicit on his fabulist hogwash about the size of his inaugural crowd and the path of Hurricane Dorian.

2020,Opinion | Trump Makes the American Health Care System Even Worse,"China’s failures on the coronavirus are distracting us from the mess we have at home. Opinion Columnist President Trump praises a “strong, sharp and powerfully focused” Chinese President Xi Jinping for his handling of the coronavirus outbreak. “President Xi strongly leads what will be a very successful operation,” Trump said. This offended some Americans. At a time when many Chinese are criticizing Xi for initially covering up the outbreak, should America’s president really side with a dictator who punished doctors rather than listening to them? That critique seems right to me. But a focus on China’s failures or on Trump’s praise risks distracting from our own failures in health care — and this is where Trump’s actions have been more destructive than his words. He has proposed enormous budget cuts for Medicaid, the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; if carried out, these would leave the U.S. more vulnerable to a pandemic. But whatever happens with the coronavirus, America’s health system is a mess. That is a consequence of failures that go way back, and Trump is now compounding them. In particular, his lawsuit to destroy Obamacare without offering anything to take its place is the height of irresponsibility; it’s not policy but vandalism. Already, Trump’s policies have led to the loss of health insurance for 400,000 children. Imagine that your child is crying from an ear infection or a toothache and you have no doctor to go to. Or you’re worried that your daughter is slow to speak or your son isn’t growing properly. What are you supposed to do? I’ve written scathing columns about Xi’s bungling of the coronavirus outbreak, but we Americans live in a glass house. A newborn in Beijing has a longer life expectancy (82 years) than a baby born in Washington, D.C. (78), or New York City (81). Democrats’ internecine battle over so-called Medicare for all is largely irrelevant, because the plan won’t get through Congress. What’s imperative is simply achieving universal medical and dental coverage, either by a single-payer system (like Britain’s) or a multipayer system (like Germany’s); both work fine. What matters is the universal part. In some ways, America’s health care is outstanding. Specialized anti-cancer treatments are saving lives. But over all our system has two fundamental flaws. First, outcomes are mediocre and inequitable. Rich Americans live 20 years longer than poor Americans, and low-income American men have approximately the longevity of men living in Sudan. Several American counties have a shorter life expectancy than Cambodia does. We’re bad at simple things, like vaccinating children. Rwanda has a higher share of girls vaccinated to prevent cervical cancer than the United States does. One study found that 21,000 American children’s lives would be saved each year if we only had the same mortality rates as the rest of the rich world. So two American kids die each hour because we have worse child survival rates than our peer countries. In my reporting, I’ve been struck by how much more widespread dental pain is in America than in other countries. Some 74 million Americans don’t have dental coverage, about four times as many as lack medical insurance. When their teeth rot, they suffer constant excruciating, debilitating pain that should be unfathomable in a country as rich as ours. Health care in the United States is “a moral morass,” a question of our “soul,” Uwe Reinhardt, a brilliant health economist at Princeton wrote in “Priced Out,” a book recently published posthumously. The second fundamental problem with our health care system is that it delivers these second-rate outcomes at enormous cost. “Prices for virtually any health care product or service in the United States tend to be at least twice as high as those for comparable products or services in other countries,” Reinhardt wrote. We spend an average of more than $10,000 per person on health care each year, more than twice what France, Canada and Japan each spend (even though the French, Canadians and Japanese all live longer). An excellent forthcoming book by Anne Case and Angus Deaton, “Deaths of Despair and the Future of Capitalism,” argues that this discourages hiring of low-income workers. The average cost of a family health insurance policy is $20,000, which is a reason for a company not to hire a junior employee and assume insurance costs. “Unless costs are somehow reined in, the long-run prospects for less-educated Americans remain bleak,” Deaton warns. Sadly, health professionals are part of the problem. Dentists have fought the licensing of dental therapists, who can perform simple procedures more cheaply. And doctor groups limit medical training and qualified foreign physicians to keep prices high; that’s why there are fewer doctors per capita in the United States than in peer countries. As Case and Deaton write: “The industry that is supposed to improve our health is undermining it.” This year’s election should in part be a debate about all these issues, and the coronavirus anxiety should remind us of the dysfunction of our own health system. Let’s hold China accountable — but we Americans should also look unflinchingly in the mirror. The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

2020,"Trump Mistakenly Congratulates Kansas City, Kan., on Its Super Bowl Win","The Kansas City Chiefs play in Missouri, a fact that people on Twitter didn’t hesitate to point out. WASHINGTON — President Trump did not waste any time Sunday night congratulating the Kansas City Chiefs for defeating the San Francisco 49ers in the Super Bowl. Except he got their home state wrong. “Congratulations to the Kansas City Chiefs on a great game, and a fantastic comeback, under immense pressure. You represented the Great State of Kansas” — yikes — “and, in fact, the entire USA, so very well,” Mr. Trump said in a tweet posted during his Air Force One flight from Palm Beach, Fla., to Washington. “Our country is PROUD OF YOU.” The problem, of course, is that the Chiefs play in the state of Missouri, next door. There is a Kansas City, Kan., a handful of miles away, but it was the kind of mix-up his followers might expect a member of the coastal elite to make, not a president who spends much of his time speaking on behalf of people from that part of the country. The president’s message, as short-lived as it was before it was deleted and replaced with the geographically correct location of the franchise, caught the attention of people on Twitter. One of them was Claire McCaskill, the former Democratic senator from Missouri. And she was not forgiving. For the rebuttal, the president had his defenders, including “Carpe Donktum,” a somewhat infamous conservative meme creator who has been invited to meet with Mr. Trump at the White House. In the midst of fan celebrations and Twitter arguments over the president’s grasp of geography, a new version of the first message suddenly appeared. “Congratulations to the Kansas City Chiefs on a great game and a fantastic comeback under immense pressure,” Mr. Trump wrote. “We are proud of you and the Great State of Missouri. You are true Champions!” And while attention was focused on the mix-up, the president — or whoever was in charge of the presidential account — quickly began sharing a flurry of tweets related to the Trump campaign’s Super Bowl ad, which highlighted the Trump administration’s policies on prison reform.",The New York Times
2020,Coronavirus in the U.S.: First Death Reported in Washington State,"A person in the Seattle area died. Two others tested positive for the virus in a long term care center where dozens of people have reported feeling ill. Get an informed guide to the global outbreak with our daily Coronavirus
 newsletter.
 SEATTLE — Concerns about the coronavirus intensified across the Pacific Northwest on Saturday, after a person from the Seattle area died and as two new cases emerged inside a nursing care center in Kirkland, Wash., where dozens of other people were reported to be feeling sick. Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington declared a state of emergency, and said officials were considering canceling sporting events, closing schools and taking any other steps needed to slow the spread of the virus. “If — and this is a big if — there is a social distancing strategy that becomes necessary, the emergency declaration would give us some legal authority,” Mr. Inslee said. At two schools that have had ties to cases, in Oregon and in Washington, officials announced that they were shuttering buildings for several days, and ordering deep cleanings. And in Kirkland, where a health care worker in her 40s at the Life Care Center, a long-term nursing home, and a resident of the center, in her 70s, were reported on Saturday to have tested positive for the virus, health officials expressed alarm at the possibility of more cases. Among 288 residents and workers at Life Care, more than 50 people — 25 health workers and 27 residents — have shown symptoms of respiratory illness or have been hospitalized for pneumonia, local health officials said. “We are very concerned about an outbreak in a setting where there are many older people,” said Dr. Jeff Duchin, the health officer for Public Health in Seattle and King County. A team of federal health workers was dispatched to Kirkland to assist local workers, and many more coronavirus tests were expected to be conducted in the coming days. Older people are much more likely to face serious illness if infected with the coronavirus. They are also much more likely to die. An analysis of Chinese patients found that nearly 15 percent of infected people over age 80 died; of those in their 70s, 8 percent died. On Saturday afternoon, workers in plastic protective gear and masks could be seen rolling a patient, also in a mask, to an ambulance outside the nursing home, a low slung building on a side street tucked among small condo complexes, and surrounded by pine trees. Officials said that testing for the virus was being conducted at an area hospital, and that it was not open for visits from patients’ family members or vendors as a precaution. Updated Feb. 29, 2020 Nancy Butner, the northwest divisional vice president for Life Care Centers of America, said that many of the residents were showing only respiratory symptoms that were not necessarily tied to the coronavirus. In an interview, she said that residents were mostly staying in their rooms, and that despite public health officials’ warnings of a possible “outbreak” at the nursing home, the mood inside was relaxed. “We are encouraging people to remain in their rooms,” she said. “We have the equipment and supplies to take care of them, and people are doing what they need to do.” Chad Bergevin, who lives opposite the center, said he had learned of the situation in a text message from a neighbor. “It was like, ‘Wow, this is literally less than a football field away from my house,’” he said, adding that he was surprised to see people still seeming to come and go near the center. “I’m sorry, if it were me, I’d have the place on lockdown,” he said. The indications of a possible spread, and the involvement of a nursing home marked a new, urgent phase in the response to the virus in the United States, where 70 cases have been reported, and until Saturday, none had been fatal. Most of the cases could be explained by overseas travel or contact with someone who had been ill. This week, though, new cases, in California, Oregon and Washington, were the first in the United States in which the cause was mysterious and unknown — a sign, experts warned, that the virus, which has killed more than 2,800 people worldwide and has sickened more than 86,000 others, might now be spreading in the United States. In the Northwest, especially, health officials were putting in place new precautions given the new cases. They were already discussing the possibility that they might recommend cancellations of public events. They began warning that life in the coming weeks may undergo dramatic change. By Saturday, 10 people have been treated in Washington State, including the first case of coronavirus that was diagnosed in the United States, a man in his 30s who had traveled in China and has since recovered; several patients were treated at a Spokane area hospital after returning from a cruise ship in Japan; and the first known coronavirus fatality in the United States, a man in his 50s whose death was announced Saturday. In announcing the death at a news conference, President Trump said the victim was a “wonderful woman” in her 50s, but local officials later said the patient had been a man in his 50s. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention later said that the patient was, in fact, a man, and that the agency had incorrectly described the patient as a woman. Few details were known about the man who died, except that he had underlying health conditions and had been a patient at a hospital in Kirkland. He was not known to have traveled abroad, or to have had contact with anyone who had tested positive for the virus, adding to growing signs that the coronavirus may be spreading in the United States. He also had no known connection to the nursing home, officials said. The new cases added to the fears of some residents. Noelle Salazar, an author in Bothell, Wash., was recovering from a surgery, and realized that she had been in the same hospital as the man who died. “We weren’t in the same section, but it’s not comforting,” she said while recuperating at home. “I’m a little on edge right now for sure.” Like many Americans, she has begun to take extra precautions in recent days: She wiped down her shopping cart at a grocery store for the first time, bought extra vitamins and nonperishable food and canceled a Pilates class to avoid getting too close to others. Around the region, it was clear that residents were bracing. At a big-box store north of Seattle on early Saturday, checkout lines were unusually long, snaking down aisles with carts loaded with all sorts of supplies. In Oregon, a state that until Friday had not reported any cases of the coronavirus, officials say an employee of Forest Hills Elementary School in Lake Oswego, a suburb of Portland, appeared to have contracted the virus more than a week ago. The school would be closed for several days, and was being cleaned, but parents said they were uncertain and scared. Gov. Kate Brown of Oregon said that she expected more cases, and that her state might take more aggressive action if the outbreak got more severe. But, in the meantime, she said people did not need to take drastic action. “I’m wanting to convey to Oregonians, and frankly folks on the entire West Coast: stay calm, continue on your daily lives and follow public health precautions,” Ms. Brown said. Dr. Dean Sidelinger, Oregon’s state health officer, said a broader closure of schools was an option the state could pursue at some point. “If we do notice spread in our community or multiple cases, that is certainly something we would consider on a case-by-case basis,” Dr. Sidelinger said. Back at the school in Lake Oswego, parents were weighing how to go forward. “I really don’t know how to process it at this point,” said Danielle Gaustad, a mother of three children, ages 3, 5 and 18. Her 5-year-old, who attends Forest Hills Elementary, had pneumonia several weeks ago, and her 3-year-old has severe asthma. “When people don’t understand an illness, and clearly no one understands coronavirus at this point, everybody gets scared,” Ms. Gaustad said. Though the school has said it intends to reopen in a few days, Ms. Gaustad said she would not allow her children to go back to school this week. “I don’t know when I will, honestly,” she said. “It’s scary.” Mike Baker reported from Seattle, Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs from New York and Karen Weise from Kirkland, Wash.

 WASHINGTON — President Trump named Vice President Mike Pence on Wednesday to coordinate the government’s response to the coronavirus, even as he repeatedly played down the danger to the United States of a widespread domestic outbreak. The president’s announcement, at a White House news conference, followed mounting bipartisan criticism that the administration’s response had been sluggish and came after two days of contradictory messages about the virus, which has infected more than 81,000 people globally, killing nearly 3,000. The announcement also came on a day when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported a person with no known risk factors had been infected in Northern California. “The risk to the American people remains very low,” said Mr. Trump, flanked by top health officials from several government agencies. “We have the greatest experts, really in the world, right here.” The president said he would accept whatever amount of money congressional Democrats wanted to give for the virus response, adding, “We’re ready to adapt and we’re ready to do whatever we have to as the disease spreads, if it spreads.” “We’ll spend whatever is appropriate,” he said. Several top health care experts at the news conference echoed Mr. Trump’s optimism but also offered a more sober assessment of the future risks. Dr. Anne Schuchat, the principal deputy director of the C.D.C., warned Americans that there would be more infections. “Our aggressive containment strategy here in the United States has been working and is responsible for the low levels of cases that we have so far. However, we do expect more cases,” she said as the president stood behind her. “The trajectory of what we’re looking at over the weeks and months ahead is very uncertain.” About a half-hour later, Mr. Trump contradicted Dr. Schuchat’s assessment, telling reporters that “I don’t think it’s inevitable.” He left the door open to travel restrictions beyond China, to other hard-hit countries like South Korea and Italy, and said his early decision to stop flights from China had held the virus at bay. But the C.D.C. confirmed minutes later that a new infection in California was contracted by a person who did not appear to have traveled to countries hard hit by the virus or been exposed to a known coronavirus patient. That raised the prospect that the virus was spreading through unknown means. Health experts have questioned the C.D.C.’s decision to limit testing for the virus to people who have traveled in China or have come into contact with someone who has. Other countries are testing more broadly for the coronavirus among people from countries where outbreaks have been growing, including Italy, Iran and South Korea. Updated Feb. 29, 2020 “We’re testing everybody that we need to test,” Mr. Trump insisted, “and we’re finding very little problem, very little problem.” Earlier in the day, the president had accused journalists of making the situation “look as bad as possible” even as government health experts warned that the coronavirus threat in the United States was only beginning. Without offering any details on transmission, Alex M. Azar II, the health and human services secretary, confirmed the new case on Wednesday afternoon, bringing to 60 the total number of infections that have been counted in the United States. Mr. Azar said that health officials were still figuring out how the new person became infected. The politics of coronavirus shifted drastically on Tuesday when Dr. Nancy Messonnier, the director of the C.D.C.’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, told reporters that “it’s not so much of a question of if this will happen anymore, but rather more of a question of exactly when this will happen.” She said that hospitals and schools should begin preparing for an outbreak, and that she had even spoken with her own family about “significant disruption of our lives.” Mr. Trump sought on Wednesday to counter that message with a much less dire one, holding up a Johns Hopkins University study that he said showed the United States as the most prepared country in the world to confront a virus. He said he was “amazed” that tens of thousands of people died from the flu each year, contrasting that number with the several dozen currently infected with the coronavirus. “We’re very, very ready for this, for anything, whether it’s going to be a breakout of larger proportions or whether or not, we’re, you know, we’re at that very low level,” Mr. Trump said. The president, who is a well-known germophobe, urged Americans to be vigilant about covering their coughs and washing their hands, and he told the story of a man who recently came up to him and hugged him. “I said, ‘Are you well?’ He says, ‘No,’” Mr. Trump said. “He said, ‘I have the worst fever, and the worst flu.’ He’s hugging and kissing me. I said, ‘Excuse me,’ I went and started washing my hands.” Mr. Trump has been reluctant to give in to what he considers an “alarmist” view about the virus, an administration official said. The president has repeatedly said that, like the flu, the new coronavirus will dissipate with warmer, more humid weather even though officials have warned him that relatively little is known about the virus, and it may not behave as others do. The possibility of the virus spreading in the United States comes as the administration grapples with budget cuts and personnel moves that critics say have weakened the system for dealing with such health crises. In 2018, the White House eliminated a dedicated position on the National Security Council to coordinate pandemic response, the same year that the Trump administration narrowed its epidemiological work to 10 countries from 49. In November, a task force at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, which included five current and former Republican senators and House members, warned that “the United States remains woefully ill prepared to respond to global health security threats” and recommended the reinstatement of an N.S.C. coordinator and a recommitment of funding and attention to global health programs. Instead, the president’s budget request this month for the fiscal year that begins in October would cut the C.D.C.’s budget by almost 16 percent, and the Department of Health and Human Services’s by almost 10 percent. The proposal’s $3 billion in cuts to global health programs included a 53 percent cut to the World Health Organization and a 75 percent cut to the Pan American Health Organization. And the president’s naming of Mr. Pence as his point person immediately drew partisan fire even as he vowed to ensure that the “full resources of the American government” were deployed to protect Americans from the coronavirus. The Democratic National Committee immediately pointed out that as governor of Indiana, Mr. Pence was blamed for aggravating a severe AIDS outbreak among intravenous drug users in a rural Indiana county when he opposed calls for a clean needle exchange program on the grounds it would encourage more drug use. It has fallen to Mr. Azar to make the case that the government is up to the task of containing the virus as anxiety grows around the world about vulnerability to a still-mysterious affliction that does not respect international borders. New cases have popped up across Europe. Dozens of infections in Iran have raised fears of an unbridled spread in the Middle East. And the first confirmed case in Latin America has been reported — a Brazilian man who returned home from Italy just as Carnival is underway. The virus has infected more than 87,500 people in at least 60 countries. For the first time, more new cases were reported outside China — where the outbreak began two months ago — than inside, according to figures from the World Health Organization. The Chinese authorities cautioned that the falling infection rate might be only temporary, while South Korean officials scrambled to contain the largest outbreak of cases outside China — including an American soldier deployed to South Korea. Across the United States, universities began bringing students home from abroad and canceling overseas study programs. Mr. Trump has privately expressed frustration to numerous officials about his administration’s efforts to confront the virus, according to someone familiar with his comments. transcript Across the world, there are rising concerns of a potential coronavirus pandemic after a major jump in cases outside of China. From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” 30 countries and territories, nearly 80,000 cases. Today: South Korea, which has now 750 cases or more. And in Iran, where there have been close to 100 cases and the death toll is 15. What began as a public health crisis in China is well on its way to becoming a pandemic. It’s still unclear how the virus made it into Italy. Four new cases are here on a French territory. Japan. Canada. Afghanistan. Austria, Switzerland, and Croatia all confirming their first cases. Now. And the C.D.C. in the last hour, warning Americans to prepare for the possibility of an outbreak. As officials warn of a coming outbreak in the US — C.D.C.‘s Dr. Nancy Messonnier said it’s not a question of if the novel coronavirus will spread through the United States, but when. My colleague Donald G. McNeil Jr. on how bad the coronavirus might get. Outbreak could go any direction. I do think that we are heading towards a pandemic. It’s Thursday, February 27. Donald, I have the sense that you have covered a lot of epidemics in your career. And if this isn’t too strange a question, how many epidemics have you covered? SARS, MERS, bird flu, 2009 swine flu, Zika. Dengue and chikungunya didn’t really become epidemics. And also I’ve covered H.I.V., although that started long before my time as a health reporter. And seasonal flu. Have I forgotten anything? That’s enough, right? That seems like enough. That seems like a lot of epidemics. Yeah, and this. And by “this,” you mean — COVID-19, coronavirus infectious disease 2019. Well, that’s the reason we want to talk to you, Donald, is because you have this history and this experience when it comes to epidemics. And at this moment, there is a lot of news about this new virus, the coronavirus, but not a lot of understanding about it. So given your history, how do you rank this epidemic in terms of previous epidemics, in terms of — let me use some unscientific words here — bigness, scariness, awfulness? I spend a lot of time thinking about whether I’m being too alarmist or whether I’m being not alarmist enough. And this is alarmist, but I think right now, it’s justified. This one reminds me of what I have read about the 1918 Spanish influenza. And the reason I say that is because, right now, the only measure we have for the death rate from this flu is a study that the Chinese did of the first 45,000 cases. And of those, 80 percent were mild. 20 percent were various degrees of seriousness, up to critical and on a respirator and in organ failure. And 2.3 percent died. Now, 2.5 percent mortality is about the mortality rate of the 1918 flu. Which was a very big deal. It was a very big deal epidemic. Now, it’s not the Black Death. In the Black Death, a third of the world died. But in 1918, not everybody died, but everybody knew somebody who died. I mean, my oldest friend’s grandmother died. She was a young woman with two kids. She died. Another guy I talked to said, oh, yeah, my grandmother’s sister died in that one. I thought you were here to bring calm, Donald. I’m trying to bring a sense that if things don’t change, a lot of us might die. If you have 300 relatively close friends and acquaintances, six of them would die in a 2.5 percent mortality situation. OK, you’re painting a pretty scary portrait here. What makes this virus something so lethal and fearsome? What is it specifically about this virus? There are six kinds of coronaviruses we know about before. Two of them, SARS and MERS, kill a lot of people. Those are both coronaviruses. Yeah. SARS kills about 10 percent of the people who get it. SARS is gone. MERS kills about 30 percent of people who get it. Wow. Those are high death rates. Absolutely. But there are four other coronaviruses that cause about a quarter of all the common colds this year. And you’ve had all of them. I’ve had all of them. Everybody’s had all of them. So we’ve had coronaviruses and just maybe not called them coronaviruses. Yes, you called them, “I had a cold.” There are many causes of the common cold, but some of the most popular ones are four different coronaviruses. This doesn’t give you a common cold. It attaches deep in your lungs. So you don’t get runny nose as much as you get fevers and cough. And then ultimately, if it keeps getting bad, you get pneumonia. And that’s what kills a lot of people. The final stage of this. And it’s a viral pneumonia. So giving antibiotics does not help. So what you just said makes me think that in the grand scheme, this coronavirus is not as bad as a SARS or a MERS. So help me understand why, even though it’s seemingly statistically not as bad as those, it is something quite worrisome? SARS and MERS, if you get them, are very likely to kill you. But you’re very unlikely to get them because they don’t transmit very easily. If you don’t hang around camels or emergency rooms in Saudi Arabia, you’re unlikely to get MERS. This coronavirus is very transmissible — not as transmissible as measles. About as transmissible as flu, maybe a little bit less. But it’s quite transmissible. We saw that on the Diamond Princess. Here you had a boat with three or four people who might have had the virus on it, then suddenly they were — what was it — 600 people who had the virus on it. That’s a transmissible virus. And why is it so transmissible? What is it about the virus? Do we know? We don’t know. We know that it attaches to some receptors deep in the lung called the ACE-2 receptors, but then so do other viruses. We don’t know why this one jumps easily. Something in the genome does it, but we haven’t pinpointed that genetic change yet. So we don’t know why it’s so transmissible, but we do know that it’s passing from person to person quickly. So how exactly do you contract it? How does it transmit? It’s transmitted mostly by coughing. And we think it’s transmitted by fomites, which is to say touching surfaces. So if you’re in this room and you’ve got it, you’ve coughed all over this table. And I come in later and I don’t know you were here. And I, you know, I’ve got my hands on the table, and then I pick up my finger and I put it in my eye or my nose. I might get it. And that’s scary. Now there’s a whole question of is it got aerosol transmission, which means it drifts through the air and might go through the ventilation system into another room. That might be part of it. And there might also be some fecal transmission. But those are unimportant. The main thing is coughing and surfaces. That’s how it gets transmitted. We’re still in the early days of knowing about this virus, but that’s the prevailing theory, that those are the number one and two drivers. My sense is that when it comes to infections, this is not a virus that discriminates. That young people get it. Middle-aged people get it. Old people get it. But do we have a sense of who is most likely to contract this coronavirus? Yeah. It sounds like because it’s so transmissible, almost everybody might be able to get it. Oddly enough, children are very unlikely to get this virus. Huh. Why is that? Well, nobody knows. The theory I’ve seen that makes sense is that kids have enormous numbers of these mild coronaviruses, because that’s the typical cold virus. Kids are the ones who get colds. You go to kindergarten, you come back with a cold. So they may have some immunity from having somewhat similar but mild viruses circulating in the child population. Whereas all of us who had those viruses as kids, our immunity to those has waned. And now we have a new coronavirus. Our immune system is just not as prepared. Yeah, we’re susceptible to it. The people who are getting sick and hospitalized is basically people from 30 on up. Most of the people in the hospitals are between 30 and 79, the Chinese said. Now, the people who die is basically the older you are, the more likely you are to die. So far, the large numbers of deaths have been elderly Chinese men. That’s because the virus has been in China. But there’s also a phenomenon in China that something like 50 to 80 percent of all men smoke, and only 2 to 3 percent of all women smoke. And once you’re a smoker and you’re over 50, your lungs are kind of half shot, you know? You’ve got emphysema or C.O.P.D., maybe a mild case. But if you get a dangerous lung infection on top of that, you’re much less likely to recover. Also once you’re over 65, you have an immune system that starts weakening slowly, so you’re less able to bounce back from that kind of thing. So we see the death rates are like people in their 80s and then people in their 70s and then people in their 60s. But we’ve seen people in their 30s die from this. We’ve seen some of the doctors, you know, including the famous doctor Li Wenliang, who tried to raise the alarm. He was 33 or 34, and he died. And how do you explain that? He might have been unlucky, and he might have gotten a big blast of virus from a lot of patients. Even with viruses, the dose, to some extent, makes the poison. If you get a big load of virus in one blast, your body’s overwhelmed more quickly by it. And that may have happened to him. You’ve been talking about this death rate of around 2 or 2.5 percent from this coronavirus. And you mentioned earlier that that is a lot like the Spanish flu of 1918. For those of us who didn’t live in the early twentieth century, can you put this into a more modern context? How does this compare with the annual flu? How does this compare with something maybe a little more knowable for us? OK, this is not like the annual flu. The annual flu, in a bad year, has a death rate of around 0.1 percent. So we’re talking about 20 times as bad. That’s very meaningful. When people were going around saying, oh, not to worry about this. You should get a flu shot because the flu is a bigger threat. Yes. At this moment, the flu is a bigger threat, definitely, in the United States. But don’t think you have nothing to worry about. One thing that might happen is it might not get here in a big wave until the fall. That happened in 1918. There was a spring wave that was scary, and then the virus mostly disappeared in the summer, because a lot of viruses don’t like hot weather. But then when it came back in the fall and winter, that was the real killer wave. And that’s when a lot of people died. But we conventionally say that if the 1918 flu came back today, it wouldn’t be as deadly. Because it’s not 1918. Because in 1918, we didn’t have antibiotics, and a lot of people died of secondary bacterial pneumonias. We didn’t have mechanical ventilators to put people on. We didn’t have the steroids that cuts down on lung inflammation. We have a lot of things in modern medical care that we didn’t have then. But what’s disturbing about what you see happening in China is that a lot of people are going into hospitals and they are getting antibiotics, and they are getting Tamiflu, and they are getting antivirals, and they are getting steroids, and they are getting put on ventilators. And they still die. And that’s unexpected, and it’s quite spooky. We’ll be right back. Back now with scientists around the world working day and night to contain the coronavirus. Chinese now sharing information with the World Health Organization in the hope that it will lead to treatments for the coronavirus, but — There has been an effort to secure funding with Congress, some $2.5 billion used for vaccine development, treatment, as well as — Top health authorities have played down the rising hopes about a vaccine, as well as a treatment for the coronavirus. Donald, I want to move into diagnosis and treatment. Right now — correct me if I’m wrong — there is no treatment. Correct. Right now, there is no treatment. I mean, there’s treatment in that you hospitalize somebody. You put them on oxygen. Then you give them antibiotics so they don’t get a secondary bacterial pneumonia or things like that. But there’s nothing that actually cures this virus. Or prevents it. Correct. Nothing that prevents this virus. So what are the most promising possibilities out there to do either of those things? And what’s the timeframe we’re looking at to do that? There are several anti-viral drugs that are being tested. Some have been used against H.I.V. Some have been tried against Ebola and didn’t work. There’s an anti-malaria drug they’re trying as ways of stopping this. They’re doing tests on them in China now. And we may know the results of that trial within the next two or three weeks. So far, then, none of the experimental treatments for this are known to work. They’re still in the testing phase. Got it. Do we know anything? Frankly, I think if there was something that was a miracle drug, it would have leaked right now. They — ethically, if it was a miracle, they’d have to stop the trial early and just give everybody that drug. OK, what about a vaccine, something that would prevent this virus? A vaccine is going to take pretty close to a year to produce. A year. A year. That’s a really long time. Yeah, so we’re not — if this virus arrives here, we will not have a vaccine. And the reason is, you have to do the safety and efficacy trials. And those have to be done in animals, and then they have to be done in people. And first you have to do them in a small number of people, and then you do them in a large number of people. Because when you don’t do that, you may find — and this has happened — that the vaccine makes the problem worse. What do you mean? Well, there have been vaccines that have caused horrible side effects in the past. And there also have been vaccines that actually make you more susceptible to the disease. There was a dengue vaccine that appeared to make children more susceptible to dengue. There was an H.I.V. vaccine trial that had to be stopped because it made people more likely to catch H.I.V. OK, so during this year when a vaccine would be under development, but not yet available, paint a portrait of what is likely to happen. Now I know, based on my many years as a Times reporter, science and health reporters here do not like to speculate. But I am going to, with your permission, ask you to speculate a little bit about what that year looks like, the worst-case scenario and the best-case scenario. I don’t know what’s going to happen. But keep in mind, the 1918 flu was really the 1918-1919 flu. It started in the spring, faded in the summer, came back like a monster in the fall. That would be a worst-case kind of scenario. That we don’t have a vaccine yet by the fall, and the disease hits us hard then. In that scenario, could almost every person in the country who is not a child get the virus? Some big chunk of the country — 30, 40, 50 percent — are likely to get a new virus when it blows through. And if you don’t get it in the first wave, you might get it in the second wave. And 2 percent lethality rate of 50 percent of the country. I don’t want to do that math. It’s really, really awful. It’s a lot of people. It means, you know, you don’t die. 80 percent of people have mild cases. But you know somebody who dies. That’s pretty horrible. Yeah. Right now, it’s a smaller threat than the flu for us in the United States right now, but it could be a lot worse. And take that threat seriously. And that’s what the C.D.C. is saying, too. Prepare. It’s not just prepare as in stock up on food and buy masks. It’s more like, mentally prepare yourself for what would happen if you and all of your friends had to stay home for a month, or not be able to ride the subways, or supermarkets ran low on food. Or, you know, your medicine — your insulin or your H.I.V. meds or your heart meds or whatever it is you take — wasn’t available because the supply lines from China have been cut off. So we’ve got to mentally prepare ourselves for something like that. OK. Now, the best-case scenario. The best-case scenario is one of these drugs works, and basically everybody gets sick next year, but everybody who is hospitalized gets a drug that keeps them from dying and keeps them from going into deep, deep, deep respiratory distress. And we have the equivalent of a bad flu season. And then everybody says, oh, the media, they blew it out of proportion again. You know, it’s all ridiculous. And, you know, I get blamed. So, too bad. It’s happened before. So at this point, American health officials are saying it’s just a matter of time — and they’re not saying how much time — before this virus reaches the U.S. in a pretty meaningful way and starts to spread. So how prepared is this country? Not prepared enough. And it’s hard to know exactly how prepared we need to be. Why do you say not enough? Well, in any bad flu season, hospitals put people on all their ventilators. We have a National Strategic Stockpile, which has a lot of stuff in it — masks, gowns, gloves, drugs, even some ventilators. But you can’t stockpile enough ventilators to put — a ventilator is like a cost of a car. It’s $25,000 to $50,000. Hospitals can’t go out and order an extra hundred of those. And if they did order an extra hundred of those — It would take awhile. It would take awhile. And also you need at least three people to staff that ventilator with the patient on it around the clock. And that’s a lot of trained respiratory technicians and things. So if we get hit with a gigantic epidemic of a lot of people with pneumonia needing to be on breathing machines, we’re not prepared for that. What about preparations beyond ventilators? What happened in China, with the shutdown of Wuhan and Hubei province during Tet, during New Year, was the equivalent of shutting down Chicago and most of that surrounding part of the Midwest at Christmas time and telling people, you are now going to stay in Chicago. You can’t leave. You can’t see your families. All the flights are canceled. All the trains are canceled. All the highways are closed. You’re going to stay in there. And you’re locked in with a deadly disease. We can do it. Would we do that? We can do it, but we’re not used to being controlled from the top down the way people have been in China. So I don’t know what’s going to happen in the United States. We’re not mentally prepared to fight a sort of people’s war against an epidemic, which is what happened in China. Before I let you go, I feel like I have to ask you, given your experience covering these kinds of epidemics, what kind of preparations are you personally making? I have food in the basement anyway. I always have about a month’s worth of food in the basement, because that’s the kind of person I am. I’ll probably order some more of my heart — you know, blood pressure medicine, you know, so that I have another 90-day supply. I shouldn’t stockpile masks. I’m against it. I did go out and buy a box of 10 masks back in January. I feel a little ashamed I did that, because really those masks are more important on health care workers than they are on me. Otherwise, I’m not sure there’s much you can do. You know, I take some comfort in the fact that 80 percent of the people have a mild disease, and that might be me and everybody I love, too. We might all get lucky. But not everybody we know is going to get lucky if this turns into something like 1918. Well thank you, Donald. You’re welcome. On Wednesday, U.S. health officials reported the first American infected with the coronavirus who had not traveled to countries in which the disease was circulating. Such an infection may represent a case of community transmission, which would be a turning point for the virus in the U.S. I have just received another briefing from a great group of talented people on the virus that is going around to various parts of the world. We — On Wednesday night, President Trump addressed the nation about the virus from the White House, heralding his administration’s handling of the situation so far, describing the risk to Americans as low and appointing his Vice President, Mike Pence, to oversee the response effort. We — we’re ready to adapt, and we’re ready to do whatever we have to as the disease spreads, if it spreads. Asked whether the U.S. would undertake the kind of sweeping measures used to contain the virus in China, the president said that nothing was off the table. Mr. President, have you been presented any plans that would involve quarantining cities like we saw in China? And what would have to happen for you to take a step? We do have plans of a much — on a much larger scale, should we need that. We’re working with states. We’re working with virtually every state. And we do have plans on a larger scale if we need it. We don’t think we’re going to need it, but, you know, you always have to be prepared. As of Wednesday, more new cases of infection were reported outside of China than inside of it. The total number of cases has now surpassed 80,000, and nearly 3,000 have died. We’ll be right back. Here’s what else you need to know today. [CROWD SHOUTING] At least 25 people have died in some of India’s worst Hindu-Muslim violence in years. [CROWD SHOUTING] The violence began with a speech from a local Hindu official calling for the forceful removal of Muslims, who were protesting India’s new citizenship law, which is widely seen as discriminating against Muslims. Within hours of that speech, violence had broken out, much of it directed at Muslims. The latest case of what many inside and outside of India see as the rising danger of Hindu nationalism. That’s it for “The Daily.” I’m Michael Barbaro. See you tomorrow. transcript “So as you know, I was one of the architects of the original pandemic plans back in the Bush administration. That work is foundational. That’s what has set up our entire state and local and federal preparedness program for any type of viral outbreak like this. And so it’s really the feds — it is the blueprint for how we are operating today, including my role leading through the Emergency Support Function 8, under the national response plan, which is the doctrine that we’ve had in place now for 15 years. Innovation is vitally important, and that’s why two of the key legs of the supplemental request are to develop vaccines and therapeutics for this novel virus. Interesting —” Lawmaker: “So what happened is they flew back in 14 Americans, maybe more, who were infected with the coronavirus. That’s why someone needs to be in charge. And you know what, I think it should be you.” “They — I, I just, with respect. I want — the deputy chief of mission had a very difficult decision to make there.” Lawmaker: “I understand that. I don’t need you to explain that to me. What I’m saying is as this goes along, there needs to be someone who can overrule Homeland Security and State, who can make these decisions for the American public based on public health.” As recently as last weekend, the president grew furious that he had been sidelined from a decision to return some Americans infected with the virus to the United States, and he made his anger to Mr. Azar known. Officials in the White House have since wrestled with how best to present Mr. Trump with information during a fast-moving situation, one aide said. The White House’s muscular internal messaging efforts kicked in on Wednesday. Supporters were pelted with multiple emails assuring them that Mr. Trump was overseeing an “aggressive coronavirus response,” and that the “full weight of the U.S. government” was working to safeguard Americans from illness, according to one message. Mr. Trump’s attempts to calm the public have also occasionally been laced with a degree of alarm, with the president telling reporters on Tuesday at a news conference in India that “there’s a very good chance you’re not going to die.” Some of Mr. Trump’s political allies tried to question the motivation of some of his top health officials for warning the public about the spread of the virus. On Wednesday, Rush Limbaugh, the conservative talk radio host, argued without foundation that Dr. Messonnier was being purposely alarmist to undermine the president because she is the sister of Rod J. Rosenstein, the former deputy attorney general who was a frequent target of Mr. Trump’s ire. “In that town, I’m telling you, everything is incestuous,” Mr. Limbaugh said on his show. “Most of that town is establishment oriented or rooted, which means they despise Trump.” Mr. Trump’s reassurances to the public appear at least in part aimed at calming global markets. On Tuesday, a day after its worst one-day slide in two years, the S&P 500 closed down 3 percent. The S&P 500 ended Wednesday down about 0.4 percent, bringing its losses for the week to close to more than 6 percent. Moody’s Analytics predicted a 40 percent chance that the virus would grow into a global pandemic that would push the United States and the world into a recession. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump said he believed that “the stock market will recover; the economy is very strong.” For a second day, Mr. Azar was on Capitol Hill on Wednesday defending his work, telling lawmakers that he was overseeing “the smoothest interagency process I’ve experienced in my 20 years of dealing with public health emergencies.” He said that the C.D.C. had already exhausted the $105 million rapid-response fund that the federal government had been using in its initial response efforts. He has proposed shifting $136 million from other health programs to the coronavirus to replenish the government’s efforts. A day earlier, he told a Senate panel that medical supplies were badly needed for the nation’s emergency stockpile, including 300 million masks for health care workers alone. But on Wednesday, he faced bipartisan concern about the administration’s $2.5 billion request. Lawmakers from both parties have said the White House request is far short of what is needed and relies on the transfer of existing funds — including $535 million intended to counter the spread of the Ebola virus. “These cuts are shameful,” Representative Anna G. Eshoo, Democrat of California, said Wednesday at a separate House hearing with Mr. Azar. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, proposed on Wednesday to increase the president’s emergency request drastically, to $8.5 billion in new funds, including $3 billion for a public health emergency fund, $1.5 billion for the C.D.C., $1 billion for vaccine development and $2 billion for reimbursing states and cities for efforts they have so far made to monitor and prepare for potential cases of the virus. Mr. Trump said he would gladly accept the additional funds.

2020,Trump Names Richard Grenell as Acting Head of Intelligence,"The move places a loyalist atop the intelligence agencies that the president has long battled. WASHINGTON — President Trump on Wednesday named Richard Grenell, the ambassador to Germany who quickly antagonized the establishment after arriving in Berlin in 2018, to be the acting director of national intelligence overseeing the nation’s 17 spy agencies. By choosing Mr. Grenell, who has little experience in intelligence or in running a large bureaucracy, the president signaled that he wants a trusted, aggressive leader atop an intelligence community that he has long viewed with suspicion and at times gone to war against. As ambassador, Mr. Grenell made public statements that some German officials took as expressing opposition to the government there, an extraordinary intervention into domestic affairs that diplomats typically avoid. He attacked what he called “failed” open-border policies in Germany, which has resettled hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees, and criticized Berlin’s stances on Iran, military spending and Chinese investment in global telephone networks. He also expressed an eagerness to empower conservatives throughout Europe. “I absolutely want to empower other conservatives throughout Europe, other leaders,” Mr. Grenell told Breitbart, a far-right website, in an interview shortly after his arrival in Germany. “I think there is a groundswell of conservative policies that are taking hold because of the failed policies of the left.” While intelligence directors have tried to serve as neutral arbiters of facts, Mr. Grenell’s experience as an ideological advocate prompted some former officials to express concern that he could color the intelligence he presents to Mr. Trump rather than present an objective assessment. “This is a job requiring leadership, management, substance and secrecy,” said John Sipher, a former C.I.A. officer. “He doesn’t have the kind of background and experience we would expect for such a critical position.” Mr. Grenell is expected to keep his current ambassadorship as long as he is acting intelligence director, one administration official said. Mr. Grenell did not respond to a request for comment. His bare-knuckled approach clearly resonates with the president and his inner circle. Last spring, shortly before the now-infamous removal of the American ambassador to Ukraine, Marie L. Yovanovitch, Mr. Trump’s oldest son, Donald Trump Jr., invoked Mr. Grenell in a tweet about conservative discontent with Ms. Yovanovitch. “We need more @RichardGrenell’s and less of these jokers as ambassadors,” the younger Mr. Trump wrote. Mr. Grenell, who has pushed to advance gay rights in his current post, is also thought to be the first openly gay cabinet member. Republican senators had privately pushed the Trump administration to nominate a national security professional for the post, and advisers made clear that the president was not nominating Mr. Grenell for the permanent job. Mr. Trump has installed acting leaders in other top government vacancies, giving him freedom to maneuver around the demands of Senate confirmation. By law, the current acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, has to give up his temporary role before March 12. Mr. Grenell is expected to begin his new job on Thursday. Mr. Maguire, in a statement on Wednesday, thanked Mr. Trump and said that when he was confirmed by the Senate to lead the counterterrorism center, he “never imagined what would follow.” Mr. Trump can choose any Senate-confirmed official to replace Mr. Maguire, who has served as the acting director of national intelligence since the resignation last summer of Dan Coats, a former Republican senator from Indiana. Mr. Grenell was confirmed by the Senate for his current job after a delay caused by parliamentary tactics that stirred a bipartisan outcry. He would be the latest in a line of intelligence directors who have had varied policy experience including diplomatic or military backgrounds rather than stints in the intelligence world. But Mr. Grenell is also an acerbic combatant who throws regular punches at “fake news” reporters and Mr. Trump’s opponents online. Last month, he angrily demanded The Washington Post retract a report, which he insisted was based on fabricated sources, that Mr. Trump had threatened to impose auto tariffs on European cars if European leaders did not adopt a tougher line on Iran’s nuclear program. The next day, Germany’s defense minister publicly confirmed it. Mr. Grenell honed his combative style when he worked as a spokesman at the United Nations for the former ambassador John R. Bolton. Often to the surprise — and sometimes the horror — of the State Department’s more staid communications officials who worked for Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Mr. Grenell would take on reporters and argue long into the night about stories appearing in major newspapers and on television. In recent days, after Attorney General William P. Barr said in an interview that Mr. Trump’s tweets made his job more difficult, Mr. Grenell appeared on Fox News to counter that view. “It makes my job so much easier,” Mr. Grenell said, offering the example of Mr. Trump’s pressure on NATO allies to spend more on defense. In a country where former President Barack Obama is still widely popular, Mr. Grenell’s style put off other officials and ultimately isolated him, the German publication Der Spiegel reported last year. “The powerful avoid him,” the newsmagazine wrote. “Doors have been shut.” Much of Mr. Grenell’s criticism has been directed at German military spending, its decision to stand behind the nuclear deal with Iran and its wavering on the American demand to ban Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications giant, from building next-generation mobile networks. He has also had successes, including getting Germany to agree to take American liquefied natural gas and to pull the landing rights of an Iranian airline. A number of German companies have pulled out of Iran, warned by Mr. Grenell that they could run afoul of American sanctions if they did business with Tehran. And while German military spending has continued to rise during the Trump administration, the government in Berlin has ratcheted back its goals for increasing spending. While most of the previous directors of national intelligence have tried to take a nonpartisan tone, Mr. Trump has looked askance at officials who have tried to remain neutral. He has increasingly looked to people for positions who he believes share his views. “Grenell, from the beginning, was an ultraright-wing sniper on social media,” said Douglas H. Wise, a former senior intelligence official. “He is certainly in line with the Trump agenda.” Intelligence professionals reacted with surprise, and some with disappointment, questioning Mr. Grenell’s experience and temperament. The appointment demonstrated that Mr. Trump little understands or values the intelligence community, said Nicholas J. Rasmussen, the former head of the National Counterterrorism Center. “Personal loyalty is prized above relevant experience and demonstrated competence,” said Mr. Rasmussen, now the acting executive director of the McCain Institute. “Professionalism and integrity are devalued. The signal this sends to our career national security and intelligence professionals is unmistakable.” Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia and the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, criticized Mr. Trump for appointing another acting director, rather than choosing an official nominee, “apparently in an effort to side step the Senate’s constitutional authority.” While it has never been clear how Mr. Trump viewed Mr. Maguire, there is little doubt that the president would prefer a partisan fighter in the post. Mr. Maguire, a retired admiral, became the acting director in August just as a whistle-blower inside the C.I.A. filed a complaint about Mr. Trump’s dealings with Ukraine. Since even before the acquittal of Mr. Trump in the Senate impeachment trial, the president has been pushing to remove officials seen as disloyal to or undermining of the president or holding views contrary to the White House, looking for replacements who are more likely to follow the president’s wishes. Mr. Trump has at times disparaged American intelligence agencies because he did not agree with their findings, perhaps chiefly the conclusion that Russia interfered with the 2016 presidential election to help him win. He told his intelligence chiefs to “go back to school” after they offered assessments on Iran and North Korea at odds with his policy initiatives. Anxious to avoid a repeat, Mr. Maguire’s aides initially pushed for this year’s public hearing to be canceled, a request that lawmakers have rejected. Tensions between the White House and intelligence agencies only grew during the impeachment inquiry. Mr. Maguire initially blocked the whistle-blower complaint from being forwarded to Congress, following the guidance of administration lawyers. But he eventually helped broker the agreement to provide the complaint to Congress’s intelligence committees, allowing the impeachment inquiry to gain steam. When Mr. Coats announced his resignation in July, Mr. Trump initially nominated a Republican ally in Congress, Representative John Ratcliffe of Texas, to be the next top intelligence chief, a job considered to be among the most nonpartisan in Washington. But Mr. Trump quickly dropped those plans after pushback from Democrats and some key Republicans who worried Mr. Ratcliffe’s loyalty to the president and lack of intelligence experience would make him nearly impossible to confirm. There were also concerns that Mr. Ratcliffe exaggerated some of what he included on his résumé. After Mr. Ratcliffe was dropped from consideration, Mr. Trump promised to announce a new nominee soon. But the list of people with the requisite experience who have not been critical of the president is slim. The administration considered, and discarded, a number of potential nominees, including Pete Hoekstra, the American ambassador to the Netherlands and a former Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, and Representative Chris Stewart, a Utah Republican on the committee.

2020,Trump Opens National Monument Land to Energy Exploration,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration on Thursday finalized plans to allow mining and energy drilling on nearly a million acres of land in southern Utah that had once been protected as part of a major national monument. The Interior Department’s release of a formal land-use blueprint for the approximately 861,974 acres of land will allow oil, gas and coal companies to complete the legal process for leasing mines and wells on land that had once been part of Utah’s Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, established by President Bill Clinton. In December 2017, President Trump cut the monument’s acreage about in half, aiming to open the newly unprotected land for drilling and development. At the same time, he removed about a million acres from another Utah monument, Bears Ears. Together, the moves were the largest rollback of public lands protection in United States history. The land carved from the Bears Ears monument, which was established in 2016 by President Barack Obama, has been open for companies to begin the oil and gas leasing process for some time. Because that land had been protected for less than a year, Interior Department officials said, reversal was quick. Trump administration officials said Thursday’s move was a win for the Utah economy. “The approved plans keep the commitment of this administration to the families and communities of Utah that know and love this land the best and will care for these resources for many generations to come,” said Casey Hammond, the Interior Department’s acting assistant secretary for land and minerals management. To date, no oil, gas or coal companies have taken any of the legal first steps required to mine or drill on the land, although they could have done so at any time in the months following Mr. Trump’s proclamation that he was removing protection from the land, a spokeswoman for the Interior Department said. “There has been almost no interest in mining and drilling on the lands excluded from Grand Staircase,” said Kimberly Finch, the spokeswoman. If a company or individual chooses to explore for minerals or fossil fuels on that land, they could likely purchase a lease from the federal government to mine or drill within a year. Environmentalists decried the latest step in the Trump administration’s efforts to open public lands to energy exploration. “These plans are atrocious, and entirely predictable,” said Sharon Buccino, senior director for lands at the Natural Resources Defense Council. “They are the latest in a series of insults to these magnificent lands by the Trump administration.” For more climate news sign up for the Climate Fwd: newsletter or follow @NYTClimate on Twitter.",The New York Times
2020,Trump Places Loyalists in Key Jobs Inside the White House While Raging Against Enemies Outside,"President Trump had a busy morning on Twitter and the radio, in a tirade that rivaled his most grievance-filled moments since becoming president. WASHINGTON — President Trump made a number of staff moves on Thursday to ensure he will be surrounded by a cadre of loyalists at the White House even as he raged against an ever-growing cast of perceived enemies that included his former chief of staff, an impeachment witness, a juror he accused of bias and a Democratic rival. The White House announced the return of Hope Hicks, the president’s former communications director and one of his closest advisers. The move consolidated the position of Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and adviser, and signaled the waning influence of Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff. Ms. Hicks will serve as a counselor to the president, reporting to Mr. Kushner. Her return to the president’s side after his acquittal in the impeachment inquiry is an indication that Mr. Trump is seeking to reassemble as best he can the small, intensely devoted team of family members and friends who helped guide him to an improbable victory in 2016. Johnny McEntee, the “body man” who trailed Mr. Trump as a candidate and in the White House, will be elevated to oversee the Presidential Personnel Office, according to four people briefed on the move. Mr. McEntee, who was forced from his job in 2018 over gambling debts that threatened his security clearance, recently returned to his old role as a personal aide to Mr. Trump. The West Wing changes came just hours before Attorney General William P. Barr issued a remarkable rebuke of Mr. Trump, saying the president’s attacks on the Justice Department over the case of Roger J. Stone Jr. made it “impossible for me to do my job” and asserting that “I’m not going to be bullied or influenced by anybody.” Earlier Thursday, Mr. Trump engaged in an hourslong series of rants on Twitter and in a radio interview, hurling insults and unproved accusations in a tirade that rivaled his most grievance-filled moments since becoming president. In rapid-fire fashion, Mr. Trump alleged bias from a juror in the trial of Mr. Stone, his longtime friend, and belittled John F. Kelly, his former chief of staff, as an ineffective aide who “misses the action & just can’t keep his mouth shut.” In a speech on Wednesday, Mr. Kelly had defended Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman, the decorated national security official who testified in the impeachment inquiry and was removed from his job last week. The president said Colonel Vindman’s exit from the White House — he was escorted out by security officers — was applauded by “the whole building.” Moments later, Mr. Trump mocked the physical stature of Michael R. Bloomberg, a Democratic candidate for president and the former mayor of New York. “Mini Mike is a 5’4” mass of dead energy who does not want to be on the debate stage with these professional politicians,” Mr. Trump said, sneering at the idea that Mr. Bloomberg might stand on a box during a debate. “No boxes please.” Mr. Bloomberg is actually 5-foot-7. Mr. Bloomberg, a billionaire who has already spent more than $350 million in his bid for the Democratic nomination, wasted no time returning fire at the man he hopes to face in November’s election. “We know many of the same people in NY,” he wrote. “Behind your back they laugh at you & call you a carnival barking clown. They know you inherited a fortune & squandered it with stupid deals and incompetence. I have the record & the resources to defeat you. And I will.” In his speech at Drew University in New Jersey, first reported by The Atlantic, Mr. Kelly said that Colonel Vindman was right to raise questions about a telephone call with the president of Ukraine in which Mr. Trump pressed for investigations into his political rivals. “He did exactly what we teach them to do from cradle to grave,” Mr. Kelly said. “He went and told his boss of what he just heard. We teach them: ‘Don’t follow an illegal order. And if you’re ever given one, you’ll raise it to whoever gives it to you that this is an illegal order, and then you’ll tell your boss.’” The remarks drew a swift response from the president, who tweeted on Thursday morning that Mr. Kelly, who served as the chief of staff for 17 months before resigning early last year, was “way over his head” in the job. He also suggested that Mr. Kelly’s public comments violated a “military and legal obligation” to remain silent. John R. Bolton, the president’s former national security adviser, who clashed with Mr. Kelly when the two were White House colleagues, came to his defense. Mr. Kelly has “always served his country faithfully,” Mr. Bolton said in a statement, and called on conservatives to “reject baseless attacks upon him.” In the radio interview with Geraldo Rivera, Mr. Trump also renewed his attacks on Colonel Vindman, describing him as “very insubordinate” and claiming that Colonel Vindman’s colleagues applauded his departure last Friday. “Vindman was the guy that, when we took him out of the building, the whole building applauded,” Mr. Trump said. A senior National Security Council official said later that Mr. Trump’s description was accurate, but did not say he had firsthand knowledge of it. David Pressman, a lawyer for Colonel Vindman, did not address a question about the applause, but said in a statement that the “continued public attacks by the president of the United States on an active-duty officer in the military are designed to intimidate and to punish.” He added, “By using the power of his office to repeatedly humiliate and punish those following the law, the president is encouraging breaking the law.” Mr. Trump also suggested during the radio interview that he could stop the tradition of allowing numerous national security officials to listen to his phone calls with foreign leaders, as Colonel Vindman did with the Ukraine call. “I may end the practice,” Mr. Trump said. “I may end it entirely.” The changes at the White House will bring familiar faces back to the West Wing. Always obsessed with the threat of leaks, Mr. Trump has become more concerned about loyalty since a whistle-blower came forward last year to express concerns about the Ukraine call. Ms. Hicks, 31, worked on Mr. Trump’s 2016 campaign from its inception and followed him to the White House, eventually becoming communications director. Her return will come as his re-election campaign intensifies and as his advisers say the superstitious president has talked about recreating some aspects of that first race. Ms. Hicks’s title when she left belied her influence with Mr. Trump, who felt more personal comfort with her than with almost any other adviser. A senior administration official said that Ms. Hicks would work on projects that Mr. Kushner oversees, including the re-election campaign. She will not rejoin the communications office. “There is no one more devoted to implementing President Trump’s agenda than Hope Hicks,” Mr. Kushner said in a statement. “We are excited to have her back on the team.” Ms. Hicks’s time with Mr. Trump began when she was working as an aide for his elder daughter, Ivanka Trump, on her fashion brand. He hired her for his skeleton staff when he began his campaign for president in 2015, and because the campaign was so small, Ms. Hicks was constantly at Mr. Trump’s side. Since last fall, Ms. Hicks had been working as the chief communications officer at Fox. Eileen Sullivan and Michael Crowley contributed reporting.",The New York Times
2020,Opinion | Trump Posts Another ‘Keep Out’ Sign for Immigrants,"The administration’s security rationale for its latest red tape on travel from African and Asian countries doesn’t ring true. The editorial board is a group of opinion journalists whose views are informed by expertise, research, debate and certain longstanding values. It is separate from the newsroom. On Friday, with Americans focused on President Trump’s impeachment trial, the coronavirus and the upcoming Iowa caucuses, the Trump administration announced it was adding six more countries to the list of those whose citizens face travel restrictions to the United States. The given reason was that those nations were not sufficiently screening people who sought to come to America. The six countries affected when the travel ban takes effect on Feb. 22 are Sudan, Tanzania, Eritrea, Myanmar, Kyrgyzstan and Nigeria. All have sizable, if not majority, Muslim populations — in Myanmar’s case, Muslims are a minority that is severely repressed. According to the acting secretary of homeland security, Chad Wolf, these countries fell short in new vetting criteria for “terrorists and criminals attempting to enter the United States.” The restrictions differ — Sudan and Tanzania are barred from the “diversity visa” lottery, while the other countries face a suspension of entry for immigrants. Travel for tourism and reasons other than immigration remains open — a curious gap if the purpose of the restrictions is to keep out potential terrorists. It may be that the countries do somehow fall short in vetting would-be emigrants. And since the conservative-controlled Supreme Court upheld Mr. Trump’s ban on travel from several predominantly Muslim countries — Iran, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Somalia and Chad (later removed from the list) — as well as Venezuela and North Korea in June 2018, the new ban would most likely survive legal challenge. But it doesn’t take a lot of intuition to guess that security is not foremost on the president’s mind. Blocking the immigration of people of color, Muslims or non-English speakers has been among the most frequent of Mr. Trump’s pitches to his base, and the timing for a new ban was propitious. It was the third anniversary of his first travel ban, the impeachment drama was sputtering to an end and the starting gun for the 2020 election season was about to go off in Iowa (or, as it happened, to pathetically misfire). With all the Democratic candidates opposed to Mr. Trump’s immigration policies, what better time to remind his followers that Mr. Trump was still standing guard at the gates? Yet the latest ban makes as little sense as the first one, and it stands to do far more harm than good. A 2018 study by the libertarian Cato Institute found that the Trump administration’s “extreme vetting” of travelers and immigrants, of which the travel ban is a centerpiece, would not significantly reduce the already minuscule risk of imported terrorism achieved by visa reforms after 9/11, but would come at exponentially greater cost. The risk of any American being killed in the United States by a refugee or immigrant is negligible, Cato found. Apart from the cruelty of barring thousands of family reunifications, the new restrictions could actually hurt the American economy. The ban is certain to strain relations with the newly listed countries. Five of them, including Nigeria, which has Africa’s largest economy, are being avidly courted by China as part of its “Belt and Road Initiative,” and could well conclude that China is a more trustworthy and predictable partner than the United States. Adding ignorance to insult, Mr. Trump has consistently misrepresented the diversity lottery program, from which he is now excluding Sudan and Tanzania, as a means for poor countries to dump people they don’t want on the United States. In fact, the Diversity Immigrant Visa Program is administered by the State Department to increase immigration from countries with low rates of immigration, and candidates must have at least the equivalent of a high school diploma or two years of work experience to qualify. The veneer of process and rationale over the latest travel ban cannot conceal its fundamental malice. The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

2020,Trump Praises Barr for Rejecting Punishment Recommended for Stone,"The president dismissed criticism that the Justice Department had acted inappropriately in overruling the recommendation of its own prosecutors in the case of his longtime friend. transcript Reporter: “On Roger Stone, isn’t your tweet political interference?” “No, not at all. He was treated very badly — nine years recommended. If you look at what happened — I want to thank the Justice Department for seeing this horrible thing. And I didn’t speak to him, by the way, just so you understand. They saw the horribleness of a nine-year sentence for doing nothing. You have murderers and drug addicts, they don’t get nine years — nine years for doing something that nobody even can define what he did.

And then they put a man in jail and destroy his life, his family, his wife, his children — nine years in jail. It’s a disgrace. In the meantime, Comey walks around making book deals. The people that launched this scam investigation, and what they did is a disgrace.” WASHINGTON — President Trump congratulated Attorney General William P. Barr on Wednesday for intervening to lower the Justice Department’s sentencing recommendation for the president’s longtime friend Roger J. Stone Jr., calling his prosecution “a disgrace” for which he deserves an apology. In sharply worded tweets and comments to reporters, Mr. Trump dismissed criticism that the Justice Department was abandoning its traditional independence by responding to his unhappiness with the recommendation that Mr. Stone serve up to nine years in prison for obstructing a congressional inquiry. “Congratulations to Attorney General Bill Barr for taking charge of a case that was totally out of control and perhaps should not have even been brought,” Mr. Trump tweeted. He compared the Stone case to the Russia investigation led by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel. “Evidence now clearly shows that the Mueller Scam was improperly brought & tainted. Even Bob Mueller lied to Congress!” Mr. Trump said, though he did not explain the accusation against Mr. Mueller, a former F.B.I. director. Mr. Trump’s comments came less than 24 hours after four career prosecutors withdrew from the Stone case after senior officials at the department overruled the seven- to nine-year term they had recommended Mr. Stone receive. One of the prosecutors also resigned from the Justice Department, where he worked in the public integrity section. The reaction by the prosecutors and the president’s subsequent comments roiled Washington for a second day as Democratic lawmakers, former law enforcement officials and ethics watchdog groups accused Mr. Trump of abusing the power of his office to influence the Justice Department in a continuing criminal case. Eric H. Holder Jr., who served as attorney general under President Barack Obama, called the situation “unprecedented.” Walter M. Shaub Jr., the former director of the Office of Government Ethics, likened Tuesday’s actions by Mr. Trump and the Justice Department to those in countries with authoritarian regimes. “A corrupt authoritarian and his henchmen are wielding the Justice Department as a shield for friends and a sword for political rivals,” Mr. Shaub said Wednesday in a Twitter post. “It is impossible to overstate the danger.” Mr. Stone was convicted in November of obstructing the House Intelligence Committee’s examination of Russian interference in the 2016 election by lying to investigators under oath and trying to block the testimony of a witness who would have exposed his lies. The initial sentencing recommendation for Mr. Stone was filed late Monday. On Tuesday, it was amended and refiled stating that the earlier version “did not accurately reflect the Department of Justice’s position on what would be a reasonable sentence in this matter.” The department instead suggested an unspecified term. The department’s action followed a Fox News report on the recommendation and a Twitter post by Mr. Trump, who said: “This is a horrible and very unfair situation. The real crimes were on the other side, as nothing happens to them. Cannot allow this miscarriage of justice!” The decision to override the recommended sentence was made by officials from the offices of Mr. Barr and the deputy attorney general. The Justice Department said on Tuesday that the case was not discussed with anyone at the White House. Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office before meeting with President Lenín Moreno of Ecuador on Wednesday, Mr. Trump denied that his tweet about Mr. Barr was political and called the prosecution of Mr. Stone “a disgrace.” Asked whether he would pardon Mr. Stone, the president said, “I don’t want to say that yet, but I tell you what: People were hurt viciously and badly by these corrupt people.” He added that it was unfair that prosecutors recommended that Mr. Stone be sentenced to nine years in prison when James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, has not been jailed. He said that prosecutors “ought to apologize to him.” “You have murderers and drug addicts that don’t get nine years,” the president said. “Nine years for doing something that no one can even define what he did.” “In the meantime, Comey walks around making book deals,” Mr. Trump lamented. Presidents have typically avoided interfering in Justice Department decisions to avoid allegations of improper influence, though there is no law against it. Mr. Trump has publicly inserted himself into several department matters, in some instances to protect friends like Mr. Stone and to direct investigations into his political rivals. The president has also demanded loyalty from his subordinates and has repeatedly praised Mr. Barr’s leadership of the department. But the unusual step of overruling the decisions of career prosecutors, particularly in such a politically charged case, reinforced concerns by Democrats and others that Mr. Trump was tipping the scales of justice in favor of his interests. “I do not take a position on the proper prison term for Mr. Stone, but it would be a blatant abuse of power if President Trump has in fact intervened to reverse the recommendations of career prosecutors at the Department of Justice,” said Representative Adam B. Schiff, a California Democrat who led the House’s impeachment of the president. Mr. Schiff is also the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, which Mr. Stone was convicted of obstructing. Mr. Holder said in a Twitter post just after midnight on Wednesday, “This affects the rule of law and respect for it.” “Do not underestimate the danger of this situation: the political appointees in the DOJ are involving themselves in an inappropriate way in cases involving political allies of the President,” he added.

2020,Trump Promotes Low Unemployment and Rising Wages in State of the Union,"The president emphasized a “blue collar” boom in his speech to Congress. But workers in those industries have seen a slowdown — or even losses — in jobs. WASHINGTON — President Trump used his State of the Union address on Tuesday to tick off a laundry list of economic gains, citing record low unemployment for women, higher incomes for households and a “blue collar” boom that he said is underway across America. The speech showcased what will be Mr. Trump’s primary message as he heads into a re-election campaign that he hopes will be a referendum on the United States economy. But it also overstated the strength of an economic expansion that has slowed or stalled for parts of his base. “Jobs are booming. Incomes are soaring. Poverty is plummeting,” Mr. Trump said. “America’s fortunes are on the rise.” He added, “I am thrilled to report to you tonight that our economy is the best it has ever been.” The economic expansion has now reached its 11th year, a record for the modern era of economic statistics in the United States. Unemployment sank to 3.5 percent in December, down from 4.7 percent when Mr. Trump took office. Workers’ wages are growing, particularly for those in the jobs that pay the least, like retail clerks and restaurant workers. The stock market, which is one of the president’s favorite gauges of economic success, is up about 20 percent from a year ago. Forty percent of Americans say they are better off financially than they were at the same time last year — double the number who say they are worse off, according to a survey conducted last month for The New York Times by the online research firm SurveyMonkey. That is the brightest economic outlook respondents have expressed in the three years the survey has been conducted. Independent voters, a particularly crucial electoral bloc, reported a surge in confidence in the latest survey. And yet the economy grew faster under several of Mr. Trump’s predecessors than it has on his watch. When he bragged of the economy’s strength on Tuesday, Mr. Trump frequently cited “record” low rates of unemployment and poverty, which are in part attributable to the low and falling rates he inherited from former President Barack Obama. The economy’s improvement has also slowed on several fronts since last year, particularly in the president’s favored blue-collar sectors like mining and manufacturing. Mr. Trump declared in his 2019 State of the Union speech that “an economic miracle is taking place in the United States, and the only thing that can stop it are foolish wars, politics or ridiculous partisan investigations.” Over the last year, the president’s economic policies have not delivered anything close to the miracle he had promised to white working-class voters in the industrial Midwest. Combined employment in construction, manufacturing and mining grew more slowly last year than at almost any other point in the current expansion. Job growth has slowed sharply — from 2.6 percent at the start of 2019 to 1.3 percent at the end of the year — in so-called middle-wage sectors that include mining, construction and transportation, according to calculations by Nick Bunker, an economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab. That blue-collar slowdown is driving the deceleration of job growth across the United States economy. Mr. Trump’s policies have also not revived employment in coal mining, as he promised; the sector lost 1,000 jobs nationwide in 2019, according to the Labor Department. Primary metals manufacturing, which includes the steel and aluminum industries that Mr. Trump claimed to have restored with tariffs, shed about 12,000 jobs in 2019. Employment growth in manufacturing, which Mr. Trump promoted in his speech last year, slowed to fewer than 50,000 jobs in 2019 — the worst rate of his presidency and the second worst of the long recovery from recession. Mr. Trump nodded implicitly to that slowdown in his speech on Tuesday night. Last year, he claimed, incorrectly, that the United States had created 600,000 factory jobs during his tenure. On Tuesday, he revised that number down to “half a million,” which is the correct figure. Many economists blame the economy’s deceleration on the trade wars Mr. Trump has waged with China and other countries that send steel, aluminum, washing machines and solar panels to the United States. Economic growth slowed to 2.3 percent last year, according to data released last month by the Commerce Department. That is a percentage point less than what Mr. Trump’s advisers predicted for the year. Across Mr. Trump’s three years in office, growth has never reached the 3 percent rate that administration forecasters have projected. It has fallen well short of Mr. Trump’s campaign promises of 4, 5 or even 6 percent annual rates. Independent economists expect only modest growth this year from the initial trade deal that Mr. Trump reached with China and the revamped North American trade pact that he signed last week. And while Mr. Trump signed a large tax cut in 2017, it has failed to produce the sustained investment boom that he and Republicans promised. After surging in 2018 following a cut in the corporate income tax rate, business investment shrank for the final three quarters of 2019. Investment has now grown more slowly in the quarters after the tax cut than it did in the eight years, including the end of the Great Recession, under Mr. Obama. Mr. Trump’s only mention of business investment was in reference to opportunity zones, a creation of the 2017 tax law that bestowed tax incentives on investors who put money into projects in so-called distressed communities. He did not directly mention the corporate rate cuts that were the centerpiece of the 2017 law, nor the investment decline. Mr. Trump did not propose a new round of tax cuts, as his advisers had hinted he might. His most substantial economic policy proposal was to call on Congress to pass a bipartisan family leave law that has been championed by his daughter Ivanka Trump. The president was unequivocal in saying that his policies had fundamentally transformed the economy. “The days of our country being used, taken advantage of and even scorned by other nations are long behind us,” he said. “Gone, too, are the broken promises, jobless recoveries, tired platitudes and constant excuses for the depletion of American wealth, power and prestige.” Other analysts say Mr. Trump has benefited from a historically anomalous economic stimulus while unemployment is low. The Federal Reserve ended a slow march of interest rate increases last year and slashed rates instead, spurring growth and stock gains. Combined with military and other federal spending increases that bipartisan majorities in Congress passed and Mr. Trump signed into law, the tax cuts have helped to swell the federal budget deficit to $1 trillion a year. Mr. Trump did not mention the Fed, a frequent target of his criticism, or the growing deficit in his speech. Updated Feb. 29, 2020",The New York Times
2020,"Trump Renews Attack on Justice System, Again Disregarding Barr’s Pleas","In lashing out at the prosecution of Roger Stone and “dirty cops,” the president confronted the attorney general with a choice about how to respond. transcript So before we go any further, I want to address today’s sentencing of a man Roger Stone. Roger Stone. He’s become a big part of the news over the last little while and I’m following this very closely and I want to see it play out to its fullest, because Roger has a very good chance of exoneration in my opinion. But I’m not going to do anything in terms of the great powers bestowed upon a president of the United States. I want the process to play out. I think that’s the best thing to do, because I’d love to see Roger exonerated and I’d love to see it happen because I personally think he was treated very unfairly. WASHINGTON — President Trump once again berated the “dirty cops” of the law enforcement establishment on Thursday, accusing the Justice Department of going after his friends but not his enemies in an outburst that flouted Attorney General William P. Barr’s pleas to stop publicly intervening in prosecutions where he had a personal interest. Speaking out hours after his friend Roger J. Stone Jr. was sentenced to more than three years in prison for lying to protect the president, Mr. Trump belittled the case and hinted broadly that he would use his clemency power to spare Mr. Stone if a judge did not agree to a retrial sought by defense lawyers. In essentially dangling a pardon or a commutation for a friend, Mr. Trump confronted Mr. Barr with a choice about how to respond after he declared last week that the president’s attacks on the criminal justice system were making his job “impossible.” “A lot of bad things are happening, and we’re cleaning it out,” Mr. Trump said of law enforcement at a Las Vegas event for former convicts re-entering society. “We’re cleaning the swamp. We’re draining the swamp. I just never knew how deep the swamp was.” He added: “We had a lot of dirty cops. F.B.I. is phenomenal. I love the people in the F.B.I. But the people at the top were dirty cops.” Mr. Barr last week reversed the Justice Department’s original request, in line with federal guidelines, for a term of seven to nine years for Mr. Stone, leading four career prosecutors to quit the case and one to resign from the department altogether. But even as he agreed with Mr. Trump that the sentencing recommendation was excessive, he went on ABC News to publicly ask the president to stop commenting because “I cannot do my job here at the department with a constant background commentary that undercuts me.” Mr. Trump later agreed that he was making Mr. Barr’s job harder but indicated he would not stay quiet. While Mr. Trump again erupted on Thursday, some in Mr. Barr’s camp took solace in the fact that the president did not directly attack the judge in the case, Amy Berman Jackson, the prosecutors or the sentence itself and that he said he admired the F.B.I. rank and file, even though he continued to target its current and former leadership. Mr. Barr has come to recognize that he may never be able to keep Mr. Trump quiet altogether and so in parsing the president’s latest comments, the attorney general and his team chose to see them as progress and an opportunity to work out their differences without further public exchange. Mr. Barr, who has suggested to associates that he may have to resign if the president keeps tweeting about individual prosecutions, stayed silent after Mr. Trump’s remarks, and the department declined to comment. Over the last week, some of Mr. Trump’s closest Republican allies in Congress, including Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and some of the president’s favorite Fox News commentators have been trying to smooth over the rift by vouching for Mr. Barr and urging the president to let the legal process play out, according to people familiar with the matter. After the judge sentenced Mr. Stone on Thursday, Mr. Graham noted on Twitter that the term was “on the lower end” and emphasized that a president could always grant clemency. He urged that there be no undue interference in legal cases — without quite saying whom he was addressing. “It is important to give both the government and the accused a fair trial free from influence,” Mr. Graham wrote. “I believe this has been accomplished in Mr. Stone’s case. Like all Americans, Mr. Stone can appeal the fairness of his trial and the verdict rendered. Under our system of justice President Trump has all the legal authority in the world to review this case, in terms of commuting the sentence or pardoning Mr. Stone for the underlying offense.” Mr. Trump’s critics maintained that extending clemency to Mr. Stone would amount to self-dealing for a president who stood to benefit from the convicted adviser’s lies about connections to WikiLeaks, which disseminated Democratic emails stolen by Russian agents to damage Hillary Clinton during the 2016 campaign. “Roger Stone was found guilty of lying to Congress and threatening a witness,” said Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, the panel that Mr. Stone was convicted of obstructing. “He did it to cover up for Trump. His sentence is justified. It should go without saying, but to pardon Stone when his crimes were committed to protect Trump would be a breathtaking act of corruption.” In his speech on Thursday, Mr. Trump dismissed the significance of Mr. Stone’s crimes. He complained that the Justice Department prosecuted his friend for lying and obstructing a congressional inquiry, but did not charge his enemies like Mrs. Clinton, the former F.B.I. director James B. Comey, Mr. Comey’s onetime deputy Andrew G. McCabe or the former F.B.I. officials Lisa Page and Peter Strzok. “What happened to him is unbelievable,” Mr. Trump said of Mr. Stone. “They say he lied. But other people lied, too. Just to mention, Comey lied. McCabe lied. Lisa Page lied. Her lover, Strzok, Peter Strzok, lied. You don’t know who these people are? Just trust me, they all lied.” He went on to revive the email case involving Mrs. Clinton. “Hillary Clinton leaked more classified documents than any human being, I believe, in the history of the United States,” he said. But, he added, “nothing happened to her.” In repeating his attacks on his favorite targets, Mr. Trump distorted or misstated the facts. Mrs. Clinton was not accused of leaking classified documents, much less the most in history. She was investigated for using a private computer server that was not as secure as a government server to send emails, some of which were later found to include classified information. Mr. Comey, then the F.B.I. director, faulted her for carelessness but said “no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case.” His surprise announcement that he was briefly reopening the investigation days before the 2016 election has been blamed by many Democrats for contributing to Mrs. Clinton’s defeat. By contrast, Mr. Trump mocked the case against Mr. Stone, including the witness intimidation charge. “It’s not like the tampering that I see on television when you watch a movie,” the president said. “That’s called tampering — with guns to people’s heads and lots of other things.” He repeated his assertion that the jury forewoman in Mr. Stone’s case was “totally tainted” and an “anti-Trump activist,” which he said should compel the judge to order a new trial. The Justice Department opposes a new trial, a position approved by Mr. Barr. Mr. Trump left the strong impression, however, that he would use his clemency power if the judge did not go along with the defense motion, saying that he would “love to see Roger exonerated.” “I’m going to watch the process. I’m going to watch it very closely,” Mr. Trump added. “And at some point, I’ll make a determination. But Roger Stone and everybody has to be treated fairly, and this has not been a fair process. OK?” Charlie Savage and Katie Benner contributed reporting.",The New York Times
2020,Trump Reprises State of the Union Message in North Carolina,"The president promoted the economy and “opportunity zones” and questioned African-American support for Democrats. CHARLOTTE, N.C. — Three days after his State of the Union address, President Trump traveled on Friday to North Carolina to drive home one of the speech’s major themes. “This is a blue-collar boom,” Mr. Trump said, repeating what he told Congress was responsible for “the great American comeback.” He added, “Boom!” The president’s visit to a Charlotte community college gave him a chance to celebrate a 3.6 percent unemployment rate, the latest jobs numbers, which showed that employers added 255,000 jobs in January, and the 2017 tax bill. All of those issues are key components of what is expected to be the centerpiece of his re-election campaign: the economy. He boasted about his poll numbers, the 2016 election, his relationship with China, soldiers coming home and criminal justice overhaul. He derided Democrats over their trade policies and the chaos during the Iowa caucuses on Monday, and he dismissed the “failed impeachment hoax.” And Mr. Trump made no mention that he intended to dismiss two key witnesses in the House hearings that led to his impeachment: Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman, an adviser on Ukraine on the National Security Council, and Gordon D. Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union. His focus was economic development, and he highlighted the more than 8,700 economically distressed areas designated by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act as “opportunity zones” and the tax incentives offered to business leaders and investors who put money into them. “Opportunity zones are amazing,” Mr. Trump said. “Tremendous amounts of money are being put into areas that have not received money for decades and decades.” North Carolina has more than 250 such zones, representing a population of 1.1 million, including 45,000 families with children living in poverty. Seventeen of the zones are in Charlotte. Mr. Trump also singled out low unemployment rates for African-Americans, Asian-Americans, Latinos and women. He lauded his own criminal justice overhaul efforts and his support for historically black colleges and universities. And he expressed frustration over African-Americans’ support for Democrats. “You’ve been with the Democrats for a hundred years, 112 to be exact, and they treat you badly,” Mr. Trump said. “They only come around two months before the election, and then right after the election, they say, ‘Bye-bye, we’ll see you in two years.’” Ben Carson, the housing secretary and the only African-American cabinet member, said Mr. Trump was driven by his kindness and compassion to help low-income communities. He said that the president was not given credit for his achievements and that Mr. Trump had been wrongly called a racist and deemed guilty of “everything under the sun.” “But let me tell you what he’s really guilty of,” Mr. Carson said. “He is guilty of creating a dynamic economy that is working for everybody. He is guilty of creating a military that is so strong that it can’t be challenged by anyone. He is guilty of recognizing how important it is to have a Space Force. He is guilty of trade agreements that have leveled the playing field.” Updated Feb. 29, 2020",The New York Times
2020,Trump Revels in Democrats' Dysfunction in the Iowa Caucuses,"The president mocked a breakdown during the Iowa caucuses at the same time he came under criticism himself for not showing full respect during the national anthem at a Super Bowl party. WASHINGTON — When President Trump looks back on his best days in the White House, Tuesday may land near the top of the list. With Democrats in disarray at the start of their nominating season, Mr. Trump will take the national stage to address his largest audience of the year assured of acquittal in his Senate trial and enjoying his highest public approval since taking office. For a president impeached for high crimes and misdemeanors just seven weeks ago, he finds himself in a strikingly strong position as his re-election campaign gets underway in earnest. His State of the Union address on Tuesday night will enable him to frame the debate while his opposition not only has no clear leader but embarrassed itself with a vote-counting debacle in Iowa. Not that he can necessarily count on any of this to last. The economy, while healthy, has slowed its growth and could take a hit from the China travel restrictions imposed to fight the coronavirus outbreak. At some point, the Democrats will anoint a nominee who could unify the party against Mr. Trump. And John R. Bolton, the former national security adviser, plans to publish a book next month that is expected to have revelations about the president’s use of his office to further his own political interests. Mr. Trump has shown a remarkable capacity for crossing lines and creating political problems for himself just when things appear to be better for him — indeed, he placed the phone call to Ukraine’s president that got him impeached the day after testimony by the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III made clear that he was out of political jeopardy as a result of the Russia investigation. Still, Mr. Trump could hardly restrain his delight at the Democratic dysfunction in Iowa, quickly taking to Twitter to needle the other side. “The Democrat Caucus is an unmitigated disaster,” he tweeted on Tuesday morning as the Iowa results remained unknown. “Nothing works, just like they ran the Country. Remember the 5 Billion Dollar Obamacare Website, that should have cost 2% of that. The only person that can claim a very big victory in Iowa last night is ‘Trump.’” But acutely aware that he must win Iowa in the fall, Mr. Trump sought not to offend the state and rejected suggestions that the breakdown in counting should cause Iowa to lose its status as the first stop in the presidential nomination process. “It is not the fault of Iowa, it is the Do Nothing Democrats fault,” he tweeted. “As long as I am President, Iowa will stay where it is. Important tradition!” Mr. Trump was in a relaxed mood later in the day as he hosted an off-the-record lunch for television anchors before the evening speech (after barring CNN). While he said that he did not know who would win the Democratic presidential nomination, he said that Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont was “nastier and smarter” than the other candidates in the primary race. However, the president expressed surprise at how well Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., had been doing, according to people in the room. Contrary to his past threats, Mr. Trump said he would participate in debates in the fall after all, even though he considers the Commission on Presidential Debates biased against him. He also predicted that Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York would challenge Senator Chuck Schumer in a Democratic primary and “kick his ass.” Looking ahead to his speech on Tuesday night, Mr. Trump said that Rush Limbaugh, the conservative radio host who announced on Monday that he has advanced lung cancer, may be in the audience, and the president added that he might award the broadcaster the Presidential Medal of Freedom. He was not looking forward to having Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who orchestrated his impeachment, sitting behind him and next to Vice President Mike Pence during the speech. “There’s one person behind me who’s going to be friendly and one who’s not going to be friendly,” he said, according to the people in the room. Mr. Trump complained at length about Mr. Bolton, whose unpublished book confirms a central allegation of the impeachment charges by reporting that the president conditioned security aid to Ukraine on its willingness to announce political investigations of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and other Democrats. “He turned on me,” Mr. Trump said of Mr. Bolton. The Iowa debacle played out even as Gallup reported that Mr. Trump’s approval rating had climbed to 49 percent, its highest in that survey since his presidency began. While polls have shown that most Americans want the Senate to call witnesses, his impeachment trial is set to end Wednesday with an assured acquittal — and it is even possible, though not certain, that one or more Democratic senators vote with him. “What other people would look at as a moment of completely political meltdown for this president, it all appears to accrue to his benefit,” said Matt Schlapp, the chairman of the American Conservative Union. “He actually looks like the adult in the room.” Moreover, Mr. Schlapp said, the delayed count in Iowa will sow discord and suspicion within Democratic ranks. “The problem for the Democrats is it will make people think and assume the fix is in again because they don’t like who is leading,” he said. Representative Mark Meadows, Republican of North Carolina and a close Trump ally, compared the problems in Iowa with the Obama administration’s bungled start of its health care program’s website in 2013. “Four years of planning for the Iowa Democrat caucus up in flames,” Mr. Meadows said. “It is like a florist missing Valentine’s Day or a fireworks company being ready for July 5. The last time Democrats had a failure this big was HealthCare.gov.” Democrats acknowledged that the Iowa breakdown plays to Mr. Trump’s advantage, at least in the short term. “A fractious, divisive and chaotic process inevitably takes focus away from Trump’s own failures, at least in the short term, and Trump obviously believes he has the opportunity to stir the pot against the Democrats in these circumstances,” said Geoff Garin, a prominent Democratic pollster. “All of this heightens the importance for Democrats to have a confident and united front as soon as possible.” But even as he was mocking the Democrats for their debacle, though, Mr. Trump himself was coming under fire for appearing to be less than fully respectful during the playing of the national anthem during the Super Bowl. A smartphone video posted on Instagram and published by The Miami Herald showed Mr. Trump during a Super Bowl watch party at Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Fla., near his Mar-a-Lago estate, standing and pretending to lead an orchestra while “The Star-Spangled Banner” played before the start of the game between the San Francisco 49ers and the Kansas City Chiefs. While his wife, Melania, and son Barron had their hands on their hearts, the president fidgeted, looked around and pointed at guests. The Herald pointed out that Mr. Trump has lectured others to be respectful during the playing of the anthem, harshly criticizing black N.F.L. players who took a knee to protest racial injustice. “You have to stand, proudly, for the national anthem or you shouldn’t be playing. You shouldn’t be there. Maybe you shouldn’t be in the country,” Mr. Trump said on Fox News in 2018. The video is the second point of criticism of the president stemming from this year’s football championship game. He was roundly ridiculed for tweeting after the game congratulating the Chiefs and “the Great State of Kansas” even though they actually play in Missouri. Mr. Trump quickly deleted the mistaken tweet and reposted it with Missouri substituted in. The Iowa caucus meltdown provided ammunition to the president just as the re-election season gets underway. Rather than facing an emboldened Democratic candidate after a caucus win, Mr. Trump has an opening to paint the opposition party as incapable of governing. “When will the Democrats start blaming RUSSIA, RUSSIA, RUSSIA, instead of their own incompetence for the voting disaster that just happened in the Great State of Iowa?” he tweeted, making light of Moscow’s interference in the 2016 presidential election on his behalf. Mr. Trump’s State of the Union address will prevent the Iowa winner, once announced, from having even a single news cycle to himself or herself. And he hopes to upstage the Democrats again next week, scheduling a campaign rally in New Hampshire on Monday night, the eve of the first primary election, thus drawing away at least some of the television airtime and newspaper space that would have gone to the candidates running against him as they seek to regain momentum from Iowa. In the meantime, Mr. Trump and his team were trying to stir as much trouble among the Democrats as possible by stoking suspicions of nefarious machinations in Iowa meant to deprive Mr. Sanders of a victory. “Mark my words, they are rigging this thing,” Eric Trump, one of the president’s sons, wrote on Twitter. His brother Donald Trump Jr. wrote on his own account, “Rigging ain’t easy."" Michael M. Grynbaum contributed reporting from New York. Updated Feb. 29, 2020",The New York Times
2020,Trump Says Harvey Weinstein Verdict ‘Sends a Very Strong Message’,"The president called the film producer’s conviction “a great victory” for women even as he focused on Mr. Weinstein’s ties to Democrats. NEW DELHI — President Trump on Tuesday called the conviction of the former film mogul Harvey Weinstein on two felony sex crime charges “a great victory” for women that “sends a very strong message” about sexual misconduct, even as he sought to highlight the defendant’s ties to Democrats. Asked whether justice had been done in the case, Mr. Trump first stressed that he had never liked Mr. Weinstein even though they knew each other through New York circles. He then noted that the Hollywood producer had been an active friend and fund-raiser for Democratic politicians over the years. “I was just not a fan of his,” Mr. Trump told reporters at a news conference wrapping up a two-day visit to India. “I will say the people that liked him were the Democrats. Michelle Obama loved him, loved him. Hillary Clinton loved him. And he gave tremendous money to the Democrats, and I guess my question is will the Democrats be asking for that money back because he gave a lot of money to the Democrats.” After another reporter pressed him again on the message the New York jury verdict might send to women who have been subjected to sexual harassment and assault, Mr. Trump said, “I think from the standpoint of women, it was a great thing. It was a great victory and sends a very strong message, a very, very strong message.” Mr. Trump has himself been accused by multiple women of sexual harassment and sexual assault, and he was famously caught on tape, in a recording that became public shortly before the 2016 election, boasting that he could grab women by their private parts and kiss them because “when you’re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything.” E. Jean Carroll, a longtime Elle magazine advice columnist, accused Mr. Trump last year of raping her in a dressing room at an upscale New York department store more than 20 years ago and then sued him for defamation when he called her a liar. She said last week that she had been fired by Elle because of Mr. Trump’s insults against her. The president made no mention of that or other allegations against him on Tuesday, but in the past he has often expressed empathy or given the benefit of the doubt to allies and appointees accused of sexual misconduct like the Senate candidate Roy S. Moore, Justice Brett Kavanaugh, and the former Fox News host Bill O’Reilly. “Peoples lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation,” he wrote on Twitter in February 2018 after an aide was accused by two former wives of abuse. “Some are true and some are false. Some are old and some are new. There is no recovery for someone falsely accused — life and career are gone. Is there no such thing any longer as Due Process?”",The New York Times
2020,Trump Says He Is In for Debates and Wants to Honor Rush Limbaugh,"At lunch with TV anchors before the State of the Union speech, the president was jovial about Iowa’s voting problems and said John Bolton “turned on me.” President Trump told a group of television news anchors at the White House on Tuesday that he would participate in this year’s general election debates, despite his misgivings about the commission that oversees them, according to two people with knowledge of his comments. Mr. Trump also said he hoped that Rush Limbaugh, the right-wing talk radio star who this week announced a diagnosis of advanced lung cancer, would attend Tuesday’s State of the Union address. The president said he was interested in awarding Mr. Limbaugh the Presidential Medal of Freedom. On Tuesday evening during his address, Mr. Trump did just that, with the first lady, Melania Trump, presenting the medal to a surprised Mr. Limbaugh in the gallery. In a jovial mood after Iowa Democrats botched Monday’s caucus vote count — a situation that Mr. Trump happily called a “fiasco” — the president held court for nearly two hours on Tuesday afternoon over a lunch of sole and soup in the State Dining Room. Vice President Mike Pence and Ivanka Trump also attended. The conversation, an annual tradition for anchors, is off the record, but as in past years, multiple people described Mr. Trump’s remarks after the fact. Journalists from The New York Times were not invited and did not agree to those off-the-record terms. The White House declined to discuss the president’s remarks. “I actually have ethics so I’m not going to comment on an off-the-record lunch,” said Stephanie Grisham, the White House press secretary. The president had tough words for John Bolton, his former national security adviser, complaining that Mr. Bolton wanted to be referred to as “ambassador” and saying that Mr. Bolton “turned on me” by writing a book that includes unflattering portrayals of Mr. Trump’s behavior. As for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who will stand on the dais beside Mr. Pence during the State of the Union, Mr. Trump said the two had not spoken in some time. “There’s one person behind me who’s going to be friendly and one who’s not going to be friendly,” the president said, referring to his Tuesday evening address. With a Diet Coke at his side, Mr. Trump spoke of his regret about Mr. Limbaugh’s medical diagnosis, saying that he had recently spoken with the talk-radio host and Mr. Limbaugh had offered no hint of his illness. Asked about this fall’s general election debates, Mr. Trump repeated his recent complaints that “Never Trumpers” sit on the Commission on Presidential Debates, the nonpartisan group that organizes the events. But the president said he had decided to participate, because he believed his debate performances helped him win support from voters in the 2016 campaign. The annual anchor lunch predates Mr. Trump’s administration. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump broke from precedent by declining to invite journalists from CNN, a network that he routinely accuses of bias. Chuck Todd, the moderator of NBC’s “Meet the Press,” told Mr. Trump at the lunch that he was asking a question on behalf of the CNN anchor Jake Tapper, according to another person familiar with the exchange. The president responded by saying that journalists from “MSDNC” — his recently adopted nickname for MSNBC — were also absent, though Mr. Todd hosts a daily afternoon show for the cable network. Mr. Trump often castigates news outlets and individual reporters in public, contributing to a hostile environment toward journalists that press freedom groups have called dangerous and encouraging to autocrats who suppress independent media.

2020,Trump Sees Commitment to Religious Freedom in India as Riots Break Out,"The president stressed the strength of his relationship with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in meetings long on symbolism and short on concrete agreements. NEW DELHI — In the lush garden of Hyderabad House, President Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi celebrated their friendship and talked of a modern, diverse and unified India. Across town, an explosion of anger over Mr. Modi’s sectarian policies set a neighborhood on edge, leaving a trail of dead bodies and a widening religious rift. The two sides of New Delhi on display on Tuesday underscored the disparity between the hopes of Mr. Trump’s trip and the tensions outside the fortified environs of world leaders. Just miles from the pomp of a presidential visit, a mob of hot-tempered Hindu men wielding iron bars hunted their Muslim neighbors on streets littered with scraps of bricks. As he completed his two-day stay, Mr. Trump focused only on the positive, offering validation of Mr. Modi as a champion of religious liberty even as the Indian government has adopted Hindu-first policies targeting Muslims. The president publicly accepted Mr. Modi’s word that he treats the 1.3 billion people in his diverse country fairly without regard to faith and made no mention of the months of protests by those who think otherwise. “We did talk about religious freedom, and I will say that the prime minister was incredible on what he told me,” Mr. Trump told reporters. “He wants people to have religious freedom, and very strongly.” “They have really worked hard on religious freedom,” Mr. Trump added. “We talked about it for a long time and I really believe that’s what he wants.” His reluctance to criticize Mr. Modi sharply contrasted with his willingness to assail his domestic critics even while abroad. During his concluding news conference, Mr. Trump attacked Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the former first lady Michelle Obama, Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California, and the unnamed whistle-blower whose disclosures led to the president’s impeachment. He also confirmed that his White House had embarked on a hunt for disloyal officials to purge in the aftermath of his acquittal in a Senate trial but said it would not be “very many people,” without estimating how many. “We want to have people that are good for the country, are loyal to our country,” he said. “Because that was a disgraceful situation.” The president’s embrace of Mr. Modi came at a time when the government has revoked the statehood of Kashmir, the disputed majority Muslim territory; rounded up Muslim leaders there; and enacted a law giving preference to non-Muslim migrants naturalizing as citizens. Protests over the citizenship law culminated in street violence that cost at least 11 lives since Sunday. Mr. Trump made no public mention of those actions until asked and even then professed no view of them. Instead, he framed his first visit to India as president on terms he preferred. Just as religious disputes drew no outward concern, the president insisted that the two leaders had made “tremendous progress” toward the landmark trade agreement he has sought even though there was no evident sign of breakthrough on the major issues that have divided negotiators for months. “We think we’re at a point where our relationship is so special with India, it has never been as good as it is now,” Mr. Trump said. “We feel very strongly about each other, and we have done something that is very unique.” The president often personalizes his relations with foreign leaders. His willingness to accept Mr. Modi’s version of events recalled Mr. Trump’s deference to President Vladimir V. Putin’s denials that Russia had intervened in the 2016 presidential election and his professed belief in Kim Jong-un’s vague promises to give up North Korea’s nuclear weapons. Even Mr. Trump’s boasts about the scale of his reception in India were extravagant. He claimed before his arrival that Mr. Modi had promised him crowds of up to 10 million people. The actual number lining the streets of Ahmedabad on Monday was well under one-tenth that amount. Despite saying he had been told his greeting was the greatest “ever given to any head of state from any country,” Mr. Trump was not even the top-drawing American president to visit India looking back to Dwight D. Eisenhower’s crowds. Only after he was no longer in Mr. Modi’s presence did Mr. Trump return to some of his longstanding complaints about India’s trade policies, complaining to reporters that New Delhi maintained unfairly high tariffs on American goods, including Harley Davidson motorcycles. But while the two leaders were together, it was all sunshine, long on florid language about the strength of their relationship and short on concrete results. Mr. Trump and Mr. Modi celebrated a series of modest agreements that were set before the visit, including a $3 billion arms purchase and a letter of cooperation between Exxon Mobil and India’s energy sector. They agreed to create a joint counternarcotics working group to reduce opioid abuse. During his news conference, Mr. Trump also addressed growing alarm over the coronavirus and the return of 14 Americans infected with coronavirus to the country last week. He defended that action, even though he was privately furious about it. “I felt that we should bring them back,” he said. “They’re Americans — we should bring them back.” During the 2014 Ebola epidemic in Africa, Mr. Trump tweeted in outrage that Americans infected with that virus should not be allowed into the country. Asked whether his current view clashed with his prior one, he rejected the comparison. “There’s a vast difference” between the two epidemics, Mr. Trump said, noting that Ebola was nearly always fatal while the death rate among those infected with the new coronavirus has been relatively low. “At that time, nobody had ever even heard of Ebola or ever conceived of something where you basically — the people would disintegrate.” (Ebola was widely known by 2014.) Mr. Trump also vowed not to accept foreign assistance during his re-election campaign and rejected American intelligence assessments that Russia was already working to help him as it did in 2016. “I want no help from any country, and I haven’t been given help from any country,” Mr. Trump said. Mr. Modi welcomed Mr. Trump to the presidential palace on Tuesday with the roar of guns and an honor guard of red-uniformed soldiers on horseback and later hosted him at a lavish state banquet. “President Trump’s contribution in raising our relations to this level have been invaluable,” Mr. Modi said. Mr. Trump basked in the visit. “Nobody else that came here got the kind of reception we got,” Mr. Trump said. The two leaders declined to answer questions at their joint appearance before the news media. Although Mr. Modi has taken questions from reporters while overseas next to other world leaders, he is the first prime minister in recent memory to not have held any news conferences in India. And so Mr. Trump waited until later to meet reporters on his own. He did gently urge Mr. Modi’s government to respect freedom on the internet, which the Indian government has shut down repeatedly. Talking about the need for secure 5G wireless, the president added that it should be “a tool for freedom, progress, prosperity — not to do anything where it could be even conceived as a conduit for suppression and censorship.” A trade deal with India has been a priority for two years for Mr. Trump, who would like another economic agreement to show while campaigning before the November election. But the two sides have been divided over farm products, medical devices, digital trade and new tariffs. Mr. Trump has complained that India treats the United States unfairly and called Mr. Modi a “tough negotiator.” “Our teams have made tremendous progress on a comprehensive trade agreement, and I’m optimistic we can reach a deal that will be of great importance to both countries,” Mr. Trump told reporters, without elaborating. For Mr. Trump, it was a day to emphasize the optimism. It was, he said, “a very special visit — unforgettable, extraordinary.”",The New York Times
2020,Trump Takes On Bloomberg and Once Again Hijacks a News Cycle,"White House Memo Like an assignment editor at a tabloid newspaper, the president poured accelerant on a negative story and got it trending on Twitter and cable news. WASHINGTON — Tuesday was shaping up to be the kind of news day that makes President Trump unhappy: one in which he saw himself losing control of the narrative in the face of wall-to-wall coverage of his Democratic rivals in the presidential primary in New Hampshire. Mr. Trump had other ideas. In a provocative early-morning tweet in which he charged, “WOW, BLOOMBERG IS A TOTAL RACIST!,” the president delivered to his millions of Twitter followers leaked audio from 2015 in which Michael R. Bloomberg, the Democratic presidential hopeful and former New York mayor, offered an unflinching defense of stop-and-frisk policing for which he has since apologized. Originally posted by a liberal blogger on Monday night, the clip underscored one of Mr. Bloomberg’s key vulnerabilities in the Democratic primary as he seeks to convince voters that he is sorry for the aggressive policing tactics his administration used against minorities in New York. In the clip, Mr. Bloomberg can be heard saying that “the way you get the guns out of the kids’ hands is to throw them up against the walls and frisk them.” For Mr. Trump, it was an opportunity to try to shape the coverage of the Democratic contest more to his liking. Like an assignment editor at a tabloid newspaper, the president poured accelerant on the story, aided by his oldest son, Donald Trump Jr., and his campaign manager, who helped fuel a social media firestorm, already underway, that had the hashtag “#BloombergIsARacist.” Within an hour, Mr. Trump had deleted his own tweet without explanation. But by the afternoon, the hashtag was trending on Twitter and cable news programs, including on CNN and MSNBC, where guests were still talking about the audio clip — and Mr. Trump’s meddling. Mr. Trump has himself been a vocal supporter over the years of the same police tactics that Mr. Bloomberg once championed, and the very accusation he was leveling against his potential rival — that he is a racist — conjures up one of the most often repeated accusations against the president himself. Asked about that, Jason Miller, a spokesman for Mr. Trump’s 2016 campaign who spent the morning talking about the Bloomberg audio clip on a Trump-backed podcast and radio show, shrugged. “I think Trump is trying to draw out Michael Bloomberg,” he said. The tweet, Mr. Miller added, “was hugely effective.” “If President Trump had not done that,” he continued, “you wouldn’t have seen all the cable news coverage. Now that’s injected right into the middle of the conversation.” On Tuesday afternoon, Mr. Trump kept it up in the Oval Office, where he accused Mr. Bloomberg of pandering for votes when he apologized for the stop-and-frisk policy at a Brooklyn church last November. Uncharacteristically, the president also suggested that he deleted his tweet about the audio clip because he was worried about being too divisive. “I put something out and it was pretty nasty,” Mr. Trump told reporters. “And I thought, you know, I’m looking to bring the country together, not divide the country.” The morning of presidential media distraction was a reminder, if anyone needed one, that the first reality show star turned president has mastered the art of hijacking the modern internet-dominated news cycle, taking old but not well-known information and hyping it to make it feel new and potentially damaging for one of his political enemies. Mr. Trump has been warily eyeing Mr. Bloomberg, who has already spent hundreds of millions of dollars in television ads attacking the president. The audio was posted hours after Mr. Bloomberg polled in third place in a national survey of the Democratic primary conducted by Quinnipiac University. His support among black voters was higher than that of Senator Bernie Sanders, who is on his second presidential campaign. In a statement shortly after the president’s tweet, Mr. Bloomberg admitted that stop-and-frisk was “overused” and again apologized for not eliminating the policy “faster and sooner.” But he lashed out at Mr. Trump, saying the morning’s post was the “latest example of his endless efforts to divide Americans.” “The president’s attack on me clearly reflects his fear over the growing strength of my campaign,” Mr. Bloomberg said. “Make no mistake Mr. President: I am not afraid of you and I will not let you bully me or anyone else in America.” Mr. Bloomberg’s record on stop-and-frisk has gotten limited attention since he began running for president in November. The three-term New York City mayor defended the aggressive policing tactic for years, even after a federal judge ruled that it had violated the constitutional rights of minority men in New York. He apologized for it only after he announced his presidential campaign. In the weeks since, he has mischaracterized when and why he made changes to the policy in 2013, his final year in office. Snippets of Mr. Bloomberg’s blunt comments about the stop-and-frisk policy during a speech at the Aspen Institute in 2015 had been previously reported. But the audio, edited to string the most damning statements together, was taken by Mr. Trump and his online supporters and shared repeatedly on Twitter. But Mr. Trump has his own history of support for stop-and-frisk. In 2016, he endorsed the policy, saying it had been used effectively in New York City. And in 2018, after he was president, Mr. Trump suggested that police departments in heavily minority cities, like Chicago, ought to use such aggressive tactics. The police in that city should “strongly consider stop-and-frisk,” Mr. Trump said in a speech at the time. “It works, and it was meant for problems like Chicago,” the president said. The White House declined to comment about Mr. Trump’s tweet or his history of support for the policy. Mr. Trump has also repeatedly been accused of racism, both as a 2016 presidential candidate and during his time in office. His efforts to curb the use of food stamps, his administration’s attempts to dismantle provisions of the Affordable Care Act and his restrictive immigration policies have all been denounced as harmful to blacks and Latinos. Mr. Trump has often turned the criticism he gets back on his opponents. When he was running against Hillary Clinton in 2016, Mrs. Clinton said during their third debate that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia preferred having “a puppet as president of the United States.” Mr. Trump replied, “No puppet — you’re the puppet.” When The Washington Post reported the existence of the “Access Hollywood” tape that featured Mr. Trump bragging about grabbing women’s genitals, he responded by bringing women who had accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct to the second presidential debate two days later.

2020,Trump Takes Up Call for Barr to ‘Clean House’ at Justice Dept.,"With a series of retweets, President Trump kept up attacks on federal law enforcement agencies, despite pleas from the attorney general. WASHINGTON — Ignoring appeals from his attorney general to stop tweeting about the Justice Department, President Trump renewed his attacks on the agency on Wednesday, demanding “JUSTICE” for himself and all future presidents. With a series of retweets, Mr. Trump appeared to embrace the suggestion that Attorney General William P. Barr “clean shop” at the department. And the president promoted the idea of naming a special counsel to investigate what Tom Fitton, the head of the conservative nonprofit Judicial Watch, described as a “seditious conspiracy” at the department and the F.B.I. A day earlier, Mr. Barr was, according to some of his associates, considering a different sort of shop cleaning: If his boss did not stop meddling with Justice Department investigations, he was said to be considering his own future. For more than a week, the president has been publicly open about his view of the case against his longtime friend and adviser Roger J. Stone Jr. And the notion that Mr. Barr might leave his post over Mr. Trump’s commentary did not appear to quiet the president. Mr. Stone was convicted in November of seven felonies for obstructing a congressional investigation into whether the Trump campaign had ties to Russia. At the time, Mr. Trump said his friend’s conviction was evidence of a double standard in the justice system. Last week, a day after prosecutors filed a routine recommendation for Mr. Stone’s sentencing, Mr. Trump called it “horrible and very unfair.” Hours after that, Mr. Barr intervened to lower the sentencing recommendation, drawing public praise from the president while spurring fears that the Justice Department was bowing to White House influence. This led four prosecutors to quit the Stone case, drawing a lashing from Mr. Trump who said they “cut and run” and were part of the special counsel team’s “investigation that was illegal.” Amid outrage over the prosecutors’ departures, Mr. Barr took the extraordinary step of going on national television to send a message to the president: “It’s time to stop the tweeting about Department of Justice criminal cases.” Mr. Trump has also questioned the decisions of the federal judge overseeing the Stone case. And on Tuesday, he spoke highly of Mr. Barr’s integrity while simultaneously undermining his authority. Mr. Trump said, “I’m actually, I guess, the chief law enforcement officer of the country.” Mr. Stone’s sentencing is scheduled for Thursday. Mr. Barr’s ability to protect the Justice Department from Mr. Trump’s influence was a concern of critics when Mr. Trump announced his nomination. Since then, critics say, Mr. Barr has all but proved their fears. Mr. Barr oversaw an administrative-review-turned-criminal inquiry into the origins of the 2016 Russia investigation, an investigation Mr. Trump had been demanding for months. Mr. Barr reviewed and decided not to pursue a criminal referral about the president’s campaign finance violations regarding Ukraine, dealings that ultimately led to Mr. Trump’s impeachment last year. And Mr. Barr summarized the findings of the special counsel inquiry, led by Robert S. Mueller III, in a manner that was favorable to Mr. Trump — leaving out details about the instances in which Mr. Trump may have obstructed justice. Mr. Trump acknowledged on Tuesday that his running commentary on the Stone case was making Mr. Barr’s job harder, but he gave no indication that he would back off. Asked about pardoning Mr. Stone after the president granted clemency to several white-collar criminals on Tuesday — decisions he said were made based on advice from friends and business associates — Mr. Trump said, “I haven’t given it any thought.” He added: “In the meantime, he’s going through a process. But I think he’s been treated very unfairly.”",The New York Times
2020,Trump Taps John Ratcliffe for Director of National Intelligence,"It is not clear if the Republican congressman from Texas, whose name was floated for the post last year, can win Senate confirmation. WASHINGTON — President Trump announced on Friday that he intended to nominate Representative John Ratcliffe, Republican of Texas, as his director of national intelligence, choosing someone he considered last summer before senior Republicans in Congress deemed him unqualified for the job. Mr. Ratcliffe is a vocal supporter of the president who serves on the House Intelligence Committee. If confirmed, he would replace Richard Grenell, whom Mr. Trump put in charge of American intelligence agencies this month on an acting basis. The job has been vacant since Dan Coats stepped down on Aug. 15. It is unclear whether Mr. Ratcliffe could be confirmed by the Senate. When Mr. Trump floated his name for the job last summer, some Republicans, including Senator Richard M. Burr of North Carolina, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told White House officials that Mr. Ratcliffe was too partisan for the position, according to people familiar with the discussions. Members of both parties also expressed concern at the time about his qualifications for such a senior position, as well as charges that he had exaggerated his résumé. But just nominating Mr. Ratcliffe creates a benefit for the White House: Once Mr. Trump sends formal nomination papers to the Senate, it will extend the time the current acting director, Mr. Grenell, a favorite of Mr. Trump’s, can remain in the office. And in the minds of some Democrats, that was the president’s goal at a time when he is seeking to impose greater control over the nation’s intelligence agencies after years of tension that started with the intelligence community’s consensus that Russia had interfered in the 2016 election to help Mr. Trump. Under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, Mr. Grenell can serve in his post only until March 11 unless the president formally nominates someone else for the job. Under that law, Mr. Grenell would be able to stay an additional 210 days once Mr. Ratcliffe is nominated. Should the Senate reject Mr. Ratcliffe, Mr. Grenell’s tenure would be extended again. Some people close to the White House said they believe Mr. Ratcliffe stands a better chance at confirmation now than he did last summer. They said his robust defense of Mr. Trump during the House’s impeachment proceedings and effective questioning of Democratic witnesses had impressed senators who had expressed concerns about him, including Mr. Burr. One senior administration official said the situation was “different” than it was with Mr. Ratcliffe in July, but also conceded that Trump officials were “cleareyed” about earning the needed votes. On Friday, Mr. Burr issued a lukewarm statement that stopped short of endorsing Mr. Ratcliffe for the position but signaled impatience with having an acting director in the position. Mr. Burr wrote that “there is no substitute for having a permanent, Senate-confirmed director of national intelligence in place to lead our I.C.” I.C. is Washington shorthand for “intelligence community.” “I look forward to receiving Congressman Ratcliffe’s official nomination and ushering it through the Senate’s regular order,” he added. Senior Democrats said they were decisively opposed to the nomination. “The last time this nomination was unsuccessfully put forward, serious bipartisan questions were raised about Rep. Ratcliffe’s background and qualifications,” Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia and the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, wrote on Twitter. “It’s hard for me to see how anything new has happened to change that.” The Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, said in a statement, “Replacing one highly partisan operative with another does nothing to keep our country safe. At a time when the Russians are interfering in our elections, we need a nonpartisan leader at the helm of the intelligence community who sees the world objectively and speaks truth to power, and unfortunately neither Acting Director Grenell nor Rep. Ratcliffe comes even close to that.” Mr. Schumer added that the nomination reveals Mr. Trump’s “lack of respect for the rule of law and the intelligence community” and called on Republicans to “join Democrats in swiftly rejecting the nomination of Mr. Ratcliffe.” The position of director of national intelligence, created by a special commission in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, attacks, was designed to oversee and coordinate the federal government’s sprawling intelligence network, which includes the Central Intelligence Agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency and more than a dozen smaller agencies. Writing on Twitter Friday, Mr. Trump called Mr. Ratcliffe “an outstanding man of great talent,” adding: “Would have completed process earlier, but John wanted to wait until after IG Report was finished.” Mr. Trump appeared to have been referring to a recent report by the inspector general of the Justice Department that criticized aspects of the federal investigation into ties between Mr. Trump’s 2016 campaign and Russia. Mr. Trump’s previous plan to nominate Mr. Ratcliffe, unveiled in July, ran aground amid questions about the depth of his intelligence experience, his outspoken pro-Trump partisanship, and apparent exaggerations about his biography. Mr. Trump initially defended his pick, telling reporters he needed someone to rein in intelligence agencies that “have run amok.” But he dropped the plan within days, before Mr. Ratcliffe was formally nominated, accusing the media of “slander and libel.” Top Republicans had questioned Mr. Ratcliffe’s brief experience on the House intelligence committee, which oversees the American intelligence community, and which Mr. Ratcliffe joined last year. Mr. Ratcliffe also drew criticism for claiming on his website and campaign material that, as a federal prosecutor, he had tried suspects who were accused of funneling money to the Hamas terrorist group. Mr. Ratcliffe was involved in investigating side issues related to an earlier mistrial, but was not a prosecutor in the original or second trial. While Mr. Ratcliffe often touted his role as the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Texas during the George W. Bush administration, he held that position only on an interim basis, bridging a gap of less than a year between two Senate-confirmed presidential appointees. And there are few if any significant terrorism cases in the public record for his time serving as the terrorism coordinator in the eastern district office. Republican senators also fretted that as a fiery member of the House Intelligence panel and one of the House’s most conservative members, Mr. Ratcliffe was too political to take the top intelligence position. Those concerns may soon resurface, especially given Mr. Ratcliffe’s high-profile role defending Mr. Trump during the House’s impeachment proceedings. It is that same fiery streak, however, that has endeared Mr. Ratcliffe to his fellow House conservatives and Mr. Trump. He was a vocal figure in House hearings during the impeachment fight, brooking no criticism of the president and forcefully arguing for an investigation into the anonymous whistle-blower whose complaint about the president’s actions toward Ukraine helped prompt the inquiry. Mr. Ratcliffe then served on a team of House lawmakers who helped amplify Mr. Trump’s legal defense during the impeachment trial in the Senate. Mr. Grenell, the acting director, offered his congratulations to Mr. Ratcliffe on Friday on Twitter, adding, “We are ready for you and grateful for your willingness to serve.” Michael D. Shear contributed reporting.",The New York Times
2020,"Trump Targets New York Again, This Time Over Car Exports","New restrictions have made it close to impossible to send cars from the state overseas, and a busy industry has ground to a halt. Several times a month, ships loaded with used cars leave ports around New York, bound for sale in the Caribbean, West Africa and the Middle East. It is a bustling business that starts with car dealerships and involves auction companies, exporters, freight carriers and shipping lines. Tens of thousands of cars make their way overseas every year through this secondhand trade, which rarely gets much notice. But the industry has suddenly ground to a halt after becoming an unexpected target in President Trump’s crackdown on states that hamper efforts to deport undocumented immigrants. As part of a raft of restrictions announced this month, the Department of Homeland Security said vehicles with New York State titles would face delays before they could be exported. The shift came at the same time as a change that got much wider attention: The federal government also began barring New York residents from trusted traveler programs, such as Global Entry. Officials tied their actions to the state’s passage of the Green Light Law, which allows undocumented immigrants to obtain driver’s licenses and blocks federal agencies from gaining access to the state’s motor vehicle databases. Customs officials said they needed that access to verify vehicles’ ownership. “Because of the blockage by New York, they are introducing for themselves — and I’m sure they didn’t think about this — the consequence of much slower sales of their own vehicles,” Kenneth T. Cuccinelli, the acting deputy secretary of Homeland Security, said after the change was announced on Feb. 5. In reality, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo’s office and people in the industry said, the car export trade has not slowed. It has stopped. Ships have been detained at port, containers unloaded and cars put back in storage. The change has hit those dealing in salvage vehicles — inoperable vehicles sold for scrap — as well as expensive antique and classic cars bought by overseas collectors. People hoping to ship their own vehicles out of the country as part of a move have seen their plans stymied, too. A thriving salvage vehicle industry has taken root in the New York area because of its proximity to ports including Port Newark-Elizabeth in New Jersey and large auctions that sell cars from local dealers. Louis Spano, whose company, Red Hook Shipping Inc., exports salvage vehicles to Haiti that are often packed with dry goods and clothing, said he already has had to leave hundreds of vehicles behind in Brooklyn. He learned of the change as he prepared to load a ship at the Red Hook Container Terminal with $80,000 worth of vehicles. “When the bomb dropped on us, what are you going to do? We never loaded them,” he said. He said a number of area businesses would be affected, particularly shipping lines that focus on car exports. Mr. Spano said he did not think the entreaties of small business owners could influence the stalemate between New York and Washington. “It’s bigger than us, honey,” he said. “It’s bigger than us.” Tim O’Day, the president of U.S. operations for Insurance Auto Auctions, a large company that is based near Chicago and processes more than 100,000 vehicles a year in New York, said the company has just recently started to assess the impact. “We have learned that the policy change is limiting and halting our buyers’ ability to promptly export vehicles with New York ownership documents,” he said. If the standoff continues, shipping lines specializing in exporting vehicles will probably reduce the number of calls to New York, focusing instead on ports in other states to meet demand for used cars overseas. Mr. Cuomo, who had assailed the ban on Global Entry applications as “extortion,” met last week with Mr. Trump without reaching any deal. The New York attorney general has sued the federal government for what the office says is retaliatory action against the state. A spokesman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection said in a statement that the agency checks vehicle identification numbers against state D.M.V. records to verify ownership and check for fraud. There has been a long history of theft rings exporting stolen cars from area ports. “Because C.B.P. will no longer be able to carry out these checks against New York Department of Motor Vehicles records, the export of used vehicles titled and registered in New York may be significantly delayed,” the spokesman said. A Cuomo administration official cast doubt on Homeland Security’s justification for the restrictions on vehicle exports, saying Customs and Border Protection could check if cars were stolen using a national database that is updated by the New York Department of Motor Vehicles. The change appeared to be part of an escalating campaign by the Trump administration to put pressure on New York and other places with so-called sanctuary policies. The acting director of U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement, Matthew T. Albence, was scheduled to speak in Troy, N.Y., on Thursday about public safety and the Green Light Law. More than a dozen states offer driver’s licenses to undocumented immigrants, but only New York has shielded its motor vehicle database from federal immigration enforcement agencies, according to administration officials. Many exporters and others in the industry were reluctant to speak publicly about the disruption, saying they feared retribution from the customs agency when the restriction on vehicles with New York titles is eventually lifted. But they used words like “disaster” and “nightmare” to describe the impact. Julia Sirkis, who works as an agent at K International Transport Co., a freight forwarder in Manhattan, said she had been fielding calls from confused customers for the previous week, from area residents moving overseas who planned to ship their cars to a man who had traveled from Dakar, Senegal, to buy a used vehicle to send home. “A lot of people are calling because they don’t believe it. It sounds so surreal,” she said. Dmitriy Shibarshin, the marketing director for West Coast Shipping, a large car-shipping company, said he was advising the company’s clients, which include classic car collectors, not to buy cars in New York, or, if it was too late, to cut their losses and sell their vehicles at auction. Ms. Sirkis said small businesses will be hit the hardest by the federal government’s stance. “Global Entry normally affects people who have money. This affects people who are low income, middle,” she said. “Car shipments — it mostly affects immigrants, people who are sending cars back to their country, trying to make something.” Far from New York, too, many had found their plans stymied by the sudden shift. Adam Grodkowski, the owner of Pro Cartech in Olten, Switzerland, had just bought a used 2019 BMW at auction for $25,000 in New York when the change came down. “I was really surprised,” said Mr. Grodkowski, who had planned to ship the car with West Coast Shipping to Germany. “It is standing and waiting in a warehouse,” said Mr. Grodkowski, who said he had lined up mechanics and parts to get the car back on the market, where he hoped it would sell for about triple the auction price. “It is of course a very big bummer for me,” he said. “It’s frustrating. I am here in Europe and the car is stuck in the U.S.”",The New York Times
2020,"Trump Threw Weighty Refugee Decisions to Local Government, With Painful Results","President Trump’s executive order granting local officials veto power over refugee resettlement has divided communities and left immigrants feeling unwanted. EAST LONGMEADOW, Mass. — In a gray-walled, institutional hall usually reserved for prosaic debates over traffic and town budgets, Mohamoud Abdirahman rose from the audience last month and approached a panel of five town councilmen sitting in judgment. Civil war had forced his family to flee their native Somalia in 1991, when he was a child. The Abdirahmans traveled for two days by cargo ship to Kenya, where they stayed for a year and a half before securing refuge in the United States. Now, it was his turn to fight for those trying to follow his footsteps to this town abutting Springfield and the Connecticut border. “A lot of people like me just want a second chance at life,” an emotional Mr. Abdirahman pleaded. A similar refrain is echoing across the country in town councils, county commissions, mayors’ offices and governors’ mansions after an executive order signed by President Trump in September granted local politicians a veto over the placement of refugees in their communities. That order has carried the national tension over the Trump administration’s hard-line immigration agenda from the halls of Washington and detention camps along the southwestern border to places like East Longmeadow, population 16,000, and turned refugees and those who work to resettle them into lobbyists of sorts. The anxiety among resettlement officials here has grown in recent weeks after the mayor of neighboring Springfield, one of the largest cities in Western Massachusetts, became one of the first politicians in the country to announce that he would not allow refugee resettlement. That was amplified by the decision of Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas last month to block resettlement for the entire state, which has welcomed more refugees than any other state in the past five years. And on Friday, Mr. Trump put refugees who have lived in Western Massachusetts for years at risk of continuing to stay separated from their relatives abroad when he added Nigeria, Myanmar, Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan, Sudan and Tanzania to a list of countries facing stringent travel restrictions. “This goes against everything we know,” said Maxine Stein, the chief executive of the Jewish Family Service of Western Massachusetts, a refugee resettlement agency. The vetoes issued so far in Texas, Springfield and counties in Minnesota and Virginia were suspended in recent weeks by a federal judge who issued a temporary injunction against the executive order. The ruling delayed a Jan. 21 deadline for resettlement agencies to submit funding requests — along with letters of consent from governors and local officials — to the State Department. But the resettlement agencies say there is still an urgent need for the resettlement approvals. Judges issued similar temporary injunctions for Mr. Trump’s other immigration polices, only to have the Supreme Court side with the administration. It is also, the resettlement agencies say, about education. Some local officials were wholly unfamiliar with refugee policy before Mr. Trump tasked them with deciding whether resettlement should continue in their communities. Under the executive order, if a town board, county official or mayor declines — or neglects — to make a decision, silence equates to a veto. “What we’ve seen in the courts is that the deadline may be pushed back, but it often doesn’t go away,” said Sara Bedford, who works with refugee families for the Jewish Family Service. “As long as the Springfield mayor doesn’t opt in, I think refugee communities will feel just a little bit less welcome.” The vague wording of the executive order also caused confusion among refugee resettlement officials, who questioned which local official had the power to consent to the State Department. Under the order, consent is required from governors and “localities,” which in many places was interpreted as the county leadership. But some Western Massachusetts towns are not represented by a county government, so the decision in Springfield fell to Domenic J. Sarno, the son of Italian immigrants and the longest-serving mayor of one of the poorest cities in the state. Mr. Sarno, a Democrat, issued his veto even after Gov. Charlie Baker of Massachusetts formally consented to allow refugees into the state and the Springfield City Council unanimously voted to allow them into the city. “You cannot continue to concentrate poverty on top of poverty,” Mr. Sarno wrote in Springfield’s newspaper, The Republican. He demanded that more affluent communities “step up to the plate and put their money where their mouth is — to take on their fair share of social justice responsibilities.” Mr. Sarno’s words echoed those of Mr. Trump, who has said the country is “full” and has threatened to send immigrants by the busload to Democratic cities and towns that have denounced his policies. Michael A. Fenton, the Springfield councilman who introduced the resolution to welcome refugees, said he had been fielding calls from residents demanding the city “let them go to the suburbs.” Mr. Abbott argued, “Texas has carried more than its share.” But most government officials who responded to the executive order have decided to accept refugees into their states and counties, including those dominated by Republicans. At least 42 governors and more than 110 local governments have consented. They include Asa Hutchinson, the Republican governor of Arkansas and former under secretary of homeland security, who in 2015 opposed allowing Syrian refugees into the state, citing security concerns. Last month, Mr. Hutchinson testified before his State Legislature to defend allowing refugees into Arkansas, taking with him a Congolese business owner and an Afghan refugee who assisted the American military. Gary Stubblefield, an Arkansas state senator, pressed his fellow Republican, lamenting, “Every morning when I wake up and turn on the national news, sometimes I ask myself a question: ‘Am I still in the United States of America?’” Mr. Hutchinson held his ground: “You’ve got a choice to make. You can create fear, or you can help resolve fear. I challenge you to help resolve fear.” In a twist, Mr. Hutchinson said in an interview that he was encouraged to allow refugees into Arkansas since a limited number would most likely be resettled in the state after Mr. Trump capped the number for 2020 at 18,000, down from 30,000 in the previous year. President Barack Obama set the cap at 110,000 his last year in office. Still, Mr. Hutchinson’s staff spent the first days after his decision fielding angry calls from constituents, an uncomfortable task that Mr. Fenton in Springfield knows well. By signing the executive order, Mr. Trump has put municipal leaders in an unfair position, Mr. Fenton said. “Municipal officials in the Northeast, we deal with snow, we deal with potholes, we deal with property taxes, trash pickup,” he said. “We do not deal with the complications associated with refugee immigration policy.” He worries that the mayor’s decision will have a lasting effect on Springfield’s reputation. “Those active and contributing members of our society don’t feel good about themselves in the place that they live when people say they’re not welcome,” Mr. Fenton said. Mr. Sarno’s rejection of refugees surprised Fikiri Amisi and Jacqueline Asumani, Congolese immigrants who came to Springfield last year after spending more than 12 years in a refugee camp in Zimbabwe. When he first came to Springfield, Mr. Amisi said, it felt as though he had been saved. Both work full time, Ms. Asumani at a hotel and Mr. Amisi at a factory that manufactures medical supplies. Mr. Amisi is also studying for his associate degree. They have three children and plan to buy a house next year. The couple wonders what they have done wrong. “They don’t want more refugees here,” Ms. Asumani told her husband. “It shows they don’t love us.” On a recent afternoon, Mr. Amisi looked through a photo album and stopped at an image showing the refugee camp where he used to wait in limbo. A friend called him to express concern over the mayor’s decision. He has been waiting for a ticket to the United States for four years, though long ago he cleared the refugee screening process. The resettlement officials at Jewish Family Service have tried to meet with officials on a near daily basis. Municipal leaders often ask about costs to the school system and whether the local government will need to provide housing for the refugees. The staff reassures them that the onus is on the resettlement agency, which helps families find work and pay for the first three months of housing. While a veto by a local official cannot prevent a refugee from moving to a city from within the United States, it prohibits the resettlement organizations from providing that initial financial support and could harm their overall funding, according to Ms. Stein. “When you’re sleeping on relatives’ floors or extra beds, and you’re all jammed into the kitchen, and it’s chaotic in the morning to get to school so you just don’t get to school, it’s just not a good scene,” Ms. Stein said. She made that case to the East Longmeadow Town Council, hoping councilors would open the door to refugees shut out of Springfield. Some seemed moved by the testimonies, including the story of Mr. Abdirahman, who now holds a master’s degree and works as the assistant director of behavioral health services at Jewish Family Service. “To our residents who took the time to speak from your heart, thank you for doing that,” said Kathleen G. Hill, the Town Council president. “And come visit anytime.” But the Council already voted to take no action on Mr. Trump’s executive order in November, weeks after it was signed. Local government rules stipulated that they could not take the matter up for another six months. Their hands were tied. And under Mr. Trump’s policy, doing nothing meant turning the refugees away.",The New York Times
2020,Trump Travels to New Hampshire to Rally Republicans and Distract Democrats,"On the eve of the state’s presidential primary, he arrived with a team of surrogates who will visit polling places on Tuesday. MANCHESTER, N.H. — In his first rally since the Senate acquitted him on charges that he abused power and obstructed Congress, a triumphant President Trump returned on Monday to New Hampshire, the state where he won his first primary in 2016 and that he hopes to carry in 2020. At a rally in an arena that top officials billed as something of a homecoming, Mr. Trump’s crowd erupted in vintage chants of “Lock her up!” when he referred to Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s behavior at his State of the Union address last week, when she tore up a copy of his remarks after he finished. “I’m speaking and a woman is mumbling terribly behind me, angry,” he said. “We’re the ones who should be angry.” But Mr. Trump also credited Ms. Pelosi and the impeachment trial for an increase in his poll numbers. “Thank you, Nancy,” he said. Mr. Trump and his top campaign aides made it clear that their immediate goal in coming to Manchester on the eve of the New Hampshire primary was to steal attention from a competitive Democratic primary in which Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., are running almost neck and neck in many surveys. Mr. Trump dangled the idea that in the open primary, Republicans could try to influence the outcome. “A lot of Republicans tomorrow will vote for the weakest candidate,” Mr. Trump said. “My only problem is I’m trying to figure out who is the weakest candidate. I think they’re all weak.” And the president claimed, without evidence, that Democrats illegally bussed in voters from Massachusetts to vote in New Hampshire in the 2016 election, when Mr. Trump narrowly lost the state to Hillary Clinton. But even his former campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, who is from New Hampshire, has said that never happened. “We should have won the election,” Mr. Trump said. “But they had buses being shipped up from Massachusetts hundreds and hundreds of buses, and it was very, very close even though they did.” In a disjointed speech where he toggled between the teleprompter and his own discursive asides, Mr. Trump played into working-class fears by warning of the loss of manufacturing jobs and played up his new North American and Chinese trade agreements. And he stoked the same fears that propelled him to victory in the Republican primary here four years ago, noting that illegal immigrants coming into the country were “murders, rapists, and some other things. They’re going to be poisoning our children with drugs right here in New Hampshire.” Four years ago, Mr. Trump benefited from running against a crowded field of traditional Republican candidates. This time around, a field of three challengers has already been whittled down to one — Bill Weld, a former Massachusetts governor who has failed to make any dent in Mr. Trump’s popularity within the party. But Mr. Trump hopes to deprive Democrats of being the focus of attention; in Iowa, the front page of The Des Moines Register the day after the president’s rally there featured a picture of him, not the Democrats. Trump campaign officials said they were eager to begin running a general election strategy in a state the president lost to Mrs. Clinton by just 2,700 votes and where they believe they can expand the map in November. Mr. Trump’s rally at SNHU Arena brought him back to the place where he shocked voters during the primary with a vulgar description of his chief rival at the time, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. A few weeks ago Mr. Trump singled out Mr. Cruz for praise when he signed the United States-Mexico-Canada trade deal. “Thank you, Ted, for everything,” he said. “You’ve been incredible.” It was a reminder of how far Mr. Trump has come in four years — his onetime foes have become his biggest defenders. But his remarks also showed how much he relied on the same kit of tricks to rally his supporters. Mr. Trump reprised a 2016 primary campaign staple — reading aloud a poem called “The Snake,” about a woman who was bitten by a pet reptile she took in. In Mr. Trump’s rendering, “The Snake” represented the threat of undocumented immigrants. Mr. Trump, who is deeply superstitious, had not read the poem in months. Supporters who began lining up in the snow a day ahead of the rally appeared to have forgiven Mr. Trump — if they ever blamed him — for maligning New Hampshire as a “a drug-infested den” in a 2017 private call with the president of Mexico, the transcript of which was published by The Washington Post. Before leaving Washington to fly here, Mr. Trump expressed his admiration for authoritarian countries like China, where drug dealers are executed. “Countries with a powerful death penalty, with a fair but quick trial, they have very little if any drug problem,” he said. “That includes China.” The president’s daughter Ivanka Trump, a senior White House adviser, joined him in Manchester after attending a “Cops for Trump” event in Portsmouth, with Vice President Mike Pence. A team of congressional allies, including Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Senator Rick Scott of Florida and Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, were also on hand, and plan to greet voters at polling stations on Tuesday. Mr. Trump’s 2016 primary victory in New Hampshire, coupled with Mr. Sanders’s trouncing of Mrs. Clinton in the Democratic race, were seen at the time as a sign of the power of two establishment-wrecking candidates. Part of Mr. Trump’s challenge this time around will be channeling the same outsider energy from the seat of the presidency. Mr. Trump’s campaign is now focused on Mr. Sanders as the candidate it would most want to face in a general election. Mr. Trump has not, in the past, been willing to bend to the traditional politicking that New Hampshire voters expect. In 2016, he grumbled to audiences in the state about the time he had to spend in the car to get from one event to another. And he bypassed the traditional flesh-pressing that New Hampshire voters expect from candidates trying to win their votes, instead flying in and out of the state on his private jet and sticking to jumbo rallies. His campaign style has not changed. Mr. Trump outsourced the diner meet-and-greets to Mr. Pence, who dutifully stopped by Airport Diner in Manchester, N.H., on Monday, where he and Ms. Trump sat with a family eating mozzarella sticks for an early dinner. And the president left quickly after the rally, departing for Dover Air Force Base in Delaware to participate in a dignified transfer of two soldiers killed over the weekend in Afghanistan. “These were fallen heroes,” Robert O’Brien, the president’s national security adviser, told reporters aboard Air Force One. “And we were close by.” Katie Rogers contributed reporting.

2020,Opinion | Trump Uses Kids Sold Into Sex Slavery to Score Political Points,"“Using human trafficking for pernicious political purposes is … a Trump administration invention.” Opinion Columnist Few people on earth are so exploited as children trafficked into the sex trade. And now they are being exploited again, by President Trump. “My administration is putting unprecedented pressure on traffickers at home and abroad,” Trump declared at a White House meeting on trafficking last month. “My administration is fighting these monsters, persecuting and prosecuting them, and locking them away for a very, very long time. We’ve had a tremendous track record — the best track record in a long time.” I’ve been reporting about human trafficking all over the world since the 1990s, so part of me is thrilled that a president is highlighting this issue. Ivanka Trump has made it a signature issue, and she organized the White House event. The president used the occasion to announce a new White House position to oversee antitrafficking efforts, and all this high-level attention could be very helpful. Yet it’s increasingly clear that this is less about protecting children and more about exalting Trump, whose administration is actually prosecuting fewer traffickers and making it harder for some trafficking survivors to get help. As a result, major antitrafficking organizations boycotted the White House session. “Over the last three years we have watched with horror as the administration has dismantled protections for trafficking survivors,” said Martina Vandenberg, the president of the Human Trafficking Legal Center in Washington, who stayed away. “Using human trafficking for pernicious political purposes is new,” she added. “It is a Trump administration invention.” The Human Trafficking Legal Center reports only 146 federal trafficking indictments in 2019, down from 204 in the last year of the Obama administration. A whistle-blower complaint alleges the administration diverted antitrafficking money from well-respected nonprofits to less-effective organizations like “Hookers for Jesus.” Foreign women and children who have been trafficked into America’s sex trade are eligible for a special visa, the T visa, under a program with bipartisan support, but the administration in 2019 approved only 500 T visas, down from 748 in 2016, and wait times are now three or four times longer. The administration now threatens to deport trafficking survivors who are denied T visas, so applications have fallen. The U.S. traditionally pushed other countries to crack down on human traffickers and toughen their laws on trafficking. But in 2018, only five countries changed their laws, down from 25 in 2016. Many more tough laws are still needed. The administration has also made no attempt to address underlying causes of trafficking — such as child poverty. America’s foster care system, for example, is dysfunctional and amounts to a pipeline for traffickers. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine last year offered an important road map to cut American child poverty by half — a step that would reduce trafficking — but the administration has ignored it. “We are losing the ‘war on trafficking,’ mostly because we have made this all about prosecutions,” Vandenberg said. “We are doing almost no prevention.” Rachel Lloyd, who was trafficked into the sex trade as a teenager, now runs an excellent program in New York City called the Girls Educational and Mentoring Service, or GEMS, which helps girls who have been trafficked. Lloyd said that when she realized that the administration was only engaged in a P.R. effort, she turned down a position on an administration advisory panel and also declined a $10,000 donation from Ivanka Trump for GEMS. “Why would we give them cover and validation?” asked Lloyd, whose memoir, “Girls Like Us,” is one of the best books on trafficking. Human trafficking is one of the pre-eminent moral challenges of our time. The International Labor Organization estimates that worldwide, some 10 million children exist in forms of modern slavery. In Cambodia, I once saw terrified young girls being sold for their virginity; in Pakistan, I saw a brothel owner determined to kill a girl who had escaped. Trump’s exploitation of trafficking victims for his own purposes is particularly sad because this is a rare issue where Democrats and Republicans have worked productively together: Evangelical Christians and liberal feminists both have done heroic work for 20 years. Representative Chris Smith, a Republican from New Jersey, has done outstanding work on this issue, as has Gloria Steinem. It’s useful for a president to speak up about trafficking, to keep the issue on the agenda. But Trump sensationalizes in lurid terms: “Women are tied up, they’re bound, duct tape put around their faces,” he has said. It’s usually more complicated than that, and survivors are irritated that Trump cites trafficking as a reason to build his border wall. “This is an issue that doesn’t need overdramatizing,” said Lloyd, who was nearly killed by her pimp. “It’s bad enough. You don’t need to make it worse.” Shaquana Blount, who was trafficked at age 14 in New York and is now 30, put it this way: “The president’s sensationalization of sex trafficking is a spit in the face to myself and many survivors, as his narrative does not fit ours. It is his own.” The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor. We’d like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles. Here are some tips.

2020,Trump Was Furious That Passengers With Coronavirus Were Brought Back to U.S.,"Among the passengers from the Diamond Princess cruise ship who were flown back were 14 American citizens who tested positive for the virus. The move took Mr. Trump by surprise. Get an informed guide to the global outbreak with our daily Coronavirus
 newsletter.
 WASHINGTON — President Trump was infuriated that 14 American citizens who had tested positive for coronavirus were permitted to return this week to the United States, said two senior administration officials. The decision had taken the president, a self-declared “germophobe,” by surprise. Officials at the State Department decided to bring back the citizens, who had been quarantined on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan, after consulting with a senior official at the Department of Health and Human Services. But officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention objected, concerned that the passengers, among hundreds of Americans being evacuated from the ship, could spread the virus. News organizations reported on the decision on Monday, and the passengers arrived in the United States that day. Mr. Trump, furious at not having been briefed on the Americans who had tested positive, relayed his anger to Alex M. Azar II, the health and human services secretary, and other top officials. They then alerted the White House interagency task force on the coronavirus, which Mr. Azar oversees. One official said Mr. Trump views shutting the borders to infected people as critical to keeping the country safe and wants to be seen as managing a proper response. The top State Department official on the task force is Stephen E. Biegun, the deputy secretary of state. During the early legs of a four-day trip this week to the West Coast meant to bolster his re-election effort, Mr. Trump paid close attention to Fox News’s coverage of the Diamond Princess that played aboard Air Force One. Word of Mr. Trump’s reaction had already begun circulating among officials on Tuesday morning. The Washington Post and Politico first reported on it on Friday. Updated Feb. 29, 2020 In 2014, during an Ebola crisis in Africa, Mr. Trump, who was then a private citizen, demanded that the Obama administration cancel flights and bar anyone infected with the virus from entering the country — including American medical workers who had gone to Africa to help. “KEEP THEM OUT OF HERE!” he wrote in a July 31 tweet after learning that one American medical worker would be evacuated to Atlanta from Liberia. “The U.S. cannot allow EBOLA infected people back,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter the next day, adding: “People that go to far away places to help out are great — but must suffer the consequences!” There have been at least 634 infections and two deaths from the Diamond Princess, which Japanese officials kept in isolation for two weeks at a port in Yokohama. That effort at a quarantine contributed to the virus’s rapid spread among passengers. The cluster from the ship is the largest concentration of coronavirus cases outside China, warranting its own category in data compiled by the World Health Organization. American officials began a complex evacuation procedure on Sunday night for 328 passengers aboard the Diamond Princess. All had been examined by American medical experts and showed no symptoms of the coronavirus, Dr. William Walters, managing director of operational medicine at the State Department, and Dr. Robert Kadlec, assistant secretary for preparedness and response at the Department of Health and Human Services, said on Monday during a conference call with reporters. But as those passengers were bused to Haneda Airport in Tokyo early Monday morning, Japanese officials told American counterparts that laboratory tests for 14 passengers had come back positive, Dr. Walters said. The tests had been conducted two to three days earlier, but American officials, believing the timing of the results would be “unpredictable” because of the volume of testing being done in Japan, began the evacuation without having all results in hand. American passengers who had already tested positive or who had displayed symptoms had been sent to hospitals in Japan, Dr. Walters said. After they learned that 14 passengers had tested positive, American officials decided that the entire group set to leave Japan should be treated according to protocols the officials had developed for evacuees, Dr. Walters said. That meant continuing to transport those who had tested positive but putting them in isolation — behind sheets of plastic about 10-feet tall — at the rear of the two planes flying them back to the United States. Dr. Walters said on Monday that he and Dr. Kadlec reviewed the possible options after learning of the test results. “Then the question was simply this: Are these evacuees?” Dr. Walters said. “And do we follow our protocol? And the answer to that was yes on both accounts.” Dr. Kadlec added, “We had additional expertise and experienced eyes on these people and monitoring through the flight.” The planes landed at Travis Air Force Base in California and Lackland Air Force Base in Texas. Most of the 14 passengers who had tested positive were then flown to Omaha for treatment and monitoring by experts at the University of Nebraska. Since then, Japanese officials have informed American officials that several other passengers among the 328 brought back had also tested positive for coronavirus. On Friday, American officials said at least 34 people inside the United States have the virus — 18 of them from the Diamond Princess. All of the 34 cases have been linked to overseas travel. There has been no sign yet of the virus spreading among communities in the United States. The State Department is closely monitoring American citizens on board the Westerdam cruise ship in Cambodia, as well as Americans who have disembarked and are in hotels in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia. Those Americans are expected to travel onward at some point. One 83-year-old American woman from the ship traveled to Malaysia and tested positive for coronavirus. Dr. Walters said Monday that 92 American citizens were still on board the Westerdam, while another 260 were in hotels in the Cambodian capital. About 300 American citizens had left the country, but “only after testing by the government of Cambodia’s ministry of health,” he said. When asked whether the United States was thinking about arranging evacuation flights for the hundreds of Americans in Cambodia or elsewhere, Dr. Walters did not offer a direct answer. He said the State Department was “following very closely” the situation of American citizens in places where coronavirus is prevalent and of citizens who are “having difficulty in returning to the United States because of the disruptions in the international airline industry, and flights, and so forth.” Separately, State Department officials say that thousands of Russia-linked social media accounts are spreading disinformation about the coronavirus, including a conspiracy theory that the United States is behind the outbreak. American monitors first identified the campaign in mid-January. Agence France-Presse reported the assessment on Saturday. “Russia’s intent is to sow discord and undermine U.S. institutions and alliances from within, including through covert and coercive malign influence campaigns,” said Philip T. Reeker, the acting assistant secretary of state for Europe and Eurasia. “By spreading disinformation about coronavirus, Russian malign actors are once again choosing to threaten public safety by distracting from the global health response.”",The New York Times
2020,Opinion | Trump Weakens the Nation’s Clean Water Efforts,"The president’s decision to roll back protections is deeply misguided. Mr. Wood is president of Trout Unlimited, Mr. O’Mara is president of the National Wildlife Federation and Mr. Hall is a former director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. The Environmental Protection Agency made a startling admission last month when it announced that many of the nation’s streams and wetlands would no longer be protected under the Clean Water Act, perhaps the nation’s most successful antipollution law. The agency said it could not predict how many miles of streams and acres of wetlands would lose their protection because of “existing data and mapping limitations.” In other words, the E.P.A. was sharply narrowing the reach of a landmark environmental law without understanding the consequences of its actions. This is flat wrong on every level. We do know the consequences. And we can say unequivocally that this ill-informed policy will reduce water protections to a level not seen in more than a generation. We understand the impact not just because the three of us have spent decades working to protect fish and wildlife, and not just because our organizations have an intimate understanding of the significance of the now-jeopardized headwater streams and wetlands that are so critical to healthy wildlife, waterfowl and wild trout. We know this because we did what the E.P.A. apparently did not do: We dug into the best available mapping resources to find out what will happen. Last year, Trout Unlimited analyzed detailed United States Geological Survey stream and topographic maps and other resources, and while these maps did not tell us whether a particular stream, lake or wetland will be protected or not under the new policy, they did help us reach larger conclusions. Trout Unlimited’s research suggests that more than six million miles of streams — half the total in the United States — will now be unprotected by the Clean Water Act, because they flow only after rainfall. More than 42 million acres of wetlands — again, about half the country’s total — will no longer be protected because they are not immediately adjacent to larger waters. This will make it easier to pollute streams and fill in wetlands that safeguard our water supplies, reduce flood risks and provide for healthy fish and wildlife habitat. And it will make it harder to provide sensible oversight of oil and gas projects, pipeline construction and major housing development. The impacts will be felt nationwide. In Arizona, for instance, home of the threatened Apache trout, almost all streams are dry except during and after rainstorms. As a result, 83 percent of Arizona streams will lose protection under the E.P.A.’s new policy, according to state officials, along with 99 percent of lakes. Because the state does not have its own regulations, 98 percent of the permits that limit pollution discharges into waterways will simply no longer be in force. The situation is similar in New Mexico, where the new rule will effectively invalidate permits controlling the levels of mercury and PCBs running off the heavily contaminated grounds of Los Alamos National Laboratory and into the Rio Grande, Santa Fe’s main drinking water supply. In West Virginia and Virginia, there will no longer be federal protections for some 82 small streams that are to be excavated if the 600-mile Atlantic Coast Pipeline is built, based on surveys by Dominion, the pipeline’s developer. In the Great Plains, the E.P.A. will no longer conserve freshwater marshes known as prairie potholes that fill with water in the spring and provide critical, timely habitat for more than half of North America’s migratory waterfowl. In the flood-prone Houston area, federal permits will not be required to develop coastal and prairie wetlands that absorb excess rainwater and provide habitat for migrating songbirds and waterfowl. The E.P.A.’s new policy comes with a price tag. It’s not just that it threatens an $887 billion American outdoor recreation economy powered in part by anglers, duck hunters and wildlife watchers. When the E.P.A. stops protecting these streams and wetlands, states will have to foot the bill for regulatory oversight; many states may decide not to step in at all. When developers fill in wetlands, local communities will be on the hook for cleaning up more frequent flood damage. When headwaters are polluted, cities downstream will pay to treat their drinking water. You need only consider the name to recognize what’s happening here. What was the Waters of the United States Rule is now the Navigable Waters Protection Rule. This signals a narrow concern only for commerce but not, illogically, for the network of tributaries and wetlands that keep navigable waters healthy. It also completely misses the point of the Clean Water Act, which is to protect the health of all the nation’s waters. If we are to reach that goal — if we are to keep our streams and wetlands safe for fish and wildlife, recreation, and drinking — we must not allow this flawed and misguided rule to stand.

2020,"Opinion | Trump Will Slime His Democratic Opponent, No Matter Who It Is","The approach is not to appear more ethical than the other candidate but to tear down that person’s character. Mr. Masket is a professor of political science and director of the Center on American Politics at the University of Denver. Given the amount of political news being generated these days, you could be forgiven for not paying close attention to both the Trump-Ukraine scandal and the 2020 presidential campaign. But they are actually one and the same: The scandal is the campaign. President Trump was impeached (and acquitted) for using foreign military aid funding to pressure the Ukrainian government to announce an investigation into Joe Biden and his son Hunter, a former board member of the Burisma Holdings company. Mr. Trump was and is trying to generate a scandal to make the Biden family look corrupt. It should be clear by now that this is how Mr. Trump runs for office. He goes into 2020 in a political situation similar to the one he was in four years ago — he’s trailing modestly in polls and is largely seen as ethically challenged. His approach with Hillary Clinton then and with Joe Biden (or any Democrat) now is not to appear more ethical than they are but to besmirch their character with scandal. The idea is to make them look no better than he is, so that political journalists and voters come to see them as equally tainted by scandal, thus neutralizing ethical considerations. It is a remarkable innovation in presidential campaigns. And as the Democrats get deeper into the actual voting toward selecting their nominee and fret over Mr. Biden and Ukraine or Bernie Sanders and socialism, they might keep in mind that it can be applied (early and often) to any opponent. Traditionally, candidates followed a “glass houses” approach, trying to steer conversations away from areas in which they were vulnerable. Bill Clinton wasn’t about to accuse George H.W. Bush of having an affair, and it would have been strange to see Barack Obama accusing John McCain of inexperience or having a radical minister. Mr. Trump runs in the opposite direction. He directly accuses his opponents of scandals in which he himself is implicated. You could see this as a logical extension of the Republican strategy in 2004. Democrats had nominated a decorated military veteran, John Kerry, in part to bolster their party’s reputation for patriotism during wartime and to draw a favorable comparison with George W. Bush, who had avoided combat in the Vietnam War. Instead of changing the subject, however, Republicans attacked Mr. Kerry as someone who didn’t earn his medals and was potentially treasonous. But Mr. Bush, running for re-election that year, kept his hands clean of those attacks and let his allies do the dirty work for him. Mr. Trump, on the other hand, embraces such rhetoric. Along with his Republican allies, friends in the Russian government and supportive news organizations like Fox, Mr. Trump aggressively pushed the Hillary Clinton email story throughout 2016. Political journalists felt compelled to mention it so that their coverage wouldn’t appear biased. All of this helped voters see Mrs. Clinton as mired in scandal, just like her opponent. Mr. Trump’s approach to Mr. Biden is identical. His effort to get the Ukrainian government to announce an official investigation into the Biden family seems to have been thwarted by the whistle-blower. However, Mr. Trump and his Republican allies in Congress have been heavily pushing the story that Mr. Biden is compromised and corrupt, and used his influence in Ukraine for personal benefit — exactly what Mr. Trump is being accused of. This will be the Trump campaign agenda throughout 2020 if Mr. Biden gets the Democratic nomination — not to portray himself as ethical, but to get voters to say, “Well, both of them have scandals, so whatever.” And some political journalists will feel compelled to acknowledge the accusations against the Bidens. They’ll offer caveats, of course, as one news story from 2019 did, saying, “There’s no evidence that Hunter or his father acted improperly or violated any laws. But the arrangement, government ethics experts say, raises concerns.” The “raises concerns” part is the key — it will be just enough to plant seeds of doubt in voters’ minds about the Democrat’s ethical commitments. But the Trump approach is nothing if not flexible. He’d use it against any Democratic nominee. If Mr. Sanders is nominated, Mr. Trump might pull from many things in the senator’s long political history. For one, Mr. Sanders honeymooned in the U.S.S.R. in 1988. It wouldn’t take too much effort for Mr. Trump to suggest that Mr. Sanders did something untoward or un-American during that 10-day trip, and he has friends in high places in the Russian government who could help in this regard. If it’s Pete Buttigieg, he’ll accuse the former mayor of being racist through his leadership in South Bend, Ind., or of being corrupt through his consulting work with McKinsey. If it’s Elizabeth Warren, he’ll accuse her of racism, of fraudulently using ancestry claims to get into schools and of taking millions of dollars in shady legal consulting fees. My argument here is not that Democrats should focus on picking a clean nominee who can’t be smeared with scandal. The leading Democrats are all pretty clean. Rather, I’m saying that Mr. Trump and his Republican allies will attempt to make the nominee look dirty, legitimately or not, no matter who it is. That’s his one go-to campaign tactic. Now, it’s not obvious that this tactic works all that well. According to John Sides, Michael Tessler and Lynn Vavreck’s study of the 2016 election, “Identity Crisis,” media coverage of the general election was a net negative for Mr. Trump. Even while tearing down Mrs. Clinton’s reputation, he was still at a disadvantage. On the other hand, the relentless focus on the email scandal most likely pressured James Comey, the F.B.I. director at the time, to announce the agency would review new material in the investigation of Mrs. Clinton in late October of 2016, and that may well have influenced the election’s outcome. But once Mr. Trump starts going after the Democratic nominee this way, Democrats shouldn’t kick themselves for not picking a cleaner champion. No matter who it is, Mr. Trump will find a scandal.

2020,"Opinion | On Roger Stone, Trump and Barr Are Out of Control","The prosecutor who quit over the Roger Stone sentencing is sending a powerful message about political weaponization. Mr. Bauer was a White House counsel in the Obama administration. The resignation of a Justice Department prosecutor over the sentencing of Roger Stone is a major event. The prosecutor, Jonathan Kravis, apparently concluded that he could not, in good conscience, remain in his post if the department leadership appeared to buckle under White House pressure to abandon a sentencing recommendation in the case of Mr. Stone, the associate of President Trump who was convicted of obstructing a congressional inquiry into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Three of his colleagues quit the Stone case but remain with the department: Mr. Kravis left altogether. Even though the president for years has derided federal law enforcement officials, accusing them variously of conflicts of interest and criminality and weakness in not pursuing prosecution of his political opposition, Mr. Kravis’s is the first resignation in the face of these assaults. Dramatically forceful responses to Mr. Trump’s assaults on rule-of-law norms have been all too rare. A resignation can set off an alarm bell for an institution whose failings an official might be unable to bring to light in no other way, or as effectively. It upholds rule of law norms in the very act of signaling that they are failing. It makes its point with power and transparency, and stands a chance of rallying support from those who remain in place and compelling other institutions like the press and Congress to take close notice. The government official who resigns for these reasons is, paradoxically, doing his or her job by leaving it. Why did the Stone matter so clearly warrant resignation? The president has used Twitter to denounce and pressure department officials, senior administration lawyers and the Mueller team. When he did that to Attorney General Jeff Sessions, his deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, and the special counsel Robert Mueller, they stuck it out. They must have thought that the best way to serve the rule of law was to hold off or humor the president, maintaining regular order as much as possible even as Mr. Trump raged that he could not fully control his department. And there is a case to make for their choice. Mr. Sessions stood up to the president and adhered to his decision to recuse himself from the Russia investigation. Mr. Mueller was not fired and completed his investigation in the Russia matter. But this time, the president got what he wanted. Mr. Trump attacked the department sentencing recommendation as an unacceptable “miscarriage of justice” that was “horrible and unfair.” And then the department did switch positions on the sentencing, criticizing its own prosecutors for failing to be “reasonable” in their recommendation to the court. This, then, could be seen as the extreme case, whereas normally a lawyer might decide that “working from the inside” is the best, most responsible answer to the president’s behavior. Still, if resignation had been seen earlier as viable, even necessary option, it’s possible that we would not have arrived at this point. Mr. Sessions could have resigned over the president’s public calls for him to ignore his recusal requirements or prosecute Hillary Clinton. If Mr. Mueller had resigned over the president’s attacks on him and refusal to sit for an interview, he might not have completed his report but he would have rendered a devastating and unequivocal judgment. And, without a report he felt compelled to rely on, Mr. Mueller might have felt himself more at liberty to testify in detail to Congress. Resignation, while an act of professional conscience, can be effective in pushing back against violations of norms of impartial, professional law enforcement insulated from political pressure. According to the Mueller report, having been finally pushed too far, the White House counsel Don McGahn threatened to resign in June 2017 over Mr. Trump’s directive to fire Mr. Mueller. What did the president do? He backed down. That was then. Mr. Trump has established a new normal at the senior legal leadership of his administration. The rhetoric of Mr. Sessions’s successor, William Barr, suggests that he accepts, to a disturbing degree, the president’s desire for a politically responsive Justice Department. Mr. McGahn’s successor, Pat Cipollone, defended the president in the impeachment proceeding with arguments of the kind, in tone and variance from the factual record, you would expect to hear from Trump surrogates on Fox News. We can’t know if a wave of resignations early in this administration would have made a difference in preventing or tempering the unfortunate appearance, and perhaps increasing reality, that the administration of justice is being politicized. During the Watergate scandal, the Saturday Night Massacre resignations by Justice Department leaders certainly made an impression on President Richard Nixon, who then appointed an effective independent prosecutor, Leon Jaworski. Resignations can be a shock to the system, just what is needed to clarify the issues, force Congress to pay attention and alter a president’s behavior. What government lawyers are prepared to accept, the conditions under which they are willing to work, still matters. Institutions can be severely damaged in one huge blow or whittled away. Of course, resignation as an act of protest is not a choice to be lightly made by those who join an administration and find themselves in disagreement with the president. It is not justified by policy decisions that a subordinate official would have made differently. But the president should not be able to command this loyalty when the conflict concerns something as fundamental as the professionalism and independence of the Justice Department — and involves a case in which the president has a direct personal interest and the defendant is a political associate. For senior administration lawyers to just manage these kinds of conflict — ignoring Mr. Trump’s tweets and disregarding his inappropriate if not unlawful presidential orders — allows the abnormal to become normal and professional standards to crumble. The prosecutor who resigns rather than remain in a decaying institution is upholding crucial norms. To his credit, at least one lawyer has chosen to do this, even if it is the rare case and it may have come too late to protect the Department of Justice from Mr. Trump’s demands and Attorney General Barr’s apparent willingness to accommodate them.

2020,Trump and Bloomberg’s Twitter Fight: ‘Like if a Rap Battle Was on CNBC’,"Best of Late Night Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown of the previous night’s highlights that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. If you’re interested in hearing from The Times regularly about great TV, sign up for our Watching newsletter and get recommendations straight to your inbox. President Trump and Michael R. Bloomberg traded insults on Twitter on Thursday, with the former calling the latter “Mini Mike” and “a 5’4” mass of dead energy who does not want to be on the debate stage with these professional politicians” (that is, other Democratic presidential candidates). Bloomberg responded by saying that mutual acquaintances in New York laughed at Trump behind his back, calling him “a carnival barking clown.” “This is crazy. Two mega-rich dudes dissing each other in the most personal way. It would be like if a rap battle was on CNBC.” — TREVOR NOAH “The sad part for me is that billionaire feuds used to be so much more dignified, you know? Yeah, back in the day, it wasn’t on Twitter. They would be like, ‘Mr. Trump, I have commissioned a devastating opera that disparages both you and your lineage.’ It’d be like, ‘Well, Master Bloomberg, at this very moment, a team of artisans is sculpting a middle finger from the world’s finest Italian marble. In eight to nine months, you will be truly owned.’” — TREVOR NOAH “Trump spent the morning attacking Mike Bloomberg on Twitter and called him ‘a mass of dead energy.’ When he heard that, Mike Pence was like, ‘Hey, that’s my nickname!’” — JIMMY FALLON “But I will say this: If I was Mike Bloomberg and I had $61 billion — which is what he has — this is how I would get in Trump’s head: I’d buy every ad on Fox News from now until November. I would ruin his precious Hannity time, his ‘Fox and Friends’ in the morning. Maybe instead of an election we should just put these two old billionaires on a jungle island with sharp sticks and force them to hunt each other, you know? Put it on pay-per-view, all proceeds go to the homeless.” — JIMMY KIMMEL “In response, Bloomberg tweeted at Trump and said, ‘Behind your back people are laughing at you.’ Trump called it fake news and spent the next hour trying to look behind his own back.” — JIMMY FALLON “Bloomberg has been rising in the polls, but there could be some hurdles for his campaign. In the past, he’s been accused in several lawsuits of creating an uncomfortable workplace environment for women, but he won’t release women who sued him from their nondisclosure agreements. Oh, good — yet another New York billionaire with a questionable history with women.” — STEPHEN COLBERT “Trump’s former chief of staff, John Kelly, is also speaking out. Last night in New Jersey, John Kelly defended the newly fired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, who testified against the president and criticized the president’s position on many subjects. Which is all well and good, but it’s now a year since he left the White House. This is like a smoke detector that goes off after your house burns down.” — JIMMY KIMMEL “And then after those comments went public, Kelly was rewarded for his belated truth-telling the way anyone who turns on Trump is rewarded — with a nasty personal attack on Twitter. Trump tweeted: ‘When I terminated John Kelly, which I couldn’t do fast enough, he knew full well that he was way over his head. Being Chief of Staff just wasn’t for him. He came in with a bang, went out with a whimper but like so many X’s, he misses the action.’ I’m sorry, do you mean the word ‘exes’? It’s not just spelled with the letter ‘x.’ When you say ‘x,’ people tend to think of the X-Men, and what X-Man would John Kelly be? The one who waits a month after Magneto destroys the city and then says, ‘We should have done something’?” — SETH MEYERS “Then all of Trump’s exes were like, ‘Trust us — we don’t miss the action.’” — JIMMY FALLON The Ontario native Justin Bieber taught Jimmy Fallon how to play Canada’s national pastime on Thursday’s “Tonight Show.” Two new psychological horror films, “The Lodge” and “Swallow,” make motherhood look scarier than ever.",The New York Times
2020,Trump and Kushner Saw Super Bowl Ad as Way of Making Inroads With Black Voters,"Privately, some aides were skeptical that broad numbers of black voters, whose views of the president are overwhelmingly negative, would be persuadable this fall. WASHINGTON — In front of an audience of 102 million Super Bowl viewers Sunday night, Alice Marie Johnson, a 63-year-old African-American woman, became the unlikely face of President Trump’s re-election campaign. In a 30-second spot that cost Mr. Trump’s campaign millions of dollars, Ms. Johnson’s face fills up the screen as she tearfully thanks “President Donald John Trump” for her early release from prison. Mr. Trump commuted her sentence in June 2018, after the reality television star Kim Kardashian West personally appealed to the president on her behalf. Ms. Johnson had been serving a life sentence for a nonviolent drug conviction. Even before the ad, Ms. Johnson was already something of a touchstone for Mr. Trump, who invited her to attend his State of the Union address last year and highlighted her story in his speech. But elevating the administration’s work on criminal justice reform to Super Bowl status was another effort by Mr. Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, to reach black voters. The Johnson ad was made late last year and was tested with focus groups months in advance, aides said. Mr. Trump himself made edits to the spot and ultimately settled on it as the “most impactful” of a flight of ads he was given to choose from in the days leading up to the Super Bowl, people familiar with the process said. Mr. Trump was not wrong: Salesforce data indicated that online, the ad featuring Ms. Johnson was the most talked about one of the game, and that most of the chatter around it was positive. But privately, several senior Trump aides expressed skepticism of Mr. Kushner’s belief that broad numbers of black voters, whose views of the president are overwhelmingly negative, are persuadable. Running an ad aimed at black voters — which could also have the effect of reassuring white suburban women, a worrisome demographic for the campaign, that the president is not racist — was a change of strategy from Mr. Trump’s previous efforts to simply energize and turn out his base. Many public polls back up the skeptics in Mr. Trump’s orbit. According to a Washington Post/Ipsos poll released last month, for instance, more than 80 percent of black respondents said that they believed Mr. Trump was racist and that he had helped to make racism a bigger problem in the country. Nine out of 10 black Americans in the poll said they disapproved of Mr. Trump’s job performance. Mr. Trump himself was a motivating factor for turning out African-American Democrats in the 2018 midterm elections. Voter participation among black people in 2018 grew from the 2014 midterms, according to data from the Pew Research Center. Despite those numbers and the skepticism from colleagues, Mr. Kushner has been advising Mr. Trump that black voters can be converted into supporters if they are simply educated on his policies. Mr. Trump’s biggest challenge, Mr. Kushner has told people, is a “knowledge gap” on many of the president’s accomplishments, particularly on the issue of criminal justice reform, which Mr. Kushner has spearheaded. Mr. Kushner has hosted black leadership summits at the White House. And two of the lone African-American White House staff members, Scott Turner and Ja’Ron Smith, have been traveling to black communities to make a pitch for Mr. Trump. Even some of Mr. Trump’s most vociferous Republican critics said it was not an off-the-wall idea, although Mr. Trump had only a thin record to run on and a political career marked by racial invective and a proposed Muslim ban to run from. “They don’t need to reinforce the base at this point,” said William Kristol, the conservative writer and prominent “Never Trump” Republican. “If they can chip away a little bit at the African-American vote, or make it harder to mobilize them against Trump, it’s not a foolish expenditure of money.” Mr. Kushner has pointed people to public polls, including Rasmussen, that are outliers but that have shown Mr. Trump winning up to 30 percent of the African-American vote. In 2016, Mr. Trump won just 8 percent of the black vote, according to exit polls. But Mr. Kushner has told people that in Hillary Clinton, the 2016 Democratic nominee, they faced a candidate who had been popular in the black community for decades, while Mr. Trump was then an unknown quantity. In 2020, Mr. Kushner has argued, voters need to be reminded of the president’s accomplishments and that their “worst fears have not been realized.” Mr. Trump’s goal is finding a way to shave off enough supporters from the Democratic nominee to compensate for an expected loss of suburban voters in swing states like Michigan and Pennsylvania. Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster, said that in three states that were key to Mr. Trump’s victory — Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania — even a small change could matter. “Given how close many states were, but actually the three Rust Belt states that put him in the White House, any little bit helps at the margins of any demographic group,” Mr. Ayres said. Mr. Trump has professed bafflement that his numbers with black voters are not higher, telling allies he assumed he would fare better because the economy is doing well and unemployment among African-Americans has dropped. Cornell Belcher, a progressive pollster whose firm worked on President Barack Obama’s campaign and who is black, described the efforts by Mr. Trump and Mr. Kushner as laughable. “It’s almost as if they think we’re all kin to each other,” he said, adding that passage of the First Step Act, the criminal justice bill that Mr. Trump signed in 2018, “does not erase this man’s record of just absolute, over-the-top racist rhetoric and policies that frankly hurt African-American communities.” The campaign’s decision to use the Super Bowl as an opportunity to expand its coalition of voters is a change from how Mr. Trump was positioning himself less than two years ago. For years, Mr. Trump repeatedly criticized National Football League players who took a knee when the national anthem was played before games, a form of silent protest against social inequality and police brutality. He directed Vice President Mike Pence to walk dramatically out of an N.F.L. game in Indianapolis in 2017 when a group of football players knelt during the anthem. At the time, his political advisers noted that the fight with N.F.L. players like Colin Kaepernick was not some distraction, but the essence of Mr. Trump’s re-election strategy: enmeshing himself in culture wars and heightening racial tensions as a method to fire up his political base. Jessica Jackson Sloan, the national director of #Cut50, a prisoner advocacy group, said the ad was helpful to her work on the state level, regardless of any political advantage Mr. Trump was trying to achieve. “We’ve heard many times what happened to this country when the Republican candidate for president was playing Willie Horton ads,” Ms. Sloan said, referring to an infamous ad in the 1988 presidential race that highlighted the story of a black man who had raped a white woman and assaulted her husband while free on a prison-furlough program supported by Michael Dukakis, the Democratic candidate. “Regardless of what reasons he did it,” she added of Mr. Trump, “the fact we have a sitting Republican president campaigning on criminal justice reform is 180 degrees from where we’ve been in the past. It’s really going to help us with some of these Republican state legislatures.” The Trump campaign did not announce the subject of the ad until after Michael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire former New York City mayor running for president as a Democrat, unveiled his own ad, which featured an African-American mother grieving the loss of her son to gun violence. Mr. Trump had said he would air a 60-second ad during the Super Bowl, and previewed a generic ad showcasing his economic accomplishments. But what played during the game was a 30-second spot featuring Ms. Johnson, followed by a 30-second one afterward about the president’s economic record. Mr. Trump’s campaign emphatically denied making any decision in reaction to Mr. Bloomberg. “He had nothing to do with it,” said Tim Murtaugh, a campaign spokesman. “How we would use our 60 seconds was always an internal decision based on no outside factors.” Reached on the phone, Ms. Johnson declined to say when she learned the ad in which she appears would run.

2020,Trump and Pelosi Exchange Snubs at the State of the Union Address,"He declined to shake her outstretched hand. She omitted his ceremonial introduction and ripped up her copy of his speech. transcript Members of Congress, the president of the United States. WASHINGTON — For President Trump and Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday night, the State of the Union was hostile. The mutual snubbing began the moment Mr. Trump walked into the House chamber and continued until he finished speaking, when Ms. Pelosi stood, an expression of vague disgust on her face, and tore up her printed copy of his speech — in full view of the television cameras, while Mr. Trump had his back turned. The interaction between Mr. Trump and Ms. Pelosi, who had led the drive to impeach him, was one of the most anticipated moments of the president’s appearance at the Capitol the night before the Senate is expected to acquit him in his impeachment trial. The two had not seen each other since October, when Ms. Pelosi abruptly left a White House meeting after lecturing a scowling Mr. Trump. transcript “The president of the United States.” [applause] The snubs came early, even before President Trump began his State of the Union speech. He declined to shake Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s hand. Moments later, she introduced him without using the ceremonious language that’s customary. “The president of the United States.” [applause] The speech itself included a series of made-for-TV moments: A surprise award for conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh. “The Presidential Medal of Freedom.” [applause] There was also this surprise reunion for a military family. “There is one more thing: Tonight, we have a very special surprise. I am thrilled to inform you that your husband is back from deployment. He is here with us tonight, and we couldn’t keep him waiting any longer.” [applause] Trump also surprised a fourth-grader with a scholarship. “Janiyah, I have some good news for you. An Opportunity Scholarship has become available. It’s going to you, and you will soon be heading to the school of your choice.” [applause] Throughout his speech, Trump struck an optimistic tone, not once mentioning his impeachment trial. “Jobs are booming, incomes are soaring, poverty is plummeting, crime is falling, confidence is surging, and our country is thriving and highly respected again.” The optimism was a way to make his case for re-election. “We are moving forward at a pace that was unimaginable just a short time ago, and we are never, ever going back.” [applause] In foreign policy, he touted the killing of adversaries. “The bloodthirsty killer known as al-Baghdadi is dead. And the U.S. military executed a flawless precision strike that killed Suleimani and terminated his evil reign of terror forever.” He also sent a message to Venezuela’s government by inviting the opposition leader. “… Juan Guaidó.” [applause] Democrats had their own message, many wearing white, a symbol of women’s suffrage and empowerment. [chanting] “We are curbing the opioid epidemic —” Trump ended his speech looking to the future. “This nation is our canvas, and this country is our masterpiece. We look at tomorrow and see unlimited frontiers just waiting to be explored.” After he was through, Speaker Pelosi sent one final message with her copy of his speech. [applause] On Tuesday night, the sour dynamic was on display from the start. When Mr. Trump stepped up to the rostrum in the House of Representatives and handed her his speech, Ms. Pelosi rose and extended her hand to shake his. Mr. Trump turned his back, and the speaker quickly withdrew her hand, appearing to shrug slightly and raise her eyebrows as if to say, “Well, I tried.” Then Ms. Pelosi dealt Mr. Trump a slight of her own by omitting the customary laudatory words in her introduction of the president. Normally, she would have said, “I have the high privilege and distinct honor of presenting to you the president of the United States.” Instead, she said simply, “Members of Congress, the president of the United States.” But it was the flourish at the end — when Ms. Pelosi made a point of picking up her copy of the speech, ripping it in half and throwing the pieces on the table in front of her — that grabbed the attention of the public and drew the ire of Republicans. The gesture was particularly out of character for the speaker, who prides herself on exhibiting proper decorum. Republicans seized on the speech-ripping as beyond the pale. “@SpeakerPelosi had a tantrum, disgraced herself and dishonored the House,” Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the No. 3 House Republican, wrote on Twitter. “She is an embarrassment and unfit for office.” Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump’s campaign manager, sounded almost gleeful. “Nancy & the Dems couldn’t stand what they were hearing because it was all good news for Americans!” he wrote on Twitter. “Rip up the speech, Nancy! You’ll want to rip up the election results in November too!” Predictably, there were deep partisan divisions over who was behaving poorly to whom. Democrats were focused on Mr. Trump’s handshake snub, which Ms. Pelosi later spotlighted on Twitter, along with a photograph of the president turning his back. “Democrats will never stop extending the hand of friendship to get the job done #ForThePeople,” she wrote, using the party’s campaign slogan. “We will work to find common ground where we can, but will stand our ground where we cannot. #SOTU” During the address, as Mr. Trump read from the teleprompter, Ms. Pelosi, dressed in white — the color of the suffragists, worn by many of the Democratic women in the chamber — could be seen behind him, paging through his speech. Practiced at maintaining a stone face (she served as House speaker alongside another Republican president, George W. Bush), she kept her lips pursed and her eyes down, mostly remaining seated as Republicans rose to give Mr. Trump one standing ovation after another. But when Mr. Trump made mention of the First Step Act, the bipartisan legislation that overhauled criminal justice reforms, Ms. Pelosi clapped and rose to her feet. The relationship between Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Trump has long been one of the most closely watched in Washington — and it began going downhill even before Ms. Pelosi became House speaker. Mr. Trump tried to undercut her during an Oval Office meeting shortly after Democrats swept to the majority in 2018. Ms. Pelosi would have none of it. “Mr. President,” she shot back, “please don’t characterize the strength that I bring to this meeting as the leader of the House Democrats, who just won a big victory.” When the meeting was over, images of Ms. Pelosi leaving the White House in a swingy red coat quickly went viral. From there, their interactions seemed defined by a series of memes and public spats. Ms. Pelosi called off last year’s State of the Union address because of the government shutdown, enraging Mr. Trump and prompting him to cancel a flight she had scheduled overseas. When his speech was rescheduled, Ms. Pelosi was captured smirking and clapping at the president. When they met in October, a White House photographer snapped an image of the speaker standing up and wagging her finger at the seated president while she lectured him. But none of that came close to the spectacle in the House chamber Tuesday night, on the eve of the president’s expected acquittal in the Republican-led Senate on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress in connection with his campaign to pressure Ukraine to investigate his political rivals. Ms. Pelosi has said that regardless of the Senate outcome, Mr. Trump will be “impeached forever,” as she said in an interview on Monday. She also made a point of saying that she planned to treat the president at the State of the Union address “with the respect that he deserves,” though she added that she did not necessarily expect the same from him. “We will treat him as a guest in our House — and we hope he will behave as a guest in our House,” she said. “But we never have that expectation.” After her display of disdain on Tuesday, Ms. Pelosi told reporters that she had ripped up the speech “because it was a manifesto of mistruths.” Earlier, she had said that it was the “courteous thing to do, considering the alternatives.” She did not elaborate on what else she had considered.

2020,Trump and the Trillion Trees,"Climate Fwd: Also this week, bringing solar power to Navajo homes Welcome to the Climate Fwd: newsletter. The New York Times climate team emails readers once a week with stories and insights about climate change. Sign up here to get it in your inbox. President Trump, in his State of the Union address Tuesday night, talked about a new global effort to plant a trillion trees, although he didn’t mention the problem it was created to address: climate change. “To protect the environment, days ago, I announced the United States will join the One Trillion Trees Initiative, an ambitious effort to bring together government and the private sector to plant new trees in America and around the world,” he said. Earlier in the speech, though, he lauded American production of oil and gas, both fossil fuels that generate emissions of planet-warming carbon dioxide. Republican climate advocates said they weren’t surprised that Mr. Trump sidestepped direct mention of global warming. They said the president was trying to thread a needle by both promoting fossil fuels and declaring himself environmentally friendly ahead of the elections. “No surprise at all,” said Jerry Taylor, president of the Niskanen Center, a conservative think tank that supports a tax on carbon-dioxide emissions. Republicans, he said, are “trying to solve a political problem, the perception that the party just doesn’t care one bit about climate change.” Ted Halstead, the chief executive of the Climate Leadership Council, a policy group backed by two former Republican secretaries of state, James A. Baker III and George P. Shultz, said he also believed electoral math was driving Mr. Trump’s softening on the environment. He said he was hopeful the rhetorical shift would drive a substantive one. “There’s a major Republican climate pivot, which is encouraging,” Mr. Halstead said. “The president is talking about a trillion trees, the House is talking about innovation. These are all encouraging steppingstones, but none of them are nearly enough.” Mr. Taylor said he believed the shift was driven by “cold-eyed Republican realists in Trump’s re-election campaign” and that he wasn’t certain it would translate into progress in the battle against climate change. Solving the problem, he said, “would require a lot more than policies to promote ever greater use of oil, gas and coal — leavened by some trees.” Wahleah Johns is on a mission to provide solar power to 15,000 families in the Navajo Nation. Ms. Johns is the co-founder and executive director of Native Renewables, a company that is installing off-grid solar panels for families on the reservation, which covers parts of New Mexico, Arizona and Utah. Native Renewables started with three homes in 2019 and plans to install the systems for 100 homes this year. “These families are going to be the model of how we should be living in a more just and sustainable way,” she said. Ms. Johns, 44, who describes herself as a community organizer, grew up without electricity about a mile from one of the largest coal mines in the United States, Peabody Energy’s Kayenta Mine, which, together with the Navajo Generating Station, a coal-fired power plant on the reservation, shut down last year. Both closed, at least in part, because of a broad shift in the United States away from coal for power generation. She said her vision had been influenced by the “beautiful narratives about the sun” that were passed down by her ancestors, and her belief that off-grid solar is the most sustainable form of power generation. Tribal lands have the highest rates of homes without electricity in the United States, and about three-quarters of those homes are in the Navajo Nation. There are various reasons for that, including the high costs of extending power lines into sparsely populated areas. At the same time, many of those lands have great capacity to generate renewable energy. “It’s astounding that no one has addressed this,” Ms. Johns said. “I realized that if nobody was going to provide power for these families, we had to figure out how to power ourselves using the sun.” In her home, where she lives with her husband and two daughters, Tohaana, 11, and Alowaan, 9, Ms. Johns now has an off-grid solar system that provides enough power for a handful of appliances — including a coffee maker, a refrigerator and a slow cooker — though not enough for more energy-hungry devices like a space heater or an electric dryer. There have been other efforts to bring power to tribal lands. The federal government, through the Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs, has invested nearly $85 million in more than 180 tribal energy projects from 2010 to 2019. Last year, with the help of volunteers, the Navajo Tribal Utility Authority built power lines to provide electricity to 233 families. And another group, called Navajo Power, aims to build 10,000 megawatts of solar capacity in the Navajo Nation. The small, off-grid solar systems proposed by Native Renewables cost around $15,000 per home. But according to the Clean Energy States Alliance, in the long term, families that currently use fossil-fuel-burning generators to produce power could save around 70 percent on their energy bills. To overcome the burden of upfront costs, Native Renewables is teaming up with PosiGen, a New Orleans lender that provides solar financing to cash-strapped families. But Ms. Johns also needs to raise about $1.5 million to scale up operations, and that has been challenging. Native Renewables is led by Navajo and Hopi women, which resonates with locals, because the Navajo are traditionally matriarchal. Having access to power would be a game-changer for these communities, said Manley Begay Jr., a professor of applied Indigenous studies at Northern Arizona University. “When you don’t have electricity, it’s very difficult to maintain a standard of living that’s enjoyed by the rest of the country.” Ms. Johns’s emphasis is on the future. She wants to build the foundations of a system that will benefit “seven generations,” a Native tradition that urges people to live and work for the benefit of their descendants.

2020,Opinion | Trump and the Virus,"Not a good combination. Opinion Columnist This article is part of David Leonhardt’s newsletter. You can sign up here to receive it each weekday. A public health crisis can create risks for an authoritarian government that few other crises can. Most crises don’t threaten the immediate well-being of millions of citizens. But an epidemic can. That’s why Chinese citizens have been much bolder than usual in confronting their government over coronavirus. “Online, people are openly criticizing state media,” Li Yuan of The Times reported. “China’s propaganda machine, an increasingly sophisticated operation that has helped the Communist Party stay in power for decades, is facing one of its biggest challenges.” The United States does not have an authoritarian government. Every day, American citizens publicly criticize President Trump with a severity that would bring harsh consequences in China. Yet there are still some similarities between the political risks that the virus poses to Trump and to Xi Jinping, China’s president. In both countries, people who usually support the leader may not be as willing to do so when their own well-being is on the line. And in both countries, the leaders’ instincts conflict with the best practices of virus response. As Ashley Parker and Philip Rucker of The Washington Post write: With the first case of coronavirus not tied to foreign travel being announced in California on Wednesday, Trump finds himself grappling with a crisis for which his record suggests he is particularly ­ill-suited to respond.  At a moment that demands sobriety and honesty, Trump is a leader prone to hyperbole and falsehoods. As the financial markets and the public crave order and clarity, Trump has a penchant for creating chaos and confusion. And at a time when expertise is paramount, Trump has hollowed out the government agencies responsible for the tasks at hand. Peter Nicholas writing last week in The Atlantic: Trump insists on being the protagonist in every drama. He wants to promote the idea that everything on his watch is improving. Virology isn’t politics, though. Tweets don’t beget vaccines. Following his instincts in the face of an outbreak that has left the world on edge risks making things worse. And my colleague Paul Krugman writes: “Maybe Trump — and America — will be lucky, and this won’t be as bad as it might be. But anyone feeling confident right now isn’t paying attention.” If you want to understand the basics of the virus itself, yesterday’s episode of “The Daily” offered an excellent explanation. The mayors’ race There are no more governors or former governors left in the presidential race. But there are three former mayors: Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg and Michael Bloomberg. In a new book, Rahm Emanuel — a former White House chief of staff and mayor of Chicago — argues that the new political prominence of mayors is no coincidence. Much of government seems broken today, Emanuel writes in “The Nation City: Why Mayors Are Now Running the World.” But city governments are not. They are, by necessity, “immediate, intimate and impactful,” dealing with the issues that affect people every day, like education, crime, snow removal and public parks. The presidential race is rightly receiving a lot of attention this year. But don’t lose sight of the many lower-level races that will also be held this year and that will have a big impact on people’s lives. Of the nation’s 100 largest cities, 29 will hold mayoral elections this year, according to Ballotpedia. If you are not a subscriber to this newsletter, you can subscribe here.

2020,Fact-Checking Trump’s 2020 State of the Union Address and the Democratic Response,"It’s a stretch to claim that all 275 pieces of legislation have garnered bipartisan support. According to the nonpartisan Factcheck.org, half passed by a voice vote and at least two dozen of those bills passed with fewer than 17 Republican votes. Of the three bills Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan cited, the Paycheck Fairness Act passed with just seven Republican votes, the Raise the Wage Act had three Republicans on board and the Elijah E.

2020,Highlights From the Nevada Caucuses: Bernie Sanders Is Declared the Winner,"Officials with the Nevada Democratic Party and the Democratic National Committee stressed all week that they had gone to school on lessons learned from the bungled Iowa caucuses, when a smartphone app for reporting results crashed and phone lines to report results were jammed for hours. But by 11:00 p.m. Eastern time — more than seven hours after Nevada’s caucuses began, and four hours after most of them closed — Nevada Democrats still have only reported results from about 23 percent of the state’s precincts. The tardiness stems from new caucus rules mandated by the D.N.C. that require the state party to collect more than 100 data points from each of Nevada’s 2,097 precincts. The state party also installed a duplicative reporting system to try to prevent Iowa-style mishaps that led to a litany of mathematical errors that had to be corrected later. Nevada’s protracted vote-counting served to rob several Democratic candidates who had hoped to claim a second-place finish on Saturday night and position themselves as the moderate alternative to Bernie Sanders, who won what appears to be a commanding victory in Nevada.",The New York Times
2020,Trump in South Carolina: Excerpts,"At a rally in North Charleston, President Trump praised his administration’s response to the coronavirus and assessed the Democratic primary field. President Trump addressed thousands of supporters on Friday night at a “Keep America Great” rally in North Charleston, S.C. It was the night before the state’s Democratic primary and came on a day when the financial markets continued their slide over coronavirus fears. He addressed both the election and the outbreak, along with other issues. Here are excerpts. On the coronavirus “Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus, you know that right? Coronavirus. They are politicizing it. We did one of the great jobs — you say, ‘How’s President Trump doing?’ They go, ‘Oh, not good. Not good.’ They have no clue. They don’t have any clue. They can’t even count the votes in Iowa. No, they can’t. They can’t count their votes. One of my people came up to me and said, ‘Mr. President, they tried to beat you on Russia, Russia, Russia.’ That didn’t work out too well. They couldn’t do it. They tried the impeachment hoax. That was on a perfect conversation. They tried anything. They tried it over and over. They’ve been doing it since you got in. It’s all turning. They lost. It is all turning. Think of it. Think of it. And this is their new hoax. But, you know, we did something that’s been pretty amazing.” “The Democrats’ single talking point, and you see it, is that it’s Donald Trump’s fault, right? Now, just things that happen. Things happen. Whoever thought of this? Two weeks ago who would’ve thought this would be going on, four weeks ago? But things happen in life and you have to be prepared and you have to be flexible and you have to be able to go out and get it. And my guys, we have the best professionals in the world, the best in the world and we are so ready. At the same time that I initiated the first federally mandated quarantine in over 50 years, we had to quarantine some people. They weren’t happy. They weren’t happy about it. I want to tell you, there are a lot of people that not so happy but after two weeks they got happy. You know who got happy? The people around them got happy. That’s who got happy.” On African-Americans “We had a great event yesterday. An event that was so beautiful. Young African-American leaders. One of the things I asked them — and I’ve been thinking about this for a long time — great people, great people, some of them are here tonight — do you like the name African-American or black? And they said ‘black' all at the same time. True. I tell you. Because you say African-American or black. And they said almost, like, immediately, ‘black.’ But we had an incredible group of people.”On the news media“Comcast, which owns NBC — actually NBC, I think, which is, we call it MS-DNC, right? MS-DNC. But NBC I think is worse than CNN. I actually do. And Comcast, a company that spends millions and millions of dollars on their image, I’ll do everything possible to destroy their image because they are — they are terrible. They are terrible, they’re a terrible group of people. And they paid a fortune for years for ‘The Apprentice.’ They paid me a fortune. And when I left the show, it was doing great, when I left the show, 14 seasons, think of that. They got a big movie star. Won’t tell you his name. Nobody would know. Actually, nobody will know his name because he was on for such a short period of time. But the show went down the tubes very quickly after they had Trump.” On the Democrats and the primary “I mean, nervous Nancy [Pelosi], Crying Chuck Schumer, Cryin’ Chuck. Bunch of losers. The good citizens of South Carolina have had a front-row seat to the extremism of the Democrat candidates, whether it’s this character that nobody ever heard of. I thought I knew all the wealthy people. This guy Tom Steyer, Mr. Impeachment. How did that work out, Tom? Hey, he spent millions and millions of dollars in Iowa, right? Millions. He got less than 1 percent. He got like one-third of 1 percent. I wrote a little note, did you see it? It said, ‘Tom, it’s not so easy doing what I did, is it?’ Not so easy. Not so easy. All you have to do is ask Mini Mike [Bloomberg]. He's in there for a fortune. He wished he never started, Mini Mike, he wished he never started. He said, ‘Well, Trump can do it. I’m going to do it, too.’ Unfortunately, it’s not working out too well.” “I hear Mini Mike, by the way, has left, he’s basically given up. That’s what I hear. He gave up! He gave up! Now, I hope what I just said keeps him in. You know, he’s the kind of guy, he’ll stay in because ‘I don’t want to be wrong.’ Mike, it is time to go home. Go home, Mike, and enjoy your life. Go home and spend some money on something. So let’s just go. Do you agree? Pocahontas, we can forget about her, right [referring to Senator Elizabeth Warren]? Pocahontas. I came out with that name far too early. … You know she’s not dumb but she is just so damn mean. We can’t vote for her. She’s a mean one. She is mean. So, Pocahontas, should we leave her in or out? How about [Senator Amy] Klobuchar? Not going to happen. So, really, we’re down to two candidates, right? Sleepy Joe Biden [former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.] and crazy Bernie [Senator Bernie Sanders].” On the border wall “It’s being built. It’s being built. And by the way, just in case you haven’t heard, it is being built, and that you know. They are going to go nuts, they’re gonna go nuts, they thought they got me. They said, OK — have you heard them recently? OK. ‘He’s building the wall.’ And you think it is easy getting that kind of money to build a wall when I have a whole party and a deep state and some Never Trumpers — they’re a dying breed though, they’re on respirators, they’re on mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. … You think it is easy, it’s not. But you know what they say now? ‘OK. He’s building the wall, but Mexico’s not paying for it.’ Yes they are, actually. They are, they are. They are paying for it. And some of the fake news knows that, but they refuse to report it. But that’s OK, you’ll see what’s going on. And I want to thank Mexico because, by the way, right now they have 27,000 soldiers on our border, protecting our border. We have Mexico protecting it. And they only do that for Trump. They don’t do that for Sleepy Joe. They don’t do that for Crazy Bernie. And they don’t do it for Mini Mike, that’s for sure. They are only doing that for Trump.” Zach Montague contributed research.

2020,Highlights From a Day of Campaigning in South Carolina and Super Tuesday States,"Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina went on the Sunday talk show circuit to emphasize that the primaries are young and to caution against prematurely crowning Bernie Sanders as the Democratic nominee. “South Carolina has a demographic that lends itself well to Democratic voters especially, so I think that if you can win South Carolina decisively, I think you can set the stage for Super Tuesday and you will become the odds-on favorite,” Mr. Clyburn said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “I remember John McCain coming into South Carolina the odds-on favorite. He left South Carolina in bad shape,” he continued, arguing that his state had a history of changing the trajectory of presidential races. “We had Barack Obama win South Carolina and be launched all the way to the presidency. Hillary Clinton won South Carolina and became the odds-on favorite, and she won the nomination.” It’s true that black voters are the core of the Democratic base and that South Carolina is the first opportunity for them to participate in significant numbers, which means it absolutely has the potential to be a game-changer. But none of the examples Mr. Clyburn cited resemble the current situation, in which one candidate (Mr. Sanders) dominated the first three primaries and the candidates counting most on South Carolina (Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Tom Steyer) came nowhere near winning any of them. In 2016, a blowout victory in South Carolina gave Mrs. Clinton a big boost going into Super Tuesday, especially after Bernie Sanders won New Hampshire — but Mrs. Clinton had already won Iowa (albeit narrowly) and Nevada, and was already the favorite. In 2008, South Carolina did cement Mr. Obama as the front-runner, but he had already won an upset in Iowa and earned the most delegates in Nevada. As for John McCain, he ran in both 2000 and 2008. While Mr. Clyburn did not specify what year he was referring to, we can safely assume it wasn’t 2008, given that Mr. McCain didn’t leave South Carolina “in bad shape” that year; he won it. But in 2000, while Mr. McCain won New Hampshire, George W. Bush won the other early contests.",The New York Times
2020,Highlights From the Final Day Before Voting,"MANCHESTER — Amy Klobuchar, sounding only slightly hoarse at her fifth rally of the day, at a bar in downtown Manchester, told voters she was in the process of firing up her campaign operation in the coming Nevada caucuses — “and beyond,” she added. More than any other major candidate, Ms. Klobuchar will have to expand her organization in Nevada in a tightly compressed time frame before the Feb. 22 caucuses. She has focused overwhelmingly so far on Iowa and New Hampshire, and for most of the race has faced significant financial constraints. But a Klobuchar aide said on Monday that the campaign was shifting staff members out of Iowa and into Nevada, and Ms. Klobuchar appears to be in a stronger financial position after a post-debate infusion of online cash. “We’re so excited about tomorrow night and then to Nevada, where we’re building a big operation,” Ms. Klobuchar said. She went on to repeat a plea she has offered over the last few days, telling New Hampshire voters “this is a big deal for me here” and crediting the state with having vaulted relatively unknown or underfunded candidates into national contention in the past. Without strong finishes in both New Hampshire and Nevada — and perhaps even with them — it could be exceedingly difficult for Ms. Klobuchar to compete across the enormous Super Tuesday map in early March. But the mere fact that Ms. Klobuchar is confidently turning her attention west represents a real shift from just last week, when her fifth-place finish in Iowa seemed unlikely, on its own, to change the trajectory of her campaign. Without the intervening debate, Ms. Klobuchar could well have been headed for another likely fifth-place finish, leaving her future as a candidate in serious doubt.",The New York Times

2020,Trump to Propose $4.8 Trillion Budget With More Border Wall Funding,"The president’s final budget proposal of his term will offer a blueprint for his priorities if he wins re-election. WASHINGTON — President Trump is expected to propose on Monday a $4.8 trillion budget that will include billions of additional dollars for his wall along the southern border and steep cuts to safety net programs like Medicaid, disability insurance and housing assistance, according to senior administration officials and documents reviewed by The New York Times. The final budget proposal of Mr. Trump’s term is expected to reinforce the anti-immigration platform that helped propel him into office and will be a big part of his re-election campaign. Mr. Trump intends to ask Congress for an additional $2 billion to fund his border wall, according to people familiar with the plan, pressing ahead with one of his signature campaign pledges and setting up another clash with Democrats. The White House budget is generally viewed as a political messaging document. Congress, which is responsible for approving government spending, is under no requirement to adhere to White House requests. Lawmakers have previously rejected many of Mr. Trump’s attempts to gut domestic programs. But this year’s budget will serve as a blueprint for Mr. Trump’s priorities if he wins a second term. And some of the proposals can be achieved without the approval of Congress. The president’s plan includes what officials described as $4.4 trillion in spending cuts over the next decade, with about $2 trillion coming from changes to safety net programs and student loan initiatives. Those reductions encompass new work requirements for Medicaid, federal housing assistance and food stamp recipients, which are estimated to cut nearly $300 billion in spending from the programs. The budget will also cut spending on federal disability insurance benefits by $70 billion and on student loan forgiveness by $170 billion. The budget will propose cutting foreign aid spending by 21 percent and, as in previous budgets, eliminate funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. It would cut the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention budget by 9 percent but increase funding levels for the center’s infectious disease activities. It targets specific programs, including some at the National Institutes of Health, for cuts. The budget also assumes Mr. Trump’s 2017 tax cuts are extended for 10 years: It includes $1.4 trillion to extend the individual tax cuts to 2035. And it includes $1 trillion in new infrastructure spending, including $200 billion for high-priority projects. The budget would slightly increase military spending and reduce nonmilitary domestic spending by 5 percent, defying a budget agreement struck last year by congressional Democrats and Republicans. Given that budget agreement — which both parties agreed to over the summer as part of a two-year spending deal — it is unlikely that Congress will accept such draconian cuts, particularly for housing, environmental programs and the arts. In the Democratic-controlled House, it is all but certain to be declared a nonstarter. And at the beginning of Mr. Trump’s administration, when Republicans controlled both chambers, the administration’s budget proposal largely failed to gain traction on Capitol Hill. In a statement, Representative John Yarmuth, Democrat of Kentucky and the chairman of the House Budget Committee, accused the president of “apparently going back on his word” on the budget agreement by “proposing deep cuts to critical programs that help American families and protect our national security.” “Congress will stand firm against this president’s broken promises and his disregard for the human cost of his destructive policies,” Mr. Yarmuth said. A senior administration official acknowledged that reality on Sunday, saying “our hope is that Congress will consider these and not make us wait for the future. But we do realize that under a two-year spending agreement right now, this conversation may get pushed to the future.” Mr. Trump, who campaigned on a promise to eliminate the federal deficit within eight years, projects a balanced budget in 2035, assuming strong, sustained economic growth and the enactment of trillions of dollars in proposed spending cuts, a senior administration official said Sunday. The White House projects that the deficit — which has ballooned as a result of Mr. Trump’s tax and spending policies — will fall below the trillion-dollar mark, to $966 billion in the 2021 fiscal year. The Congressional Budget Office said in January that it projected that the United States deficit would top $1 trillion annually over the next 10 years, reaching $1.7 trillion in 2030. The administration’s budget predicts a more sanguine deficit number through robust economic assumptions for the next 15 years, including sustained growth near 3 percent, as well as spending cuts. The budget predicts the United States economy will grow at a 2.8 percent rate this year, which is more than a half percentage point more than forecasters at the Federal Reserve and the Congressional Budget Office predict. It then sees growth rising above 3 percent annually for the next several years if the administration’s policies are enacted. The Fed, the budget watchdog and others all see growth falling below 2 percent annually in that time. Growth in 2019 fell nearly a percentage point short of White House projections. Officials on Sunday attributed a half-point of that shortfall to the effects of American trade policy — specifically, uncertainty over the resolution of trade talks with China and congressional approval of a new trade agreement with Canada and Mexico. They said those uncertainties were now resolved and that growth would accelerate accordingly. The administration has also revised down its estimate of the interest the federal government will pay to borrow money over the next decade, an assumption that reduces budget deficits by $1.5 trillion over a decade. In addition to the border wall funding, Mr. Trump plans to ask Congress for $15.6 billion for the Customs and Border Protection agency, a 7 percent increase from current spending levels, and $9.9 billion for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a 23 percent increase. A senior administration official said that the budget would ask for big spending increases on infrastructure, technology and law enforcement personnel, and that the money was needed to “gain operational control” of the border. Mr. Trump is asking for less than the $5 billion in wall funding that he sought a year ago, which resulted in a five-week government shutdown. Since then, he has been shifting funds that Congress allocated for military construction projects to pay for the new border barrier. Congress previously agreed to provide $1.375 billion for wall construction, far less than the $18 billion Mr. Trump asked for in 2018. Last year, after declaring a state of emergency when Congress did not yield to the request for $5 billion, the Trump administration diverted about $6.7 billion from military construction funds and other money intended for cracking down on illicit drugs to pay for the wall. It plans to use $7.2 billion of those funds this year. The shifting of that money has set off a string of legal battles between the Trump administration and opponents of the wall, who argue that the president is wrongfully appropriating funds that were meant for other projects. A federal court ruled in January that some of those funds could be used to build 175 miles of barrier in parts of Texas, Arizona and California. Mr. Trump’s immigration budget request, which was reported by The Wall Street Journal on Sunday, is not expected to include money to reimburse the military for funds that the White House reallocated for the wall. Last month, Mr. Trump drew criticism from Democrats for suggesting during an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, that he would consider cuts to entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare if he won a second term. He has since tried to reverse those comments; in a tweet on Saturday, he said no such cuts would be proposed in the upcoming budget request. The budget for Medicare will be largely similar to what the White House has proposed in previous years, according to a person familiar with the plan. It will suggest a number of policy changes designed to reduce spending by targeting what officials believe is waste in the program. Many of the suggested tweaks are identical to proposals from the Obama administration’s budgets for the program. Taken together, the changes would represent around half a trillion dollars in reduced Medicare spending but do not include any major reductions to benefits or eligibility, like those proposed in House budgets when Republicans controlled that chamber. But on drug prices, an issue the president talks about often, the budget will diverge from previous years. Instead of proposing a suite of specific policy changes, it will instead set a dollar target: $135 billion in savings linked to lower prices over a decade. A senior administration official said the target was designed as a signal to Congress to negotiate the policy package of its choice. The dollar total is similar to the budget score for a bipartisan bill from Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, and Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, that Mr. Trump referenced last week in his State of the Union address without specifically endorsing. That bill passed the Senate Finance Committee but has not received a floor vote. The House recently passed its own bill to lower drug prices, which would save significantly more. The administration is also deviating from previous budgets by not proposing a specific plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, though it supports a lawsuit that could eliminate Obamacare entirely. The White House had previously recommended eliminating funding for the coverage expansions created by the law and adopting a congressional proposal that would provide block grant health funding for states to design their own programs. The new budget will propose an overall savings target for health care reform, but it reveals fewer details about how those savings would be achieved, according to a senior administration official.

2020,Highlights From South Carolina: CNN Town Halls and Clyburn’s Endorsement,"Elizabeth Warren reiterated on Tuesday that she would be open to staying in the presidential primary even if someone else had amassed an insurmountable plurality — but not a majority — of pledged delegates. That was the position of every other Democrat on the debate stage in Las Vegas last week besides Senator Bernie Sanders — who, as the current front-runner, appears to be the most likely candidate to wind up in the lead in such a situation. “You do know that that was Bernie’s position in 2016?” Ms. Warren said, pushing back on a Sanders supporter in the audience at a CNN town hall who had asked about the issue. She said Mr. Sanders’s “last play” in that race was to win over the party’s so-called superdelegates. She said she would stick to the rules outlined by the Democratic National Committee. “Bernie had a big role in writing the rules. I didn’t,” Warren said. “I don’t see how come you get to change it just because you see an advantage.” Tyson Brody, an adviser to Mr. Sanders, responded to Ms. Warren’s remarks on Twitter. “So the plan isn’t to win then,” he wrote, before deleting the tweet.",The New York Times
2020,"Opinion | Trump, Unrepentant and Unleashed","The diabolical duo of Donald and Mitch, serving their own interests, not the national one. Opinion Columnist WASHINGTON — During a meeting with Donald Trump at Trump Tower in June of 2016, with the opéra bouffe builder improbably heading toward the nomination despite a skeletal campaign crew on a floor below, I asked when he would pivot. We all assumed he would have to pivot, that he would have to stop his belittling Twitter rants, that he would have to cease attacking fellow Republicans like John McCain, that he would have to get more in line with the traditional stances of his party, that he would have to be less of a barbarian at the gates of D.C. He crossed his arms, pursed his lips and shook his head — a child refusing vegetables. How naïve he was, I thought to myself. But I was the naïve one. Trump has forced the world to pivot to him. The state of the union is upside down and inside out and sauerkraut. Trump has changed literally everything in the last three years, transforming and coarsening the game. On Friday night, he became, arguably, the most brutishly powerful Republican of all time. Never has a leader had such a stranglehold on his party, subsuming it with one gulp. As the Senate voted 51 to 49 to smother the impeachment inquiry, guided by the dark hand of Mitch McConnell, it felt like the world’s greatest deliberative body had been hollowed out, diminished. McConnell let Mitt Romney and Susan Collins vote to allow documents and witnesses such as John Bolton, knowing two could strain at the leash safely. The rest of the senators fell into line as sycophantic clones of Mike Pence. The impeachment trial amounted to one side being earnest and one pretending to be. It was exactly what Nancy Pelosi feared would happen before she was reluctantly drawn into the show trial. “Now the State of the Union is going to be the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man coming down the street and standing in the rubble of what’s left of the Congress,” keened one Democrat on Friday night. “The Republican Party has now lost whatever control they could exert over this president, any oversight they could have. It’s gone. The state of the union is there is no union. How can there be, when one side is petrified of their Godzilla?” Senator Chris Murphy, the Connecticut Democrat, dismissed Republicans as “a cult of personality” around Trump. “This trial in so many ways crystallized the completely diametrically opposed threats that Democrats and Republicans see to the country,” Murphy told The Times’s Nicholas Fandos. “We perceive Donald Trump and his corruption to be an existential threat to the country. They perceive the deep state and the liberal media to be an existential threat to the country. “That dichotomy, that contrast, has been growing over the last three years, but this trial really crystallized that difference. We were just speaking different languages, fundamentally different languages when it came to what this trial was about. They thought it was about the deep state and the media conspiracy. We thought it was about the president’s crimes.” I feel like I have spent my career watching the same depressing dynamic that unspooled Friday night: Democrats trying, sometimes ineptly, to play fair and Republicans ruthlessly trying to win. I watched it with the Anita Hill-Clarence Thomas hearings. I watched it in the 2000 recount with Bush versus Gore. I watched it with the push by W., Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld to go to war in Iraq. I watched it with the pantomime of Merrick Garland. Democrats are warning Republicans that they will be judged harshly by history. But in the meantime, the triumphant Republicans get to make history. And a lot of the history that Republicans have made is frightening: the endless, futile wars, the obliviousness to climate change, the stamp on the judiciary. As Carl Hulse writes in his book, “Confirmation Bias,” about the Garland fiasco: “The success in naming judges was the signal achievement of Trump’s first two years. In the coming years, those judges will be among the members of the federal bench called to rule on Trump’s policies and practices in cases arising from challenges initiated by increasingly confrontational Democrats and other legal adversaries around the nation. Mitch McConnell made a snap decision one night in 2016. The consequences will reverberate for decades.” For hours on Friday, the House managers made their vain final arguments.

2020,"Opinion | Trump, Unrepentant and Unleashed","The diabolical duo of Donald and Mitch, serving their own interests, not the national one. Opinion Columnist WASHINGTON — During a meeting with Donald Trump at Trump Tower in June of 2016, with the opéra bouffe builder improbably heading toward the nomination despite a skeletal campaign crew on a floor below, I asked when he would pivot. We all assumed he would have to pivot, that he would have to stop his belittling Twitter rants, that he would have to cease attacking fellow Republicans like John McCain, that he would have to get more in line with the traditional stances of his party, that he would have to be less of a barbarian at the gates of D.C. He crossed his arms, pursed his lips and shook his head — a child refusing vegetables. How naïve he was, I thought to myself. But I was the naïve one. Trump has forced the world to pivot to him. The state of the union is upside down and inside out and sauerkraut. Trump has changed literally everything in the last three years, transforming and coarsening the game. On Friday night, he became, arguably, the most brutishly powerful Republican of all time. Never has a leader had such a stranglehold on his party, subsuming it with one gulp. As the Senate voted 51 to 49 to smother the impeachment inquiry, guided by the dark hand of Mitch McConnell, it felt like the world’s greatest deliberative body had been hollowed out, diminished. McConnell let Mitt Romney and Susan Collins vote to allow documents and witnesses such as John Bolton, knowing two could strain at the leash safely. The rest of the senators fell into line as sycophantic clones of Mike Pence. The impeachment trial amounted to one side being earnest and one pretending to be. It was exactly what Nancy Pelosi feared would happen before she was reluctantly drawn into the show trial. “Now the State of the Union is going to be the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man coming down the street and standing in the rubble of what’s left of the Congress,” keened one Democrat on Friday night. “The Republican Party has now lost whatever control they could exert over this president, any oversight they could have. It’s gone. The state of the union is there is no union. How can there be, when one side is petrified of their Godzilla?” Senator Chris Murphy, the Connecticut Democrat, dismissed Republicans as “a cult of personality” around Trump. “This trial in so many ways crystallized the completely diametrically opposed threats that Democrats and Republicans see to the country,” Murphy told The Times’s Nicholas Fandos. “We perceive Donald Trump and his corruption to be an existential threat to the country. They perceive the deep state and the liberal media to be an existential threat to the country. “That dichotomy, that contrast, has been growing over the last three years, but this trial really crystallized that difference. We were just speaking different languages, fundamentally different languages when it came to what this trial was about. They thought it was about the deep state and the media conspiracy. We thought it was about the president’s crimes.” I feel like I have spent my career watching the same depressing dynamic that unspooled Friday night: Democrats trying, sometimes ineptly, to play fair and Republicans ruthlessly trying to win. I watched it with the Anita Hill-Clarence Thomas hearings. I watched it in the 2000 recount with Bush versus Gore. I watched it with the push by W., Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld to go to war in Iraq. I watched it with the pantomime of Merrick Garland. Democrats are warning Republicans that they will be judged harshly by history. But in the meantime, the triumphant Republicans get to make history. And a lot of the history that Republicans have made is frightening: the endless, futile wars, the obliviousness to climate change, the stamp on the judiciary. As Carl Hulse writes in his book, “Confirmation Bias,” about the Garland fiasco: “The success in naming judges was the signal achievement of Trump’s first two years. In the coming years, those judges will be among the members of the federal bench called to rule on Trump’s policies and practices in cases arising from challenges initiated by increasingly confrontational Democrats and other legal adversaries around the nation. Mitch McConnell made a snap decision one night in 2016. The consequences will reverberate for decades.” For hours on Friday, the House managers made their vain final arguments. Pressing for Bolton’s testimony, Val Demings implored Republican senators: Aren’t you worried that, if left in office, Trump will harm America’s national security, seek to corrupt the upcoming election and undermine our democracy to further his own personal gain? Don’t you want to hear the witnesses and see the documents that would give the full story and make this a fair trial rather than a mock one? “This is the American way and this is the American story,” Demings told the Republican senators as they looked back at her, impassive or impatient.

2020,Trump Demands 2 Liberal Supreme Court Justices Recuse Themselves From His Cases,"The president ratcheted up a fight with a judicial system he sees as biased against him. NEW DELHI — President Trump lashed out at two liberal Supreme Court justices on Tuesday, escalating his battle with the judicial system to new heights despite entreaties by his attorney general to refrain from attacks that complicate the administration’s legal fights. Weighing in on a domestic matter as he began a day of ceremony, meetings and a joint appearance with Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, Mr. Trump seized on a dissenting opinion last week by Justice Sonia Sotomayor and a years-old comment by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg to demand that the two Democratic-appointed jurists recuse themselves from any cases involving him. “I just thought it was so inappropriate, such a terrible statement for a Supreme Court justice,” the president said. Besides ignoring the entreaties of Attorney General William P. Barr, the president’s attack on the two justices also risked provoking a reaction from Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. In 2018, Chief Justice Roberts admonished Mr. Trump for calling a federal judge who ruled against one of his administration’s policies, “an Obama judge.” “We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges,” he said at the time. “What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them. That independent judiciary is something we should all be thankful for.” Kathleen Arberg, a Supreme Court spokeswoman, said Chief Justice Roberts, Justice Ginsburg and Justice Sotomayor declined to comment. Mr. Trump did not confine his criticism to the two justices. At his news conference, he also renewed his calls for an investigation into his longtime foil, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Adam B. Schiff, for what he said without evidence was Mr. Schiff’s improper disclosure of information provided to the committee at a briefing from intelligence officials. It is unusual for presidents to fixate on domestic issues while overseas on a state visit, but Mr. Trump has veered from that tradition so much that it has come to be expected. Before he took the first question from a reporter during the Tuesday appearance, Mr. Trump said that he did not plan on saying anything controversial. And then he attacked two liberal Supreme Court justices and called for an investigation into a political rival. “Schiff leaked it, in my opinion — and he shouldn’t be leaking things like that,” Mr. Trump said referring to the California Democrat. The president was responding to a question about recent intelligence briefings about Russia’s meddling in the upcoming election. “And if they don’t stop it, I can’t imagine that people are not going to go after them and find out what’s happening,” Mr. Trump said, reviving his accusation that the committee had been a source of improper leaks. Last week the president also called for an investigation into Mr. Schiff, to which Mr. Schiff responded: “Your false claims fool no one.” Justice Sotomayor issued her dissent issued last week against an order by the court allowing the Trump administration to proceed with a plan to deny green cards to immigrants who are deemed likely to become “public charges” reliant on government aid programs. In her seven-page opinion, Justice Sotomayor wrote that the Trump administration had become too quick to run to the Supreme Court after interim losses in the lower courts. “Claiming one emergency after another, the government has recently sought stays in an unprecedented number of cases, demanding immediate attention and consuming limited court resources in each,” she wrote. “And with each successive application, of course, its cries of urgency ring increasingly hollow.” Writing on Twitter Tuesday morning, Mr. Trump cited Laura Ingraham’s show on Fox News: “‘Sotomayor accuses GOP appointed Justices of being biased in favor of Trump.’” “This is a terrible thing to say. Trying to ‘shame’ some into voting her way? She never criticized Justice Ginsberg when she called me a ‘faker’. Both should recuse themselves on all Trump, or Trump related, matters!” “While ‘elections have consequences,’” he added, “I only ask for fairness, especially when it comes to decisions made by the United States Supreme Court!” Later, during the news conference at his hotel, he added of Justice Sotomayor, “Her statement was so inappropriate.” “When you’re a justice of the Supreme Court — it’s almost what she’s trying to do is take the people that do feel a different way and get them to vote the way that she would like them to vote,” he said. But Justice Sotomayor did not overtly accuse Republican-appointed justices of being biased in favor of Mr. Trump, as the president asserted. She complained in her dissent that the court “is partly to blame for the breakdown in the appellate process,” because it “has been all too quick to grant the government’s” reflexive requests. She added: “Perhaps most troublingly, the court’s recent behavior on stay applications has benefited one litigant over all others,” a reference to the Trump administration. The five justices who voted in the majority in the case were all appointed by Republicans, but Justice Sotomayor did not frame her disagreement in partisan terms, and her dissent was written in much the same way as others by justices who lose divided rulings. Mr. Trump did not seem familiar with what Justice Sotomayor actually wrote but instead seemed to be reacting to a television chryon that characterized her statement in a far balder, more political way than she had. Asked by a reporter what exactly he found inappropriate, Mr. Trump demurred, saying “you know what the statement was.” When the reporter accurately summarized part of the justice’s dissent, the president said, “No, I don’t think that was it.” In adding Justice Ginsburg to his attacks on Twitter and at the news conference, Mr. Trump resumed a four-year-old feud with the longest-serving liberal on the court. During the 2016 presidential campaign, Justice Ginsburg called Mr. Trump a “faker” and said she could not imagine him as president. He responded at the time that she should resign. She did not, but expressed regret, saying her remarks were “ill advised” for a Supreme Court justice and promised that “in the future I will be more circumspect.” The head of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, Kristen Clarke, said the president’s call for Justices Ginsburg and Sotomayor to recuse themselves was “deeply disturbing and unprecedented.” “No president in modern times,” she said “has shown greater disrespect for or worked to actively undermine the independence of the judiciary than President Trump.” The justices are highly unlikely to comply with Mr. Trump’s latest demand that they recuse themselves from the many cases involving him that come before their court. But the president’s attack raised the temperature of his continuing assault on the law enforcement and justice systems, which he has tried to bend to his will in increasingly bold ways. In recent days, he has repeatedly attacked Judge Amy Berman Jackson, who is overseeing the case of his friend Roger J. Stone Jr., who was sentenced to more than three years in prison for lying to Congress and intimidating a witness. He targeted her again on Tuesday, reposting a Twitter message from a Fox News host that said, “Roger Stone judge’s bias may have jeopardized entire trial,” and later posting another message of his own calling the judge and the jury forewoman “totally biased.” Mr. Barr has gone on television to ask Mr. Trump to stop weighing in on legal cases involving his friends, because it was making it “impossible” for him to do his work. A group of federal judges convened an emergency conference call because of the attacks on Judge Jackson. Adam Liptak and Eileen Sullivan contributed reporting from Washington.",The New York Times
2020,Trump’s $4.8 Trillion Budget Would Cut Safety Net Programs and Boost Defense,"The budget, while largely a messaging document, reflects the administration’s spending priorities’ stark contrast with the president’s Democratic rivals. WASHINGTON — President Trump released a $4.8 trillion budget proposal on Monday that includes a familiar list of deep cuts to student loan assistance, affordable housing efforts, food stamps and Medicaid, reflecting Mr. Trump’s election-year effort to continue shrinking the federal safety net. The proposal, which is unlikely to be approved in its entirety by Congress, includes additional spending for the military, national defense and border enforcement, along with money for veterans, Mr. Trump’s Space Force initiative and an extension of the individual income tax cuts that were set to expire in 2025. Its biggest reduction is an annual 2 percent decrease in spending on discretionary domestic programs, like education and environmental protection. Speaking to the nation’s governors at the White House on Monday, Mr. Trump said that his budget proposal would bolster the United States military and nuclear arsenal and bring the deficit close to zero in “not that long a period of time.” However, Mr. Trump’s budget does not estimate wiping out the deficit until 2035 and gets there only through rosy assumptions about economic growth — an area where the administration’s past predictions have proved to be overconfident — and the continued ability of the government to borrow money at rock-bottom rates. It also projects adding $3.4 trillion to the national debt by 2024, at the end of a potential second Trump term. Despite the hefty borrowing, Mr. Trump’s budget does not detail another round of tax cuts that his administration has suggested he will pursue if he wins re-election. Instead, it extends for 10 years the expiring cuts contained in the tax overhaul Mr. Trump signed in 2017, at an estimated revenue loss of about $1.4 trillion. The budget also assumes large amounts of new military spending, including $3.2 billion — a $459 million increase — to help develop a high-speed weapon capable of evading missile defense systems and $18 billion for the newly established Space Force. “We’re going to have a very good budget with a very powerful military budget, because we have no choice,” he said, adding that he was aiming to reduce spending by rooting out “waste and fraud.” The White House budget is largely a messaging document that reflects the administration’s spending priorities. While Monday’s proposal is similar to the president’s previous requests, it is a stark contrast with his leading Democratic rivals for the White House, who have proposed large tax increases on the rich and expansions of government efforts to provide health care, education, affordable housing and aid for the poor. For instance, at a time when many Democratic candidates are proposing sweeping efforts to forgive student loan debt and make some or all public colleges tuition-free, Mr. Trump’s budget again recommends eliminating subsidized federal student loans and ending the public service loan program. The program is an incentive for teachers, police officers, government workers and other public servants that cancels their remaining federal student loans after a decade of payments. Those proposals were in last year’s budget, but Congress did not adopt them. The budget also calls for the creation of a single income-driven loan repayment program, to replace what has become a confusing jumble of different payment plans. Under the administration’s plan, borrowers would pay 12.5 percent of their discretionary income toward their loans, instead of the 10 percent many currently pay. The administration would drastically change the way states are allocated funding for programs that support disadvantaged K-12 students. The budget proposes consolidating 29 programs into a $19.4 billion block grant that would dispense funding to states, who would then determine how to use it. Among the programs that would be zeroed out to fund the grant are 21st Century Community Learning Centers, which funds after-school programs for low-income students; funding for programs in rural schools and magnet schools; and funding for homeless and migrant students. The measure would overhaul the role of the Education Department, reducing its staff and administrative costs, and “empower states and districts to decide how to best use federal funds to meet the needs of their students,” the department’s budget said. The budget also proposes creating an entirely new agency to police tobacco, moving that responsibility out of the Food and Drug Administration and into the Department of Health and Human Services. The proposal is also notable for what it did not include. In previous years, Mr. Trump’s budget has proposed repealing the Affordable Care Act and replacing it with a system that would provide block grants of funding to states with far fewer rules about how the money should be spent. The new budget backs away from that approach. It leaves the law’s funding in place but asks Congress to develop policies that would “advance the president’s health reform vision,” with a corresponding price tag, which it says would save $844 billion over the decade. The budget’s approach to health care is particularly striking given the administration’s actions in court. The White House has joined a lawsuit brought by a group of Republican states that would seek to invalidate all of the Affordable Care Act. The Supreme Court is deciding whether it will take up that case or allow the lower courts to continue reviewing it. The president has repeatedly promised to release a health care plan that could be deployed if he wins in court, but has yet to do so. It still makes major changes to health care programs, including several that would tend to lower federal spending on Medicaid, by reducing the share of medical bills the federal government will pay for the Obamacare expansion population and imposing new requirements on beneficiaries who wish to enroll. All together, it proposed combined cuts to spending in Medicaid and Affordable Care Act subsidies that equal a trillion dollars — cuts that would mean substantial program changes. Democratic candidates, in contrast, have offered detailed plans, which typically cost trillions of dollars raised via new taxes on corporations and the rich, to expand health care coverage and reduce costs for American patients. Health care remains a top issue for many of Mr. Trump’s supporters, while Democrats’ “Medicare for all” plans have fared well in many opinion polls. Democrats dismissed the budget out of hand and vowed to prevent the changes from going into effect. Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California accused Mr. Trump of “a complete reversal of the promises he made in the campaign and a contradiction of the statements he made at the State of the Union.” Representative Richard E. Neal of Massachusetts, the House Ways and Means Committee chairman, said that when he saw the budget, “I felt an immense sense of relief — relief that there is absolutely no chance of his ruthless cuts to critical programs ever becoming law.” The budget maintains the administration’s tradition of highly optimistic economic growth forecasts, which have not borne out the past two years. Even then, it would leave the federal budget deficit only slightly smaller at the end of a possible second term for Mr. Trump, in 2024, than it was the year before he took office. In what Mr. Trump said was an attempt to “put our nation on a fiscally sustainable course,” he proposed reducing a scheduled pay raise for civilian federal workers in 2021 to 1 percent from 2.5 percent. Congress can set its own levels in spending bills later this year. While Republicans have made relatively little noise about the ballooning federal deficit since Mr. Trump took office, some lawmakers suggested on Monday that the budget would not pass muster with fiscal conservatives. “Presidents’ budgets are a reflection of administration priorities, but in the end, they are just a list of suggestions, as the power of the purse rests with Congress,” said Senator Michael B. Enzi, Republican of Wyoming and the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee. “Bipartisan consensus will be necessary to bring our debt and deficits under control. I hope to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to put our country on a more sustainable fiscal course.” Senator Kevin Cramer, Republican of North Dakota, sent out two statements that, while initially complimentary of Mr. Trump’s efforts to cut federal spending, voiced concern with cuts to both defense and agriculture programs. Mr. Cramer said he disagreed with a number of defense provisions, including “cuts to intelligence-gathering resources for our military.” He also said that cuts to certain farm programs “would save little but inflict severe pain in American agriculture.” Democrats do not plan to release a separate budget proposal, pointing to the overall figures for military and nonmilitary spending approved in the summer’s bipartisan budget deal. Mr. Trump’s budget avoids some hot-button issues that Democrats could seek to turn against the president in November — notably by not reducing Social Security or Medicare benefits. Most of the administration’s initiatives to save money on Medicare are cost-reduction proposals first offered under President Barack Obama. In other areas, like climate policy, Mr. Trump continued to pick fights with Democrats in Congress and on the campaign trail. The administration reserved some of its deepest cuts for the Environmental Protection Agency, which would face a 26 percent reduction in funding and the elimination of 50 programs that Mr. Trump deemed “wasteful” or duplicative. The budget would shrink the agency to funding levels it last saw during the 1990s and focus it on “core functions” like addressing lead exposure in water and revitalizing former toxic sites, while excluding efforts like beach cleanup. It does not mention climate change. Congress has typically ignored the administration’s proposals for cuts to the agency. Democratic presidential candidates have proposed trillions of dollars in new spending to reduce carbon emissions and try to stem the resulting rise in global temperatures. Administration officials appeared to make little effort on Monday to sell congressional Democrats on the budget’s proposals. They canceled a planned briefing for some Democratic staff members, two congressional aides said. One aide said it was because elements of the budget leaked Sunday night. A senior administration official confirmed the cancellation of the briefing because of the leaks, but a separate bipartisan, bicameral briefing remained scheduled.

The budget also assumes large amounts of new military spending, including $3.2 billion — a $459 million increase — to help develop a high-speed weapon capable of evading missile defense systems and $18 billion for the newly established Space Force. “We’re going to have a very good budget with a very powerful military budget, because we have no choice,” he said, adding that he was aiming to reduce spending by rooting out “waste and fraud.” The White House budget is largely a messaging document that reflects the administration’s spending priorities. While Monday’s proposal is similar to the president’s previous requests, it is a stark contrast with his leading Democratic rivals for the White House, who have proposed large tax increases on the rich and expansions of government efforts to provide health care, education, affordable housing and aid for the poor. For instance, at a time when many Democratic candidates are proposing sweeping efforts to forgive student loan debt and make some or all public colleges tuition-free, Mr. Trump’s budget again recommends eliminating subsidized federal student loans and ending the public service loan program. The program is an incentive for teachers, police officers, government workers and other public servants that cancels their remaining federal student loans after a decade of payments. Those proposals were in last year’s budget, but Congress did not adopt them. The budget also calls for the creation of a single income-driven loan repayment program, to replace what has become a confusing jumble of different payment plans. Under the administration’s plan, borrowers would pay 12.5 percent of their discretionary income toward their loans, instead of the 10 percent many currently pay. The administration would drastically change the way states are allocated funding for programs that support disadvantaged K-12 students. The budget proposes consolidating 29 programs into a $19.4 billion block grant that would dispense funding to states, who would then determine how to use it. Among the programs that would be zeroed out to fund the grant are 21st Century Community Learning Centers, which funds after-school programs for low-income students; funding for programs in rural schools and magnet schools; and funding for homeless and migrant students. The measure would overhaul the role of the Education Department, reducing its staff and administrative costs, and “empower states and districts to decide how to best use federal funds to meet the needs of their students,” the department’s budget said. The budget also proposes creating an entirely new agency to police tobacco, moving that responsibility out of the Food and Drug Administration and into the Department of Health and Human Services. The proposal is also notable for what it did not include. In previous years, Mr. Trump’s budget has proposed repealing the Affordable Care Act and replacing it with a system that would provide block grants of funding to states with far fewer rules about how the money should be spent. The new budget backs away from that approach. It leaves the law’s funding in place but asks Congress to develop policies that would “advance the president’s health reform vision,” with a corresponding price tag, which it says would save $844 billion over the decade. The budget’s approach to health care is particularly striking given the administration’s actions in court. The White House has joined a lawsuit brought by a group of Republican states that would seek to invalidate all of the Affordable Care Act. The Supreme Court is deciding whether it will take up that case or allow the lower courts to continue reviewing it. The president has repeatedly promised to release a health care plan that could be deployed if he wins in court, but has yet to do so. It still makes major changes to health care programs, including several that would tend to lower federal spending on Medicaid, by reducing the share of medical bills the federal government will pay for the Obamacare expansion population and imposing new requirements on beneficiaries who wish to enroll. All together, it proposed combined cuts to spending in Medicaid and Affordable Care Act subsidies that equal a trillion dollars — cuts that would mean substantial program changes. Democratic candidates, in contrast, have offered detailed plans, which typically cost trillions of dollars raised via new taxes on corporations and the rich, to expand health care coverage and reduce costs for American patients. Health care remains a top issue for many of Mr. Trump’s supporters, while Democrats’ “Medicare for all” plans have fared well in many opinion polls. Democrats dismissed the budget out of hand and vowed to prevent the changes from going into effect. Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California accused Mr. Trump of “a complete reversal of the promises he made in the campaign and a contradiction of the statements he made at the State of the Union.” Representative Richard E. Neal of Massachusetts, the House Ways and Means Committee chairman, said that when he saw the budget, “I felt an immense sense of relief — relief that there is absolutely no chance of his ruthless cuts to critical programs ever becoming law.” The budget maintains the administration’s tradition of highly optimistic economic growth forecasts, which have not borne out the past two years. Even then, it would leave the federal budget deficit only slightly smaller at the end of a possible second term for Mr. Trump, in 2024, than it was the year before he took office. In what Mr. Trump said was an attempt to “put our nation on a fiscally sustainable course,” he proposed reducing a scheduled pay raise for civilian federal workers in 2021 to 1 percent from 2.5 percent. Congress can set its own levels in spending bills later this year. While Republicans have made relatively little noise about the ballooning federal deficit since Mr. Trump took office, some lawmakers suggested on Monday that the budget would not pass muster with fiscal conservatives. “Presidents’ budgets are a reflection of administration priorities, but in the end, they are just a list of suggestions, as the power of the purse rests with Congress,” said Senator Michael B. Enzi, Republican of Wyoming and the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee. “Bipartisan consensus will be necessary to bring our debt and deficits under control. I hope to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to put our country on a more sustainable fiscal course.” Senator Kevin Cramer, Republican of North Dakota, sent out two statements that, while initially complimentary of Mr. Trump’s efforts to cut federal spending, voiced concern with cuts to both defense and agriculture programs. Mr. Cramer said he disagreed with a number of defense provisions, including “cuts to intelligence-gathering resources for our military.” He also said that cuts to certain farm programs “would save little but inflict severe pain in American agriculture.” Democrats do not plan to release a separate budget proposal, pointing to the overall figures for military and nonmilitary spending approved in the summer’s bipartisan budget deal. Mr. Trump’s budget avoids some hot-button issues that Democrats could seek to turn against the president in November — notably by not reducing Social Security or Medicare benefits. Most of the administration’s initiatives to save money on Medicare are cost-reduction proposals first offered under President Barack Obama. In other areas, like climate policy, Mr. Trump continued to pick fights with Democrats in Congress and on the campaign trail. The administration reserved some of its deepest cuts for the Environmental Protection Agency, which would face a 26 percent reduction in funding and the elimination of 50 programs that Mr. Trump deemed “wasteful” or duplicative. The budget would shrink the agency to funding levels it last saw during the 1990s and focus it on “core functions” like addressing lead exposure in water and revitalizing former toxic sites, while excluding efforts like beach cleanup. It does not mention climate change. Congress has typically ignored the administration’s proposals for cuts to the agency. Democratic presidential candidates have proposed trillions of dollars in new spending to reduce carbon emissions and try to stem the resulting rise in global temperatures. Administration officials appeared to make little effort on Monday to sell congressional Democrats on the budget’s proposals. They canceled a planned briefing for some Democratic staff members, two congressional aides said. One aide said it was because elements of the budget leaked Sunday night. A senior administration official confirmed the cancellation of the briefing because of the leaks, but a separate bipartisan, bicameral briefing remained scheduled.

2020,"Opinion | Trump’s Acquittal, and Romney’s Courage","letters Readers reflect on what was achieved, Mitt Romney’s act of defiance and the meaning of acquittal. To the Editor: Re “Split Senate Clears Trump on Each Count in Finale of a Bitter Impeachment Battle” (front page, Feb. 6): Well, it’s finally over, and now come the analyses and the blowback from the White House. And what was accomplished by the impeachment effort? A lot, I think. Some good, some bad. For one thing, the House Democratic leaders reminded us of who we are and what we are. Representative Adam Schiff’s “Enough!” should echo through campaign ads all across the nation this fall. The most consequential accomplishment of the impeachment effort, I think, is that it did exactly what President Trump tried to do by pressuring the president of Ukraine. It dragged Joe Biden’s name through the mud, and that helps explain Mr. Biden’s poor showing in Iowa. So Mr. Trump seems to have a clear shot at being re-elected. But there’s a silver lining. At least some of the G.O.P. members of Congress who live in fear of Mr. Trump and who turned their backs on the Constitution will not be returning to Washington, and we’re likely to see Democratic majorities elected in both the House and the Senate. George MooreElkins, W.Va. To the Editor: Thank you, Adam Schiff, Hakeem Jeffries, Val Demings, Zoe Lofgren, Jason Crow, Sylvia Garcia and Jerry Nadler. Thank you for your hard work as House impeachment managers over the many long days and nights of the proceedings. Thank you for heartfelt and inspiring words. And, most of all, thank you for your deep knowledge of and belief in democracy and the Constitution. Thank you for reminding us that there are still people like you in Congress — people of character who work every day to do what’s right for our country. We now owe it to you to seek out and help elect more people like you in November. Peggy CalkinsGloucester, Mass. To the Editor: Thank goodness this ill-conceived debacle of an impeachment has come to its inevitable end. It should be clear now that the program of resistance aimed at toppling President Trump has failed. If anything it has made him stronger. Let me suggest to the Democrats that the time has come to put aside your hatred of President Trump. That does not mean you should stop challenging him. By all means continue to challenge him, but challenge him in the arena of ideas. At the end of the day the party that succeeds will be the party that does the most to improve the lives of Americans. William PriesterNew York To the Editor: Let’s remember that an acquittal does not mean the accused did not commit the offenses alleged, or suggest innocence, only that a jury — for whatever reason, including the most shameless and self-serving — failed to convict. Tim O’BrienChiang Mai, Thailand To the Editor: Re “An Act of Defiance by Romney Against a Party He’d Personified” (front page, Feb. 6): It is shocking for a senator of the United States to find it necessary to appear like a penitent schoolboy to explain his vote. It is alarming that currently many Americans seem eager to celebrate blind loyalty, and seek to punish those who exercise their rights to freedom of thought and speech. This is the path to tyranny. I applaud Senator Mitt Romney for his courage, but I grieve that he felt it necessary to explain. It should not have been so. Norma S. GausterAvon, Conn. To the Editor: Senator Mitt Romney said, “We’re all footnotes at best in the annals of history.” He is wrong. He is no footnote. It was easy for every Democrat to vote for President Trump’s conviction, and it was easy for every Republican but him to vote to acquit. Both sides yielded to peer pressure and the herd mentality of their party. But Mr. Romney genuinely and unequivocally voted his conscience. He is no footnote. He is a shining light. William GoldmanPalos Verdes Estates, Calif. To the Editor: Re “Republicans Clear Trump Out of Fear,” by Senator Sherrod Brown (Op-Ed, Feb. 6): Republican senators, you have hitched your wagon to a boat anchor, and he is dragging the G.O.P. to the bottom. President Trump is a self-centered bully and liar who has no regard for propriety, morality, truth, scientific facts, history or the conventions that make our democracy work. You surely know this, just as you know that his famous call to Ukraine’s president was far from “perfect.” You found him innocent of the charges against him, yet I read that a number of you have serious concerns about his actions. Why not assert yourselves and express those concerns? Fifteen or so of you could band together and vote with Democrats to deliver a strong message of censure. Mr. Trump will bluster and tweet, but if you stick together, he will not hurt you, and history will note that the Senate had a spine and a moderate G.O.P. re-emerged on this day. How about it?

2020,Trump’s Budget Math Grapples With Economic Reality,"The budget predicts the economy will grow significantly faster than most economists anticipate. WASHINGTON — President Trump’s budget proposals have been defined by a belief that the economy will grow significantly faster than most economists anticipate. The latest version, released on Monday, is a brief departure: It concedes, for the first time, that the administration’s past projections were too optimistic. Then it goes right back to forecasting 3 percent growth, for the better part of a decade. Mr. Trump’s $4.8 trillion budget proposal is slightly larger than last year’s $4.75 trillion request and calls for increased spending on the military, the border wall, infrastructure and other priorities, including extending the president’s 2017 tax cuts. It also includes trillions of dollars of cuts to safety-net programs like Medicaid and discretionary spending programs outside of the military, like education and the environment. The White House makes the case that this is affordable and that the deficit will start to fall, dropping below $1 trillion in the 2021 fiscal year, and that the budget will be balanced by 2035. That projection relies on rosy assumptions about growth and the accumulation of new federal debt — both areas where the administration’s past predictions have proved to be overconfident. The new budget forecasts a growth rate for the United States economy of 2.8 percent this year — or, by the metric the administration prefers to cite, a 3.1 percent rate. That is more than a half percentage point higher than forecasters at the Federal Reserve and the Congressional Budget Office predict. It then predicts growth above 3 percent annually for the next several years if the administration’s economic policies are enacted. The Fed, the budget office and others all see growth falling below 2 percent annually in that time. By 2030, the administration predicts the economy will be more than 15 percent larger than forecasters at the budget office do. Past administrations have also dressed up their budget forecasts with economic projections that proved far too good to be true. In its fiscal year 2011 budget, for example, the Obama administration predicted several years of growth topping 4 percent in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis — a number it never came close to reaching even once. Trump officials had considered their projections to be a break from that trend, writing last year that they were the first administration on record “to have experienced economic growth that meets or exceeds its own forecasts in each of its first two years in office.” That turned out to be wrong: In the middle of last year, the Commerce Department revised its accounting of the 2018 growth rate downward, to well below the rate Trump officials had forecast. Their predictions were similarly off in 2019. Robust economic growth rates are not the only area where the administration’s renewed optimism appears in its latest budget. It has also revised down its estimate of the interest the federal government would pay to borrow money over the next decade, based largely on the assumption that the Fed, which began cutting rates in 2019, would raise them only modestly again over the next 10 years. The changes in rate assumptions reduce budget deficits by $1.5 trillion over the course of the decade, according to the administration’s projections. Essentially, administration officials are contending that rising levels of debt in the United States will not drive up borrowing costs, as many conservative economists have long warned, at least for the next several years. They also believe, a rarity among economists, that a sustained stretch of 3 percent growth would not push the Fed to raise interest rates. Administration officials do not directly control Fed policy, but in a companion document to the budget, the officials wrote that federal borrowing costs would stay low “as U.S. debt continues to be in high demand because it is a safe haven for savings amidst global turmoil.” As a result, the administration sees federal debt held by the public — the national debt, essentially — declining from 79 percent of the overall economy this year to 66 percent in 2030. The budget office sees it rising, to 98 percent, a level not reached since 1946. In order to justify that optimism, administration officials are contending that their overly optimistic growth forecasts of the past were a fluke of circumstance. Mr. Trump’s first budget, in the spring of 2017, predicted growth of 2.3 percent that year using the administration’s preferred measure — the change in the size of the economy from the fourth quarter of the preceding year. It was a mild undershoot; growth actually hit 2.5 percent. The next two budgets predicted 3.1 percent growth for 2018 and 3.2 percent for 2019. Both were off, badly. Growth was 2.5 percent in 2018, from fourth quarter to fourth quarter, and 2.3 percent in 2019, according to the Commerce Department. Officials on Sunday attributed a half-point of the missed forecast last year to the effects of American trade policy — specifically, uncertainty over resolution of trade talks with China and congressional approval of a new trade agreement with Canada and Mexico. They said that those uncertainties were now resolved and that growth would accelerate accordingly. The senior administration official also said a General Motors strike, aerospace giant Boeing’s struggles with its 737 Max aircraft and flooding in the Midwest had reduced growth by an additional three-tenths of a percentage point last year. Mr. Trump has long asserted that his push to negotiate with the Chinese and reopen North American trade talks were helping the economy. In the 2016 campaign, his advisers said tariffs on Chinese imports — even more aggressive levies than what Mr. Trump ultimately imposed on Beijing — would increase growth, by pushing multinational companies to invest in the United States instead of China. Such an investment wave never materialized. Capital spending growth turned negative for the last three quarters of 2019. Many forecasters believe that decline was trade related; the budget office, among others, is predicting a bounce-back in investment growth this year. But those forecasters also see growth slowing, over all, as the stimulus fades from Mr. Trump’s deficit-swelling tax cuts in 2017 and spending increases he has signed each year in office. Partly as a result of those measures, and the administration’s inability to interest Congress in any of its most aggressive proposals for cuts, the federal budget deficit was nearly twice as large last year as the administration projected in its first budget: It topped $1 trillion. The Congressional Budget Office predicts it will continue to grow, hitting $1.3 trillion in 2025 as growth slows to 1.5 percent. For that same year, the new Trump budget predicts that the deficit will be less than half the size — and that growth will be just under 3 percent. A companion document to the budget includes an alternate forecast for the full decade — with growth much closer to, but still higher than, independent economists’ projections — in the event that the administration’s proposed extensions of tax cuts, continued deregulation, reductions in certain spending programs and other policy changes are not enacted. It notes one reason, in particular, that those efforts might not succeeded this year: “2020 is an election year,” the officials write, “and there is the risk that this will distract from implementation of the necessary policies required for continued increases in prosperity.” Updated Feb. 29, 2020",The New York Times

 WASHINGTON — President Trump, whose government is leading an effort to combat the spread of the coronavirus in the United States, offered some tips on Wednesday to avoid getting sick, and as he did so, he revealed a little more about his lifelong aversion to germs. “I do it a lot, anyway, as you’ve probably heard: Wash your hands,” he told reporters gathered at the White House for a news conference on the global epidemic. “Stay clean. You don’t have to necessarily grab every handrail unless you have to. You know, you do certain things.” Mr. Trump’s self-declared germophobia is well documented. In his 2004 book, “How to Get Rich,” he detailed what he called a “personal crusade to replace the mandatory and unsanitary handshake with the Japanese custom of bowing.” His stance on combating illness as president has in some ways matched how he behaved as a private citizen — “KEEP THEM OUT OF HERE!” he wrote on Twitter in 2014 days before an American aid worker infected with the Ebola virus in West Africa during a severe outbreak there returned to the United States. That has alarmed experts who have said he is not the right person to be leading the charge. But with tales of his own ways of warding off germs, the president spent nearly an hour on Wednesday trying to assure the public that he was. “When somebody sneezes,” Mr. Trump said, “I try to bail out as much as possible when they’re sneezing.” Last year, the president scolded his acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, for coughing during an interview Mr. Trump had with ABC, and he asked Mr. Mulvaney to leave the room. Aides at the time said the president had been more revolted by the sight of someone coughing than he was annoyed at someone interfering with his camera shot. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump also shared a recent story about precautions he had taken to avoid contracting an illness from an unnamed friend. (On the campaign trail, he frequently invokes stories about unnamed friends and associates to underscore a story, a habit that has caught the eye of fact checkers.) “I had a man come up to me a week ago,” said Mr. Trump, who was touring the West Coast on a campaign trip. “Hadn’t seen him in a long time. I said, ‘How are you doing?’ He said, ‘Fine, fine.’ He hugs me. I said, ‘Are you well?’ He says, ‘No.’ He said, ‘I have the worst fever and the worst flu.’ He’s hugging and kissing me.” “I said, ‘Excuse me,’ and started washing my hands,” Mr. Trump added. “You have to do this.” The president said to view the coronavirus “the same as the flu,” even though much is unknown about how it develops or spreads. Mr. Trump, who appointed Vice President Mike Pence to oversee the government’s response to the outbreak, also waved away concerns by officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who said the spread of the virus was inevitable. “I don’t think it’s inevitable,” the president said, before adding, “There’s a chance that it could get worse.”",The New York Times
2020,Opinion | Trump’s De-Polarizing Architecture Plan,"Why a conservative initiative on public architecture might be good for American institutions. Opinion Columnist Here are two scenes from the same drama. The first scene takes place in California, where the state’s public university system now effectively requires prospective faculty members to make a statement affirming their commitment to “diversity, equity and inclusion” — an officially politically neutral trinity that is widely suspected to be conterminous with progressive notions of what counts as diversity and what sort of inclusion matters. At the University of California, Berkeley, the state’s flagship school, a recent investigation found that these don’t-call-them-loyalty-oaths are being used to cull job applications across multiple departments. In one case in the life sciences, Robby Soave of Reason reported, “a pool of 894 candidates was narrowed down to 214” based exclusively on whether their statements cleared the diversity-and-inclusion ideological bar. The second scene takes place across the country, in Washington, D.C., where the Trump administration has drafted an executive order that would give precedence to classical architectural forms in the construction of federal buildings and give local communities and nonexperts a stronger influence over designs. This would reverse a 1960s policy that discourages an official style and favors expert control over the building process, on the grounds that “design must flow from the architectural profession to the government and not vice versa.” While the University of California’s project of ideological exclusion appears mostly of interest to heterodox academics and conservatives, the Trump draft order has inspired a general media freakout, with editorial pages joining architects in denouncing the idea of political control over political buildings. (In a representative commentary, The Chicago Sun-Times’s editorial board accused the White House of taking us “back into a bygone era when women wore bonnets, men wore tricorn hats and the only acceptable design for a federal building was a knockoff of a classical Greek or Roman structure.”) But these two stories, Californian and Trumpian, belong together because they illustrate the evolution of the culture war. Over the last generation, our nation’s elite cultural institutions have become more themselves, which is to say that they have passed from being mostly liberal to being monolithically so, with strong internal forces — like Berkeley’s litmus tests — pulling them leftward and no countervailing power remaining on the right. Over the same period, in a trend that obviously feeds into and is fed by the first one, conservative politics has become more populist and anti-intellectual, and conservative voters have become more hostile to universities, the media and other organs of the intelligentsia. This has sharpened one of our many forms of polarization. Conservatives have political power but feel shut out of cultural power, and liberals have cultural power but lack the political power to match. The second half of the equation explains the current liberal fascination with novel forms of political hardball, to make the most of the Democratic Party’s next rendezvous with power — ranging from mild ideas like abolishing the filibuster to more extreme plans for state-adding, court-packing and Electoral College abolition. But this liberal yearning has its mirror image in the Trump-era conservative desire for novel forms of cultural hardball — for ways to use the power that the right still enjoys, the power over laws and budgets, to either regain influence in the commanding heights of culture or weaken the institutions that dominate those heights. As an example of this combative thinking, the conservative intellectual journal National Affairs recently published an essay by Arthur Milikh, urging the right to effectively defund the university system — cutting subsidies, ending student loan financing and removing tax exemptions. If major public universities are explicitly imposing progressivism as an orthodoxy, the thinking goes, with diversity-and-inclusion statements as the equivalent of a faith profession at a seminary, then why should right-of-center politicians vote to keep them funded? Milikh’s sweeping proposal isn’t likely to be adopted, but higher education funding cuts championed by Republican governors and the G.O.P. tax reform’s bite out of high-dollar endowments represent a more modest version of this impulse. And a similar impulse lies behind the Trump architecture order: It’s a repudiation of the idea that there exists some neutral community of cultural expertise to which Republican presidents as well as Democrats should defer, and it’s a deliberate attempt to use the power of the public purse to shift the balance of power within a specific culture industry. As such, it’s an act that provisionally deepens polarization, by elevating a new culture-war issue. But it also points to one plausible way that polarization might ultimately diminish: not through mutual disarmament, but through the fruitful use of power against power, so that different ideologies balance one another in different spheres and it becomes easier for Americans of all political persuasion to invest in their institutions once again. In “A Time to Build,” one of the few mildly optimistic political books to come out in this winter of depressing ones, the conservative scholar (and editor of National Affairs) Yuval Levin argues for just such a comprehensive recommitment to American institutions — families and churches, academia and government — as an alternative to the current tendency to use them instrumentally, as a platform for partisan ambitions and personal desires. Only a renewed institutionalism, in Levin’s telling, can correct both individualism and partisan tribalism, the two self-reinforcing spirits of our age. When we see our lives, personal or political, “as mediated by institutions that structure appropriate ways to do what we do,” he writes, “we are more likely to act responsibly and to demand responsibility of others.” But reading Levin’s admirable exhortation while contemplating our “conservatives rule politics”/“liberals rule culture” division made me wonder if, to reach the point where people are willing to submit themselves to institutionalism once again, we may first need our factions to more aggressively check one another, in politics and culture both. In politics, it’s easier for liberals to see how this might work. A movement to add Puerto Rico and Washington, D.C., to the roster of Senate-represented states, for instance, or to divide California into six states, two conservative-leaning and four liberal, would be a form of partisan aggression in the short run. But if successful, in the long run it might help depolarize the Senate somewhat, forcing conservatives to compete outside their current rural-state majority and restoring liberal confidence in the fairness of the upper chamber. But the same pattern might hold in cultural conflicts. Liberals have a harder time imagining this because they like to think of public architecture proposals or public-university hiring as “independent” and “nonideological.” But this is silly: Cultural production is obviously dominated by guilds with strong ideological dispositions, which alienate differently disposed citizens when those dispositions seem too all-controlling or oppressive. In the architectural case, what we have now is a permanent bias toward modern schools that have cycled through various ideological justifications (today, anti-racism, yesterday, Great Society liberalism, the day before that, fascism) for their long-running war on beauty. And I can confidently say that my own patriotism, my own trust in American institutions, would be modestly increased if public architecture tilted toward the wide variety of forms called classical under Republican presidents and then back toward “starchitect” experiments under Democrats. Judging by polling on Americans’ favorite public buildings, I would not be alone. [Listen to “The Argument” podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.] Note that the Trump administration draft order does not propose defunding or eliminating public architecture, but just changing the way public money influences the choice of designs and schools and hires. That makes it more plausible and productive, more institutionalist, if you will, than a Republican crusade to defund universities, and it’s suggestive of a better way that the right might approach its alienation from academia and vice versa. Instead of imposing an austerity that often just leaves shrunken humanities faculties more ideological than before, conservatives with political power should use it to reward schools and systems that don’t take the Californian path, to fund programs that diversify academia along lines of philosophy and faith and class as well as race and gender, to regard the demographic challenges facing many colleges as an opportunity to influence them for the better rather than just smirking while they fall. Such efforts, where they exist — for instance, Arizona State’s School of Civic and Economic Thought and Leadership, which was initially funded by the state’s Republican-led legislature — are generally greeted with the same academic suspicion, shading into hysteria, that’s greeted the Trump architecture proposal. I should disclose that I spoke at an event sponsored by the School of Civic and Economic Thought and Leadership in 2018. And that suspicion and resistance are natural and inevitable, in the same way that Republican opposition to D.C. statehood would be inevitable; the people or the factions with power in a given institutional realm are never going to be excited by anything that would weaken it. But sometimes forcing incumbents to share power is a necessary path to a more stable equilibrium, to an increase in public buy-in and transpartisan trust. In politics, it’s likely that you won’t get an America where liberals are institutionally invested in the Senate until liberal constituencies feel that they can be more justly represented in that body — which at the very least requires Democrats to figure out a way to win more Senate seats, and possibly to change the institution somewhat once they do. And likewise, you won’t get an America where conservatives trust elite cultural institutions until something happens to break up the current consolidation of progressive power in those spheres. Making American architecture a little more traditional probably isn’t going to get us there, but it certainly wouldn’t hurt — and it’s more likely than many forms of cultural skirmishing to produce a little surplus beauty along the way.

2020,Trump’s Doctor Thought He Had a Ticket to Congress. It Hasn’t Been So Easy.,"Ronny Jackson is one of 15 candidates in a crowded Republican primary. And the White House hasn’t gone out of its way to help. WICHITA FALLS, Texas — Dressed in cowboy boots and jeans, with an American flag pin on his lapel, Dr. Ronny L. Jackson rolled up at the Red River Harley-Davidson outpost to make his pitch to voters. “I just came from the White House,” Dr. Jackson, the former White House physician, told the small crowd gathered upstairs from the Harley showroom. “I’ve been working side by side with the president. I know all the cabinet secretaries. I have their cellphones. I know the chief of staff, the national security adviser. I can pick the phone up and I can call them. They’re all friends of mine.” Dr. Jackson left the West Wing in December after rising from President Trump’s physician to his unlikely pick to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs to Trump administration roadkill when he was forced to withdraw his name from consideration amid allegations related to his professional conduct. Now he’s running for Congress in Texas’ 13th District, one of the most conservative in the country, and his argument is simple. In a primary field of 15 anti-immigrant, anti-abortion Republicans, Dr. Jackson is betting his personal connection with the president is enough to win the Republican nomination tantamount to election. Standing alongside other candidates wearing cowboy hats and “Make America Great Again” caps at the forum on Thursday, Dr. Jackson pitched himself as the only one “who can walk in the Oval Office unannounced and say, ‘Sir, I need you to stop what you’re doing and listen to me,’ and he will stop what he’s doing and listen to me.” That access, he said, would make him an unusually powerful replacement for Representative Mac Thornberry, the Republican who announced last fall he would not seek re-election after representing his district for more than a quarter of a century. But it is not clear if that connection, combined with his background as a Navy rear admiral, will be enough to help Dr. Jackson overcome some rookie mistakes as a candidate. There have been more than a few. His campaign organization, for one thing. Dr. Jackson’s campaign manager, he said, is “a horse doctor” with a full-time job. He has one full-time staff member, a recent college graduate who is also working for free, and he has relied on his wife, Jane, to drive him around the enormous Panhandle-encompassing district, which spans 41 counties. And despite having a power Rolodex, he has never reached into it to ask the right people for help. On Friday, Dr. Jackson spent the afternoon knocking on doors in Wichita Falls, only to realize that it was a relatively futile exercise since most people weren’t home. In the evening, he mingled in the bleachers at the Monarch Motor Speedway only to report back to his wife that most of spectators had driven in from Oklahoma. While waiting for the stock car race to begin, Dr. Jackson laughed when a hunk of mud spun up from the dirt track and landed in his coffee cup, a fitting end to another long day on the campaign trail where it wasn’t clear if he’d made any progress. Dr. Jackson, who grew up in Levelland, Texas, returned to the Panhandle after leaving the White House and retiring from the Navy, settling in the district in Amarillo. He thought his connections to Mr. Trump and the extended Trumpworld would make him a shoo-in for the seat, people who spoke to him at the time said. But Mr. Trump, who now generally adheres to rules put in place by his political shop about whom he endorses and what races he weighs in on, has been silent about Dr. Jackson’s campaign. Donald Trump Jr., whom Dr. Jackson considers a close friend, has no plans to get involved in his race or officially endorse him, an aide said. And even Rick Perry, the former energy secretary and Texas governor who encouraged him to run and then endorsed him, has not campaigned for him. Dr. Jackson is now facing an uphill battle against two well-funded and connected opponents — Chris Ekstrom, a Dallas millionaire who recently moved to the district to run and is self-funding his campaign, and Josh Winegarner, a lobbyist who has the backing of the cattle industry he represents and Mr. Thornberry. But Dr. Jackson’s connections to the Trump administration as well as the president and his family are real, even if they have not translated into much support. Eric Trump has tweeted a supportive message, and Mr. Trump has privately encouraged Dr. Jackson to run. And Dr. Jackson is benefiting, if belatedly, from Trump allies and aides who have only recently realized he needed help and have pitched in, setting him up with a real online fund-raising and phone prospecting operation, which helped to finally get him on air with a commercial — a 30-second spot made up entirely of old clips of Mr. Trump praising his character. At the candidates forum, Dr. Jackson, 52, conceded that he had “never really considered running for office.” But, he said, “Trump is getting re-elected. That’s a done deal at this point.” “I thought this is the unique opportunity for me to get in the game,” he added. “I have an opportunity to get in the fight and do something for our country.” Dr. Jackson, who served in the White House medical unit under the past three presidents, grew close to Mr. Trump after delivering the results of a presidential physical in a briefing at which he promoted Mr. Trump’s “incredible genes,” said he did “exceedingly well” on a cognitive test and claimed that if he had adhered to a better diet over the past 20 years, he could have lived to be 200. His hourlong news conference transformed Dr. Jackson into an inner circle Trump favorite, and a candidate, in Mr. Trump’s mind, for a cabinet post. It also changed how he was perceived outside the building. “That was the day I got the Trump stamp on me completely,” Dr. Jackson said during an interview last week at a coffee shop in Wichita Falls. “I was no longer viewed as a nonpartisan physician on military orders, even though I still technically was. What I didn’t realize was that it made people much more aggressive toward me when the V.A. nomination came up.” At the time of the allegations against him — which included loosely dispensing strong drugs to lawmakers and political aides — Dr. Jackson was not allowed to respond because he was an active-duty military officer. The experience took a toll on Dr. Jackson and his family. “I tell people now that I got Kavanaugh-ed before Kavanaugh did,” he said, referring to Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, who he believes was falsely accused of sexual assault during his Supreme Court confirmation hearings. “I was the pregame but I didn’t know it. I was the warm up.” Dr. Jackson called the allegations against him “complete garbage” and hinted at behind-the-scenes plotting from both parties to remove a Trump loyalist from contention. “I saw the ugly side of Washington,” he said. He noted that despite the scandal, “I got promoted in the White House, I maintained my clearance, I stayed in the military, I retired as a Navy admiral. Come on.” Mr. Trump mounted an aggressive defense of Dr. Jackson, even as a bipartisan group of Senators expressed concerns over his record. The president called for Senator Jon Tester, Democrat of Montana, to resign for his lead role in releasing details of the allegations against Dr. Jackson. Mr. Trump called Dr. Jackson “one of the finest people that I have met” while elevating him to the role of assistant to the president. And in the 13th District, those words may be more important than any accusation. “I’m leaning toward Ronny because I have to look at who’s electable,” said Danny Breegle, a business owner in Wichita Falls who attended the Thursday night forum. He said he was impressed with his résumé and “wanted to make sure he’s not of the swamp, and now I think he’s independent.” But for Dr. Jackson, the question will be whether the last-ditch help from Trumpworld has come too late — by Friday, over half of the vote will already be in because of early voting in the March 3 primary. In the interview, Dr. Jackson admitted that he had not been aggressive in calling in favors, especially from the president. “He had so much on his plate. He was going through impeachment,” Dr. Jackson said. “I thought, I’m not going to put ‘Ronny Jackson in the 13th Congressional District’ on his plate.” If he wins the seat, Dr. Jackson will be back on a government salary. If he loses, he said, he plans to make enough money to buy his wife any house in Amarillo she wants. That is, if he doesn’t go back into the Trump administration. Dr. Jackson appeared to leave himself open to the possibility, but said his wife was committed to staying in Texas. For now, Dr. Jackson said, he has put a cabinet post in his rear view mirror, calling the Veterans Affairs Department a “massive bureaucracy” and asserting that “my ability to impact things will actually be better if I’m a congressman, even for the veterans.” One of his regrets was moving on from his post as White House physician before he could help institute the diet and exercise regimen he had planned for the president. During his infamous news conference, Mr. Jackson said his goal was to help Mr. Trump lose 10 to 15 pounds and that he planned to bring an exercise bike or elliptical machine into the White House residence. Mr. Jackson said those plans never came to pass. (Mr. Trump had gained four pounds by his following physical.) “The exercise stuff never took off as much as I wanted it to,” he said. “But we were working on his diet. We were making the ice cream less accessible, we were putting cauliflower into the mashed potatoes.”",The New York Times
2020,Trump’s Efforts to Remove the Disloyal Heightens Unease Across His Administration,"As senior officials are shown the door, a new personnel chief orders a search for political appointees as well as career officials deemed insufficiently supportive of the president. WASHINGTON — In some of the most critical corners of the Trump administration, officials show up for work now never entirely sure who will be there by the end of the evening — themselves included. Even for an administration that has been a revolving door since Day 1, this has become a season of turmoil. At a moment when first-term presidents are typically seeking a stable team to focus on their re-election, President Trump has embarked on a systematic attempt to sweep out officials perceived to be disloyal. The headquarters of the nation’s intelligence apparatus roiled with the ouster of the acting director Joseph Maguire and his replacement by a sharp partisan amid a dispute over Russian election interference. The Justice Department remained on edge with whispers of further resignations, including perhaps even that of Attorney General William P. Barr, after the president’s intervention in a case involving one of his friends. Witnesses from the impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump have been summarily dismissed. Dozens of policy experts have been cleared out of the National Security Council staff as part of a restructuring that will mean fewer career professionals in range of the president. A deputy national security adviser dogged by innuendo about disloyalty was exiled to the Energy Department. A Trump appointee’s nomination for a top Treasury Department post was pulled. The No. 3 official at the Defense Department was shown the door. And Johnny McEntee, a 29-year-old loyalist just installed to take over the Office of Presidential Personnel and reporting directly to Mr. Trump, has ordered a freeze on all political appointments across the government. He also convened a meeting to instruct departments to search for people not devoted to the president so they can be removed, according to people briefed about the session, and informed colleagues that he planned to tell cabinet secretaries that the White House would be choosing their deputies from now on. “Trump appears to be launching the biggest assault on the nation’s civil service system since the 1883 Pendleton Act ended the spoils system,” said Paul C. Light, a New York University professor who has studied presidential personnel. [Read: ‘America loves India,’ Trump declares at rally with Modi.] But career professionals are not the only ones in the cross hairs. Also facing scrutiny are Republican political appointees considered insufficiently committed to the president or suspected of not aggressively advancing his agenda. Allies of the president say he should be free to make personnel changes, even if it amounts to shedding people who are not seen as loyal to Mr. Trump. “It is not unusual at all that these types of assessments are done and thereafter changes are made,” said Bradley A. Blakeman, a Republican strategist and former White House official under President George W. Bush. Nonetheless, the tumult and anxiety come at a time when the Trump administration confronts enormous challenges, including the coronavirus outbreak, Iranian and North Korean nuclear development and Russian determination to play a role again in America’s next election. Democrats, for example, have expressed concerns about the administration’s ability to respond if there were a severe coronavirus outbreak in the United States, noting that a global health security expert position on the National Security Council has been left vacant for almost two years. Mr. Trump has long been obsessed with loyalty, a view only exacerbated by his impeachment and the various investigations over the last three years that have convinced him that he is surrounded by a deep-state enemy within that is leaking, lying and sabotaging his presidency. He has also been frustrated by the decision-making process of government, aggravated at competing centers of power that have shaped the modern presidency but have, in his view, hindered his ability to enact policies. With a more loyal team in place, he hopes to make more progress on initiatives that have been slow-walked by institutional inertia or resistance like tougher rules on trade and immigration. But it could mean less dissent and less open debate with surviving officials fearing the loss of their jobs if they are seen as stepping out of line. From the beginning, his administration has been a turnstile of people who fall in and out of favor with the president. Including those with “acting” designations, he is on his third chief of staff, his fourth national security adviser, his fourth defense secretary, his fifth secretary of homeland security, his sixth deputy national security adviser and his seventh communications director. According to data compiled by Kathryn Dunn Tenpas, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, turnover among what she calls Mr. Trump’s “A team,” meaning his senior staff, has hit 82 percent, more in three years than any of the previous five presidents saw in their first four years. Moreover, the Trump administration has been notable for a high level of serial turnover, with 38 percent of the top positions replaced more than once. “Many key departments and White House entities have been hollowed out,” Ms. Tenpas said. The president has thus been left with acting officials in many key areas. “He seems completely unbothered,” she said. “He claims that actings give him flexibility, but fails to see that temporary leaders cannot advance his policies nearly as well as a Senate-confirmed appointee who has the stature and all the powers to do so.” While some of the reliance on acting officials owes to a dysfunctional Senate confirmation process, Mr. Trump seems to prefer to keep senior advisers on edge as to whether they will keep their job. Mick Mulvaney, his acting White House chief of staff, a position that does not require Senate confirmation, is finishing his 14th month with an “acting” in front of his title for no reason that has ever been publicly articulated and he may be forced out without ever having been granted the full title. Mr. Mulvaney has shrugged it off, saying that anyone who works for Mr. Trump is by definition an acting official who could be dismissed at any time. But the president’s refusal to bestow the full title strikes many as a form of ritual humiliation depriving him of stature, influence or job security. Just a few days ago, Mr. Mulvaney seemed to speak out in a way that caused many to wonder whether he may leave soon, voluntarily or not. During a session with the Oxford Union in England, he said that the United States was “desperate” for more immigrants and that Republicans seemed to stop caring about rising deficits when Mr. Trump took office. He added that “I disagree with the president every single day” but did not talk about it publicly. The newest power center at the White House is Mr. McEntee, a former assistant to the president who was fired by the previous chief of staff, John F. Kelly, but has been brought back as presidential personnel director. Mr. McEntee has made clear that his mission is to establish a more loyal team around the president. His meeting last Thursday with cabinet liaisons in which he called for rooting out disloyal officials was first reported by Axios. The ousters have extended beyond impeachment witnesses like Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman and the ambassador Gordon D. Sondland. John C. Rood, who was removed as under secretary of defense for policy, did not speak out publicly but had written internal emails skeptical of the freeze on security aid to Ukraine that was at the center of the impeachment inquiry. In National Security Council staff meetings, however, Mr. Rood was a constant voice of skepticism over the administration’s troop reductions in Syria, its pending peace deal with the Taliban and other issues. With Mr. McEntee’s arrival, that dissenting voice was no longer welcome, said a person familiar with the matter. Supporters of Jessie K. Liu, a Trump backer who served as the United States attorney in Washington, suspect her nomination for under secretary of Treasury was pulled because of dissatisfaction with her prosecution of Roger J. Stone Jr., the president’s adviser convicted of obstruction and witness intimidation to protect Mr. Trump. Victoria Coates, a deputy national security adviser, was dispatched to the Energy Department despite denials that she was the anonymous official who wrote an Op-Ed and book critical of the administration. Mr. Maguire, the acting director of national intelligence who angered the president by allowing intelligence officials to tell House lawmakers that Russia was already intervening in the 2020 election on Mr. Trump’s behalf, was replaced by Richard Grenell, the ambassador to Germany and a vocal conservative with no background in intelligence. One of Mr. Grenell’s first moves was to push out Andrew P. Hallman, the popular principal executive, who had been acting as the top deputy. Arriving with Mr. Grenell was Kashyap Patel, a senior National Security Council staff member and former key aide to Representative Devin Nunes, Republican of California and a former chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. Mr. Patel has been viewed warily by intelligence officers especially since news reports that his mandate was to clean house. Some top civil servants told colleagues they were contemplating quitting or feared being fired. But Mr. Grenell also began a charm offensive with senior officials and his initial meetings have put some at ease while making others think they should give the new boss a chance. It is also not clear who placed Mr. Patel in the office, with one official saying it was not Mr. Grenell’s idea. Some allies of the administration cautioned against overanalyzing the developments in the intelligence office. Mr. Maguire was scheduled to leave next month anyway under a vacancies law, although administration officials had been looking for ways to extend him, and Mr. Grenell is only temporary while the president comes up with a nominee to send to the Senate. “The O.D.N.I., I think, is less than meets the eye,” said James Jay Carafano, a national security scholar at the Heritage Foundation, using the initials for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. Even so, it has added to the wave of concern across the administration, even among Trump appointees. And that may be part of the point. Convinced that so many officials in government have been working against him, Mr. Trump does not mind if they are more than a little unsettled.

2020,Opinion | Trump’s Interventions in the Justice System,"letters Readers discuss the president’s pardons and his claim to be the nation’s top law enforcement official. To the Editor: Re “Trump Exerts His Power With a Spree of Pardons” (front page, Feb. 19): In my eyes, President Trump’s commutation of the sentence of Rod Blagojevich, former governor of Illinois, is the last straw in a long line of abhorrent transgressions. For years, I have given Mr. Trump the benefit of the doubt. I supported his tax cuts and his attempt to curtail the devastating impact of the authoritarian Chinese state. However, enough is enough. Mr. Blagojevich attempted to essentially sell former President Barack Obama’s Senate seat. He undermined, in the most heinous fashion, the sacred trust of the American people. Now Mr. Trump has done the same by commuting his sentence. This madness must end now. The American people have the power to restore dignity and sanity to our governing institutions. We must take a stand against the actions of this president and the threat that he represents to our democratic republic. Henry J.H. WilsonBarrington, Ill. To the Editor: As someone who has received clemency and has advocated for others who have been convicted of nonviolent drug charges, I support President Trump’s use of his pardon powers. I am hoping that other elected officials who have pardon power follow Mr. Trump’s lead and free deserving individuals who have fallen through the cracks of our criminal justice system. There are many cases of injustice that exist and need to be corrected. If critics continue to question the actions of Mr. Trump about whom he chooses to grant clemency or pardons to, it might prevent him and others from using their pardon powers. We need to embrace the use of this power in order to save lives and support the president instead of putting him down. Anthony PapaBrooklynThe writer is the author of “15 to Life” and “This Side of Freedom: Life After Clemency.” To the Editor: Re “Barr’s Irritation Mounts as Boss Claims to Be Chief Law Officer” (front page, Feb. 19): After publicly attempting to disempower the F.B.I. and the State Department, President Trump has turned his attention to the justice system. Not only did he not heed the attorney general’s pleas to stop the public statements and tweeting, he doubled down, asserting his right to speak and tweet at will, and then, to show William Barr who’s boss, declared himself the “chief law enforcement officer of the country.” More than 2,000 former Justice Department prosecutors and officials have called for Mr. Barr’s resignation, and representatives of America’s federal judges called an emergency meeting to discuss the president’s intervention in judicial matters. Mr. Barr’s reputation for probity is in tatters. How much humiliation is he willing to absorb? Perhaps the attorney general should have talked to Jeff Sessions before taking his current job.

2020,Trump’s New Intelligence Director Faces a Legal Countdown Clock on His Tenure,"Under federal law, Richard Grenell, the new acting director of national intelligence, may be able to serve only a few weeks unless the president nominates someone to take on the job permanently. WASHINGTON — President Trump’s new acting director of national intelligence may hold the job for only about three weeks — unless the White House quickly finds a permanent nominee to offer to the Senate for confirmation. The president tapped Richard Grenell, the American ambassador to Germany, on Wednesday to add the role overseeing the nation’s 17 spy agencies to his existing duties. Mr. Grenell agreed to hold the post for only a limited period of time, according to people familiar with his plan. Federal law gives the president a great deal of flexibility to appoint whomever he chooses to the position on a temporary basis while his official nominee for the job awaits confirmation from the Senate. Late Thursday, Mr. Trump, traveling on the West Coast, told reporters he was considering naming Representative Doug Collins, Republican of Georgia and an ally of his currently running for the Senate, as the permanent director. Under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, Mr. Grenell can serve in his post only until March 11 unless the president formally nominates someone else for the job. That move would allow Mr. Grenell to serve for months longer as the nomination works its way through the Senate. Two administration officials said that officials were aware that they must nominate someone else soon, and that the process to find a formal nominee was underway. “The President will announce the Nominee (not me) sometime soon,” Mr. Grenell wrote on Twitter on Thursday morning. It was the latest instance of complicated maneuvering by the White House to place people the president favors in specific positions. Mr. Grenell, a Trump loyalist, has little experience in intelligence or in running a large bureaucracy, and would be likely to face resistance in the Senate if he were nominated permanently for the post. Notably, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Richard M. Burr, Republican of North Carolina, has not issued a statement praising Mr. Grenell. It was not clear whom Mr. Trump would nominate, and indeed he might choose someone with little chance at drawing Senate approval to keep Mr. Grenell in the position as long as he can. Even if the Senate rejected a new nominee, it would effectively reset the clock on Mr. Grenell’s tenure, said Eric Columbus, a former Obama administration Justice Department official. “The Federal Vacancies Reform Act is coming into play constantly in this administration and allows the president a great deal of leeway in appointing acting officials,” Mr. Columbus said. Stephen I. Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas at Austin, agreed, saying an “acting” appointee could follow someone else who was “acting” so long as there was a new nominee who had been sent to the Senate. Without that, he said, “it doesn’t extend the clock” on how long the temporary appointee can serve. Mr. Grenell replaces Joseph Maguire, who was also an acting director of intelligence and may have had to give up the position by March 11, according to federal law. The Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel reviewed the vacancies act and how it applied to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence last year, when the president appointed Mr. Maguire. “The clocks are very generous,” Mr. Columbus said. “They were intended for good-faith uses, and it may very well be they are acting in good faith and they intend to nominate someone who can be confirmed and they aren’t going to nominate Jeanine Pirro,” the Fox News host. But Mr. Columbus argued that Mr. Maguire did not need to be replaced to reset the clock on an acting director. “There was no legal impediment to keeping Maguire and just making a permanent nomination,” he said. “That he is getting rid of Maguire now suggests he is maybe dissatisfied with what Maguire did in regards to the Ukraine whistle-blower.” Even before his new appointment on Wednesday, Mr. Grenell had been working with the White House on issues related to intelligence, including pressuring Germany and other allies not to use the Chinese telecom company Huawei to build the next-generation mobile network known as 5G over security concerns. He is not giving up his ambassadorship to Germany or a broader diplomatic portfolio that involves developing a rail path between Kosovo and Serbia. Mr. Grenell has spoken to people about the need to have the Office of the Director of National Intelligence function as an entity that is not in competition with the various intelligence branches, according to a person familiar with the discussions. Before Mr. Grenell’s appointment became public on Wednesday, the decision was kept under wraps within the White House, with only a few people aware of it ahead of time. Julian E. Barnes reported from Washington, and Maggie Haberman from New York.",The New York Times
2020,Trump’s Path to Weaker Fuel Efficiency Rules May Lead to a Dead End,"Ms. Davenport has been covering the fight over the federal government’s use of auto emissions standards to tackle climate change since 2007. WASHINGTON — Last April, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, Andrew Wheeler, proclaimed at an auto show here that he would soon roll back President Barack Obama’s stringent fuel efficiency standards. That, the administration contends, would unleash the muscle of the American auto industry. It would also virtually wipe away the government’s biggest effort to combat climate change. Nearly a year later, the rollback is nowhere near complete and may not be ready until this summer — if ever. In January, administration staff members appointed by President Trump sent a draft of the scaled-back fuel economy standards to the White House, but six people familiar with the documents described them as “Swiss cheese,” sprinkled with glaring numerical and spelling errors (such as “Massachusettes”), with 111 sections marked “text forthcoming.” The cost-benefit analysis showed that consumers would lose more money than they would gain. And, because the new auto pollution rule lacks the detailed technical analyses required by law, the regulations would be unlikely to withstand court challenges. “They look like they’re headed to a legal train wreck here,” said Richard Lazarus, a professor of environmental law at Harvard University. Michael Abboud, a spokesman for the E.P.A., said the length of time the rule was taking reflected the care the administration was using. “The Trump administration has reviewed hundreds of thousands of comments, met with numerous stakeholders, and provided ample amount of time for all involved to voice their opinion on this serious matter,” he said. The delay has angered Mr. Trump, who is eager to campaign on the rollback as a signature economic achievement — one that he personally promised to autoworkers in the critical battleground state of Michigan, which he won in 2016 by 10,704 votes. By lifting the Obama administration’s requirements that carmakers build and sell millions of hybrid and electric vehicles, Mr. Trump hoped to claim credit for lowering the cost of sport-utility vehicles, pickup trucks and large sedans while boosting economic growth. But the problem is mathematics. Instead of boosting the economy, the analyses show that the rule’s economic costs would outweigh its benefits, according to the people who have viewed the documents. For months, Trump administration aides crunching the numbers of the new rule have come up with the same unwelcome result: while lower sticker prices on less fuel-efficient cars would save consumers money upfront, fuel costs over time would overwhelm the initial savings. And, by allowing more pollution into the air, the rule would measurably contribute to more premature deaths from lung and respiratory illnesses, piling on more societal and economic costs. Massaging the numbers or the models used to produce them would only open the rule to legal attack when it is inevitably challenged in court. “They are trying to make the data dance the way this administration wants it to dance,” said John M. DeCicco, an expert on transportation technology and emissions policy at the University of Michigan. But, he added, “the data and the models don’t lie.” Since his first days in office, Mr. Trump has reveled in rolling back regulations on industry; to date, his administration has erased or weakened about 100 environmental protections on climate change, clean air, clean water, and endangered species. But the largest federal climate change regulation remains in place — Mr. Obama’s 2012 fuel economy rules to cut vehicle tailpipe emissions. The standards, which require automakers to sell vehicles that average about 54 miles per gallon by 2025, are among the most ambitious fuel economy standards in the world. Once fully implemented, they would reduce U.S. carbon dioxide emissions by about six billion tons over the lifetime of the vehicles affected by the regulations. That would be about the same amount of carbon dioxide the United States emits in a year. Oil consumption would be reduced by about 12 billion barrels over the same period. To meet the standards, automakers will have to invest heavily in building and marketing highly fuel-efficient hybrid and electric cars. From the beginning of his administration, Mr. Trump saw the fuel economy rules as an opportunity. In March 2017, he told autoworkers in Ypsilanti, Mich., “The assault on the American auto industry is over.” Under his new rule, automakers would have to build cars that achieve a fleetwide average of about 40 miles a gallon by 2026. To meet Mr. Obama’s 54-miles-per-gallon standard, automakers have been forced to increase the fuel economy of their fleets by about 5 percent a year. Under the Trump standard, that would drop to about 1.5 percent a year, lower than the 2-percent annual increase that auto companies roughly achieve absent any regulation, according to industry experts. A draft of the rule sent to the White House in January, which was obtained by Senator Thomas R. Carper, a Delaware Democrat, concluded that the Trump fuel economy target would lower the prices of new cars and light trucks by about $1,000. But it would increase the amount consumers would pay for gasoline by about $1,400, according to a letter sent to the White House by Senator Carper, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Environment Committee. A senior administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity because the rule is not yet complete, described that analysis as “insufficient” and “incomplete.” But outside experts say they agree that the rule will cost consumers money. An analysis by the Consumer Reports concluded that, overall, increasing fuel economy rates 1.5 percent annually compared to 5 percent annually would cost American consumers a total of $300 billion in net losses, chiefly as a result of higher gasoline expenditures. An analysis by the nonpartisan research firm Rhodium Group concluded that a rule that would increase efficiency by 1.5 percent a year would raise oil consumption by 1.8 billion barrels by 2035 relative to Obama-era standards, and cost drivers an additional $231 billion through 2035. “No matter how you look at these numbers, this still costs consumers money,” said Shannon Baker-Branstetter, a policy analyst with Consumers Reports. Beyond the politics of those numbers is the legal problem. “If the costs to the economy exceed the benefits, and there are no environmental benefits, the courts would classically look at this as an arbitrary and capricious policy,” said Mr. Lazarus, who specializes in environmental law at Harvard. “That makes it very vulnerable to being overturned.” More basic issues holding up the regulations point to another problem: the skeleton crew of inexperienced political appointees who are heading the drafting process may not be up to a job that would usually be handled by career federal workers with decades of expertise. The draft rule lacks two technical documents that experts say would be essential to defending it in court. By law, any major new policy affecting the environment requires an environmental-impact statement, but no such document has been completed or sent to the White House, according to people who have viewed the draft. Those people say the draft rule also lacks what is known as a regulatory impact analysis, which is supposed to describe at length the legal, scientific, health and economic impacts of a major new rule. It typically takes many months to complete — the analysis accompanying the original Obama rule ran to 1,217 pages and included supporting analyses by the National Academies of Science. But as of last month, that document was in bare-bones draft form at best, according to a person familiar with the matter. “That’s the single most important document for the legal status of the rule,” said Jeff Alson, an engineer who spent more than 20 years at the E.P.A. working on vehicle emissions programs before retiring in 2018. “That’s where all the key numbers are explained and generated and supported.” As Mr. Trump’s appointees began the work of loosening the Obama rules, he said he and his team of vehicle emissions experts were excluded from the process. “I can tell you with certainty and personal experience that E.P.A. career staff were completely locked out doing any technical work on these documents,” Mr. Alson said. In fact, people familiar with the writing of the rules said the regulatory impact analysis had been sent to the Transportation Department, where a small group with limited experience in mathematical modeling of vehicle emissions was still working to complete it. Although Mr. Trump is said to be irritated by the delay, he is reluctant to rebuke the secretary of transportation, Elaine Chao, because her husband, Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, was instrumental in ensuring the president’s impeachment acquittal, according to two people familiar with the matter. The pressure is rising. The federal government has until March 30 to publish the fuel economy standard for vehicles that will be built and sold in 2022. If the deadline is missed, either the Obama standards remain in place another year, or the Trump administration must press to extend the deadline, squeezing the automakers’ production schedule as they await a final word. “The auto suppliers — aluminum and steel manufacturers, the guys who make transmissions — they’re all waiting for a clear signal from the government on what the automakers are going to do,” said Chris Miller, executive director of the Advanced Engines Systems Institute, which represents manufacturers of vehicle emissions equipment. “If there isn’t soon a clear fuel economy standard for model year 2022, we won’t know if we’ll be able to sell in the U.S. market,” Mr. Miller said. “Our companies and suppliers have already started shifting to focus on the European and Asian markets.” For more climate news sign up for the Climate Fwd: newsletter or follow @NYTClimate on Twitter.

2020,Trump’s Plan Backs Israeli Settlements. So Why Are Settlers Unhappy?,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expected the U.S. peace plan would gain him votes in Monday’s election. It might not work out that way. YITZHAR, West Bank — For the residents of the hilltop Jewish settlement of Yitzhar, President Trump’s recently published plan for Middle East peace comes with a blessing and a curse. For many, it fulfills a lifelong dream: American recognition of the biblical promise and legitimacy of the settlements in the occupied West Bank, allowing Israel to annex them while flouting decades of international consensus that they violate international law. “The whole narrative has changed,” said Matanya Gavrieli, 27, a member of Yitzhar’s leadership council. “A president of the United States came along and said the people of Israel have the right to be here.” But what many of the settlers object to is that the plan leaves Yitzhar and 14 other isolated settlements — including some of the most ideologically hard-line ones — as enclaves surrounded by a Palestinian mini state, tethered to Israel by narrow arteries. Standing by President Trump’s side during the rollout of the plan at the White House last month, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel proudly announced that he would annex the settlements and that not a single settler would have to be uprooted, a pitch that was expected to increase his chances in Israel’s election on Monday. But if Mr. Netanyahu hoped this plum from Washington would win Likud the crucial votes it needs to ensure a right-wing victory after two inconclusive elections in April and September, they were unlikely to come from settler strongholds like this one. The idea of a Palestinian state surrounding Israeli settlements was dangerous, Mr. Gavrieli said, however far-off that state may be. The Palestinians have rejected the plan, which is seen as heavily weighted toward Israel. “It will be impossible to provide security to the residents,” Mr. Gavrieli said. “It’s absurd. It’s another way of saying ‘Get up and leave.’” The Palestinians were not happy with the Trump map either. President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority compared its proposed Palestinian state to “Swiss cheese.” Regardless, Mr. Netanyahu has campaigned hard to convince his base that only a right-wing government led by his conservative Likud party can capitalize on the plan by moving quickly and unilaterally to extend Israeli sovereignty to the settlements and the strategic Jordan Valley. Signaling their serious intent, an American-Israeli team charged with the preparatory work of mapping the exact areas to be annexed convened for the first time this week in the settlement of Ariel. Yet all this appears to have had little effect on the voters. “It was clearly timed to have a political impact,” Prof. Reuven Hazan, a political scientist at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, said of the Trump plan. “But for all of that, nothing has happened.” Pre-election opinion polls again show Mr. Netanyahu, Israel’s longest serving prime minister, in more or less a tie with his main rival, Benny Gantz, of the centrist Blue and White party. Neither Mr. Netanyahu’s right-wing religious alliance nor the center-left bloc appears to have a clear path to forming a majority government. The plan may have helped distract the public from Mr. Netanyahu’s legal troubles: charged with bribery, fraud and breach of trust in three corruption cases, his trial is set to open on March 17. Mr. Gantz’s endorsement of the plan, at least as a basis for negotiations, made it less partisan but also blurred the lines between his party and Likud. Mr. Netanyahu has mockingly referred to Mr. Gantz as a “Bibi from AliExpress,” using his own nickname to denigrate his rival as a cheap imitation of himself. To remain in power, Mr. Netanyahu needs Likud to be the largest party and for the right wing-religious bloc to beat the center-left bloc. In the last two elections, however, the pro-settlement parties squandered votes because of internal squabbling and political fragmentation, a result that could easily repeat itself on Monday. In September, more than 58 percent of Yitzhar’s voters cast their ballots for Jewish Strength, a tiny extreme right-wing party that advocates Jewish sovereignty over the entire West Bank and other occupied territories and the transfer of “enemies of Israel,” meaning Palestinians, to neighboring Arab countries. But the party failed to win enough support to enter Parliament, and the more than 80,000 votes it garnered went to waste. The party has insisted on running again, despite Mr. Netanyahu’s pleas for it to drop out of the race and channel its voters to him or allied right-wing parties large enough to be assured of representation. Yitzhar, southwest of the Palestinian city of Nablus, is home to the Od Yosef Chai seminary, whose students have a reputation for violence against Palestinian villages and for clashing with Israeli security forces who try to curtail their activities. Some Yitzhar voters are now deliberating between the pro-settlement Yamina party and the ultra-Orthodox United Torah Judaism. “In the big picture Netanyahu did great things,” said Yechiel Klein, 37, another member of Yitzhar’s council. “But we’d like to see a stronger stand on the things we believe in.” Those, he said, include the recognition that “We are the landlords. It’s all our land.” Ora Tubi, 44, a Yitzhar resident who runs spiritual workshops for women and sells health products, said her family from central Israel doesn’t visit much because they are already afraid of the drive through the West Bank. Her daughter, 10, recites a special prayer every night that she composed herself, Ms. Tubi said, because she once heard of a settler girl who had been murdered in her bed. Historically, she said, she considers the Palestinians “guests” but that “good guests” — those prepared to peacefully accept the settlements — should be treated well. Itamar, another would-be settlement enclave southeast of Nablus, has had its share of bloodshed. Its vulnerability was exposed in 2011 when two Palestinian teenagers from a nearby village slipped into a home and stabbed five members of the Fogel family to death in their beds, including a 3-month-old baby. At least 20 residents have been killed in attacks since the settlement was established in 1984. Moshe and Leah Goldsmith, both 56 and Yamina voters, were among the first families to move in. Born and raised in Brooklyn, their living room window looks out onto Mount Gerizim and Mount Ebal, the mountains framing Nablus where, according to the Bible, the Israelites delivered blessings and curses. “Any plan with a mention of a Palestinian state is a tragedy,” Mr. Goldsmith said. “We want peace, but we are not willing to commit suicide and we will never agree to something like that, giving up our homeland.” Ms. Goldsmith described the Jews here as a “stiff-necked people,” borrowing a biblical phrase for stubbornness, and said they were not going anywhere. Itamar was only growing, she said, and life had only gotten easier, with two new shopping malls opening up in nearby Ariel in the past 18 months.",The New York Times
2020,Opinion | Trump’s Policy on New York’s ‘Trusted Travelers’ Is Unconstitutional,"People should never be punished for things they haven’t done. Mr. Tribe is a professor of constitutional law at Harvard Law School. The Department of Homeland Security recently decided to bar New York residents from federal programs that allow “trusted travelers” expedited transit through airports and border checkpoints. The Trump administration is defending the decision as a rational response to New York’s enactment of a law denying federal immigration authorities free access to the state’s motor vehicle records. In truth, the department’s decision is spiteful retaliation against people who reside in a state that declines to bend to the administration’s immigration priorities. Whatever its other virtues or vices, the decision offends constitutional norms that are neither liberal nor conservative but simply American. New York wasted no time in filing a federal suit to block the Department of Homeland Security’s move. The state’s lawsuit raises a number of plausible process-based objections and seeks to take advantage of legal doctrines usually associated with right-leaning judges. But it misses an opportunity to frame the case more fundamentally, in terms of principles grounded in personal responsibility and a refusal to punish people for the sins of others. New York argues that the department’s move was hasty and arbitrary and imposes unjustified and even irrational pressure on the state to cooperate with federal authorities by sharing data they say they need to protect the nation while facilitating travel. The state’s arguments have some force, but their premises might have limited appeal to judges deferential to executive power in matters involving immigration and allegedly implicating national security. Moreover, federal courts across the ideological spectrum might well sympathize with the administration’s claim that it cannot safely administer the expedited transit programs without access to personal information uniquely available through state motor vehicle records. The state might fare better with its federalism-based arguments: It objects to the use of national power to influence state lawmaking. Here, New York is armed with the Supreme Court’s 2018 opinion in Murphy v. National Collegiate Athletic Association, which invalidated a federal law flatly prohibiting states from legalizing sports gambling. The court in that case held the federal law to be a forbidden form of federal commandeering of state legislative power. But it’s far from obvious that the action New York challenges is sufficiently analogous to this or other cases in which the Supreme Court has declared federal legislative provisions unconstitutional because of demands they made on states. No less concerning for progressives, relying upon a line of precedents rooted in states’ rights could solidify recent conservative doctrine in ways that could limit future federal power to enact national policy on vital issues such as climate change or health care reform. Fortunately, those objecting to the Department of Homeland Security’s decision needn’t invoke controversial legal notions to establish its constitutional flaw. Although constitutional law doesn’t always track ordinary moral intuitions, this is an instance where it does. The most fundamental principles of fairness and due process, principles neither liberal nor conservative, tell us that individuals should never be punished for things they haven’t done — which is precisely what the Department of Homeland Security is doing here. The Department of Homeland Security is indiscriminately penalizing New York residents — both those directly denied access to expedited transit and those derivatively affected by the attendant economic and social consequences — for the actions of lawmakers in Albany. In so doing, the department violates not just some technical legal doctrine but also an ancient and axiomatic principle undergirding virtually any decent system of laws. This central, intuitive principle of justice is also firmly rooted in federal constitutional doctrine. Its influence is evident, for example, in Plyler v. Doe, a 1982 case in which the Supreme Court struck down a Texas law denying undocumented children access to the state’s system of free public education. The court in that case reasoned, “Even if the State found it expedient to control the conduct of adults by acting against their children, legislation directing the onus of a parent’s misconduct against his children does not comport with fundamental conceptions of justice.” The same logic applies here. Even if the Department of Homeland Security finds it expedient to control the conduct of the New York legislature by acting against its constituents — denying them access to federal programs at airports and border crossings anywhere in the nation simply because of their state residency — doing so clashes with the most basic conceptions of justice. It might be urged that a state’s residents are not wholly without influence on the lawmakers for whom they vote and who theoretically represent them. But one needn’t be cynical about the workings of representative democracy to recognize the limits of that idea. For one thing, much of the harm the Department of Homeland Security’s rule visits upon those residing in New York is aimed at people ineligible to vote there, either because they’re undocumented immigrants or because they’re green card holders. For another thing, the rule obviously can’t differentiate between those who voted for the lawmakers supporting the state law to which the department objects and those who voted against them. Finally, even those who voted for the legislators responsible for enacting the state law at issue may well have done so for reasons entirely unrelated to information-sharing by the Department of Motor Vehicles. While we can hope that this example of President Trump’s vindictive post-impeachment behavior may be promptly struck down by our independent federal judiciary, we mustn’t lose sight of this president’s other dangerous acts of retaliation, which may lack readily available judicial remedies. With the ultimate referendum on the president’s lawlessness just 10 months away, citizens should take keen note of just how willing Mr. Trump is to punish anyone who doesn’t loyally embrace his political agenda — and even those who might embrace that agenda but happen to be in his way.

2020,"Trump’s Rally Recipe: Just Add Data, Money, Entertainment and Grievance","One rally attendee’s experience embodies the ideal outcome for a campaign using digital platforms to bring followers into the flock and keep them there. Jacqueline D’Angelo, with her son, Lorenzo, attended her first Trump rally in Wildwood, N.J., last month.Credit...Bryan Anselm for The New York Times WILDWOOD, N.J. — The president asked for nothing less than everything they had. “If you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of Americans have fought and died for to secure,” President Trump told a crowd of supporters in Wildwood at one of a string of campaign rallies he has held this winter, “we must devote everything that we have toward victory in 2020.” Sitting a few yards to the president’s right, a 53-year-old retired police officer, Jacqueline D’Angelo, was taking Mr. Trump’s words to heart. Sitting with her 14-year-old son, Lorenzo, she pumped her fists as Mr. Trump’s voice rose and fell. She waved her made-for-TV sign — “Women for Trump” — and jeered along with the crowd when the president ran down the list of his villains: Democrats, Nancy Pelosi, the news media, Nancy Pelosi again. Mostly, she was having fun. The rally last month was just like any of over 500 that Mr. Trump has hosted since announcing his candidacy in 2015, but this one was special to Ms. D’Angelo because it was her first. When she emerged from the rally, her cheeks were flushed. “That,” she said, “was a release.” For the campaign, it was a capture. Ms. D’Angelo’s experience represents the ideal outcome for a campaign that leads the way in using digital platforms to bring followers into the flock and hoovering up crucial voter information once they get there. Rallies like this one — and an upcoming one Friday night in North Charleston, S.C. — turn out to be the crown jewels of data collection for Mr. Trump’s campaign. Campaign officials are open about viewing the rallies as data-mining expeditions that can help create a red-hatted army of volunteers. Ms. D’Angelo and her son, according to the campaign, were two of nearly 100,000 people who registered to attend the New Jersey rally, Mr. Trump’s first in the state as president. To register for the rally, she visited the campaign site, clicked a button, then turned over her name, email address and phone number. She received two tickets in return. Ms. D’Angelo heard about the president’s appearance through a friend who helps her operate a pro-Trump Facebook page she created before the 2018 midterm elections. Like most Facebook groups that support Mr. Trump, hers is a cascade of links to conservative websites, Trump White House social media posts and doctored photos of the president’s enemies, including Ms. Pelosi. For Ms. D’Angelo, hearing the president talk was validation of her decision to vote for Mr. Trump in 2016. Watching his performance over the past three years — particularly, she said, in securing America from “illegal immigrants” — she has gone from someone who was raised politically independent to someone who now says she believes that the truth is to be trusted only if it comes from Mr. Trump. “I was on the fence like anybody else,” she said. But now, “it’s like a leap of faith for me knowing he’s trying to do the right thing.” Her digital ticket request was just a drop in the campaign data collection bucket. According to a tweet by Brad Parscale, the Trump campaign manager who publicly shares data after each rally, the Wildwood event had 158,632 requested tickets. Of the 73,482 voters identified by the campaign as seeking tickets, 10 percent did not vote in 2016 and more than a quarter had at one point been registered as Democrats. That last figure has campaign officials convinced that Mr. Trump is attracting people who are disillusioned with the current slate of presidential candidates, so the campaign cross-references the data it collects from rallies with voter information collected by the Republican National Committee. “When someone signs up to go to a rally, we can match them up to our big voter file,” said Tim Murtaugh, the campaign’s communications director. “From that we can tell if they’ve voted recently, if they’re a Republican or Democrat, did they move from a different state. When we can identify someone as a supporter, that improves all of our modeling and voter scoring.” Republican strategists say those numbers reveal that the Trump campaign is focusing not just on drawing in believers, but also on making sure they turn out to vote in November. “People can be vocal Republicans online and in person but never vote,” Eric Wilson, a Republican digital strategist, said in an interview. “Voters are not necessarily rational actors, and that’s why it’s critical for the campaign to build a one-to-one relationship with them.” During the 90 minutes or so that Mr. Trump is onstage at every rally, he delivers what his campaign sees as its best product: a president who reinforces a feeling that the news media and the Democratic Party refuse to see anything positive about his administration or his supporters. As she waited in line in Wildwood, Ms. D’Angelo was approached by a Bikers for Trump member who was volunteering to collect names, addresses and phone numbers from people in the crowd on behalf of the New Jersey Republican Party. (Ms. D’Angelo told him she had already signed up.) She groused with an acquaintance, James Toto, a local councilman who is running for Atlantic County freeholder, over L.G.B.T.-friendly bathroom policies in public schools. Ms. D’Angelo also took time to check in on her pro-Trump Facebook page, sometimes broadcasting live video for others back home. Many of its members once worked in law enforcement, as did Ms. D’Angelo, an Army veteran who is retired from the police force in Paterson, N.J. She now collects a pension that she supplements with an auto body business she runs with her husband in Brigantine, N.J. At Mr. Trump’s rallies and campaign events, his words are fine-tuned to appeal to white, Christian, blue-collar voters. Ms. D’Angelo, who is white, said his overtures to the military and law enforcement communities helped win her over. She cannot understand why anyone would dislike Mr. Trump, a leader who, as she puts it, “has cojones.” “The last time I experienced such a patriotic push was 9/11,” Ms. D’Angelo said. “Apple pie. Baseball. Christmas. He really embodies the traditions we hold so dear.” Christmas, as Ms. D’Angelo mentioned, is something Mr. Trump often mentions at his rallies. He claims that he alone made it safe to say “Merry Christmas” again. A “Make America Great Again” collectible ornament costs $60. Ms. D’Angelo likens staying updated on pro-Trump news on Facebook to another full-time job. She and other supporters who look at such pages are nearly certain to encounter the countless ads the Trump campaign has used to flood the platform. Facebook’s fact-checking rules do not apply to political ads, letting candidates spread false or misleading claims. “It usually stays with current events,” Ms. D’Angelo said of her own page, “and it’s giving people a voice who can speak without retaliation.” Finding friendly faces nearly everywhere in the crowd, Ms. D’Angelo complained with a stranger about the rough deal Mr. Trump got by inheriting the Obama-era national deficit. When a reporter pointed out that the president had actually helped widen the national debt — despite a campaign-trail pledge to erase it within eight years — she said that Mr. Trump had come into the job with a lot on his plate. “The thing is he’s also straightened things out,” Ms. D’Angelo said in the president’s defense. As she spoke, a message came on the Jumbotron asking Trump supporters to text their phone number to the campaign to stay in touch. The campaign has aggressively pushed text sign-ups across its digital platforms in order to create a direct relationship with individual supporters to ask them for small donations. The tactic has long been used by political campaigns — 12 years ago, the Obama campaign was praised for its leveraging of SMS texting, by offering special merchandise and targeting voters in specific areas with news about rallies and events. But Teddy Goff, the Obama campaign’s former digital director, said the Trump campaign had taken traditional digital tactics in a new direction by spreading misinformation and news of the president’s latest political skirmish — basically, keeping supporters angry enough to vote. The campaign’s messaging approach often warns of what might happen should a Democrat win the 2020 election. “If Radical Democratic candidates take back the Nation, they’ll ruin everything President Trump has accomplished,” one recent email sent to supporters read, before asking them to contribute money. “I think the Trump campaign probably makes its people feel like they’re being well served in that he validates all of their grievances,” Mr. Goff said. Ms. D’Angelo said her news diet included Twitter, Facebook and news sites like the BBC and CNN — though later she added that “I can’t turn it on” — and Fox News. Occasionally, she checks in on QAnon, the conspiracy website that has a noticeable presence at Trump rallies, to see what people are saying, but she views it more as entertainment. Ultimately, Ms. D’Angelo said, she takes bits and pieces from a variety of websites, crafting her own view of the news, but only believes it if it is confirmed by the president. “I tune into the president every day, Fox every night,” Ms. D’Angelo said. “At night it’s me and my husband. Fox comes on and we get up to speed.” After making it inside the Wildwoods Convention Center, Ms. D’Angelo almost immediately encountered a table laden with Trump merchandise. With $100, she bought T-shirts, bumper stickers and hats, before turning around and spending $70 more on gifts for her brother. Along with her American Express card, she also handed over her driver’s license, which was scanned and put into a database for campaign contributions. The Trump campaign is adept at rolling out new lines of merchandise, sometimes tailoring it to the latest social media outrage. Most of the merchandise requests are routed through a company called Ace Specialties in Lafayette, La., whose owner, Christl Mahfouz, can often be seen mingling with fans outside Trump rallies. Her team sells hats in exchange for money and the buyer’s voting data: Each time supporters buy a T-shirt or a hat at a rally, a digital interface prompts them to turn over their names, addresses and other voter-specific information. This data is then logged as a donation to the Trump Make America Great Again Committee and each person’s contribution is saved for future Federal Election Commission reports, according to a campaign official. For Ms. D’Angelo, her purchases would serve another function: Wearing them would give her pro-Trump protective armor after she left the bubble of the rally for the outside world. “There’s a whole army behind him,” Ms. D’Angelo said. “Even in New Jersey.” Roughly 10 hours after she arrived in Wildwood, the president took the stage and launched into his familiar call-and-responses, reserving special treatment for Democrats, whom he called “do nothing” and “crazy.” Eventually, he landed on the news media. “Do you see the fakers back there?” Mr. Trump said, pointing to reporters and camera people in a roped-off area. “Fake news.” The president also spent time hammering home a key message: that he and his family have sacrificed a life of luxury for him to be president. Ms. D’Angelo heard that message loud and clear. “Sometimes he looks so tired and I go, ‘Ugh, look at him,’” Ms. D’Angelo said. “He’s going through so much abuse to protect us. I know he’s strong. I know he can take it. But compliment the man sometimes. I don’t see anything he’s done wrong.” By the time she left, the hours and money Ms. D’Angelo had spent in Wildwood ended up solidifying her bond with a campaign — and a president — who has prioritized his ability to connect with his supporters on an emotional level. And after the rally, she knew her marching orders. “We need to do everything to get him re-elected,” she said, “is what we’re going to do.” Updated Feb. 29, 2020",The New York Times
2020,Trump’s Reality-TV State of the Union Argues for Another Season,"Critic’s Notebook The president’s speech was jammed with engineered moments and sweeps stunts — and then came a cable-drama rip. It’s no secret that Donald Trump, just months before he ran for the job of most powerful man in the world, was hosting Season 7 of “The Celebrity Apprentice.” But not all his TV appearances as president have been as reality-fied as one might have expected, especially his sedate, from-the-TelePrompTer State of the Union speeches. The TV president made up for that Tuesday night with a dumbfounding, stunt-laden spectacle, less a presidential address than an “Apprentice” finale wrapped in an Oprah episode stuffed inside a viral YouTube video and dropped into the middle of a WrestleMania match. The speech was jammed with more twists and giveaways than a two-hour “Survivor” finale. President Trump awarded a young girl in the audience a scholarship. He had his wife, Melania, drape a Presidential Medal of Freedom around the paleoconservative shock jock Rush Limbaugh. He arranged a reunion between a deployed soldier and his wife, just like the surprise-military-return videos that TV morning shows love. And all these planned moments may have been overshadowed by a drama-filled, two-part installment of “The Real Politicians of D.C.,” co-starring his antagonist Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House. Before he began his speech, he appeared to refuse her offer of a handshake; after he finished, she ripped up her copy of it on camera. Neither of them, it seems, came there to make friends. transcript “The president of the United States.” [applause] The snubs came early, even before President Trump began his State of the Union speech. He declined to shake Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s hand. Moments later, she introduced him without using the ceremonious language that’s customary. “The president of the United States.” [applause] The speech itself included a series of made-for-TV moments: A surprise award for conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh. “The Presidential Medal of Freedom.” [applause] There was also this surprise reunion for a military family. “There is one more thing: Tonight, we have a very special surprise. I am thrilled to inform you that your husband is back from deployment. He is here with us tonight, and we couldn’t keep him waiting any longer.” [applause] Trump also surprised a fourth-grader with a scholarship. “Janiyah, I have some good news for you. An Opportunity Scholarship has become available. It’s going to you, and you will soon be heading to the school of your choice.” [applause] Throughout his speech, Trump struck an optimistic tone, not once mentioning his impeachment trial. “Jobs are booming, incomes are soaring, poverty is plummeting, crime is falling, confidence is surging, and our country is thriving and highly respected again.” The optimism was a way to make his case for re-election. “We are moving forward at a pace that was unimaginable just a short time ago, and we are never, ever going back.” [applause] In foreign policy, he touted the killing of adversaries. “The bloodthirsty killer known as al-Baghdadi is dead. And the U.S. military executed a flawless precision strike that killed Suleimani and terminated his evil reign of terror forever.” He also sent a message to Venezuela’s government by inviting the opposition leader. “… Juan Guaidó.” [applause] Democrats had their own message, many wearing white, a symbol of women’s suffrage and empowerment. [chanting] “We are curbing the opioid epidemic —” Trump ended his speech looking to the future. “This nation is our canvas, and this country is our masterpiece. We look at tomorrow and see unlimited frontiers just waiting to be explored.” After he was through, Speaker Pelosi sent one final message with her copy of his speech. [applause] For the president, the address had obvious political goals, coming amid the impeachment trial and at the beginning of an election year. But it also seemed built to make noise and get lasting attention amid a crazy-busy political news week. A State of the Union address, even in calmer times, is an evanescent thing. A president strikes a temporary tone, rattles off some aspirational proposals that will probably never materialize and the press polishes it off by noon the next day. This time, unusually, President Trump found himself sandwiched, like a network public-service announcement, into the space between two bigger political stories. Since Monday night, network news crews had been searching the haunted cornfield into which the results of the Iowa Democratic caucus had vanished. Hours before the speech, when cable analysts would normally be predigesting State of the Union nuggets, CNN’s John King and MSNBC’s Steve Kornacki were speed-swiping through a belated dump of caucus data. And the day after his address, the president had an appointment with predestination, as the Senate was scheduled for a Wednesday vote that would, barring shocking news or mass hypnosis, acquit him on impeachment charges. Indeed, if you’ve been following the impeachment saga, the State of the Union was like Washington’s most ambitious crossover event, with not only the senator-jurors present but also Chief Justice John Roberts (whom Mr. Trump chatted up on his way down the aisle) and figures mentioned in the testimony, like Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. The president, however tempted, never mentioned impeachment. Instead, he began with a long string of economic statistics and boasts. Congressional Republicans rose and clapped, sat, rose and clapped again, sentence after sentence, a P90X workout of election-year fealty. (They set a raucous tone early, chanting “Four more years!” in case you weren’t clear on the subtext.) For well over an hour, Mr. Trump offered a preview of his re-election argument, a long list of superlatives followed by an effort to soften his image for swing voters, followed by rehardening it for his base. Several times, he spotlighted Americans of color as his guests — the scholarship winner, an elderly former Tuskegee Airman whom he had promoted to brigadier general — continuing an effort to broaden his appeal to minorities, or at least reassure white voters turned off by the demonizing of Mexicans, the insults of Haiti and Africa and the caging of Latin American children at the border. All this followed a Super Bowl campaign ad featuring an African-American woman that focused on criminal justice reform instead of appealing to his base — which not long ago he stoked with attacks on black football players who knelt in protest during the national anthem. The speech also took sharp turns from sentimental to ominous, like the negative part of a campaign ad where the music turns scary and the screen shades to black and white. The president continued a long-running theme of connecting immigrants and violent crime, deploring sanctuary city policies for releasing “dangerous criminal aliens.” (Studies in fact show that immigrants commit crime at a lower rate than native-born Americans.) Over all, this was oddly both the most and the least traditional State of the Union President Trump has given, a comfortable, familiar list of campaign arguments that then veered into sweeps-month theatrics. It took the decades-long tradition of presidential guest stars, which began when Ronald Reagan invited the hero of a plane crash in 1982, and amped it up for the age of reality TV. The production seemed designed in part to remind Americans of the munificent Donald Trump persona molded by Mark Burnett on “The Apprentice” for a decade. On that show, he was not just the tough-talking “you’re fired” guy, but a dispenser of treats, rewards and mercy, who presided over celebrity challenges for charity and swept contestants off for trips to Mar-a-Lago and rides in his personal helicopter, like a pinstriped Santa. We can wonder what Mr. Trump’s presidency would have been like if he had leaned into that side of his TV character from the beginning, rather than the shark from the “Apprentice” boardroom who fomented conflict, browbeat losers and relished fights. He certainly seemed more comfortable Tuesday in the mode of expansive, backslapping master of ceremonies than he ever has reciting his staffers’ text from the prompter. But now, every stage-managed segment arrives in a context. His overtures to minority Americans come with his presidential history on race. Mr. Trump knows how this works; once upon a time, “The Apprentice” had a higher Q Score popularity rating with Hispanic and African-American than white audiences — until he embraced the birther conspiracy against Barack Obama, whose legacy his address also worked hard to undermine. In a way, the structure of this State of the Union was a battle against context. It didn’t construct a sweeping arc so much as try to generate clips to use online, in ads, on Fox News. Like much of President Trump’s rhetoric, it was more movie trailer than movie, a series of blowups each of which sought to Etch-a-Sketch the memory of the last. But it may have itself been Etch-a-Sketched. It’s possible that nothing in the speech will get more attention than the Great Pelosi Rip, custom-made to be transmuted into memes and draw cheers and jeers from partisans and inspire arguments among the agonizing-over-civility class. This is America’s political style now, a product of the Trump administration as visible as a segment of border wall. Donald Trump argued that he has delivered America a lot of things — and one of them, as the speech ratified, was the transformation of the presidency and public life into a 24-hour reality show. Tuesday night, he asked the country whether it wanted to renew this production for four more seasons.",The New York Times

Another explains why the president can target New Yorkers with impunity. To the Editor: Re “Trump Hits Back, Firing Witnesses After Acquittal” (front page, Feb. 8): Given the treatment of Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, Ambassador Gordon Sondland and others, no one should ever again question the need for whistle-blowers to maintain anonymity, if they wish.

2020,Opinion | Trump’s Shout-Out Masks a Bleak Outlook for Venezuela’s Guaidó,"The U.S. president has made the troubled South American nation a political pawn in the new cold war with Russia. Professor Smilde is a sociologist specializing in Venezuela. When President Trump recognized Juan Guaidó, president of the Venezuelan National Assembly, as “the true and legitimate president of Venezuela” during the State of the Union address on Tuesday, Mr. Guaidó received two bipartisan standing ovations. The recognition included a commitment from Mr. Trump that Nicolás Maduro’s “grip on tyranny will be smashed and broken.” It was a unifying moment in a divisive address. Mr. Guaidó then spent a night at Blair House, reserved for foreign dignitaries, with the Venezuelan flag flying out front, and met with Mr. Trump at the White House on Wednesday. The president’s shout-out and meeting capped an international tour, in defiance of a travel ban, meant to boost support for Mr. Guaidó’s coalition, in its effort to dislodge Mr. Maduro’s grip on power. The trip has included a state visit to Colombia, a meeting with Prime Minister Boris Johnson in London, with President Emmanuel Macron in Paris, with European Union authorities in Brussels, with multiple leaders in Davos, Switzerland, and with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada in Ottawa. Mr. Trump’s support will provide Mr. Guaidó with a new impulse within his coalition and make it more likely he will be let back into Venezuela without being arrested. However, it does not alter the current political context within the country, which has the opposition coalition on the ropes. The Maduro government’s crass attempt to grab control of the opposition-dominated National Assembly last month has left that body with two directorates — one controlled by Mr. Guaidó and one by opposition dissidents apparently bought off by Mr. Maduro. The impasse will probably be decided in the coming weeks by the Maduro-controlled Supreme Court — likely not in Mr. Guaidó’s favor. In his mentions of Venezuela, Mr. Trump made no new announcements. Indeed the most important innovation was the fact that he did not mention a “military option.” Until recently his administration had consistently stated that “all options are on the table.” And it is this threat that has stymied opposition political efforts. Opposition radicals, who think military intervention is available for the asking, see those who want to engage in politics as naïve about the regime at best, as dangerously complicit with it at worst. But Mr. Trump did emphasize United States leadership with respect to Venezuela, and that is where the problem is. The administration taking up the cause so explicitly a year ago effectively made Venezuela a geopolitical pawn. It is no coincidence that Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, will travel to Venezuela on Friday. The trip not only follows Mr. Trump’s State of the Union address, it comes a week after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s visit to Ukraine and other former Soviet states. It is this Cold War redux that effectively undermined the series of negotiations sponsored by Norwegian diplomats from May to August last year. When the opposition, after two months, put the Maduro government on the spot with a concrete proposal, Mr. Maduro hedged in large part because he knew he could count on Russian support. Theatrical announcement of new sanctions by the national security adviser at the time, John Bolton, including a statement that “the time for dialogue is over,” gave Mr. Maduro the excuse he needed to pull out of negotiations. United States criticism of the negotiation process also emboldened opposition radicals who successfully pushed to end it. Despite Mr. Trump’s show of support, at no time in the past year has Mr. Guaidó been in a worse position to unify the opposition around the type of political actions that have led to democratic transitions in authoritarian places as diverse as Poland, South Africa and Chile. Not only have opposition radicals with completely implausible plans been emboldened, United States economic sanctions have worsened an economic crisis and migratory exodus and thereby undermined the possibility of opposition street protests. Thus the Venezuela conflict seems destined to be a repeat of the long-term standoff over Cuba that for over 50 years has provided a solid base for South Florida electoral mobilization but has done little for democracy and human rights in Cuba itself. The only way this trajectory could be altered would be through a significant realignment of international forces and policies surrounding Venezuela. The European Union is the only global power that could conceivably challenge the geopolitical confrontation that holds the Venezuela conflict in place. There is little chance that the Trump administration would seek such a change between now and November. By simply carrying on with the current policies toward Venezuela, he will likely secure the crucial Latino vote in Florida. Democrats could begin to formulate an alternative Venezuela policy, however. Rolling back or significantly reformulating economic sanctions could provide relief to the population. Engaging the European Union and countries in the region to impose sanctions multilaterally on Venezuelan government officials could make them more effective. And engaging Russia, China and Cuba in the solution to the Venezuelan conflict could actually be fruitful. Perhaps most important would be a “golden bridge” that could encourage Mr. Maduro to give up power peacefully, as the former Colombian president and Nobel Prize winner Juan Manuel Santos suggested. Nobody in conflict offers their head on a platter. Only a plan that ensures a viable and attractive exit for Chavismo could provide them with a reason to let go.

2020,Trump’s State of the Union Speech Continues a Theme: Courting Black Voters,"President Trump used his annual address as an attempt to gain some ground with black voters, a group that largely believes he is widening a racial divide in the United States. WASHINGTON — As President Trump delivered his State of the Union address on Tuesday, he highlighted several people of color for promotions and giveaways and referred to policies popular with minority voters. It was an aggressive continuation of a strategy that he and his advisers believe should be a central part of his re-election effort: courting African-Americans, even if the odds look stacked against him and polls show that most black voters believe he is making the country’s racial issues worse. The administration welcomed five black guests in the first lady’s box this year, days after Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign aired an ad at the Super Bowl featuring Alice Marie Johnson, a 63-year-old African-American woman who was granted clemency last year. Polls show that Mr. Trump has an uphill battle to win over black voters — a Washington Post/Ipsos poll released last month showed that more than 80 percent of black respondents said they believed Mr. Trump was racist — but he still used his annual address to try to gain some ground. Gesturing to the guests, Mr. Trump highlighted the story of Charles McGee, 100, one of the last surviving Tuskegee Airmen, a squad of African-American pilots in World War II. Mr. Trump said he had pinned stars to promote Mr. McGee to brigadier general earlier on Tuesday in the Oval Office. Mr. Trump also called out Iain Lanphier, 13, Mr. McGee’s great-grandson. In a release, the White House said Iain had graduated from a program sponsored by the Organization of Black Aerospace Professionals. In touting his policies, which he said allowed “wealthy people and companies” to give money to disadvantaged areas, Mr. Trump showcased the story of Tony Rankins from Cincinnati, an Army veteran and former addict who he said was currently at work in an “opportunity zone,” a tax incentive that is intended to encourage investors to pump money into the nation’s poorest neighborhoods. “This is the first time that these deserving communities have seen anything like this,” Mr. Trump said. “It is all working!” As he spoke, Mr. Trump also awarded a so-called opportunity scholarship to Janiyah Davis, the daughter of a single mother who, the president said, “would do anything to give her daughter a better future.” The mention of the scholarships — designed to allow low-income families to send their children to a private school of their choice — was meant to bolster the administration’s efforts to promote school choice, an issue popular with minority voters. Mr. Trump used the opportunity to plug the Education Freedom Scholarships and Opportunity Act. During a speech peppered with theatrics — including directing his wife, Melania Trump, to award the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Rush Limbaugh, the conservative radio talk show host who has advanced lung cancer — Mr. Trump’s overtures to black voters were not subtle. His gestures earned him accolades from his administration members and Republican supporters gathered in the House chamber, but others criticized Mr. Trump’s checklist-style approach as pandering. “This entire #SOTU is a micro-Targeted campaign speech,” Jason Johnson, a politics and journalism professor at Morgan State University, wrote on Twitter. “Handing out gifts for poor black folks. Pitying single black mothers to appeal to white women in the burbs. This is about the base and suppressing the black vote. Dems aren’t paying attention.” Derrick Johnson, the president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, dismissed the proceedings as little more than stagecraft. “As we witness yet another episode of political theater, take a moment to check your voter registration status and encourage your friends and family to vote,” Mr. Johnson said on Twitter. “We have the power to change course and elect officials who are committed to protecting our democracy.” During Mr. Trump’s speech, some, but not all, members of the Congressional Black Caucus stood and applauded as Mr. Trump rattled off his administration’s achievements. Earlier in the day, members of the Democratic group’s leadership said they were not impressed with Mr. Trump’s overtures, including the Super Bowl advertisement. In recent days, the White House and Trump campaign allies have acted bullish on bringing black voters into the fold, including a “$25,000 cash giveaway” held by a nonprofit organization run by one of Mr. Trump’s most prominent African-American supporters. Despite skepticism that these tactics will work to win over voters in the fall, Mr. Trump’s advisers, including his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, have told him that black voters will show their support if they can simply be educated on his policies.

2020,Trump’s Team Celebrates Acquittal at (Where Else?) His Washington Hotel,"Several current and former Trump advisers gathered to mingle and toast the president’s acquittal in the Senate. WASHINGTON — Well, where else were they going to go? One mile from the scene of President Trump’s acquittal in his impeachment trial, members of his defense team, family and administration gathered Wednesday evening at the Trump International Hotel in downtown Washington. They turned its marbled lobby into something of a hive bursting with “Keep America Great” hats, well-done steaks and bottles of red wine. “I think it’s clearly a validation of the fact that the president never committed a crime,” Corey Lewandowski, the president’s former campaign manager, said as he flashed a blue piece of paper from his wallet. It was a Senate gallery ticket; he had watched the vote as it happened. “We’ve had a very good week,” Mr. Lewandowski said, “between the debacle in Iowa” — referring to assorted fumbles that left the Democratic results in the 2020 caucuses in a state of suspended uncertainty — “the State of the Union speech and then the acquittal of the impeachment proceedings.” Everyone else seemed to have gotten the message. Mr. Lewandowski was only one of several current and former Trump advisers who had gathered at the hotel to mingle and drink. On Tuesday, a photograph of an airplane full of Trump campaign surrogates returning from Iowa sailed around the internet. By Wednesday, roughly half them appeared to have passed through the hotel at some point to celebrate the verdict with plenty of booze and slightly bitter undertones. It was a mood that mirrored the one on display by Mr. Trump, who has so far reflected on his victory by hitting back at Democrats on Twitter. While the president stewed at the White House before a speech scheduled for noon on Thursday, his brethren arrived at the family property in slick black sport utility vehicles as the weather hit a drizzle. Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law, arrived early in the evening, ducking into a side room with members of Mr. Trump’s legal defense team, including Pat A. Cipollone and Jay Sekulow. Kellyanne Conway, the president’s counselor, came and went. “They denigrate,” she said. “We celebrate.” Donald Trump Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle, the ever-present campaign road warriors, also made an appearance, as did Hogan Gidley, a White House spokesman. Past a certain hour, the drinks started flowing faster and the lobby turned into a who’s who of fixtures in Mr. Trump’s circle. At one table, Mr. Lewandowski held forth with Eric Bolling, a host for the Sinclair Broadcast Group. Mr. Bolling echoed some supporters by focusing on Senator Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah, whose vote to remove the president from office prevented Mr. Trump from being able to say his acquittal had been cast along purely party lines. “Mitt Romney should be removed from all of his leadership roles and should consider switching parties,” Mr. Bolling declared. When asked if he believed the president would fixate on Mr. Romney’s decision, Mr. Bolling paused. “I hope not,” he said. This is often the best way to describe the atmosphere at even the best pro-Trump bash: celebratory, but with a palpable amount of spite. Sweet and bitter — the Negroni, as it were, of Senate acquittals. The perpetual hint of defiance that permeates a crowd like this was even more on display given that the hotel had been a regular gathering place for many of the figures involved in the impeachment proceedings. It was what Lev Parnas, a Soviet-born businessman who played an integral role in the campaign to pressure Ukraine to investigate Mr. Trump’s political rivals, called “a breeding ground.” This, of course, did little to encourage Republicans to shift their support of the president, or the family business, throughout impeachment or otherwise. The Republican National Committee has paid more than $440,000 to the hotel since Mr. Trump was elected — about 24,400 glasses of the hotel’s house white wine. America First Action, a super PAC that supports Mr. Trump’s causes, has spent $505,000 at the hotel since 2017. As the evening unfolded, the party began to creep out into the open — or at least to the steakhouse adjacent to the lobby. Ms. Guilfoyle and the younger Mr. Trump held court with a merry band of supporters, including Representative Matt Gaetz, Republican of Florida, who has dipped in and out — and is presumably in again — of the Trump fold. Even as he socialized with the president’s family, Mr. Gaetz announced on Twitter that he had filed an ethics complaint against Speaker Nancy Pelosi for tearing up the president’s State of the Union address. “Nobody is above the law,” he wrote. “She must be held accountable.” Against a wall stood Nigel Farage, the former leader of the U.K. Independence Party and one of the so-called Bad Boys of Brexit whose perpetual presence at the hotel suggests he should have a punch card. Around 11 p.m., Mr. Sekulow strode through the lobby to say goodbye, pausing to take pictures with admirers. He had no comment for a reporter on his reaction to the acquittal, but a woman approached him as he left the hotel to provide her own assessment. “You did great,” she said. Just behind her, another woman came outside and sniffed the air. “Ugly night,” she remarked to no one in particular as the celebrants departed. Updated Feb. 29, 2020",The New York Times
2020,Trump’s War Against ‘the Deep State’ Enters a New Stage,"The suggestion that Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman should now face punishment by the Pentagon was one sign of how determined the president is to even the scales after his impeachment. WASHINGTON — As far as President Trump is concerned, banishing Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman from the White House and exiling him back to the Pentagon was not enough. If he had his way, the commander in chief made clear on Tuesday, the Defense Department would now take action against the colonel, too. “That’s going to be up to the military,” Mr. Trump told reporters who asked whether Colonel Vindman should face disciplinary action after testifying in the House hearings that led to the president’s impeachment. “But if you look at what happened,” Mr. Trump added in threatening terms, “I mean they’re going to, certainly, I would imagine, take a look at that.” This is an unsettled time in Mr. Trump’s Washington. In the days since he was acquitted in a Senate trial, an aggrieved and unbound president has sought to even the scales as he sees it. Colonel Vindman was abruptly marched by security out of the White House, an ambassador who also testified in the House hearings was summarily dismissed, and senior Justice Department officials on Tuesday intervened on behalf of Mr. Trump’s convicted friend, Roger J. Stone Jr., leading four career prosecutors to quit the case. More axes are sure to fall. A senior Pentagon official appears in danger of losing her nomination to a top Defense Department post after questioning the president’s suspension of aid to Ukraine. Likewise, a prosecutor involved in Mr. Stone’s case has lost a nomination to a senior Treasury Department position. A key National Security Council official is said by colleagues to face dismissal. And the last of dozens of career officials being transferred out of the White House may be gone by the end of the week. The war between Mr. Trump and what he calls the “deep state” has entered a new, more volatile phase as the president seeks to assert greater control over a government that he is convinced is not sufficiently loyal to him. With no need to worry about Congress now that he has been acquitted of two articles of impeachment, the president has shown a renewed willingness to act even if it prompts fresh complaints about violating traditional norms. “The president is entitled to staffers that want to execute his policies, that he has confidence in,” said Robert C. O’Brien, the national security adviser, who supervised Colonel Vindman and his brother, Yevgeny Vindman, also an Army lieutenant colonel, who was dismissed last week from the National Security Council staff even though he did not testify in the House hearings. “We’re not a banana republic where lieutenant colonels get together and decide what the policy is.” The president’s involvement in Mr. Stone’s case generated vigorous protests and calls for an investigation into whether he improperly sought to skew the prosecution in favor of a longtime associate and adviser. Hours after Mr. Trump’s tweets criticizing the Justice Department for seeking up to nine years in prison for Mr. Stone, the department reversed gears and said it would ask for a lesser sentence. The Justice Department rejected any link to the president’s tweets, while Mr. Trump insisted that he had nothing to do with the case. But the withdrawal of the four career prosecutors working on the case left the unmistakable impression that they thought something improper had happened. “The American people must have confidence that justice in this country is dispensed impartially,” Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, wrote in a letter asking the department’s inspector general to investigate. “That confidence cannot be sustained if the president or his political appointees are permitted to interfere in prosecution and sentencing recommendations in order to protect their friends and associates.” Mr. Trump has repeatedly railed against law enforcement agencies for targeting his associates. Among those who have been convicted are Paul Manafort, his former campaign chairman; Michael T. Flynn, his former national security adviser; and Michael D. Cohen, his personal lawyer. “The real crimes were on the other side, as nothing happens to them,” he wrote on Twitter shortly after midnight Tuesday morning. By the evening, he was demanding to know why the Democratic power broker Tony Podesta had not been prosecuted and expanded his attack to Judge Amy Berman Jackson, who is presiding over Mr. Stone’s case. “Is this the Judge that put Paul Manafort in SOLITARY CONFINEMENT, something that not even mobster Al Capone had to endure?” he wrote on Twitter, providing a false version of her role as well as his treatment. “How did she treat Crooked Hillary Clinton?” Mr. Trump has long suspected that people around him — both government officials and even some of his own political appointees — were secretly working against his interests. His impeachment for trying to coerce Ukraine to incriminate Democrats by withholding $391 million in security aid has only reinforced that view as he watched one official after another testify before the House. Witnesses like Colonel Vindman testified under subpoena compelling them to talk, but Mr. Trump blamed them for his dilemma. In the Oval Office on Tuesday, Mr. Trump complained at length about Colonel Vindman, accusing him of misleading Congress about the president’s July 25 phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart. In fact, Colonel Vindman’s version of the call closely tracked the written record released by the White House, but he did testify that he thought it was inappropriate to ask a foreign country to tarnish the president’s domestic political opponents. “We sent him on his way to a much different location, and the military can handle him any way they want,” Mr. Trump said. “General Milley has him now,” he added, referring to Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. “I congratulate General Milley. He can have him. And his brother, also. We’ll find out. We will find out. But he reported very inaccurate things.” Others involved in the impeachment process may also pay a price. The administration plans to withdraw the nomination for Pentagon comptroller of Elaine McCusker, a Defense Department official who questioned the aid freeze, The New York Post reported. While the Senate has not been notified of such a move, an administration official said it was likely to happen after budget hearings this week. Ms. McCusker could not be reached for comment, and a Pentagon official referred questions to the White House, which had no comment. Senator James M. Inhofe, Republican of Oklahoma and the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, told reporters that he had “a feeling everything is going to be fine with the nomination.” But friends of Ms. McCusker said she was aware that her nomination was in jeopardy. Just Monday, Ms. McCusker was the one left explaining the wielding of another Trump administration ax. Appearing before reporters in her role as the Defense Department’s acting comptroller, she sought to describe why the Pentagon was proposing to eliminate the $7 million subsidy to Stars and Stripes, a newspaper for American troops. “We have essentially, decided that, you know, kind of coming into the modern age, that newspaper is probably not the best way that we communicate any longer,” she told reporters. Another political appointee who may lose a nomination is Jessie K. Liu, who served as United States attorney for the District of Columbia when her office prosecuted Mr. Stone, Mr. Manafort and other high-profile cases. She stepped down in December, when Mr. Trump nominated her to be the under secretary of the Treasury for terrorism and financial crimes. But on Tuesday, the White House withdrew her nomination, a person familiar with the matter said. At the White House, Victoria Coates, a deputy national security adviser, has twisted in the wind amid feverish speculation about whether she would be pushed out. She has been the subject of a whisper campaign suggesting that she is the anonymous author of a book about being a member of the resistance inside the administration — which prompted the literary agents for the actual author to deny the claims. Mr. O’Brien, Ms. Coates’s boss at the National Security Council, rejected the speculation in an appearance on Tuesday at the Atlantic Council. “This town is amazing when it comes to whispers,” he said, adding he did not know who the author was. “I think writing ‘Anonymous’ is inconsistent with working at the White House or working at the N.S.C., so whoever wrote ‘Anonymous’ probably shouldn’t be there.” But Mr. O’Brien is presiding over a broader housecleaning at the National Security Council. Since being appointed last fall, he has said he wants to shrink the staff to closer to what it was under President George W. Bush. At the Atlantic Council appearance, he said he would be finished “by the end of the week” reducing the staff of policy professionals to 115 or 120 from the 175 when he took over. The ousted officials were detailed from elsewhere in the government like the C.I.A., the Pentagon or the State Department and are returning to their home agencies. According to an administration official, the original plan was to use this downsizing as cover to remove Colonel Vindman as well without looking like a reprisal. But in the end, the president did not want cover. He wanted to send a message — a message that Washington has received. Helene Cooper and Michael Crowley contributed reporting.",The New York Times
2020,Opinion | Trump’s Whisper Network,"What happens when the left cedes the free speech high ground? Opinion Columnist Several months after the Harvey Weinstein scandal broke and the #MeToo movement got powerfully underway, Katie Roiphe, writing in the reliably liberal Harper’s Magazine, wrote an essay on what she called “The Other Whisper Network.” It was the sort of piece that took great honesty to write and greater courage to publish. The original “whisper networks” comprised women quietly warning other women about predatory and abusive men in their work and social environments. But as a succession of #MeToo stories unfurled in the media — some of which seemed far more ambiguous and less egregious than the early headline cases — Roiphe noticed something else: Women were afraid publicly to second-guess aspects of a movement they felt had lost a sense of fairness and proportion, largely out of fear of social media’s Jacobin call-out culture. “Can you see why some of us are whispering?” Roiphe asked about this new network. “It is the sense of viciousness lying in wait, of violent hate just waiting to be unfurled, that leads people to keep their opinions to themselves, or to share them only with close friends.” In recent years, these whisper networks have only proliferated from one subject, one institution, one domain, to another. Is sex, biologically speaking, binary? A columnist for The Denver Post thought so and last month lost his job, he claims as a direct result. Should writers of one race or culture be able to create characters and inhabit cultures not their own? One such writer recently had her book tour canceled over safety concerns following criticism of her novel about the plight of Mexican immigrants. You needn’t take one position or another on any of these questions to notice, and object to, the overall trend. Speech is free, except where and when it isn’t. Widely held religious views entail potentially ruinous professional hazards. Broad areas of intellectual inquiry are treated as off limits. Having a “bad opinion” means being a bad person. People who freely share the most intimate details of their sex lives with near-strangers think twice about sharing some of their political views with old friends. And a new version of the Miranda warning seems to apply across all media, social and traditional: Anything you say, or have ever said, in context or out, deliberately or by misspeaking, can and will be held against you. Which brings me to what is perhaps the biggest whisper network of all: the one involving inner flashes of sympathy, frequently tipping into support at the ballot box, for President Trump. Plenty of people are aware of this phenomenon: One recent academic study noted that so-called secret voters supported Trump over Hillary Clinton by a two-to-one (54 percent to 27 percent) margin in 2016. That statistic should be every bit as alarming to Democrats this time around, not least because it suggests that polls may be dramatically underweighting the scale of Trump’s support. Yet beyond the question of why people might want to conceal their voting preferences — reputation management, social harmony, and so on — it’s worth asking whether the very fact that a vote for Trump was supposed to be shameful is also what made it so attractive. After all, forbidden fruit is appealing not because it is fruit, but because it is forbidden. For every voter who pulled the lever for Trump out of sympathy for his views, how many others did so out of disdain for the army of snickering moralists (at the time including me) telling them that a vote for Trump was unpardonable? My hunch: probably enough to make the difference in the states that made the difference. I would also guess that the number has only grown as the censorious left has become more aggressive and promiscuous in its condemnations. No wonder the administration has taken up the banner of free speech: Even a president who called the media the “enemy of the people” has a case to make that his opponents are more hostile to the letter and spirit of the First Amendment than he is. Conventional wisdom about this year’s election is that it will come down to about 300,000 voters across five or six states. That’s probably right. Republicans will organize their campaign around the country’s material prosperity under Trump; Democrats around its moral deterioration. The latter is the trickier argument to make, but it’s been done before, most recently when George W. Bush promised to restore honor and integrity to the White House after eight years of Bill Clinton. How to pull it off this time? By treating Trump voters with respect. By asking why so many of them wound up in his tent to begin with. By acknowledging that not everything that’s said in a hush is shameful, and that not everyone you disagree with is a bigot. By listening, not denouncing; empathizing, not ridiculing; understanding, not dismissing. Whisper networks ought to have no place in the land of the free.

2020,Trustee Who Funds Climate Change Deniers Leaves Natural History Board,"Rebekah Mercer, whose family foundation was a major Trump donor, stepped down from the museum when her term expired in December. Rebekah Mercer, an influential donor to conservative causes — including groups that deny climate science — has quietly stepped down from the American Museum of Natural History, one of the country’s most prominent science museums. The museum, where Ms. Mercer served two three-year terms, said Thursday through a spokeswoman: “Ms. Mercer’s term expired in December 2019 and her position on the board came to an end at that time.” Members may serve up to three consecutive terms; the museum did not say if Ms. Mercer had sought election to a third term. Ms. Mercer did not respond to messages seeking comment. Her presence on the board prompted protests after The New York Times reported in 2017 that the Mercer Family Foundation — which Ms. Mercer operates with her father, the New York investor Robert Mercer — had given nearly $8 million to organizations including those that reject the scientific consensus on climate change. Among these beneficiaries are the Heartland Institute in Illinois and Breitbart News, the influential right-wing website that was run by Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump’s former chief strategist. As one of Mr. Trump’s biggest donors, Ms. Mercer joined his transition team. Her family foundation has also been a generous supporter of the museum, giving a total of $1.4 million to the institution according to its three most recent tax returns. In 2018 more than 200 scientists and other academics who have advocated policy action on climate change called on the museum to remove Ms. Mercer from its board and “end ties to anti-science propagandists and funders of climate science misinformation.” Last week, the advocacy group Revolting Lesbians trumpeted Ms. Mercer’s departure on its Facebook page: “WE DID IT!” the post said. “This is a big deal because we are in a climate emergency, and a scientific institution has no place accepting money from and giving power and legitimacy to a mega-funder of climate science denial.”",The New York Times
2020,Tu vaso desechable de café lucha por sobrevivir,"Una empresa estadounidense que fabrica productos de hule espuma le ha dado una fortuna a una familia de empresarios. Los ambientalistas dicen que sus artículos descartables contaminan el planeta. La primera taza que Dart comercializó. La reacción violenta contra el hule espuma está pasando factura: las ventas han disminuido y la compañía ha ampliado sus ofertas para incluir más productos de papel.Credit...Lyndon French para The New York Times MASON, Míchigan — En cierta medida, la empresa The Dart Container Corp. es una historia de éxito. Esta empresa familiar fue cofundada en Míchigan por un veterano de la Segunda Guerra Mundial que tenía las licenciaturas de Matemáticas, Ingeniería y Metalúrgica, y desarrolló productos que, en gran parte, ayudaron a impulsar la economía moderna. Dart fabrica, por millones, vasos térmicos, estuches, tapas para vasos de café, así como tenedores y cuchillos desechables, es decir, los recipientes de un solo uso que permiten que los estadounidenses coman y beban cuando van en camino. Le da empleo a aproximadamente 15.000 personas en catorce estados de Estados Unidos. Pero ahora muchos de los productos que produce esta empresa de bajo perfil del Medio Oeste estadounidense son señalados por algunos críticos como una peste que contribuye al problema mundial de la contaminación por plásticos. Las ciudades y los estados están prohibiendo cada vez más uno de los productos emblemáticos de Dart: los recipientes para alimentos y bebidas de poliestireno expandido —conocido como unicel, isopor, telgopor, tecnopor y otras variantes en Latinoamérica—, los cuales pueden dañar a los peces y a otros tipos de especies marinas. En diciembre, el gobernador de Nueva York, Andrew Cuomo, propuso que en todo el estado se prohibieran los recipientes de un solo uso hechos de poliestireno expandido, conocido en inglés más comúnmente, y de manera poco precisa, como Styrofoam (la marca registrada de un material que se usa normalmente como aislante). El año pasado, los estados de Maine y Maryland prohibieron los recipientes hechos con espuma de poliestireno y casi 60 países han promulgado prohibiciones similares o están en el proceso de aprobarlas. Algunos funcionarios electos y grupos ambientalistas afirman que es difícil reciclar de manera significativa los recipientes de poliestireno. “Existen pruebas abrumadoras de que este material está dañando a la Tierra de modo importante”, dijo Brooke Lierman, una legisladora de Maryland que apoyó la prohibición en su estado. Pero Dart Container, empresa que ha estado en manos de la familia Dart desde su fundación en la década de 1950, no cederá. Mientras muchas compañías de plásticos trabajan para proteger sus productos mediante cámaras de comercio y campañas de mercadotecnia que animan a la gente, Dart está desafiando la regulación de manera directa y agresiva. Poco tiempo después de que en Maryland votaron por prohibir el unicel, Dart cerró sus dos almacenes de ese estado y despidió a 90 empleados, con lo que envió una señal a otras localidades para que consideraran mejor la aplicación de leyes parecidas. En fechas recientes, San Diego decidió suspender la implementación de su prohibición del poliestireno frente a la demanda de Dart y un grupo de restaurantes que argumentaron que la ciudad debió haber llevado a cabo un estudio detallado del impacto ambiental antes de aprobar esa ley. La ciudad está realizando ese análisis ahora. “No creemos que existan motivos suficientes y objetivos para poner ciertos materiales en la lista negra”, dijo Jim Lammers, director general de Dart, en una entrevista reciente en las oficinas centrales de la empresa. Fue una de las primeras veces que Dart había permitido que un periodista tuviera acceso sin restricciones a las instalaciones de su campus arbolado de Mason, donde hay pistas de atletismo, un jardín dedicado a los empleados y bloques de piedras en las que están inscritas palabras como “Meritocracia”. Dart está realizando una amplia campaña para argumentar que sus productos se están utilizando como chivo expiatorio en una sociedad que se nutre del consumismo “para llevar”. Dart afirma que los detractores del poliestireno ignoran los efectos ambientales negativos de otros productos, como muchos vasos de papel, que se hacen con los árboles y pueden emitir gases de efecto invernadero mientras se degradan en los basureros. De acuerdo con la lógica de Dart, la mayoría de los materiales causan ciertos efectos negativos al ambiente, así que no tiene sentido prohibir uno y no el otro. “Si cedemos así como así con el unicel, ¿qué van a querer hacer luego?”, comentó Michael Westerfield, director de reciclaje de Dart. El ataque contra el unicel ya se está dejando sentir. Las ventas de la espuma de poliestireno han estado disminuyendo, y la empresa ha ido ampliando su oferta para integrar más productos de papel, como las tazas que se venden en Starbucks y Dunkin’. También está haciendo experimentos con envases que pueden convertirse en abono o que se fabrican con material reciclado. En la actualidad, el unicel representa solo una quinta parte de todos los productos que vende Dart. La empresa dice que las ventas generales de recipientes para bebidas y alimentos, las cuales generan 3000 millones de dólares en ingresos anuales, prácticamente no varían. Aun cuando el mercado del poliestireno se reduzca, muchos grupos ambientalistas quieren eliminar el unicel por completo porque si este termina en el basurero, con facilidad se puede descomponer en partes pequeñas y dañar a los peces y a los animales que lo ingieren. En el caso de los humanos —se han encontrado fibras plásticas en todo, desde el agua potable hasta la sal de mesa—, se siguen estudiando las consecuencias a largo plazo. Los académicos y expertos industriales todavía están analizando la mejor forma de cuantificar los efectos a largo plazo que pueden tener en el cambio climático los recipientes de un solo uso hechos de diversos materiales (plástico, papel, vidrio). Sin embargo, según los ambientalistas, el daño que la contaminación por plásticos puede causar en la vida marina es inmediato. “Hasta donde sé, un vaso de papel nunca ha matado a ningún animal marino”, señaló Jan Dell, una ingeniera que trabajaba en la industria de los plásticos y que ahora dirige Last Beach Cleanup, un organismo que se enfoca en combatir la contaminación por plásticos. Las mismas propiedades que pueden hacer que el unicel sea un problema ambiental también hacen rentable su fabricación. Los costos son bajos debido a que el unicel es 95 por ciento aire y puede fabricarse con relativamente poco plástico en bruto. William A. Dart no inventó los vasos de unicel, pero sí se volvió un experto en su producción en masa. Luego de regresar de la Segunda Guerra Mundial y de graduarse de la Universidad de Míchigan, William Dart pasó un año trabajando en la compañía de productos químicos DuPont. A finales de la década de 1950, con cientos de ideas relacionadas con el plástico, regresó a la fábrica de soldadura de su padre en Mason, una ciudad pequeña junto a Lansing. William Dart comenzó a experimentar con la creación de vasos hechos a partir de poliestireno (un material que parecía tener propiedades aislantes casi mágicas), los cuales serían útiles para la industria de la comida rápida que estaba teniendo un crecimiento acelerado. Una de las primeras cuentas importantes de Dart fue la cadena de pollo frito Chick-fil-A. La empresa también vendía plástico a hospitales y escuelas, estadios deportivos y a los gigantes en la industria de los alimentos Sysco y US Foods. La empresa celebra su larga historia de fabricación en Estados Unidos. Mientras muchas otras fábricas se trasladaron a Asia con el objetivo de encontrar mano de obra barata, el unicel no puede importarse del extranjero de manera rentable; de acuerdo con Dart, el costo de importación de recipientes ligeros neutralizaría cualquier ahorro en mano de obra. Lammers señaló que la empresa se sentía frustrada por la reacción cada vez más intensa contra el unicel. “Cómo se empacan los alimentos y las bebidas, al igual que muchas otras cosas en la vida, no es una discusión que se solucione con meras consignas”, comentó Lammers, quien empezó a trabajar en la empresa en 1986. Lammers, abogado de formación, se desplaza por el extenso campus corporativo de Dart en un Honda Accord azul. Acompañó a un periodista a través de un pequeño museo en el vestíbulo donde los productos de plástico desechables están dispuestos como obras de arte. Una pantalla muestra la historia de los contenedores de alimentos. Otro muestra tapas de café a través de los años. Es un santuario para los artículos desechables de la vida cotidiana: tazas de café azules con un diseño griego y esas pequeñas tazas de plástico transparente de los consultorios de los dentistas. Dart los hace todos. La única zona que estaba restringida era el Edificio Número Uno, donde se fabrican los vasos de unicel blancos. La empresa dice que la maquinaria para el unicel, diseñada por William Dart en la década de 1950 y perfeccionada durante décadas, es un secreto tan bien protegido que solo se les permite pasar a esa parte de la fábrica a algunos empleados y clientes selectos. Los herederos de William Dart también son muy reservados. Desde la década de 1980, sus hijos, Robert y Kenneth Dart, han estado en la administración de la empresa en diferentes niveles. Aunque los dos hermanos ya no están involucrados en las operaciones diarias de la compañía, son parte de la junta directiva y brindan asesoramiento sobre “gastos importantes de capital y decisiones estratégicas”, dijo una portavoz de Dart en un comunicado. Un tercer hermano, Thomas, terminó su participación en la compañía en la década de 1980, dijo la empresa. En 2012, Dart adquirió Solo, otra empresa de envases del Medio Oeste, por 1000 millones de dólares. Gracias a este trato, Dart amplió su gama de productos a más recipientes de papel y de plástico rígido, como los vasos rojos que se encuentran por todas partes en las fiestas de los universitarios y en los convivios previos a los partidos de fútbol americano. Sin embargo, incluso al diversificarse, Dart nunca renunció a la espuma de poliestireno. Durante años, la empresa ha hecho hincapié en las maneras en las que se puede reciclar la espuma de poliestireno, exactamente igual que otros tipos de recipientes de plástico. El problema es que la mayor parte de los sistemas de reciclaje municipales no aceptan el unicel porque puede ser difícil encontrar compradores dispuestos a pagar suficiente dinero por el material usado. Así que Dart les ofrece a las ciudades recolectar y transportar sin costo alguno los recipientes de unicel usados. La empresa dice que es posible que, en algún momento, el poliestireno usado pueda convertirse en una producción en masa de vasos nuevos, pero ahora mismo la capacidad de recolección y de procesamiento es limitada. “Nos encantaría llegar a ese punto”, afirmó Westerfield, el director de reciclaje. Algunas comunidades dudan que en algún momento lo hagan. En su niñez en Baltimore, Claire Wayner y su familia solían llevar sus cartones de huevo y envases de unicel a un punto de recolección que financiaba Dart en la ciudad. Los voluntarios de las escuelas locales solían limpiar los restos de macarrones, queso y el líquido que desprenden las hamburguesas de cientos de bandejas de unicel y llevarlas a un punto de reciclaje. Pese a todas estas buenas intenciones, Wayner se preguntaba qué cantidad del poliestireno de la ciudad en verdad se estaba reciclando y se cuestionaba cuán grande era el mercado para el unicel usado además de los productos especializados como los portarretratos. “Parece tan extraño y absurdo”, comenta Wayner, quien ahora es estudiante de segundo año en la Universidad de Princeton. En bachillerato, Wayner y otros estudiantes fundaron Baltimore Beyond Plastic, un grupo que convenció a los funcionarios educativos de que eliminaran las bandejas de unicel para los alimentos de las escuelas públicas de la ciudad. Luego, este grupo de estudiantes, junto con otros ambientalistas, lograron que se prohibieran los recipientes de unicel en toda la ciudad. Tras las votaciones, Dart cerró el punto de reciclado que auspiciaba en Baltimore. Cuando le preguntaron sobre el cierre, la vocera de Dart, Becky Warren, dijo en un comunicado: “Invertimos nuestros recursos de reciclaje en comunidades que apoyan a nuestros clientes y a nuestra empresa”. Para Wayner y otras personas, esta acción demostró que Dart no consideraba el reciclaje de poliestireno como una iniciativa viable, sino como una manera de protegerse de las normas. “Tan pronto como perdieron, fue como si recogieran sus canicas y se fueran a casa”, dijo Martha Ainsworth, dirigente de voluntarios de Sierra Club en Maryland. Los ejecutivos de Dart dicen que muchos de sus clientes también quieren recipientes más sostenibles, pero se enfrentan a las realidades económicas. Dijeron que algunas compañías de alimentos y bebidas quieren envases hechos de más material reciclado y biodegradable, pero no todos están dispuestos a aceptar los costos adicionales. El año pasado, la compañía abrió un laboratorio en Mason, donde químicos con batas de laboratorio y guantes de goma azul se inclinan sobre vasos de precipitado y reactores. En una habitación, los químicos probaron nuevos recubrimientos para tazas de café de papel que no están hechos de plástico. En otra, analizaron muestras de suelo para probar qué tan rápido se descompone una taza biodegradable. No está claro cuánto tiempo pasará antes de que algunos de estos experimentos deriven en productos comercializables, pero Lammers dijo que “están cerca”. “Les garantizo que vamos a ser diferentes dentro de diez años”, dijo.

2020,The Final Scramble Before the Iowa Caucuses,"DES MOINES — Less than 48 hours from now, hundreds of thousands of Iowans will gather in schools and churches and libraries and gymnasiums, from the Mississippi River to the Missouri, and participate in the first nominating contest of the 2020 election. At that point, all the candidates will be able to do is wait: for the verdict and, they hope, for one of those elusive “tickets out of Iowa.” But for now, they are trying to make the most of the few hours in which their Iowa fates are still, sort of, in their hands. And so candidates here held more than 20 events today, under the ever-present shadow of the 2016 primary. After months of ideological sparring, they seemed to have just one thing left to tell caucusgoers: If you want to beat President Trump, you had better pick me.

2020,Turkey Launches Deadly Airstrikes Against Syrian Forces,"President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said that as many as 35 Syrian government troops had been killed, and he warned Russia against trying to prevent his country’s actions. ISTANBUL — Turkey deployed F-16 fighter jets against government forces in northwestern Syria on Monday, a sharp escalation of the conflict there after six Turkish soldiers were killed by artillery strikes. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey said that as many as 35 Syrian troops had been “neutralized.” The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitoring group based in Britain, said the number of military personnel killed was at least 13, while state news media in Syria made no mention of any deaths. There were also reports on social media of at least eight civilian deaths when a minibus was struck. Mr. Erdogan warned Russia, which backs the Syrian government and which controls the airspace in western Syria, not to prevent Turkey from retaliating. “It should be out of discussion to block us,” Mr. Erdogan said, before leaving for a trip to Ukraine. Describing the dead Turkish soldiers as martyrs, he added that, “It is not possible for us to keep silent” as long as his country’s troops were being targeted. Mr. Erdogan has frequently met with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to discuss Syria, and in particular, the thorny problem of Idlib Province, which Moscow wants to bring under Syrian government control to declare victory in the war. In a sign of the fragility of the relationship and of the high stakes, Mr. Erdogan adopted a sober demeanor as he announced the Turkish casualties, despite a dispute with Russia over whether the Turkish military’s moves had been coordinated with their Russian counterparts. Turkish reporters noted that Mr. Erdogan’s understated tone and remarks were free of the vitriolic rhetoric he often uses for opponents. Syrian government forces have recently intensified their offensive in Idlib, in western Syria, the last rebel-held province. Turkey deployed several hundred troops to observation posts there in 2018, as part of an agreement with Russia to create a de-escalation zone in the area. But Russian and Syrian forces have been conducting an offensive on the major highway through the province, prompting hundreds of thousands of civilians to flee north toward the border with Turkey. Turkey has already taken in nearly four million people trying to escape the war, which started nearly nine years ago, and is concerned that the Syrian push into the area will create a fresh surge of refugees. It has closed its border with Syria to prevent more refugees from entering. Nearly 700,000 people have been displaced since the Russian-led offensive began in Idlib last year — 140,000 in January alone. Many are camping in the open in increasingly desperate conditions. The deployment of air power came after the Turkish Defense Ministry said that a supply convoy bringing reinforcements into the observation posts on Monday had come under fire, leaving six Turkish soldiers dead and several others wounded. The movement of the convoy had been coordinated beforehand, the statement said, and Turkish forces retaliated immediately. “Those who test Turkey’s determination with such heinous attacks will understand they have made a huge mistake,’’ Mr. Erdogan said. Moscow, however, disputed Turkey’s account about coordinating with other forces in the province, saying that the Russian Defense Ministry had not been told about the troop movements. Syrian forces were trying to hit militants linked with Al Qaeda, the Russian Defense Ministry said, according to The Associated Press, and the Turkish forces were struck because they were in the area. (To justify their attacks, including ones that have killed many civilians, Russia and the Syrian government have consistently argued they must go on the offensive to eradicate terrorists.) Turkey has always supported the opposition forces fighting against the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad, including some radical Islamists, and has sought to delay the Russian-Syrian advance to take Idlib. Mr. Erdogan has highlighted his good relationship with Mr. Putin and attempted to strengthen ties by purchasing the Russian S-400 missile defense system against the wishes of the United States and other NATO allies. But those links do not appear to have won him any lasting concessions from Moscow over Idlib. The Turkish Defense Ministry said that it was maintaining suppressive fire on Syrian targets for self-defense to evacuate the dead and wounded. “The perpetrators of this hateful attack will be brought to account and our right to self-defense will be exercised in the most robust way,” the ministry said. The suffering continued for the civilians caught in the fighting. At least eight people, most of them women and children, were said to have been killed on Monday when their minibus came under fire on a rural road. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said that nine people had died in that attack, including four children. Ahmad Aslan, who fled with his family from the town of Maaret al-Numan, said in a video message that he would have preferred death to abandoning his home. “We prayed many times to die from rockets or from barrel bombs there but it didn’t happen,” he said. “After the regime advanced, we were forced to leave,” he added. “We have been living under the rain and cold, we lack shelter and food.” Video distributed on social media showed people setting fire to their homes before fleeing the town of Saraqeb, ahead of the advancing Syrian forces. “We don’t want to leave anything behind for the thugs,” a voice in the background says. Abdul Kareem Thalji, from Iss, a few miles from Saraqeb, said, “The regime is advancing and I’m racing with time to find a car and house to stay in.” He added that he was being displaced for the seventh time. “If you ask me about hope, I will tell you my entire ambition for life has collapsed, people here have lost hope.” Hwaida Saad and Vivian Yee contributed reporting from Beirut, Lebanon.",The New York Times
2020,"Turkey, Pressing E.U. for Help in Syria, Threatens to Open Borders to Refugees","Turkish news outlets showed live broadcasts of migrants traveling to the border with Greece, hinting at a revival of the 2015 crisis that shook Europe. ATHENS — Time and again, when President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey wants something from the Europeans, he has reminded them that he is the gatekeeper to tens of thousands of refugees he could send their way. Friday was much the same, as Turkey demanded help from NATO after a deadly clash in Syria. But this time, Mr. Erdogan not only threatened to let refugees enter Greece. Local officials bought several thousands of them tickets, helped them onto shiny Mercedes-Benz buses and drove them to the border. The mini-exodus was accompanied step by step by state-run Turkish media, which live-streamed scenes of harried families pushing off shore for Greek islands in scenes reminiscent of the 2015 migrant crisis that Europe was able to solve only with Turkish help. The echoes of that crisis were no doubt deliberate on the part of Mr. Erdogan, who knew he could count on the desperation of refugees eager to make their way to Europe to make his point. Friday’s events were widely seen as his attempt to weaponize both the desperation of migrants and the xenophobia of Europe.It was the ninth time, in fact, that the Turkish president has promised to send a new surge of refugees Europe’s way. Whether Mr. Erdogan was merely dangling the threat again, or will unleash a full-blown crisis remains to be seen. If Turkey’s leader does mean business, he will open not only the border to Greece but also the border with Syria, where he has blocked several hundred thousand would-be refugees as fighting has intensified in the area of Idlib. “He’s trying to say, ‘What happens in Idlib doesn’t stay in Idlib,’” said Aaron Stein, a Turkey expert at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, an American think tank. “‘You Europeans have been free riding on our backs for years now, and as the situation grows more serious, our problem is now your problem.’” “I think this is mostly for show,’’ Mr. Stein added, ‘‘but I don’t know when the show ends.” Turkish actions throughout Friday suggested that Mr. Erdogan’s latest threat could be his most credible. All day, his government shuttled hundreds of migrants from the center of Istanbul to the Turkish land border with Greece — for free. Overnight, migrants were told to gather outside the headquarters of Istanbul’s migration authority, down the road from the city’s main police station. In broad daylight, officials then helped herd more than 600 migrants onto at least 12 buses sent to the Turkish-Greek land border, some 150 miles to the northwest. The coaches were provided by local municipalities, according to three coach drivers who spoke on condition of anonymity. Police officers battled to keep order as migrants laden with snacks, backpacks, strollers, suitcases and diapers jostled for space on the coaches. As many as 3,000 more migrants were sent from other towns and cities in the country, a refugee at the border estimated. Internal legal restrictions on migrants’ movements seemed to have been temporarily rescinded, as taxi drivers and private car owners were allowed to drive Syrians and other foreigners directly to the border, in full view of the police. The display was an act of facilitation not seen even during the 2015-16 crisis, when Turkey turned a blind eye to the movement of refugees without ever physically organizing it. The brazenness of the operation spoke of Mr. Erdogan’s desperation and diplomatic isolation as Turkish forces have become ever more embroiled in the Syrian war. In recent years, Turkish troops have created an informal protectorate in parts of northern Syria, sheltering Syrian rebels and displaced civilians from the Syrian government and the. government’s Russian allies. But that strategy collapsed in recent weeks, as the Syrian government, backed by Russian air power, retook vast tracts of land, increasingly drawing Turkish troops into the conflict. This growing threat suddenly morphed into a full-blown crisis on Thursday night, when dozens of Turkish troops were killed in an airstrike — prompting Mr. Erdogan to demand help from his NATO allies in North America and Europe. Against that backdrop, Mr. Erdogan’s government began ferrying migrants to the border on Friday, seemingly in an attempt to cajole European politicians into giving him more support. Mr. Erdogan believes the West should give his military more air support in Syria, and his civil ministries more aid inside Turkey, where his government looks after more than 3 million Syrian refugees — more than any other country. To underscore Mr. Erdogan’s threat, the state-run news agency, Anadolu, released a steady drip of footage of migrants approaching the Greek land border. Similarly, a private Turkish channel — which appeared to have coordinated its movements with the Turkish authorities — filmed a group of Afghans departing by boat to a Greek island farther to the south. “We are not in a position anymore to hold the refugees,” Omer Celik, a spokesman for Mr. Erdogan’s party, said early Friday. The sequence of events all but unravels a pact made in March 2016 between Turkey and the European Union, which prompted Mr. Erdogan to successfully end most migrant smuggling between Turkey and Greece. In exchange, the European Union promised to give Turkey funding worth 6.6 billion euros ($7.2 billion) to help refugees in Turkey. The deal also allows Greece to return the Syrians to Turkey from the Greek islands, though in practice, the Greek government has not made much use of the provision. When it comes to a new surge of refugees to Europe, though, there is little doubt that Mr. Erdogan still holds the keys. Migration between Turkey and Greece has fallen by more than 90 percent since its peak in 2015 largely because of restrictions enforced by Mr. Erdogan’s government. And Mr. Erdogan’s maneuvers on Friday felt more like a media stunt than a realistic attempt to spark a mass movement comparable in scale to that witnessed at the peak of the crisis in 2015, when 10,000 people a day landed in Greece. On Friday, fewer than 130 people landed on the Greek islands, according to the United Nations refugee agency, while those ferried to the Greek land border were unable to cross the fortifications there. Significantly, in addition to showing no sign of opening its southern border with Syria, Turkey has also not rescinded visa restrictions for Syrians living in Lebanon and Jordan. (A large proportion of the refugee influx to Europe in 2015 were Syrians who had come directly from Syria — or who had traveled by plane into Turkey from elsewhere in the Middle East.) Even if migrants and refugees manage to arrive in Greece and Bulgaria, the repeat of a situation similar to the one in 2015 is highly unlikely. Not only have those two neighboring countries shut their borders to prevent further movements, but the European Union has also invested heavily in keeping people in those countries, preventing them from traveling north. At the Greek border, some migrants ultimately found themselves trapped in no-man’s land, tear-gassed by Greek border guards. By nightfall several hundred of them were instead forlornly trying to cross a river that divides the two countries, but had only a total of three rubber dinghies. “If there is anybody who can help us, please tell them,” said Somar al-Hussein, a 23-year-old Syrian Kurd marooned on a river bank near the Turkish town of Enez. “We have a problem here. We don’t know how to get to Greece.” Mr. al-Hussein has only one hand, so had not even contemplated swimming across the river. Did he feel used by the Turkish government? “Maybe,” he said by telephone. “But I need a hospital for my eyes — and no one here can help me.” Matina Stevis-Gridneff reported from Athens and Brussels, and Patrick Kingsley from Jerusalem.",The New York Times
2020,"Turkey, Pressing E.U. for Help in Syria, Threatens to Open Borders to Refugees","Turkish news outlets showed live broadcasts of migrants traveling to the border with Greece, hinting at a revival of the 2015 crisis that shook Europe. ATHENS — Time and again, when President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey wants something from the Europeans, he has reminded them that he is the gatekeeper to tens of thousands of refugees he could send their way. Friday was much the same, as Turkey demanded help from NATO after a deadly clash in Syria. But this time, Mr. Erdogan not only threatened to let refugees enter Greece. Local officials bought several thousands of them tickets, helped them onto shiny Mercedes-Benz buses and drove them to the border. The mini-exodus was accompanied step by step by state-run Turkish media, which live-streamed scenes of harried families pushing off shore for Greek islands in scenes reminiscent of the 2015 migrant crisis that Europe was able to solve only with Turkish help. The echoes of that crisis were no doubt deliberate on the part of Mr. Erdogan, who knew he could count on the desperation of refugees eager to make their way to Europe to make his point. Friday’s events were widely seen as his attempt to weaponize both the desperation of migrants and the xenophobia of Europe.It was the ninth time, in fact, that the Turkish president has promised to send a new surge of refugees Europe’s way. Whether Mr. Erdogan was merely dangling the threat again, or will unleash a full-blown crisis remains to be seen. If Turkey’s leader does mean business, he will open not only the border to Greece but also the border with Syria, where he has blocked several hundred thousand would-be refugees as fighting has intensified in the area of Idlib. “He’s trying to say, ‘What happens in Idlib doesn’t stay in Idlib,’” said Aaron Stein, a Turkey expert at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, an American think tank. “‘You Europeans have been free riding on our backs for years now, and as the situation grows more serious, our problem is now your problem.’” “I think this is mostly for show,’’ Mr. Stein added, ‘‘but I don’t know when the show ends.” Turkish actions throughout Friday suggested that Mr. Erdogan’s latest threat could be his most credible. All day, his government shuttled hundreds of migrants from the center of Istanbul to the Turkish land border with Greece — for free. Overnight, migrants were told to gather outside the headquarters of Istanbul’s migration authority, down the road from the city’s main police station. In broad daylight, officials then helped herd more than 600 migrants onto at least 12 buses sent to the Turkish-Greek land border, some 150 miles to the northwest. The coaches were provided by local municipalities, according to three coach drivers who spoke on condition of anonymity. Police officers battled to keep order as migrants laden with snacks, backpacks, strollers, suitcases and diapers jostled for space on the coaches. As many as 3,000 more migrants were sent from other towns and cities in the country, a refugee at the border estimated. Internal legal restrictions on migrants’ movements seemed to have been temporarily rescinded, as taxi drivers and private car owners were allowed to drive Syrians and other foreigners directly to the border, in full view of the police.

2020,Saturday in New Hampshire: Democrats Start Unloading on One Another,"MANCHESTER — Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders spoke back to back to New Hampshire Democrats at a party dinner tonight, grounding their appeals in two very different themes — both of which have a history of success here. Ms. Warren, speaking first, embraced the role of the underdog. Having come in a distant third in Iowa to Mr. Sanders and former Mayor Pete Buttigieg, and with polls indicating she could face the same fate in New Hampshire, she boasted: “I’ve been winning unwinnable fights pretty much all my life.” Ms. Warren recalled how she confronted executives from her perch in Congress. “Yes, I’m looking at you, C.E.O. of Wells Fargo who got fired,” she said, before invoking her 2012 Senate triumph: “Bye-bye, Scott Brown.” The message was hard to miss: I’ve been counted out before and overcame the odds. If Ms. Warren’s pitch recalled the turnaround of Hillary Clinton, who in 2008 won New Hampshire after being trounced in Iowa, Mr. Sanders evoked memories of past Iowa winners who came into this state with a head of steam, such as John Kerry in 2004. His supporters erupted when he recalled his 6,000-vote margin in the raw vote in Iowa and roared again when Mr. Sanders said he was “confident we’re going to win here in New Hampshire, as well.” The message was hard to miss: Keep up the momentum and they can’t stop us.",The New York Times
2020,Opinion | Twitter Is Real Life,"Elites just pretend it’s not. Mr. Warzel is an Opinion writer at large. For the better part of a year I’ve been hearing the same refrain. Friends, colleagues, peers and respected pollsters have cautioned: Twitter is not real life. What they’re trying to say is that the political opinions expressed on Twitter don’t usually match the opinions of people in America at large, both in intensity and proportion. Most often it feels like a warning from members of the Extremely Online media to itself. The 2016 election — specifically, the notion that the press and political establishment never thought Donald Trump could win — is the unspoken undertone. We’re aware we live in a bubble. The country is big and nuanced. We won’t get fooled again. I disagree with this. In one reading, the “Twitter isn’t real life” mantra is perhaps a laudable attempt at self-reflection by the media and the political elite. There’s also a separate, less charitable reading of the phrase as it’s deployed by the pundit class — as a clever bit of misdirection intended to make elites seem in touch while they protect their power. The phrase gained traction last spring, aided in part by a Times analysis of polling that suggested a silent (on Twitter) and moderate majority of Democrats. “The outspoken group of Democratic-leaning voters on social media is outnumbered, roughly 2 to 1, by the more moderate, more diverse and less educated group of Democrats who typically don’t post political content online,” the piece concluded from the data. A few weeks later my colleague Michelle Goldberg smartly observed a similar, very real disconnect. “When it comes to Democratic politics, Twitter is proving a lot less influential,” she wrote. The best example of the phenomenon was former Vice President Joe Biden, who up until Iowa was the Democratic front-runner. “Spending too much time on the platform can be actively misleading about the state of the party, as you can see in the polling surge of Joe Biden, a man despised by the online left.” But “Twitter is not real life” has stuck around even as Mr. Biden has begun to flail. Last fall New York magazine’s Jonathan Chait lamented progressive Twitter’s distaste for center-left candidates. This January an article in The Atlantic claimed that Britain’s own elections had been distorted by a “Twitter Primary.” The “Twitter is not real life” people have a few solid arguments in their favor. As the Times analysis shows, the politically hyper-engaged and more radical tend to share opinions on Twitter. Similarly, Pew Research polling from last year showed that those on Twitter are “younger and more likely to be Democrats than the general public. Most users rarely tweet, but the most prolific 10% create 80% of tweets from adult U.S. users.” Still, the notion that Twitter isn’t real life is untrue. There’s the obvious literal sense. Twitter is a real-world platform and is used by very real humans. Then there’s the notion of tangible impact. Donald Trump’s use of the platform for campaigning and governing and acting as assignment editor to the media is the sterling example, but it goes well beyond that. Ask a journalist who has been fired for an old, dredged-up tweet or a woman or person of color who has been doxxed, swatted or harassed and driven from his or her home if Twitter is real life. They’ll say yes. There’s also something ineffable about Twitter’s influence, especially as it pertains to politics, around movement building and fandoms. Honest, sustained social media momentum behind candidates does seem to translate into something, even if it’s not clear how much to trust it. Take Andrew Yang. Though his campaign sputtered out last week, he outlasted multiple high-profile governors and senators. His staying power was linked in part to a movement he built across platforms like Twitter. Establishment pundits and politicos shocked by his longevity might have felt different had they engaged with or even observed #YangGang faithful on Twitter. A better example might be Senator Bernie Sanders, arguably now the Democratic front-runner. The Sanders movement has been criticized for its intensity on Twitter, which infrequently but occasionally veers into toxic territory. And while analysts dissect the particulars of the Sanders online movement, what’s unquestionable is that it exists and is a stand-in for something very real: enthusiasm. As we’ve seen so far in the Democratic primary, enthusiasm matters. The gap between hypothetical polling, months out before the first primary contests and the genuine, fandom-like enthusiasm that might motivate voters to caucus, canvas or brave the cold to cast their ballots can collapse quickly. Indeed, as New York magazine’s Eric Levitz pointed out last year, while Twitter may not be real life, neither is what shapes most electoral politics. “Major parties’ governing agendas aren’t set by their rank-and-file voters in popular referenda,” he wrote. “Rather, each party’s priorities are shaped primarily by its political elites — which is to say, by its most influential elected officials, activists, donors, policy intellectuals, and interest-group leaders. Such partisan elites have never been representative of their ‘normie’ allies.” Vox’s Ezra Klein recently put it similarly. “Political elites have an outsized effect on what actually happens in politics, and they’re constantly on Twitter,” he said. “And they (we!) create a politics that looks more like Twitter even if that’s not what the country wants.” One way to read my “Twitter is real life” argument, then, is that elites’ opinions aren’t in step with America, but it doesn’t matter because they’re more influential. That Twitter is dominated by political and media elites who have outsize power and that the narratives they write 280 characters at a time dictate our political reality. There’s a slice of that argument that’s true. The conversation that takes place on Twitter often programs the media; that commandeering of broad voter attention sets political agendas and grants certain candidates outsize power. But the effect on elites is not more influence. Thanks to places like Twitter, I’d argue that the elites’ power to create political narratives and champion specific political movements has waned. Politicians who build organic online movements and flood the zone with content that’s both proactive and reactive don’t need to woo the media’s or politicos’ attention; they command it at will. Donald Trump and the pro-Trump media have used this to their advantage, while left-leaning politicians like Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez use a similar attention-commandeering tactics (although to different ends). Mike Bloomberg — a candidate who has yet to appear on the ballot in early primaries — is largely using Twitter to appear like a top-tier contender for the Democratic nomination. Take the primary process, which is fueled some by polling, but also by a great deal of punditry. “If you were honest about it, you’d admit that the media itself drove much of this process,” BuzzFeed News’s Ben Smith wrote about the early part of this election cycle. But, as Mr. Smith notes, that process didn’t stick in 2016. “Trump’s supporters weren’t taking their cues from analysts, or taking much interest in the traditional vetting from the mainstream media. The more I looked through the “Twitter is not real life” conversation over the past year, the more it became clear that the refrain emanated most frequently from those whose influential status is at risk. Each “Twitter is not real life” piece seemed to perform extremely well on (uh) Twitter, especially among a kind of centrist political and media elite who bristled at the extreme opinions of far-right and far-left leaning Twitter folk. “This,” former Senator Claire McCaskill tweeted with a link to the original Times piece, signaling her approval of its analysis. Ms. McCaskill, a moderate Democrat, recently said on MSNBC that “America is, generally, not as far along the left line as Bernie and Elizabeth [Warren]” despite Senator Sanders’s current front-runner status. The official Twitter account of “Morning Joe” (a favorite show of Beltway elites that frequently tacks to the center) also posted the piece, as did scores of legacy political journalists, usually with the some disclaimer suggesting, this might be hard to read but it’s worth it. The longtime Washington pollster Frank Luntz tweeted the piece numerous times throughout the spring and summer, including before the first set of Democratic debates in June. “One thing to keep in mind as you see Internet pundits live-scoring Tonight’s #DemDebate: Twitter is not real life,” Mr. Luntz wrote. Even Pete Buttigieg — currently the leader of the moderate wing of the Democratic candidates — has lamented he “just might get canceled” on Twitter. “The one thing I am learning is just how much daylight there is between what has currency on social media and what I’m getting asked about when I’m on the ground,” he said in an interview with the Times editorial board. “I would not be surprised if it continues to be the case that doing what I view to be the right thing as president is not just politically costly in general but may cost me the hearts and minds of those who are disproportionately represented online.” Interestingly enough, both the Pete Buttigieg for MA and San Francisco for Pete Buttigieg Twitter accounts tweeted the Times’s analysis piece on Twitter opinion not lining up with broader American political sentiment. The cries of “Twitter is not real life” become a filter bubble of their own: A way to assuage those who traditionally had great influence over creating political narratives (and who rarely had to compete with dissenting voices) that they are still in touch with the body politic. And that those loud, unfamiliar voices causing all that ruckus aren’t representative of a broader, truer lived experience. It’s possible, of course, that many things are true at once. As they did about radio or television before Twitter, critics and evangelists opine about new forums for public discourse as either deeply corrosive or utopian. Twitter’s aspirations as the global town square are utopian, while the day-to-day experience of politics on the platform veer quickly toward corrosion. What’s impossible to ignore, though, is the entrance and elevation of millions of new voices into the daily political conversation. It’s not perfect. But the end product of those new voices — coalescing communities and sustained enthusiasm — is very real. For politics, Twitter is a living nightmare. It’s overly simplistic, and too prone to flattened discourse and protracted, useless fights. It’s full of in-jokes and cliques and factions and a small number of people who are too loud and too rude. It’s messy as hell with glaring problems that don’t have a whole lot of good fixes. Sounds a lot like real life. The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

2020,Twitter Moves to Target Fake Videos and Photos,"While stopping short of an outright ban, the social media company plans to label or take down material that appears to have been digitally manipulated. Twitter, bowing to pressure from its users, said on Tuesday that it would more aggressively scrutinize fake or altered photos and videos. Starting in March, the company said, it will add labels or take down tweets carrying manipulated images and videos. The move, while short of an outright ban, was announced one day after YouTube also said it planned to remove misleading election-related content on its site. Twitter’s new policy highlights a balancing act — between allowing parody and removing disinformation — that social media companies face as they try to more aggressively police the content posted to their platforms. To determine whether a tweet should be removed or labeled, Twitter said in a blog post, it will apply several tests: Is the media included with a tweet significantly altered or fabricated to mislead? Is it shared in a deceptive manner? In those cases, the tweet will probably get a label. But if a tweet is “likely to impact public safety or cause serious harm,” it will be taken down. Twitter said it might also show a warning to people before they engaged with a tweet carrying manipulated content, or limit that tweet’s reach. “Our approach does not focus on the specific technologies used to manipulate or fabricate media,” said Yoel Roth, Twitter’s head of site integrity. “Whether you’re using advanced machine learning tools or just slowing down a video using a 99-cent app on your phone, our focus under this policy is to look at the outcome, not how it was achieved.” The company developed its rules after surveying more than 6,500 users, civil groups and academics, said Del Harvey, Twitter’s vice president for trust and safety. They found that about 70 percent of surveyed Twitter users believed it was unacceptable for the company to take no action against manipulated content. More than 90 percent said such content should be removed or placed behind a warning label saying the video or image had been altered. “Things that distort or distract from what’s happening threaten the integrity of information on Twitter,” Ms. Harvey said. Like other social networks that have tried to crack down on bogus content, Twitter will be under pressure to consistently apply its new rules. Samantha Bradshaw, a researcher at the Oxford Internet Institute, said that defining harm was not always clear, especially in the context of social media. “And it would be difficult to automate these responses on a global scale,” she said. Last year, an altered video of Speaker Nancy Pelosi that made it appear that she was slurring her words spread across the internet. Another heavily edited clip of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. falsely made it seem as though he had made racist remarks. Mr. Roth said the manipulated videos of Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Biden would get a label under Twitter’s new policy. Depending on what a tweet sharing the video said and if it caused harm, Mr. Roth said, Twitter could take the tweet down. Last year, Twitter said it would add warning labels to hide messages from major political figures who broke the company’s rules for harassment or abuse. Normally, those tweets would be taken down, but the company argued that they would be newsworthy enough to remain on the platform. As of Tuesday, Twitter had not yet used the labels. In January, Facebook banned “deepfake” videos from its platform. But the company said the videos of Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Biden would not be removed under the policy because they had been edited with video editing software, not artificial intelligence. YouTube banned misleading political content on Monday as part of a new policy ahead of the presidential election in November.",The New York Times

2020,Highlights From the Nevada Caucuses: Bernie Sanders Is Declared the Winner,"Officials with the Nevada Democratic Party and the Democratic National Committee stressed all week that they had gone to school on lessons learned from the bungled Iowa caucuses, when a smartphone app for reporting results crashed and phone lines to report results were jammed for hours. But by 11:00 p.m. Eastern time — more than seven hours after Nevada’s caucuses began, and four hours after most of them closed — Nevada Democrats still have only reported results from about 23 percent of the state’s precincts. The tardiness stems from new caucus rules mandated by the D.N.C. that require the state party to collect more than 100 data points from each of Nevada’s 2,097 precincts. The state party also installed a duplicative reporting system to try to prevent Iowa-style mishaps that led to a litany of mathematical errors that had to be corrected later. Nevada’s protracted vote-counting served to rob several Democratic candidates who had hoped to claim a second-place finish on Saturday night and position themselves as the moderate alternative to Bernie Sanders, who won what appears to be a commanding victory in Nevada.",The New York Times
2020,Two American Soldiers Killed in Shootout With Afghan Forces,"Six American service members were wounded, a spokesman for the U.S. military said. He said a person in an Afghan uniform appeared to have opened fire. KABUL, Afghanistan — A shootout between Afghan and American soldiers during joint operations in eastern Afghanistan on Saturday resulted in deaths on both sides, with two Americans killed, officials said. A spokesman for the United States military in Afghanistan, Col. Sonny Leggett, said current reports indicated that “an individual in an Afghan uniform opened fire on the combined U.S. and Afghan force with a machine gun.” Six other American service members were wounded, Colonel Leggett said in a statement early Sunday. He said an investigation was underway and that the motive for the attack was unclear. The two soldiers killed, part of the Seventh Special Forces Group, were Staff Sgt. Javier J. Gutierrez, 28, of San Antonio and Staff Sgt. Antonio R. Rodriguez, 28, of Las Cruces, N.M., according to a Pentagon statement released Sunday. Other details of the incident in Nangarhar Province, where American Special Forces were helping Afghan commandos and the Afghan Army clear an area threatened by the Taliban, were scarce. It was not clear whether the firefight was the work of Taliban infiltrators, a major concern in the past. Afghanistan’s Defense Ministry said in a statement on Sunday that one Afghan soldier was also killed and three others wounded when “a man wearing military uniform” opened fire. The ministry said the country’s army chief, Gen. Bismillah Waziri, had traveled to Nangarhar to investigate the shooting. Earlier, three Afghan officials had said that two to six Afghan soldiers were also killed. In the first hours after the firefight, those officials said that five or six Americans were killed, and a United States military official said there were at least six American casualties, without specifying how many of those were fatalities. “Afghan commandos and U.S. forces were visiting an Afghan army base for an operation. After initial greetings, one of the commandos opened fire with a machine gun,” said Ajmal Omar, deputy head of the Nangarhar provincial council. “There was fear of a second shooter also, so they disarmed everyone at night.” Both the Taliban as well as the Islamic State branch in Afghanistan have had a foothold in Nangarhar Province. In Sherzad district, where the shootout took place, the joint operation had pushed the Taliban from around the main highway and was continuing to clear villages. Insider attacks by Afghan forces on Americans, known as “green on blue,” were so frequent during one stage of the war that American commanders feared the resulting mistrust could derail their mission. In recent years, the number of such attacks has fallen as the American presence has declined and the United States has taken more of a supporting role, with Afghan forces leading the fight. Nonetheless, Gen. Austin S. Miller, the top American and NATO commander in the country, barely survived a shooting by a Taliban infiltrator in an Afghan military uniform last year. A top Afghan general walking next to him was killed. The shooting comes in a delicate time in the war, as American negotiators have been locked in weeks of talks with the Taliban to finalize a peace deal. If a Taliban hand is seen in the shooting, it is sure to complicate those talks, which officials and diplomats suggested on Saturday had reached a promising stage. Last September, President Trump called off talks with the Taliban, citing a car-bombing in Kabul that had killed an American soldier as well nearly a dozen Afghans. It took months of trust building, including a prisoner swap, to get the two sides to return to the negotiating table in the hopes of finalizing a deal that could end America’s longest war. If an Afghan soldier led the attack on American forces, that could jeopardize the already strained diplomacy between Washington and Kabul. Mr. Trump has long wanted to end the United States military role in the 19-year war in Afghanistan, including withdrawing forces faster than some of his commanders recommend. The attack on Saturday could provide a new reason for him to do so. Zabihullah Ghazi contributed reporting from Nangarhar Province, and Thomas Gibbons-Neff from Washington.

2020,Two Days With the Designer Behind Kenzo’s New Era,"48 Hours Ahead of his debut show as the brand’s creative director, Felipe Oliveira Baptista looked to the house’s past to inspire its next chapter. It was the first morning of Paris fashion week and the mood was uneasy: In Milan the day before, Giorgio Armani had opted to live-stream his show from an empty auditorium rather than risk the safety of his invitees after an outbreak of coronavirus in the surrounding Lombardy region. Many Italian editors and buyers had decided to forgo Paris altogether. Nonetheless, the buzz around the Portuguese designer Felipe Oliveira Baptista’s debut at Kenzo persisted — and offered a welcomed distraction. Oliveira Baptista, 45, who hit his stride during his previous post, an eight-year tenure as the creative director at Lacoste, took over as the creative director of the 50-year-old house from Carol Lim and Humberto Leon, the U.S. retailers behind Opening Ceremony, who had shared the position since 2011. If Lim and Leon reinvigorated the brand with streetwear-inflected pieces and a youthful pop sensibility, Oliveira Baptista promised something more finessed. Despite the anxiety that suffused the surrounding city, Oliveira Baptista seemed calm two days before he would present his first collection. He arrived at his favorite corner brasserie near the Kenzo atelier on Rue Vivienne on his bike, dressed in a black overcoat and wool beanie, and ordered his morning espresso as usual. Not only had he been preparing for this debut for over a year — he began talks with LVMH, Kenzo’s parent company, six months before his official appointment last July — but he felt a clear sense of purpose, informed by the legacy of the brand’s founder, Kenzo Takada. “My vision for the brand is very much rooted in what Kenzo did and stood for — values that are still very relevant today,” he said, taking a sip of his coffee. “His designs were all about freedom of movement. While they were flamboyant, they were also very pragmatic.” But Oliveira Baptista wants to interpret this all in his own way. His first move upon his appointment was to reimagine the brand’s logo. With the help of the Paris-based creative agency M/M, he landed on a thicker, bolder font with deconstructed lettering and removed any mention of Paris from the design. “Kenzo has always been universal,” he explained, adding that he will soon revisit the brand’s tiger logo. As a young fashion designer in the mid-1960s, Takada moved from Japan to Paris, traveling by boat with stopovers in Hong Kong, Mumbai and Saigon. It was this voyage, in part, that inspired the nomadic spirit at the heart of the eponymous ready-to-wear house he founded in 1970. A mishmash of cultural influences, from Eastern European folk dresses to kimonos with graphic prints, Takada’s clothes, which he designed until retiring in 1999, were celebrated for their eclectic and uplifting aesthetic, alive with color and print. Oliveira Baptista wholeheartedly embraced these itinerant roots for his debut collection, but his contemporary take on the brand’s ethos — marked by loose, enveloping silhouettes, layered headwear, utility belts and sturdy boots — is more subdued than that of its founder. “There was something very joyful and optimistic about Kenzo then, and I want to have a nod to that,” he said, “but it’s a challenge to channel the same sentiments in 2020.” What does he want to do differently? “I think that it’s time for responsibility. When you turn on the TV and see these horrible things all the time, you think, ‘O.K., I can do things in a better way,’” he said, adding that he intends to institute more sustainable practices at the brand, including the use of organic and recycled fabrics. “Of course, I am within a structure, but it’s something that I have been thinking about a lot.” Indeed, Oliveira Baptista had plenty of time to reflect. After leaving Lacoste in January 2018, he took a sabbatical of sorts. “It was like a huge meditation moment,” he said of this break, during which he practiced yoga regularly and traveled to Brazil, Algeria and Japan with his wife, Severine — who is also his longtime collaborator and now runs the Kenzo studio — and their two children. During a monthlong pilgrimage to Japan, they visited Tokyo, Kyoto and small fishing villages along the coast, and he has fond memories of the family traveling around the country by train with their backpacks — a peripatetic mood that he channeled in the collection. During fittings in the studio the next day, as Oliveira Baptista reviewed the looks each model would wear at the show — among them cocoon-like dresses, parkas with sleeves like wings and body-enveloping down jackets — it became clear that many styles had been designed to be worn in multiple ways, transforming for different environments with ease. There were felt hats with floppy brims to cover the wearer’s eyes, some with attached scarves that wrapped around the neck — “for protection,” the designer explained — and the sleeves on many garments, from trench coats to knitwear, were so long that they almost swallowed the models’ hands. Plant- and animal-inspired prints, including an equine motif and brightly colored florals, had their roots in the brand’s pattern archive, but Oliveira Baptista had cleverly reworked some of them into a contemporary form of camouflage. While the collection invoked the legacy of the house, these were clothes for a new generation of Kenzo wanderers, roaming around in a very different world. Tuesday, Feb. 25, 9:30 A.M. At the Kenzo headquarters on Rue Vivienne, preparations were underway ahead of Wednesday’s show. In the central courtyard, a balloon-based sculpture by the Paris artists Untitled showcased the updated logo Oliveira Baptista developed for the brand. He has already started redecorating the showroom here and will soon reveal his first redesigned Kenzo boutique. 11:00 A.M. Once the models — 60 men and women in all — were confirmed, the team began to finalize the order of the runway looks in the studio. For the opening look, they chose an all-black tailored ensemble, setting the stage for the designer’s minimalist approach to color and print. The collection’s silhouettes, meanwhile, were oversize and enveloping, designed to move fluidly with a wearer who is constantly in motion. 12:00 P.M. Among the collection’s animal motifs was a rendering of a tiger, the house’s mascot, from an ’80s-era series of works by the Lisbon-based painter Júlio Pomar. 1 P.M. As models walked a makeshift runway in the studio, Oliveira Baptista and the British stylist Jane How made the final decisions on the lineup. Monochromatic looks, like this one, would appear at regular intervals throughout the show, injecting bold splashes of color. 2 P.M. This piece, which Oliveira Baptista referred to as a “painting dress,” featured one of the few graphic elements in the collection. Flowing and loose, its silhouette could be adjusted via its zippers. 2:30 P.M. Oliveira Baptista titled the collection Going Places in reference to the brand’s itinerant spirit and mined his own travels, memories and mementos for inspiration. He looked back on summers spent in the Azores during his youth, photos of his parents as newlyweds in Mozambique, and his years in Paris, the home he shares with Kenzo. Wednesday, Feb. 26, 8:30 A.M. The show took place in the verdant gardens of the Institut National de Jeunes Sourds, a school for the deaf in Paris. Kenzo’s hair and makeup teams set up in the gymnasium. 9:00 A.M. To create a cocooned, slightly futuristic runway, the brand installed a labyrinth-like plastic tent in the gardens of the school. The structure, custom-made for this show, can be dismantled and reassembled in different ways for pop-ups and events — a nod, explained Oliveira Baptista, to Kenzo’s “nomadic spirit.” 9:15 A.M. The models walked through the set one last time before the doors opened to invited guests. Logo-adorned reusable water bottles — a reference to the collection’s theme of travel — were offered to attendees as souvenirs. 9:20 A.M. Oliveira Baptista looked on during the rehearsal, during which models walked to a soundtrack mixed by his longtime friend and collaborator, the sound engineer Michel Gaubert, which included tracks by Jamie XX, Billie Eilish and the French producer Thomas Bangalter. 9:30 A.M. Oliveira Baptista paused for a moment to snap pictures of the models in the lineup backstage. 10:30 A.M. Headwear, including oversize hoods and hats with long, trailing scarves, was a big feature of the collection. Oliveira Baptista imagined travelers taking shelter in their clothes; one down jacket he designed could even be transformed into a sleeping bag. 10:50 A.M. Models walked the final lap together, marking the arrival of a new era for Kenzo, one that is more minimal, polished and slightly more somber — for now, at least. 10:55 A.M. The mood after the finale was joyful as models including Arya Bendkhale — pictured here wearing a tailored, sleeveless gray wool jacket and leather cargo pants — streamed backstage to change before their next shows. 10:56 A.M. Oliveira Baptista took his bow to rapturous applause after returning to the fashion week schedule following a two-year hiatus. “It was nice to have a break,” he had admitted a few days before. 11 A.M. The designer greeted friends and family with a mix of happiness and relief backstage. “It was even better than expected,” he said, with a beaming smile.",The New York Times
2020,Two Divorce Lawyers Take Their Work Home,"IT’S NO SECRET Dana and Michael Stutman learn all the lessons from clients, including one important one: treat each other nicely. Because marriage is an ever-evolving experience, we constantly shift, change and, in some cases, start over. In It’s No Secret, couples share thoughts about commitment and tell us what they have learned, revealing their secret to making it work. (Answers are edited for context and space.) Who Dana Stutman, 54, and Michael Stutman, 65. Occupations Both are divorce lawyers. They are founding partners in the law firm Stutman Stutman & Lichtenstein in New York. Their Marriage 16 years, 4 months and counting. The couple married Sept. 21, 2003 before 165 guests at the Essex House in New York. Mr. Stutman had broken his leg skimboarding in the Hamptons about six weeks before the wedding. He walked down the aisle with a cane. The couple lives on the Lower East Side with their two children, Julian, 15, and Olivia, 11. Mr. Stutman also has two children from a previous marriage, Amelia, 27, and Henry, 23. Dana Sherins, then 32, met Michael Stutman, then 44, in 1998 while on opposing sides of a divorce case. “He had the husband and I had the wife,” she said. “I was an associate and he was a partner at a different firm. He treated me with respect. As a young female I didn’t always get that from men.” There was no chemistry initially, but they enjoyed working together. Six months after they met, a mutual friend invited them to the Grand Central Oyster Bar for a drink. “Michael was getting divorced and I was becoming more comfortable with him,” she said. “When he found out I was single I saw him melt. He was looking at me in a very different way.” Over the next four years a “When Harry Met Sally” kind of friendship developed. “But one night he put me in a cab at the end of the evening, kissed me on my forehead and called me when I got home,” she said. “I told him, you’re a wonderful guy. There’s more that’s going on and we should run with it.” [Sign up for Love Letter and always get the latest in Modern Love, weddings, and relationships in the news by email.] During summer 2002, they officially started dating, though she had some concerns. “I wanted children, he already had two; I didn’t know if he wanted more,” she said. “I called him and told him he needed to let me know if he did.” Mr. Stutman took a week to think it over. When he phoned back he told her he did want to marry her and wanted a family and more children with Ms. Sherins. In February 2003 the couple were engaged in Hawaii during a family vacation. Ms. Stutman I’m a math person; he’s a language person. We think differently. I compartmentalize and plan ahead. He’s very much in the moment. He’s authoritative with kids. I’m the soft push over. We balance, learn from each other and enjoy intellectual conversation. We are constantly trying to improve ourselves. Michael is brilliant, humble and has brought humor to our relationship and to my life. I’ve shown him how to be less harsh, and he’s taught me to be courageous enough to be who I am all the time. Which he is. I’ve learned I’m a good mother. I never had maternal instincts, which I found. He reminded me I’m a capable and intelligent person, that was something I forgot. I built up armor. He and my children helped me to be vulnerable and take it off. Marriage is a constant job that takes effort and energy, understanding and kindness, and forgiveness. Everyone has a different perspective. Both are usually right. If you leave disagreements unresolved they fester. Being divorce lawyers has made us treat each other nicely. It makes us better parents and spouses. We’ve seen acts of unkindness projected onto a spouse, coupled by a failure to forgive, so it snowballs until they don’t have a marriage anymore. We’ve learned that the way you say something is important. We have hot tempers. Because we want this marriage to work, we work very hard at taking a breath before we say something and being forgiving. We’ve learned communication is the most important thing. Michael gets up first and wakes me up with a cup of coffee, then we sit on the couch for 10, 15 minutes. We didn’t realize how important and intimate it was to sit next to each other and talk about our anticipated day. It’s a reminder that we love each other. Mr. Stutman Dana is a fierce team player. She’s the protector of our relationship and of our children. I can be the conciliator. I put a premium on keeping the peace; she’s more direct. We’re both sentimental, passionate and principled. Dana can be more impulsive. She can put herself in my shoes intuitively and readily. I don’t do that so well. She’s taught me to lighten up, to be more of a free spirit and to look at the upside of things. I’ve really evolved over the last 15 years, she’s been a huge maturing influence. I’ve learned I’m more of a caretaker than I thought I’d be, and to be giving without being resentful. Not everything is a quid pro quo. In this marriage there’s a willingness and an insistence that our life is a life together, and everybody is meaningful and needs to be taken care of. With Dana I have an unquestionable level of support. We are loyal to each other. We try to be true reflectors. We are loving and gentle, but honest. I’ve learned we need nuggets of interaction. If not, you can become a stranger and lose yourself and the connectivity with your spouse. You can’t forget how much the other person has to offer, and how much they need you to offer to them. From work I’ve learned not to withhold affection or use sex as a weapon. To be respectful of each other’s soft points. People want to put a pin in something and say, “This is why we broke up.” But really, it’s about how you got to the place. I’d be a mess if I hadn’t met her. I’d have no insight to myself. I have a wonderful place in the world with her.

2020,"Two Napoleons in Brooklyn, One in Timberlands","Critic’s Notebook The Brooklyn Museum has hung Jacques-Louis David’s “Bonaparte Crossing the Alps” alongside an adaptation by Kehinde Wiley. It’s a face-off between two visions of the political power of art. Kehinde Wiley’s ‘‘Napoleon Leading the Army over the Alps’’ (2005), left, and Jacques-Louis David’s ‘‘Bonaparte Crossing the Alps’’ (1801) shown in a composite photo of the exhibit at the Brooklyn Museum.Credit...Photographs by Emily Andrews for The New York Times A French masterpiece has come to New York for the first time ever, and has been greeted with a curious silence. It’s Jacques-Louis David’s “Bonaparte Crossing the Alps,” from 1801, and you know it even if you’ve never seen it in person, so enduring is its propaganda. To commemorate Napoleon’s victory over Austria at the Battle of Marengo, David painted him charging up a mountain on a piebald steed, right arm pointing skyward, trademark bicorne on his head, cool and cocksure as his horse bucks its front heels. In copies the artist and his studio made afterward Napoleon wears a red cape, but here, in the original, he’s wrapped in a mantle of gold, starchy and solid in the Alpine air. It’s actually here! Usually, to see “Bonaparte Crossing the Alps,” you have to trek to the suburbs of Paris, where it hangs in the Château de Malmaison, the home of Empress Joséphine. Until May, you’ll find it in a little-trafficked gallery on the fourth floor of the Brooklyn Museum — and it is not alone. In a face-off between two visions of the political power of art, the museum has hung another equestrian portrait: “Napoleon Leading the Army Over the Alps,” by Kehinde Wiley, which pictures a young black man in the same pose, the bicorne replaced by a bandanna, the riding boots swapped for Timberlands. The two Napoleons appear alongside a few engravings, cartoons and imperial medals from the museum’s collection, in the exhibition “Jacques-Louis David Meets Kehinde Wiley,” which was first presented at the Malmaison last year. Mr. Wiley painted the official portrait of our last president but likes ornament and glitz as much as the incumbent one. His painting and David’s appear in Brooklyn under spotlights, in a room carpeted Oscar-night red. Between the canvases is an ostentatious gold monogram of the two artists’ initials, framed by heavy velvet curtains. It’s a mix of imperial and urban forms of bling, two parallel forms of bluster and self-marketing. We may have reached a point when Mr. Wiley is a bigger name than David, the official court painter of the First French Empire. Whatever, times change. But I’ve been thinking about how concerned young audiences are with the social impact of art — and for them, there may be no greater case study than Jacques-Louis David to see how far-left politics can shape painting for good and ill. Born during the reign of Louis XV, David in the 1780s became the leading figure of Neo-Classicism. In pictures like “The Oath of the Horatii,” now at the Louvre, and “The Death of Socrates,” at the Met, he purged French art of its Rococo frippery and foreshadowed the moral stringency of the Reign of Terror. When the Bastille fell David joined the Jacobins, and he designed the Revolution’s propaganda both on canvas (Marat dead in the bath) and in the streets, where he masterminded lavish parades featuring huge effigies of Reason and Liberty. You wonder about the political power of art? David took his politics out of the studio and right into the new legislature. He served as a member of the National Convention, where he voted to deliver Louis XVI to the guillotine. Many artists aim to speak truth to power. Only David actually drew blood. After Robespierre’s fall, David went to jail twice. When he got out he stepped back from politics — but by 1799 France had a new boss, and David channeled his propagandistic genius into a new vessel. Napoleon had taken power in a bloodless coup d’état, and the next year he solidified his political supremacy with a victory in Piedmont, where the 30-year-old general surprised the Austrians by traversing the Alps’s most hazardous pass. He wanted the victory to become a legend, and David delivered. Instead of the mule Napoleon actually rode, he provided a near-untamed war horse. The billowing gold mantle recalls the Roman and Italian sculptures Napoleon had recently pillaged and brought to the Louvre. Napoleon has no weapon drawn, and doesn’t even wear a glove on his raised right hand. David has invented a wholly new iconography for a modern ruler, bereft of the old monarchical symbols, in which authority derives not from divine right but from valor. In Mr. Wiley’s “Napoleon,” from 2005, the Alpine setting has given way to an abstract ground of red and gold brocade, speckled, strange to say, by swimming spermatozoa. The artist found his model via what he called “street casting”: He is a young man called Williams, his name inscribed on the Alpine rock next to “Bonaparte.” The “Napoleon” is one of Mr. Wiley’s better paintings. His translations of the 18th- and early 19th-century French tradition for black American models — he has also made paintings after Fragonard and Géricault — have always been his most interesting for how they update traditions of ornament and how they poke at Enlightenment promises of universalism and freedom. (The British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare, with his wax-print sculptures drawn from Gainsborough and Fragonard, has plumbed more deeply the Enlightenment’s mixed inheritance.) Comparing and contrasting is the foundation of Art History 101, and the Brooklyn Museum’s pairing does draw forth some of David’s themes: iconicity and masculinity, empire and conquest. (Napoleon reinstituted slavery in the French colonies in 1802; the Jacobins had abolished it eight years previously.) Yet what does this contrast reveal about Mr. Wiley’s painting? Does it exceed simple substitution? Is it more profound than, say, Banksy’s pastiche on a Paris wall of an equestrian in the same pose as Napoleon, but wearing a burqa? There are passages, especially the brocaded background and the naughty sperm, that offer hints of transgression. Unlike David’s Napoleon, Mr. Wiley’s Napoleon is as teasing as it is heroic, and lightly queers the masculine pretensions of military painting. But by and large, his art has treated the mere presence of a black sitter as a sufficient corrective to the oversights of European art. (The artist drives that point home in a video in the next gallery.) Contemporary art ought to offer more: not just clapping back at the past, but reconstituting it into newer, fresher languages. Think here of Kerry James Marshall, Njideka Akunyili Crosby, and other black figurative painters for whom European painting is one vital source among many that they assume as part of a global inheritance. Right now is a rumbling, exciting moment for places like the Brooklyn Museum, which is taking on the challenge of exposing the past inequities of art and art institutions. But what if public school students here on a field trip encountered David’s Napoleon alongside a portrait of a black French citizen by one of David’s students, such as Anne-Louis Girodet’s “Portrait of Citizen Belley,” in which a freed slave wears a tricolor sash? Might that, more than Mr. Wiley’s Napoleon, help them see themselves in the art of the past, and inspire a love for art of all ages? What if students compared David’s Napoleon with the nearly contemporaneous equestrian portrait of Toussaint Louverture, the leader of the Haitian revolution, nicknamed “the black Napoleon”? Or — if we are interested in the construction of power via images — might they learn more from seeing David’s Napoleon with Mr. Wiley’s portrait of Barack Obama, which will tour to the Brooklyn Museum next year? OK, these may be impractical proposals, any one of which would require major diplomatic lifting. I’m not raising them to knock this David-Wiley pairing per se: The Brooklyn Museum got the extraordinary loan, and has executed the hang nicely. What I am asking is whether the now frequent refrain that “representation matters” goes far enough, and whether we can derive models of engagement with the art of the past that go deeper than one-for-one substitutions. We have a shining recent example of a show that did more: “Posing Modernity,” Denise Murrell’s watershed 2018 exhibition at the Wallach Art Gallery at Columbia University, which illuminated the presence of the black model in paintings from Manet to Matisse. Do that for the art of France’s early imperial era, bring the same keen gaze on race and representation that she brought to the later 19th century, and you might inspire a new generation of painters to draw more deeply from the past. As for David, he proved that a great painter can make a great propagandist. Mr. Wiley shares with him a commitment to clear symbols with direct impact that made David the ideal artist of political power, and makes Mr. Wiley quite nice for the age of Instagram. But don’t hate me for suggesting that the most enduring reinterpretation of Jacques-Louis David by a contemporary American artist is not Mr. Wiley’s portrait, but a more recent work. It’s Beyoncé’s video for her song “Apes**t,” shot in the Louvre, in which she and her dancers wriggle in formation before David’s epic canvas of Napoleon’s coronation. She understood that, to establish your place in the museum, invention will carry you much further than mimicry.

2020,How Tyson Fury Beat Deontay Wilder for the Heavyweight Title,"And it’s done. Deontay Wilder retreated to a neutral corner while Tyson Fury pounded on him with lefts and rights. The towel flew into the ring from Wilder’s corner and referee Kenny Bayless ended the fight, wrapping up a masterful performance from Tyson Fury.",The New York Times
2020,Tyson Fury’s Solid Victory Doesn’t Close the Door to Another Rematch,"Fury and Deontay Wilder fought to a draw in 2018, but both fighters’ teams have signaled an openness to extending the rivalry. LAS VEGAS — After Tyson Fury’s seven-round thrashing of Deontay Wilder in their championship rematch on Saturday, the statistics suggested that a third showdown between these two massive heavyweights might not be necessary. Fury, the 6-foot-9 challenger from Manchester, England, landed 82 total punches, compared with just 34 for Wilder, according to CompuBox. And Wilder, who entered the bout with the World Boxing Council title and a 95.3 percent knockout rate, connected on just 18 power punches, compared with Fury’s 58. Fury landed 13 body punches, one of which dropped Wilder in Round 5, and all of which helped drain the energy and punching power of Wilder, a 6-foot-7 boxer from Alabama. By nearly any metric, Fury’s win was about as definitive a victory as you are likely to see among evenly matched elites. Unlike the pair’s first fight, in December 2018, which ended in a draw, it left few of the unanswered questions that lead to a high-stakes rematch. But another set of numbers foreshadows a Wilder-Fury trilogy. Saturday night’s rematch attracted a capacity crowd of 15,816 to the MGM Grand Garden Arena, and the $16.9 million in ticket revenue was the most for a heavyweight bout in Nevada. Pay-per-view sales figures might not be public until midweek, but ESPN and Fox combined to promote the fight, and organizers on both sides expected a commercial success. Factor in the fight contract’s rematch clause — which gives the loser 30 days to force a return bout — and we might see Wilder and Fury again. “I can’t wait for the next fight,” said Fury, now 30-0-1. “The rematch, hopefully. If he wants it.” Wilder, managed by Al Haymon, and Fury, who is signed to Bob Arum’s Top Rank Boxing, were guaranteed a reported $25 million each for Saturday’s fight, plus a portion of pay-per-view revenue. Those figures illustrate the windfalls possible when rival promoters collaborate, and that message resonated immediately with other deep-pocketed boxing businessmen. “No need for a third,” Eddie Hearn, head of U.K.-based Matchroom Sport, wrote on Twitter. “Let’s go straight to it in the summer! #Undisputed.” Hearn’s tweet referred to a potential fight between Fury and Anthony Joshua, who holds the other major heavyweight titles and is signed to Hearn’s company. Given that a Fury-Joshua showdown could result in a single, universally recognized heavyweight champion, the matchup makes sense. And from the standpoint that two wildly popular English heavyweights could threaten revenue records, a Fury-Joshua pairing seems even more appealing. Joshua lost in his United States debut, stopped in seven rounds by Andy Ruiz Jr. at Madison Square Garden last June. But he regained his titles in December, which helped him restore his marketability over all and in England, where all the heavyweight titles now reside and boxing remains a major mainstream sport. Judging by the cheers Fury received during his ring entrance, and the boos that washed over Wilder when he entered the arena, more than half of Saturday’s crowd supported Fury. Joshua, meanwhile, drew nearly 80,000 spectators to a rugby stadium in Wales for a 2017 title defense against Carlos Takam. As boxing audiences migrate online — both ESPN and Fox offered Saturday’s card on those platforms — a Fury-Joshua pairing could help the upstart streaming service DAZN monetize its own heavy investment in boxing. The company has committed $365 million to the middleweight Canelo Álvarez and another $1 billion over eight years to Hearn’s Matchroom Sport. But with his emphatic win on Saturday, Fury and his team earned leverage over nearly every potential future opponent, and it might not be Joshua. Arum said on Saturday night that the question was not for his camp to answer: “The question is directed to Deontay Wilder.” Wilder could exercise his rematch clause and return immediately to face a fighter he couldn’t solve on Saturday. “I think the public will want it,” said Wilder’s trainer, Jay Deas. “I think he’ll want it.” Fury’s camp, he added, “will want it.” In the week preceding the bout, Fury, 31, promised a bigger, more aggressive version of the tactical boxer who had unified the heavyweight title before retiring in 2016, and who had won 27 straight bouts before his 2018 draw against Wilder. On Friday afternoon, he weighed in at 273 pounds, 16.5 more than in the first Wilder bout and 42 more than Wilder, who scaled a sculpted 231 pounds. On Saturday night, Fury paired his new strength and assertiveness with the impeccable timing that has long made him so difficult to defeat. He controlled distance with a stiff jab, and used it to set up power punches, like the right hand to the ear that dropped Wilder in Round 3 and the left hook to the body that floored him in Round 5. He also used his new weight to lean on Wilder and to grapple with him in clinches. By Round 4, Kenny Bayless, the referee, looked as tired as either fighter, and in Round 5 he deducted a point from Fury for his constant roughhousing. But all those tactics succeeded in sapping Wilder’s strength and blunting the punching power that helped him salvage a draw in the first bout. Early in the seventh round, a tired, bruised and bleeding Wilder retreated to a corner and tried to shield himself from another Fury salvo. When a right cross from Fury crashed into the left side of Wilder’s swollen face, an assistant trainer, Mark Breland, tossed a white towel into the ring, prompting Bayless to stop the fight. “Everybody knows I’m a master slick boxer, but that didn’t work last time,” Fury told reporters Saturday night. “We worked our game plan in the ring, and put it into practice in the ring.” Afterward, Wilder and Deas said they disagreed with Breland’s decision. “I just wish my corner would have let me go out on my shield,” Wilder said immediately after the fight. “I’m a warrior. He had a great performance and we will be back stronger.” By the time Breland conceded the fight, Wilder trailed, 59-52, on two scorecards and 58-53 on a third. He also struggled to defend himself, and bled from a cut inside his left ear. After the fight, he received stitches in the locker room, and headed to a hospital instead of the postfight news conference. Fury arrived to the news conference with the trainer Javan Hill, the head of Detroit’s famed Kronk Gym and architect of Fury’s relentlessly effective game plan. He held a ceremonial title belt signifying Fury’s status as the lineal heavyweight champion. An assistant trainer, Andy Lee, who is Fury’s cousin, carried the W.B.C. belt that Fury had just won from Wilder. And Fury commandeered the microphone and strutted across the makeshift stage like a standup comedian. He later settled into his seat and praised Wilder’s toughness. When asked about future matchups, he said he was open to a third fight with Wilder, as well as a long list of other options. “Whoever’s next will get the same treatment,” he said.",The New York Times
2020,T’s Spring Women’s Fashion Issue: The Test,"Letter from the editor The most important thing is not that you were first to accomplish something, but that you did so on your own terms, with as few compromises as possible.

Styled by Jason Rider Although there are many things I miss about being young (all of them too obvious to detail here), one thing I don’t is the hyperawareness of age. When you are young and ambitious, your 20s can feel like a constant and unrelenting race, one in which you are vividly aware of not only your own position, but that of your peers as well. How many times did I moan about someone who seemed to be so much more accomplished than I? How much of my consciousness was dedicated to cataloging how many years (or months, even) younger or older a perceived rival was than I? I wanted to be a writer, and I wanted to be an editor in chief, and yet everyone always seemed so much further ahead of me; everyone else’s pace looked so much brisker, their triumph so much more assured. Anyone who is reading this and in a similar position should take heart, however: At some point, those feelings will fade. You will realize that early professional success ensures nothing. You will also realize that the most important thing is not that you were first to accomplish something, but that you did so on your own terms, with as few compromises as possible. By this time, you’ll probably be nearing or in middle age, but the consolation prize for being in your 40s is the relief you’ll feel that, despite everything, you are free from that particular tyranny. The ticking clock is, I’d venture, louder still for those of us living (or attempting to live) a creative life. We celebrate savants, prodigies, early promise. Your first gallery show, your first stage role, your first published book, your first runway collection — these are laudable moments; they happen for so few, and they should be celebrated. But it’s after the show closes or the curtain falls that the second test begins — the one in which you have to prove to yourself not just that you can produce art, but that you can be an artist. This test will consume the rest of your life, and although there will be moments of joy, the pursuit will often be lonely and mapless. Your age will not matter in this test; what will instead is your resilience, your durability and the singularity of your vision. There are probably few fashion designers who understand this as vividly as Marc Jacobs. Jacobs was 29 and the creative director of Perry Ellis when he presented his infamous grunge collection, which made him an instant sensation. Now 56, he has been famous — and an artistic director — for almost half of his life. Over the course of his long career, he has been responsible for giving shape and relevance to American luxury; for transforming the business of fashion; for changing our perception of what an artistic director looks like and what a runway show can be. Of course, there have been disappointments as well: both professional and personal. And yet what I admire most about him is his constant vulnerability, the generosity of his imagination, his lack of cynicism, the wonder he’s able to make his audience feel. To see one of Jacobs’s shows is to witness the work of someone who has never become weary of creating, who knows — as all artists do — that every beginning is another chance to make the world anew. He is a reminder to all of us seeking to live a creative life that trying something different is not only not a bad thing, it is an imperative. So don’t waste your time tracking who got there first, young artists. There is no stopwatch. What there is, finally, is you and a blank canvas, whether that canvas is a literal one, or whether it takes the form of a notebook or computer screen or rehearsal space or dress form. All you have to do is start. All you have to do is never stop. Read more from T’s Feb. 23 Women’s Fashion issue.",The New York Times
2020,U.K. Businessman Linked to Coronavirus Cluster Comes Forward,"Steve Walsh, who is believed to have contracted the new coronavirus in Singapore, is connected to five more of the eight known cases in Britain and to five in France. Get an informed guide to the global outbreak with our daily Coronavirus
 newsletter.
 BRIGHTON, England — A British businessman believed to be the source of a cluster of coronavirus cases in Britain and France came forward on Tuesday, saying that he had fully recovered but would remain in isolation as a precaution. The man, Steve Walsh, from Hove, a town neighboring the popular seaside area of Brighton in southern England, contracted the virus at a conference in Singapore last month, according to his representatives, before traveling on to a chalet in the French Alps where a number of other Britons also fell ill. Mr. Walsh had already been widely identified in the British media as the man who brought the virus to the chalet. Mr. Walsh thanked doctors for their care in a statement released by a public relations firm representing him and his employer. “Whilst I have fully recovered, my thoughts are with others who have contracted coronavirus,” said Mr. Walsh, one of at least eight people in Britain who have tested positive for the coronavirus in the past month. More than 44,000 people, mostly in China, have been sickened by the virus since it first emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, and more than 1,100 have died. The virus has spread to at least 24 countries, triggering fears of a global pandemic. In Britain, attention has been focused on a cluster of transmissions at a ski resort in the French Alpine town of Les Contamines-Montjoie, near Switzerland, late last month. At least six people in Britain, including Mr. Walsh, and five Britons in France who have the virus have been linked to the chalet. The British health authorities announced on Monday that they had confirmed four additional cases of the coronavirus in the country, all closely linked and tied to the French transmissions. In his statement, Mr. Walsh said that he had contacted his doctor and local public health officials as soon as he knew he had been exposed to a confirmed coronavirus case. “I was advised to attend an isolated room at hospital, despite showing no symptoms, and subsequently self-isolated at home as instructed,” he said. “When the diagnosis was confirmed I was sent to an isolation unit in hospital, where I remain, and, as a precaution, my family was also asked to isolate themselves.” Updated Feb. 26, 2020 Mr. Walsh’s employer, Servomex, a gas analytics company, issued a statement noting that it was pleased that he had made a full recovery and that it would “continue to provide support to him and his family.” The company said it was working with the public health authorities and said it was it was enforcing self-isolation for others who had attended the sales conference in Singapore where Mr. Walsh was believed to have contracted the virus. The conference was held from Jan. 19 to 22 with about 90 company employees in attendance. The first Servomex employee tested positive for the coronavirus on Feb. 3 — that person also attended the conference — and guidance was issued to all staff members. This is what alerted Mr. Walsh to the situation, and he subsequently contacted his doctor. Public health officials on Monday evening said two of the new cases announced earlier in the day were health care workers and said that they had been advised to isolate themselves. “We are now working urgently to identify all patients and other health care workers who may have come into close contact, and at this stage we believe this to be a relatively small number,” Prof. Yvonne Doyle, the medical director of Public Health England, said in a statement. While national public health officials did not specify the number of contacts the health workers had, a senior official at National Health Service group said at least 12 patients at the County Oak Medical Center in Brighton came into contact with them. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because she was not authorized to speak to the news media. The center was working with national health officials to trace the movements of the patients, she said. The Bevendean Primary School in Brighton also said one of its staff members had been advised to go into self-isolation after coming into contact with someone who carried the virus. It said it would allow absences if parents wanted to keep their children at home. Tracing those who might have been in contact with someone infected with the coronavirus is being coordinated by Public Health England, which is working with the Department of Health, the National Health Service and local councils to respond to the current cases. That process involves health officials working with each patient to collect information on where they may have visited since the onset of symptoms or, in the case of travelers, since they arrived in Britain. All of the contacts are then categorized into high or low risk. Those deemed to be at a higher risk have a daily health assessment and some may be asked to isolate themselves, health officials say. Any of the contacts who report symptoms will be assessed and offered testing for the virus, the official said. But in Brighton, where a number of confirmed cases are linked, many feared they were not being given enough information. Samer Bagaeen, a member of Brighton and Hove City Council’s health board, criticized health officials and the local council for a lack of information. Mr. Bagaeen said advice from health officials that people “self-isolate” has caused confusion. “We haven’t been given any information about the self-isolation process,” Mr. Bagaeen said. “Are these individuals still going into shops and buying groceries? And if not, who are they coming into contact with and how are they being protected?” Brighton residents expressed similar frustrations, with many complaining that information was coming by word of mouth rather than through official channels. “This is a small place, and it’s scary to think that anyone could have it, and anyone could get it,” said Adam Neil, a convenience store employee, who put up a “card only” sign on Monday to avoid handling people’s cash. “No one has given us any information, so we have to take our own precautions,” he said. Jack Henley, a local taxi driver said he would work half days until the risk of contracting the virus diminished. “Our bosses won’t let us wear masks because they don’t want us to scare the customers away, but I’m scared of the customers, to be frank,” he said. Matt Hancock, Britain’s health secretary, told Parliament on Wednesday that the coronavirus situation would “get worse before it gets better,” but noted that even as numbers of infections in Britain have risen in recent days, the threat to the public remained “moderate.” On Sunday, 105 British citizens returned to the country on a flight after being evacuated from Wuhan, China. They are now in isolation facilities. Mr. Hancock defended measures introduced on Monday to extend the government’s power to impose a quarantine on people believed to be at risk of spreading the virus. He warned that the response to the coronavirus would be long term. “Dealing with this disease is a marathon, not a sprint,” he said.",The New York Times
2020,U.K. Court Blocks Heathrow Airport Expansion on Environmental Grounds,"The Court of Appeal said the government failed to take its climate change commitments into account, a decision that carries global implications LONDON — Britain’s Court of Appeal issued a landmark ruling on Thursday that stymied plans to build a third runway at Heathrow Airport in London, declaring that the government illegally neglected its commitments to reduce carbon emissions and protect the planet from dangerously high temperatures. The ruling, among the first in the world to measure a state’s infrastructure plans specifically against its promises under the Paris Agreement on climate change, threw the expansion of Heathrow into doubt and opened up a new frontier for legal challenges to major projects in Britain and around the world. While the decision left the door open for Britain’s prime minister, Boris Johnson, to reformulate the plans and try again, it set back the runway expansion considerably, prolonging a battle that has raged for years. That posed a dilemma to a country — a “truly global Britain,” in Mr. Johnson’s words — that is in the midst of severing its strong ties to Europe and looking for new trading partners farther afield. But analysts said the ruling also relieved Mr. Johnson of having to oversee a project that he once opposed — so strongly, he once said, that he would lie down in front of bulldozers to stop it. And it halted one part of the government’s aviation expansion plans at a moment when any additional flights jeopardize Britain’s own legally binding target of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. While the government said it would not appeal the ruling, the owners of Heathrow said on Thursday that they would. Technically speaking, the ruling said only that the expansion plans — drawn up under Mr. Johnson’s predecessor, Theresa May — needed to take into account Britain’s commitments to help reduce global warming, not that the plans definitely clashed with those vows. That left room for the government, if it wished, to make modifications to its case for the new runway. But with Mr. Johnson’s government already divided on the expansion plan, the ruling made it less likely that he would quickly press ahead, analysts said. For the Paris accord — already under threat from President Trump, who pulled the United States out of the agreement last year — the ruling sent a strong signal about its potential to serve as a check on domestic policies related to energy and infrastructure. Rulings by British courts, while not binding elsewhere, can influence legal thinking in other jurisdictions. “It’s not enough to take into account what you said you’d be doing under your own legislation,” said Jorge E. Viñuales, the Harold Samuel professor of law and environmental policy at the University of Cambridge, describing the message the ruling sent. “You suddenly have to take into account the declarations that states made under the Paris agreement, which is a completely new dimension that really bites.” “It’s a very significant symbolic endorsement of the Paris agreement at a time when that’s really welcome,” he added, “because it’s navigating difficult waters.” Buoyed by the victory, environmental campaigners in Britain were already thinking about other projects that could be modified or struck down on the same grounds: regional airport expansions, major railway projects. And legal experts said they expected the ruling to inspire cases in other countries, too. “It opens up so many doors it’s almost hard to know which ones to choose,” said Tim Crosland, the director of Plan B, one of the groups that brought the challenge. “This is absolutely what the courts are for, to say, ‘Stop, this doesn’t make sense, governments are failing in their basic responsibilities to protect people.’” The ruling is part of a string of recent successes for environmental campaigners. In December, the Supreme Court of the Netherlands ordered the government to cut the country’s greenhouse gas emissions by 25 percent from 1990 levels by the end of 2020. “We’re now beginning to see the courts play a more active role, not just in implementing environmental law but in plugging gaps in some sense,” said Lavanya Rajamani, a professor of international environmental law at the University of Oxford. “They’re being used very strategically, and it’s beginning to bear fruit.” The Heathrow runway case hung on a decade-old British planning law that requires the government to take into account its climate policy in making infrastructure plans. The government interpreted that to mean that it needed only to consider domestic British legislation related to climate change, not international commitments like the Paris Agreement. But the courts disagreed, saying that the Paris Agreement fell squarely within the boundaries of government climate policy. “It is clear, therefore, that it was the Government’s expressly stated policy that it was committed to adhering to the Paris Agreement to limit the rise in global temperature to well below 2 degrees Celsius and to pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5 degrees Celsius,” the ruling said. But, the decision said, the secretary of state for transport “did not take the Paris Agreement into account at all. On the contrary, as we understand it, he consciously chose — on advice — not to take it into account.” Pressure for more runway space at British airports has bedeviled governments for decades. Heathrow, a major hub for global travel that handles 80 million passengers a year, argued that it needed the extra runway to avoid being overtaken by other large European airports, including Charles de Gaulle in Paris, Schiphol in Amsterdam and Frankfurt in Germany. The $18 billion runway project would enable about 700 more planes a day to use Heathrow, but it would drive up the airport’s carbon dioxide emissions, not to speak of the extra noise. Business groups bemoaned the court’s decision on Thursday, saying that companies were at risk of losing access to trading markets around the world. “There has never been a more important time to demonstrate that Britain is open for business,” said Adam Marshall, director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce, alluding to Brexit. “The government must back Heathrow expansion unequivocally and take all necessary steps to finally move the project forward.” But for Mr. Johnson, whose parliamentary constituency encompasses towns and villages that are near the airport, which is about 14 miles west of Central London, the decision may have come as something of a reprieve. He has avoided taking strong public stands on the expansion plans in recent years; in 2018, when Parliament backed the plan in a vote, Mr. Johnson absented himself by traveling to Afghanistan in his role as foreign secretary. Still, said Tony Travers, a professor of government at the London School of Economics, the ruling only deferred a decision on a matter that has vexed Britain’s main political parties. The Labour Party government of Prime Minister Gordon Brown first gave the project a green light in 2009. His Conservative successor, David Cameron, reversed course, holding up the project. The Conservative government of Mrs. May resurrected the plan in 2015. And now Mr. Johnson’s Conservative Party, which publicly supports environmental protections even as its most pro-Brexit factions show some willingness to abandon them, now has to figure out its own approach. “Giving up on having a major international hub airport would be a noble thing to do,” Mr. Travers said. “But it’s not, I suspect, going to be enough to convince the French or the Dutch not to continue with theirs, and the British government needs to think about all of this.” Anna Joyce contributed reporting.",The New York Times

 LONDON — Britain’s health department declared the new coronavirus an “imminent threat” to public health and announced a series of measures to combat the spread of the virus, a sign of the seriousness with which local health authorities are treating the fears of the epidemic. The newly introduced measures — which apply only in England — are among the first in Europe to allow the health authorities to keep individuals in quarantine if public health professionals believe they may be at risk of spreading the virus. Four more people in Britain linked to a cluster of transmissions at a ski resort in France tested positive for the coronavirus, bringing the total number of cases in the country to eight, the health department announced Monday. The coronavirus has sickened more than 40,500 people, mostly in China, and at least 910 people have died since the virus first emerged in Wuhan, a city of 11 million people in the central part of the country late last year. Since that time, the virus has also spread to at least 24 countries, triggering fears of a global pandemic. [Read: China says 1,700 health workers have contracted coronavirus.] The Department of Health and Social Care emphasized that the risk of contracting the coronavirus in Britain remained “moderate,” even as the government empowered the health authorities to forcibly quarantine people. It also designated a hospital, near Liverpool, and a conference center, northwest of London, as isolation facilities for those placed under quarantine. “I will do everything in my power to keep people in this country safe,” Matt Hancock, Britain’s health secretary, said in a statement. “We are taking every possible step to control the outbreak of coronavirus.” He added that it meant health care providers would be “supported with additional legal powers to keep people safe across the country,” noting transmission of the coronavirus would “constitute a serious threat.” The new measures were announced a day after a repatriation flight from Hubei Province — Wuhan is the largest city in the area — carrying about 200 citizens from Britain and elsewhere landed at an air force base in central England. British passengers were taken to the Kents Hill Park conference center, about 50 miles northwest of London, for 14 days of quarantine. Twenty Germans who were on board the evacuation flight were brought to a Red Cross hospital in Berlin. Like 126 Germans who were picked up from Wuhan earlier this month, those who arrived at the weekend agreed to a quarantine time of two weeks. There are 14 known cases of the virus across Germany. [Read: U.K. businessman linked to coronavirus cluster comes forward.] By Monday morning, eight people in England had tested positive for the coronavirus, according to a statement from Professor Chris Whitty, the Department of Health’s Chief Medical Officer for England, doubling from a day earlier the known cases in the country. Updated Feb. 26, 2020 “The new cases are all known contacts of a previously confirmed U.K. case, and the virus was passed on in France,” Professor Whitty said in a statement. “Experts at Public Health England continue to work hard tracing patient contacts from the U.K. cases. They successfully identified these individuals and ensured the appropriate support was provided.” The new cases in Britain are linked to cases in France, according to the French health authorities which all trace back to a group of British citizens staying in a chalet in the Alpine village of Les Contamines-Montjoie, near Switzerland, late last month. A British man at the center of the transmissions is believed to have contracted the coronavirus while attending a conference in Singapore, before flying to Geneva on Jan. 24, and from there the village, where he shared lodgings with a group of fellow Britons. The man then returned to Britain on Jan. 28 on an easyJet flight, the budget airline confirmed in an emailed statement. He is among the eight people in Britain who have tested positive for the virus. EasyJet said in an emailed statement that it had been notified by the public health authorities that a customer who had recently traveled on flight EZS8481 from Geneva to London Gatwick on Jan. 28 had since received a coronavirus diagnosis. “Public Health England is contacting all passengers who were seated in the vicinity of the customer,” the company said in a statement, but noted that since the man had not been experiencing any symptoms, the risk to others on board the flight was “very low.” At least one of the people who tested positive for the virus was confirmed to be from Brighton, a seaside town on England’s south coast, and the BBC reported on Monday that the County Oak medical center there had to shut its doors after a member of staff tested positive for the virus. A message on the center’s answering machine indicated it had been closed for an “urgent operational health and safety reason.” Public Health England confirmed that two of the cases of coronavirus in Britain were health care workers. Yvonne Doyle, Public Health England’s medical director, said in a statement that all of the new cases announced on Monday were “closely linked to one another.” “Our priority has been to speak to those who have close and sustained contact with confirmed cases, so we can advise them on what they can do to limit the spread of the virus,” she said. “We are now working urgently to identify all patients and other health care workers who may have come into close contact, and at this stage we believe this to be a relatively small number.” A pub near Brighton in Hove, The Grenadier, said in a statement on its Facebook page that a person confirmed to have the virus had visited the establishment, but that Public Health England had determined there was minimal risk, and it was following official advice to remain open. At least five other Britons who stayed in the chalet and are still in France have tested positive for the coronavirus, said Agnès Buzyn, France’s health minister. They are among at least 11 people in France who have tested positive for the disease. A 9-year-old boy was among the British people who contracted the virus in the ski village. According to a spokeswoman for the region, the child is a permanent resident of the village, where he lives with his father, who also contracted the virus, and two siblings. His mother is currently in Britain. He attended a local school in Les Contamines-Montjoie and took French lessons in two nearby schools in Saint-Gervais and Thonon-Les-Bains. As a precaution, the three schools have all been closed for the week and fellow students are being tested. Six other British people staying in the chalet have all tested negative for the virus, according to the head of France’s national health agency, Jérome Salomon. The French health authorities said they were still in the process of determining exactly how many people were staying in the chalet and who may have come into contact with those carrying the coronavirus. Ms. Buzyn, the health minister, visited the ski resort on Sunday. “It is important to reassure the people of this village,” she said. “We have to tell them that there is no risk when you meet people on the street, it’s not the same as being in contact with an infected person.” “It’s about close, sustained, face-to-face or physical contact,” she added. A crisis unit has been opened in Les Contamines-Montjoie, where testing is underway to determine if there are further cases of the coronavirus. On Sunday night, Mr. Salomon, the head of the national health agency, announced that results from 21 samples had all tested negative and that 25 others were still being analyzed. “It’s already very good news,” he said. Etienne Jacquet, the mayor of Les Contamines-Montjoie, said in a phone interview that students who might have been in contact with the infected child underwent tests as a priority on Sunday. He said the precautionary measures made the village, in his opinion, the “most secure city in France” when it came to the coronavirus. “In Les Contamines-Montjoie life goes on normally,” Mr. Jacquet said. “For the moment there is absolutely no crisis.” Megan Specia reported from London and Constant Méheut reported from Paris.

LONDON — A British woman who in a drunken fit tried to open the door of a passenger plane thousands of feet above the North Sea has been jailed for two years and barred for life from the airline, officials said. The woman, Chloe Haines, was on an evening flight with Jet2, a British budget airline, from Stansted Airport, east of London, bound for Dalaman, in southwestern Turkey, when she leapt for a door of the plane, scratched a member of the crew and shouted, “I’m going to kill you all,” according to the BBC. Fellow passengers helped the plane crew restrain Ms. Haines, a spokesman for Jet2 told The New York Times in July. Military jets were scrambled to escort the plane back to Britain, where she was arrested. In testimony on Wednesday at Chelmsford Crown Court in England, “the prosecution said that she was drunk, loud and argumentative,” her lawyer, Oliver Saxby, said in an email on Thursday. Ms. Haines, 26, pleaded guilty to “endangering the safety of an aircraft and common assault” during the flight, Mr. Saxby said. Not much more is known about Ms. Haines or why she went for the plane door. But her lawyer said that “having been asked to sit down, she became upset and tried to grab the handle of one of the doors, apparently in an attempt to open it.” The lawyer told the court on Wednesday that Ms. Haines “wasn’t just drunk; she was unwell.” He also said that she had not consumed alcohol since the fateful flight in June and that she was “deeply embarrassed by what she did,” the BBC reported. “She sobbed throughout the hearing,” Mr. Saxby added on Thursday. Some researchers have noted that the stress of flying has increased over the years — fueled by stricter safety protocols, higher fares, increased fees and, more often than not, alcohol — contributing to a rise in unruly behavior on planes. The International Air Transport Association, an industry trade group that has about 290 member airlines, said that there was one disruptive episode for every 1,053 flights in 2017. In 2016, there was one incident for every 1,424 flights, it said. In some cases, pilots have been forced to turn planes around, creating major delays. Ms. Haines’s behavior prompted alarmed officials to summon two Typhoon military fighter jets from the Royal Air Force to escort the plane back to Stansted Airport. The situation on board was judged to be so serious that the jets sped to the plane, creating a sonic boom that “could be heard for miles around,” the airline said in a statement in July. Officers from Essex Police boarded the aircraft after it landed and arrested Ms. Haines on suspicion of common assault, criminal damage and endangering an aircraft, the authorities said on Twitter at the time. Steve Heapy, the airline’s chief executive, welcomed the court’s decision, saying in a statement on Wednesday that Ms. Haines’s conduct, which had distressed the airline’s crew and customers, was “one of the most serious cases of disruptive passenger” behavior that the airline had experienced. Mr. Heapy said that “excessive alcohol consumption was a contributing factor in this incident,” and added that the airline was working on tackling the issue of excessive drinking in the airport ahead of and on board a flight. Mr. Saxby said on Thursday that he did not know where she would serve her sentence. He noted that the maximum sentence for endangering the safety of an aircraft was five years. The airline said in its July statement that it had barred Ms. Haines for life and billed her more than 85,000 pounds, over $110,000, to recover the costs of diverting the plane back to Stansted. Jet2 did not immediately confirm on Thursday whether Ms. Haines had paid it back.",The New York Times
2020,U.K. Police Kill Man in a ‘Terrorist Related’ Incident,"The shooting occurred after people were stabbed in South London. The motive was unclear. The suspect had a fake explosive device strapped to his body. LONDON — A man armed with a knife and wearing a fake explosive device strapped to his body was shot and killed by the police in South London on Sunday after he was suspected of stabbing people on Sunday. The authorities described the attack as “terrorist related.” The assault in London came more than three months after another terrorism spree left two people dead near the London Bridge, and added to the litany of attacks Britain has endured in recent years, testing the nerves and fortitude of its residents. According to Lucy D’Orsi, the deputy assistant commissioner in specialist operations, the suspect was Sudesh Mamoor Faraz Amman, 20. Local news reports said Mr. Amman had been under surveillance by the police when two pedestrians were stabbed on Sunday in Streatham, about five miles south of Central London. One of them, a man, was hospitalized with “life-threatening” injuries, according to the police. A third pedestrian, a woman, was believed to have been injured by glass after officers discharged their weapons, the police said. The Metropolitan Police said that officers from “a proactive counterterrorism operation” quickly responded to the “Islamist related” attack and killed Mr. Amman around 2 p.m. local time. The suspect was wearing what appeared to be an explosive device strapped to his body, but it was later found to be false, a police statement said. Mr. Amman was pronounced dead at the scene, said Ms. D’Orsi. Images on social media showed his body lying on the pavement outside a pharmacy while at least two officers pointed guns at him. The stabbings unfolded on Streatham High Road, a crowded thoroughfare filled with shops, cafes and a movie theater. Witnesses told reporters they had seen what appeared to be plainclothes officers chasing and shouting at a man before hearing shots. 1 mile Thames London A3 BRIXTON Rd. BRIXTON EAST DULWICH A23 A205 ENGLAND Streatham Site of Attack London STREATHAM HIGH Rd. Detail area By The New York Times Gulled Bulhan, 19, said that he had been crossing the street when he saw a man with a machete “and silver canisters on his chest” being chased by what appeared to be an armed undercover officer, according to the BBC. Karker Tahir, who worked at a shop nearby, said that the officers asked the man to halt before they shot him. “They kept telling him, ‘Stop, stop!’” Mr. Tahir told Sky News. “But he didn’t stop, and then I saw that they shot him three times,” he said. He added that the police told him and a colleague that “you have to leave the shop because he has a bomb in his bag.’” “I’m still shocked,” he said. A video circulating on Twitter showed what appeared to be at least two plainclothes officers drawing their weapons as they took cover behind a police car. A flurry of yellow ambulances and police cars with loud sirens and blinking lights also flooded the street. The speed with which the police declared a terrorism-related attack on Sunday stood in stark contrast to their announcements after previous attacks, when the authorities took hours or days to say that a terrorist assault had taken place. David Videcette, a former British counterterrorism detective, said on Sunday that though the investigation was still in its early stages, he believed that the police officers who quickly responded to the stabbing had been part of a focused surveillance operation. The Metropolitan Police’s counterterrorism unit was leading the investigation into the attack, according to Ms. D’Orsi. Mr. Amman had been arrested in May 2018 under the Terrorism Act. He was brought to the attention of the police by a blogger from Holland, who posted one of his Telegram messages online. The message was a photo that showed two guns and a knife “on top of an Islamic flag, with the caption “Armed and ready April 3” overlaid in Arabic,” the police said. He was sentenced in December 2018 to three years and four months in prison for six counts of collecting information “likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism” and seven counts of “dissemination of terrorist material,” the Metropolitan Police said in a statement at the time. According to the BBC, Mr. Amman was released about one week ago, after serving part of his sentence. The assault on Sunday had echoes of the London Bridge attack in November, when Usman Khan, a 28-year-old Muslim man who had served eight years in prison for his involvement in a plot to bomb the London Stock Exchange, killed two people near the bridge. During the attack, he wore a fake suicide vest, which experts have said is often meant to cause panic in members of the public and to keep law enforcement at a distance. He began stabbing people, the police said, after having participated in a conference on prison rehabilitation at a venue called Fishmongers’ Hall on the north bank of the River Thames. His attack ended when he was rushed by several men — one wielding a fire extinguisher and another brandishing an ornamental whale tusk torn from the wall of the hall — and the police shot him. After the London Bridge attack, the British government said that it would toughen terrorism sentences and end early release for serious offenders. Prime Minister Boris Johnson also declared that “this country will never be cowed or divided or intimidated by this sort of attack.” On Sunday evening, Mr. Johnson thanked the emergency services on Twitter and wrote, “My thoughts are with the injured and all those affected.” Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, condemned the attack in a statement on Sunday. “Terrorists seek to divide us and to destroy our way of life — here in London we will never let them succeed,” he said. The United States Embassy in Britain urged people on Twitter to avoid the area. The current terrorism-related threat level in Britain stands at “substantial,” meaning that an attack is “likely,” according to the country’s Security Service. Streatham is a relatively unusual location for a terrorist attack in London. It is a lively, gentrifying suburb of southern London between the district of Brixton and the borough of Croydon. But it has no famous landmarks and was described as “an area of quite high poverty” by Mr. Videcette. Other terrorist attacks in the British capital have taken place in more central boroughs. Bell Ribeiro-Addy, a member of Parliament from Streatham, told Sky News on Sunday that it was “shocking” that such an attack would happen in the area. But she called it an “isolated incident” and said, “Streatham is a resilient community.” On Sunday night, Mr. Johnson said in a statement that the government, which he said introduced more measures to combat terrorism after the 2019 London Bridge attack, will announce more changes to the system “for dealing with those convicted of terrorism offences” on Monday.",The New York Times
2020,U.K.’s New Immigration Rules Will Restrict Low-Skilled Workers,"Business groups denounced the plan, warning of looming labor shortages at a time of nearly full employment. LONDON — To a chorus of complaints from employers, Britain said on Wednesday that it would slam the door on low-skilled workers as it moved to cut overall immigration by locking migrants from Europe and elsewhere out of sectors like catering, construction, senior care and hospitality. Under new post-Brexit rules starting next January, migrants will have to meet a number of criteria to qualify for a work visa, including specific skills and an ability to speak English. Applicants will also be required to have a job offer with a minimum salary threshold of £25,600, about $33,300. (Salary requirements are lower for certain job categories with critical shortages, such as nursing.) That was lower than the £30,000 figure that some employers feared. But it could nonetheless have a chilling effect on recruitment for jobs that Britons seem to want to avoid, and at a time when many economists say the country is effectively at full employment. The changes are a remarkable turnaround for Britain, which in 2004 voluntarily opened its labor markets to citizens of former Communist nations that had joined the European Union — even while those workers remained barred for years from jobs in countries like Germany and France. Immigration was one of the driving forces behind the 2016 Brexit referendum. And after that vote, immigration from within continental Europe dropped. But with more migrants now coming to Britain from outside the European Union than from within the bloc, the Conservative government has continually failed to make good on its promises to cut net migration levels. On Wednesday, the government said that it would prioritize people with skills and that employers would have to wean themselves off a seemingly inexhaustible supply of cheap labor. Britain suffers from poor productivity growth, and some economists believe that a ready supply of cheap foreign labor has discouraged companies from investing in technology. Immigration opponents contend that it has also helped suppress wages for manual workers, whose earnings have stagnated. And they note that because Britain’s welfare system is easy to gain access to (if not particularly generous by European standards), government payments for low earning workers may have subsidized poorly paid non-Britons to the benefit of their employers. In response, the government is trying to alter the composition of the migrant work force, tilting it toward people with greater skills. “Today is a historic moment for the whole country,” the home secretary, Priti Patel, whose portfolio includes immigration, said in a statement. “We’re ending free movement, taking back control of our borders and delivering on the people’s priorities by introducing a new U.K. points-based immigration system, which will bring overall migration numbers down.” She said the new system would “attract the brightest and the best from around the globe, boosting the economy and our communities, and unleash this country’s full potential.” The more than three million immigrants from the European Union now in Britain will be allowed to stay, while a visa scheme for fruit pickers and other farm workers will be expanded in time for the 2020 harvest from 2,500 to 10,000 places. But with the British economy close to full employment, many companies are less concerned with attracting the best and brightest than with filling vacant positions. Employers have long argued that they cannot recruit local people to fill vacancies. In 2017, the fast-casual food chain Pret a Manger said that only one in 50 applicants for jobs in its restaurants was British. “In some sectors, firms will be left wondering how they will recruit the people needed to run their businesses,” Carolyn Fairbairn, the director general of the Confederation of British Industry, the country’s main business lobby group, said in a statement. “With already low unemployment, firms in care, construction, hospitality, food and drink could be most affected,” she said. The government’s argument that companies should invest in training Britons was no answer to the challenges posed by sectors reliant on low-skilled labor, Ms. Fairbairn said. “Firms know that hiring from overseas and investing in the skills of their work force and new technologies is not an ‘either or’ choice.” she said. “Both are needed to drive the economy forward.” As if to make that point, while the government announced its migration plans, it also claimed credit for the health of the jobs market. The employment rate is at a record high of 76.5 percent, while youth unemployment has almost halved since 2010 — dropping from 939,000 to 481,000 — the Treasury said. But as much as putting more Britons to work, the government seems intent on driving down the number of immigrants, even though concerns about immigration seem to have subsided since 2016. It estimates that 70 percent of European Union workers currently in Britain would not have met the new requirements, and that therefore the overall number of immigrants should fall in the future. As for the needs of employers, Ms. Patel said that there were more than 8.45 million people age 16 to 64 who were classified as economically inactive in Britain, and that the government wanted “businesses to invest in them, invest in skilling them up.” That could be easier said than done. More than six million of those people are say they are students, have a long-term illness or are looking after family or home. According to Britain’s Office for National Statistics, 6.6 million say they do not want a paid job, as opposed to nearly 1.9 million who say they would like to work. Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said it was “impossible to overstate how devastating” the policy would be to Scotland because of the country’s need to attract workers from abroad. Donald Macaskill, the chief executive of Scottish Care, which represents independent care providers, told BBC Scotland that the government had “not listened” to his group’s concerns and that the new rules would put the care sector at risk. The Institute for Economic Affairs, a free market research institute, said that a points-based immigration system was likely to have unintended consequences. “Businesses need a variety of workers — with a range of skills and salary expectations — and are better placed than the state to decide what is missing from the current labor market,” said the institute’s head of political economy, Kristian Niemietz. “The decision to reduce the salary threshold from £30,000 to £25,600 is a welcome move,” he said in a statement. “However, by deliberately focusing on limiting low-skilled migration, the scheme is likely to have a significant negative impact on staffing levels in many industries, including the care system, construction and hospitality, especially in the short-term.” Others argued that the policy would set back social justice. Mandu Reid, the leader of the Women’s Equality Party, said Britain’s government had ignored warnings that such a system would “disadvantage women because of the global gender pay gap.” The policy would also worsen the problems of the care sector, she said, with worker shortages possibly limiting the number of available slots, which in turn could force women to quit their jobs to become unpaid carers. Diane Abbott, who speaks for the opposition Labour Party on home affairs, told the BBC that the announcement sent a “toxic” message that immigration was a bad thing. Writing on Twitter, she added that it was a “conjurer’s trick” because most net migration to Britain was now from outside the European Union.",The New York Times
2020,U.N. Publishes List of Firms Doing Business With Israeli Settlements,"The list was praised by a range of rights groups and denounced by Israeli officials, who saw it as a capitulation to the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement. GENEVA — The United Nations on Wednesday published a much-delayed and contentious list of 112 companies doing business with Israeli settlements in occupied Palestinian territories, drawing praise from human rights groups and denunciations from Israel. Publication of the list was seen as a victory for the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, which has sought to pressure Israel economically over the settlements, which most of the world considers a violation of international law. The Israeli government views the B.D.S. movement, which has supporters in many countries including in the United States, as an anti-Semitic plan to delegitimize Israel. B.D.S. supporters deny that accusation. The United Nations said companies placed on the list had undertaken business “that raised particular human rights concerns” like facilitating the construction, expansion or maintenance of Israeli settlements or the demolition of Palestinian housing and property. Most of the listed companies are Israeli but a few are international companies, including Motorola Solutions, General Mills, Airbnb, TripAdvisor, and Expedia from the United States; Alstom and Egis Rail of France; and JC Bamford Excavators of Britain. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, which compiled and published the list, was acting in accordance with instructions by the Human Rights Council in 2016. In a reflection of the political sensitivity surrounding the list, the office said the list had no judicial or legal status. Still, the reaction among Israeli officials was furious. “Whoever boycotts us will be boycotted,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement that called the Human Rights Council “a biased body that is devoid of influence.” Israel’s foreign minister, Israel Katz, condemned its publication as a “shameful surrender” to countries and organizations that he said wanted to hurt Israel. Israel and its most important ally in the United Nations, the United States, have long condemned the Human Rights Council for what they describe as promotion of an anti-Israeli agenda. The United States withdrew from the council in June of 2018, calling its passage of numerous resolutions critical of Israel “clear proof that the council is motivated by political bias, not human rights.” Some of the Israeli reaction on Wednesday was equally unsparing of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, a former president of Chile. The Israeli opposition leader Benny Gantz, in condemning the publication, said Ms. Bachelet’s office had “lost touch with reality.” Israel’s mission in Geneva, home to Ms. Bachelet’s office, lamented that she had succumbed to pressure to publish the “defamatory blacklist” and had “lost all credibility or ability to promote human rights in our region.” Publication of the list would have profound consequences for Israel’s relations with the high commissioner’s office, the Israeli mission said. The Palestinian leadership, on the other hand, welcomed the move. Saeb Erekat, secretary general of the Palestine Liberation Organization, said it “enhances and consolidates the credibility of the Human Rights Council and international organizations in the face of the fierce attack and the intense pressure that the Trump administration places on these institutions.” He said it was a “crucial first step to restore hope in multilateralism and international law.” The Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement welcomed publication of the list, describing it as a “first significant and concrete step by any U.N. entity” toward holding Israeli and international businesses to account for profiting from Israeli settlements. Publication of the list came a day after the Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, denounced the Trump administration’s plan for Middle East peace in an address at the U.N. in New York. The plan would allow Israel to annex about 30 percent of the West Bank, including all its settlements there, while offering the Palestinians chunks of territory connected by tunnels and bridges that they could call a state. Human Rights Watch, an international human rights group, endorsed publication of the list, saying it served notice to companies that “to do business with illegal settlements is to aid in the commission of war crimes.” Omar Shakir, the group’s representative in Israel until his deportation in November, said in an email that the list’s release underscored international rejection of Israeli and U.S. efforts to legitimize Israeli settlements. The high commissioner’s office was supposed to produce the list in 2017. But it repeatedly delayed release, saying there were complications verifying companies’ data. An interim report at the start of 2018 said the office had identified 206 companies doing business with the settlements. Some were removed from the final list after further investigation showed they were not doing business with settlements. The practical effects of publishing the database are unclear given the report’s explicit statement that it has no legal standing. . Still, publication “can deliver a significant economic blow” to the companies named, Ofer Zalzberg, a senior analyst with the International Crisis Group said on Twitter. Even before its release, he added, some Israeli firms had encountered difficulties raising loans that required proof of legal conduct, merely on the strength of unconfirmed reports they might be included. The list formally connects companies to Israeli settlements that are illegal in international law and could prompt some companies doing business with them to end their ties, Mr. Zalzberg said. Most of the American companies on the list did not immediately respond to requests for comment. But General Mills said in an emailed statement that it had been listed because of a manufacturing facility that makes Pillsbury products like bread and croissants in an industrial park in the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Atarot. The statement said half the workers are Palestinian and that “every employee has full social benefits without prejudice to race, religion or nationality.” Isabel Kershner and David M. Halbfinger contributed reporting from Jerusalem and Rick Gladstone from New York.",The New York Times
2020,U.N.L.V. Ends San Diego State’s Unbeaten Streak,"With 26 consecutive wins, the fourth-ranked Aztecs had been the final undefeated men’s team. SAN DIEGO —Elijah Mitrou-Long scored 19 points, including two free throws with 11.5 seconds left, and U.N.L.V. handed No. 4 San Diego State its first loss of the season, a 66-63 defeat on Saturday, ending the Aztecs’ 26-game winning streak. San Diego State, which had been the only remaining undefeated men’s team, erased most of a 14-point deficit when it pulled to within 64-63 on Malachi Flynn’s 3-pointer with less than 20 seconds left. Mitrou-Long was fouled by Matt Mitchell with 11.5 seconds left and made both free throws. Flynn missed a contested 3-pointer with 3.3 seconds left and the ball went to the Runnin’ Rebels (15-14, 10-6 Mountain West Conference). After a long pass down the court, Mitchell ended up with the ball and his desperation shot at the buzzer fell short. San Diego State (26-1, 15-1) unveiled a banner for winning the regular-season conference championship before the game and then looked nothing like the team that raced to the best start in program history. The Aztecs trailed by 14 midway through the second half and were down 11 with 4:32 remaining. They were uncharacteristically porous on defense and sloppy on offense, missing easy shots and committing careless turnovers. San Diego State had been projected as the No. 1 seed in the East Region in the N.C.A.A. tournament by ESPN’s Joe Lunardi. Providing the Aztecs do not falter again, the loss could keep the Aztecs in the West as the No. 2 seed. Gonzaga is the projected No. 1 seed in the West, where the regionals will be at Staples Center in Los Angeles. The Aztecs will drop from their No. 4 spot in the Top 25, which matched the highest ranking in school history. The Top 25 was also shaken by No. 3 Kansas’ 64-61 win over No. 1 Baylor. U.N.L.V.’s Amauri Hardy scored 17 points, and Bryce Hamilton added 11 points and 10 rebounds. Flynn scored 24 points, Mitchell had 13 and Jordan Schakel had 10 for San Diego State. The Aztecs pulled within 62-60 on Flynn’s two free throws with 1:47 left and Arop Aguek’s layup with 25.6 seconds left. Mitrou-Long then made two free throws with 19.9 seconds left for a four-point lead. Hardy’s jumper gave U.N.L.V. a 44-30 lead three minutes into the second half before San Diego State pulled within seven. But Hardy then made a free throw and a layup to put the Runnin’ Rebels back up by double digits. U.N.L.V. took advantage of numerous breakdowns by the Aztecs to take a double-digit lead midway through the first half and were up 37-25 at halftime after a steal and dunk by Mitrou-Long. San Diego State never led after going up 14-13 on a Flynn 3-pointer, and then allowing U.N.L.V. to go on a 10-0 run. Mitrou-Long started it by converting a 4-point play when he hit a 3-pointer and was fouled by Flynn. The Aztecs’ only points in a four-minute span were two free throws apiece by Mitchell and Flynn. U.N.L.V. kept connecting, though, getting a bank shot by Hamilton and a 3-pointer by Mitrou-Long to take its first double-digit lead, 28-18 with 7:12 before halftime. San Diego next hosts Colorado State on Tuesday.U.N.L.V. will play Boise State in its home finale on Wednesday.",The New York Times
2020,U.S. Bars Sri Lankan Army Chief Accused of War Crimes,"The sanctions are the first international action against Sri Lanka stemming from its brutal civil war. Several members of the new government are also accused of wartime abuses. NEW DELHI — The United States has imposed an entry bar on Sri Lanka’s army chief, Lt. Gen. Shavendra Silva, citing his alleged involvement in war crimes during the final stages of the country’s civil war. The travel restriction on the general is the first significant international penalty to be imposed on a Sri Lankan official over atrocities committed during the country’s 26-year civil war with Tamil Tiger militants, which ground to a halt in 2009. The United Nations estimates that up to 40,000 Tamil civilians died in those final stages, many in extrajudicial killings, accusations the Sri Lankan government has denied. The move was a rebuke to a Sri Lankan government that is stacked with officials accused of rights abuses during the civil war — including Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who won presidential elections last November. Mr. Rajapaksa was the defense secretary during the final years of the war, and has appointed or promoted several officials accused of war crimes to important positions. Now, observers and diplomats fear Sri Lanka is slipping back into illiberal democracy. Since Mr. Rajapaksa became president, activists, journalists and opposition members have increasingly come under pressure from the government, which has harassed them through the courts and police investigations and used pro-government media outlets to hound anyone suspected of dissent. Successive Sri Lankan governments have ignored calls from rights groups and the international community to investigate and prosecute war crimes. The American sanctions may prompt other countries to follow suit, or increase pressure for Sri Lanka to pursue its own tribunals, however flawed they may be, observers said. The sanction against General Silva, announced by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, will prevent the general and his family from entering the United States. “I am designating Shavendra Silva ineligible for entry into the U.S. due to his involvement in extrajudicial killings during Sri Lanka’s civil war,” Mr. Pompeo tweeted on Friday. Sri Lanka’s government was quick to denounce the decision, with a statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs declaring that there were “no substantiated or proven allegations” against General Silva. “It is disappointing that a foreign government should question the prerogative of the democratically elected president,” the statement added. But for Tamils still struggling with trauma from the war, the bar on General Silva is both welcome and overdue. “Our people have been waiting for justice for over a decade, and they are finally beginning to see the first moves by the international community to hold government officials accountable for crimes committed during the war,” said Abraham Sumanthiran, a Sri Lankan lawmaker who represents a district in the island’s predominantly Tamil northern province. “At least now, the government of Sri Lanka must wake up to this reality and allow the perpetrators responsible for killing thousands of civilians to be brought to justice,” Mr. Sumanthiran added. Human Rights Watch welcomed the travel restriction and urged the European Union and Britain to consider similar sanctions against Mr. Silva and others accused of wartime violations. “Mr. Rajapaksa campaigned last year on a platform that dismissed all charges of war crimes and political killings by military personnel as politically motivated and promised to end the ongoing oversight by the U.N. Human Rights Council” to overlook accountability efforts, said Alan Keenan, a senior consultant at the International Crisis Group. Soon after his election, Mr. Rajapaksa appointed another retired general accused of war crimes, Maj. Gen. Kamal Gunaratne, as defense secretary. General Silva commanded the 58th division of the Sri Lankan Army during the final stages of the war, a unit the U.N. accuses of committing rights violations on a wide scale. Thousands of Tamils who surrendered to Mr. Silva’s division vanished without a trace.",The New York Times
2020,U.S. Charges Chinese Military Officers in 2017 Equifax Hacking,"The indictment suggests that the breach was part of a series of thefts by China to use the data to target American officials. WASHINGTON — Four members of China’s military were charged on Monday with hacking into Equifax, one of the nation’s largest credit reporting agencies, and stealing trade secrets and the personal data of about 145 million Americans in 2017. The charges underscored China’s quest to obtain Americans’ data and its willingness to flout a 2015 agreement with the United States to refrain from hacking and cyberattacks, all in an effort to expand economic power and influence. The indictment suggests the hack was part of a series of major data thefts organized by the People’s Liberation Army and Chinese intelligence agencies. China can use caches of personal information and combine them with artificial intelligence to better target American intelligence officers and other officials, Attorney General William P. Barr said. “This was a deliberate and sweeping intrusion into the private information of the American people,” he said. transcript I’m here to announce the indictment of Chinese military hackers, specifically foreign members of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army for breaking into the computer systems of the credit reporting agency, Equifax, and for stealing the sensitive personal information of nearly half of all American citizens, and also Equifax’s hard-earned intellectual property. Today’s announcement comes after two years of investigation. According to the nine-count indictment handed down by the grand jury in Atlanta, four members of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army are alleged to have conspired to hack Equifax as computer systems and commit economic espionage. This kind of attack on American industry is of a piece with other Chinese illegal acquisitions of sensitive personal data. The information stolen from Equifax, which is based in Atlanta, could reveal whether any American officials are under financial stress and thus susceptible to bribery or blackmail. Though not as large as other major breaches, the attack on Equifax was far more severe. Hackers stole names, birth dates and Social Security numbers of nearly half of all Americans — data that can be used to access information like medical histories and bank accounts. “This kind of attack on American industry is of a piece with other Chinese illegal acquisitions of sensitive personal data,” Mr. Barr said at a news conference announcing the charges, citing China’s theft of records in recent years from the government’s Office of Personnel Management, Marriott International and the insurance company Anthem. The biggest of those breaches was the theft in 2015 of roughly 22 million security clearance files from the government personnel office, which keeps track of federal employees and contractors. It quickly became clear that the data was of significant value to the Chinese government: American officials with security clearances — including some of the most senior members of the government — had to reveal foreign contacts, relationships including extramarital affairs, health histories and information about their children and other family members. The breach was so severe that the C.I.A. had to cancel assignments for undercover officers planning to go to China; though the agency did not submit its employees’ information to the personnel office, those individuals were often undercover as State Department or other government officials. Then it got worse. Hacks into Anthem’s database and Starwood hotels — later taken over by Marriott — appeared to be orchestrated by the same or related Chinese groups. The United States assessed that China was building a vast database of who worked with whom in national security jobs, where they traveled and what their health histories were, according to American officials. Over time, China can use the data sets to improve its artificial intelligence capabilities to the point where it can predict which Americans will be primed for future grooming and recruitment, John C. Demers, the assistant attorney general for national security at the Justice Department, said in an interview. The charges were only the second time that the Justice Department has indicted Chinese military officers on suspicions of hacking. In 2014, five Chinese military officers were indicted in data thefts from a labor union, critical infrastructure and companies including U.S. Steel. The Justice Department rarely secures indictments against members of foreign militaries or intelligence services, in part to avoid retaliation against American troops and spies, but Mr. Barr said it has made exceptions for state-sponsored actors who hacked into American networks to steal intellectual property or interfere in United States elections. In 2015, President Barack Obama and President Xi Jinping of China agreed to rein in economically motivated cyberattacks in order to cooperate with requests to investigate cybercrimes and to avoid targeting critical infrastructure in each other’s countries. While Justice Department officials do not believe economic espionage was the primary goal of the Equifax hacking, Mr. Demers said the attack could be seen as a violation of the spirit of that deal. “China sees economic interests and intelligence interests as one and the same,” he said. “Commercial benefits are national security benefits in China.” The indictment shows that in addition to signing treaties and adopting certain conventions, the United States must also be willing to publicly identify and indict state actors in criminal cases, said Megan Brown, the leader of the cyber and privacy practice at the law firm Wiley Rein. “This is how we will drive international norms: by indicting people, not solely by negotiating treaties and adopting conventions,” she said. The nine-count indictment accused the Chinese military of hacking into Equifax’s computer networks, maintaining unauthorized access to them and stealing sensitive, personally identifiable information about Americans. Months before the attack, the government warned Equifax that its network contained a vulnerability, but the company did not patch it, according to government documents. The hacking was “entirely preventable,” a congressional study concluded in 2018. The defendants — Wu Zhiyong, Wang Qian, Xu Ke and Liu Lei, all members of the People’s Liberation Army — exploited that weakness in May 2017 to break into the network, conduct weeks of surveillance and steal Equifax employee login credentials before filching trade secrets and data. They masked their activity by using encrypted communications and routing their internet traffic through 34 servers in nearly 20 countries, including Switzerland and Singapore, according to prosecutors. For the most part, they managed to erase their tracks inside of the Equifax network. But investigators eventually traced their activity to two China-based servers that connected directly to Equifax. Investigators identified the four indicted officers by reviewing forensic data, analyzing the malware used in the attack and establishing a digital footprint that linked them to the intrusion, David Bowdich, the deputy director of the F.B.I., said at the news conference. In the months after Equifax was hacked, security researchers concluded that criminals, not state actors, had siphoned information over a few months after gaining access to the network. That alone was enough to force the resignation of the company’s chief executive. But that explanation appeared increasingly suspect over time because the Equifax data — like the information gleaned from the Office of Personnel Management — did not appear broadly for sale on the so-called dark web, where illicitly obtained information is often sold for use in cybercrime. Law enforcement officials have not yet found evidence that the Chinese government has used the data from the Equifax hacking, Mr. Bowdich said. The company reiterated on Monday the difficulty of warding off state-sponsored attacks. Companies often fall back on that explanation; Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, pushed back after the indictment was made public. “A company in the business of collecting and retaining massive amounts of Americans’ sensitive personal information must act with the utmost care — and face any consequences that arise from that failure,” he said in a statement. The hackers’ encryption of their operations inside Equifax’s networks is a common technique and has raised new questions about why such sensitive data in American databases is not legally required to be encrypted, experts noted. Many companies have resisted such regulation, in part because encrypted data can be harder for them to search. China has “pioneered an expansive approach to stealing innovation,” Christopher A. Wray, the director of the F.B.I., said last week at a conference on the threats posed by China. He said China was racing to obtain information about sectors as diverse as agriculture and medicine to advance its economy, using a mix of legal means like company acquisitions and illicit acts like spying and cyberattacks. “They’ve shown that they’re willing to steal their way up the economic ladder at our expense,” Mr. Wray said. The outcry from consumers and lawmakers after the Equifax breach and the company’s clumsy response was strong: Its executives were chastised, and Equifax eventually settled with regulators for up to $700 million. But of the 147 million consumers affected, only a little more than 10 percent had filed for some type of compensation as of Dec. 1. Of those, more than 4.5 million filed claims for a cash payment of up to $125, one of the settlement options. But the company had set aside only $31 million for that option, which amounts to less than $7 a person. While the thefts present a national security risk, Americans have “almost become as a country immune to these breaches,” Mr. Bowdich said. “You hear about it in the news and you think, ‘Well there goes my credit card number, my Social Security number, my bank account information,’ and you sign up for another year of free credit card monitoring information,” he said. “We cannot think like that in this country.” David E.

2020,"U.S. Charges Huawei With Racketeering, Adding Pressure on China","The indictment is the Trump administration’s latest move in its fight against the Chinese tech giant, which it deems a security threat. WASHINGTON — The U.S. government has charged Huawei and two of its subsidiaries with federal racketeering and conspiracy to steal trade secrets from American companies, a significant escalation in the Trump administration’s legal fight with the Chinese telecommunications company. In a federal indictment unsealed on Thursday in the Eastern District of New York, the Department of Justice accused Huawei and its affiliates of a “pattern of racketeering activity” and said the companies had worked to steal trade secrets from six American firms. The stolen information included source code, as well as the manuals for wireless technology. The indictment did not identify the six companies, but a source familiar with the investigation — as well as court filings made in several civil lawsuits — indicated they were Cisco Systems, Motorola Solutions, Fujitsu, Quintel Technology, T-Mobile and CNEX Labs. “The new charges in this case relate to the alleged decades-long efforts by Huawei, and several of its subsidiaries, both in the U.S. and in the People’s Republic of China, to misappropriate intellectual property, including from six U.S. technology companies, in an effort to grow and operate Huawei’s business,” the Justice Department said in a news release. The charges add more weight to Washington’s pressure campaign against Huawei, which is already barred from buying many American products and is viewed by the Trump administration as a threat to national security. The escalation is also part of the administration’s attempt to crack down on what it says is a pattern of Chinese espionage and theft aimed at giving Beijing a technological edge. On Monday, four members of China’s military were charged with hacking into Equifax, one of the nation’s largest credit reporting agencies, and stealing trade secrets and the personal data of about 145 million Americans in 2017. Also on Thursday, the Department of Commerce extended the temporary license that allows American companies to continue doing some business with Huawei. It will now expire in April. The new indictment goes beyond the Justice Department’s earlier allegations of trade-secret theft and sanctions violations. It applies a federal racketeering law that has historically been used to bring down mob leaders and gang kingpins and allows the government to file charges that would otherwise fall outside the statute of limitations. The criminal conspiracy that Huawei is accused of carrying out has been going on since at least 1999, according to the Justice Department. Huawei officials argued that the latest charges were not new allegations and appeared to be part of a larger campaign against the company. It is confident that it will be exonerated in the criminal justice system, said Andy Purdy, the chief security officer for Huawei in the United States. He said the U.S. government was trying to hurt Huawei by pressuring allies not to use its equipment and was attempting to block American companies from selling parts to the Chinese firm. Both campaigns will ultimately hurt America, Mr. Purdy said, by eliminating jobs in the United States and reducing competition in the telecommunications industry. He said the U.S. government was engaged in a “campaign to carpet bomb Huawei out of existence,” adding: “It seems like the United States is not thinking about the significance of this.” The indictment portrays Huawei as orchestrating a steady, if not sophisticated, campaign to steal trade secrets. For instance, the indictment alleged that in 2004, a Huawei employee sneaked back to a Chicago trade show to steal a competitor’s technology. The employee “was discovered in the middle of the night after the show had closed for the day in the booth of a technology company” and was found “removing the cover from a networking device and taking photographs of the circuitry inside.” The individual wore a badge listing his employer as “Weihua” — an anagram of Huawei — according to the indictment. In another episode, prosecutors say, Huawei planned “countermeasures” against a company making data storage technology. It invited leaders of the firm to make a presentation about its plans, then asked for a copy of the slides used in the presentation and “immediately” shared it with engineers at its subsidiary working on a competing product, according to the indictment. Huawei has had legal disputes with several of the companies it is accused of stealing from. Cisco, a computer networking equipment maker in San Jose, Calif., sued Huawei in 2003, claiming the Chinese company infringed on numerous patents and illegally copied its software source code and documentation. The suit was dropped about a year later in exchange for a promise of product changes from Huawei. Quintel sued Huawei in 2015, claiming it had stolen its antenna technology. The litigation was settled in 2018. Motorola settled intellectual-property lawsuits with the Chinese company in 2011. T-Mobile was named in the earlier charges against Huawei, when prosecutors alleged that the manufacturer had tried to steal details about a robot, named Tappy, used by the wireless carrier. Prosecutors also accused Huawei of helping the Iranian government install surveillance equipment to monitor and detain antigovernment protesters in Tehran in 2009. Last year, the Justice Department charged Huawei’s chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, with outlining a decade-long attempt by the company to steal trade secrets, obstruct a criminal investigation and evade economic sanctions on Iran. Ms. Meng was also named in the Justice Department’s indictment on Thursday. Ms. Meng is in Canada, out of jail on bail of 10 million Canadian dollars, or $7.5 million, awaiting extradition to the United States. She is under 24-hour surveillance and must wear a GPS tracker on her ankle. Gary Botting, a leading extradition expert in Canada, said the new charges were unlikely to have much effect on Ms. Meng’s case in Canada since they were, in his view, “too little, too late.” The judge in that case has been deliberating on whether extradition would meet a fundamental requirement under Canadian law: that the crime Ms. Meng is accused of in the United States constitutes a crime in Canada. While racketeering is not a crime under Canadian law, Mr. Botting said Canada’s extradition treaty with the United States allowed aspects of racketeering to be legal grounds for an extradition. And Canadian prosecutors representing the United States could decide to add new charges. The White House has looked to ratchet up the pressure on Huawei for years, with members of Congress from both parties backing its efforts. The new charges may give more fodder to the company’s critics on Capitol Hill, who have been pushing to make sure Huawei has no role in the next generation of wireless networks, known as 5G. “The indictment paints a damning portrait of an illegitimate organization that lacks any regard for the law,” said the top lawmakers on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Richard M. Burr, Republican of North Carolina, and Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia. Under the Trump administration, the Justice Department has focused on combating an array of threats that China poses to the United States and its allies in the West, including theft of trade secrets and espionage, as the country seeks to expand its sphere of economic and military power. Huawei, whose equipment powers telecom networks, sits squarely at the center of both of those concerns. Intelligence community analysts say Huawei can use its network equipment to monitor traffic across a network and potentially engage in unlawful surveillance. Mr. Purdy of Huawei pushed back against those claims, saying control of those mobile networks is firmly with the carriers that build and operate them. Huawei is also the leading supplier on every continent except for North America of equipment for 5G networks, which will underpin telecommunications and advanced technologies like self-driving cars. As countries around the world migrate their communications systems to 5G, and as more technology innovation is built on top of it, Huawei is in a position to gain a huge economic edge over U.S. tech giants, which have long been at the forefront of innovation and have lately powered the U.S. economy. Attorney General William P. Barr said in a speech last week that the Chinese government was using “every lever of power to expand its 5G market share” because it would gain ground in every technology that then touched 5G. “Our economic future is at stake,” Mr. Barr said in the speech, during a conference in Washington on threats that China poses to the United States. “The risk of losing the 5G struggle with China should vastly outweigh other considerations.” For years, American intelligence officials have tried to convince companies and governments around the world that Huawei’s equipment could give Beijing access to sensitive communications networks. But that global campaign has faltered, as countries like Britain and Saudi Arabia opt to use Huawei’s gear in their 5G networks. In January, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Britain believed that any risk could be managed and that the company’s products could be used in a portion of Britain’s 5G network. Germany is said to be close to a decision on whether to allow the company to work on its network, as well. As its global campaign to bar Huawei has faltered, American officials have argued that the United States should take aggressive action to help the world develop an alternative to Huawei’s products. Mr. Barr, in his speech, argued that the United States should consider providing direct or indirect financial support to Nokia and Ericsson, two European companies that are the primary competitors to Huawei’s networking gear.

2020,U.S. Designates China’s Official Media as Operatives of the Communist State,"The move is the latest in the Trump administration’s efforts to counter Beijing’s influence and intelligence operations in the United States. WASHINGTON — For years they have operated as news organizations in the United States, deploying scores of journalists to cover the major events of the day and to report back to their readers and viewers at home, even if the most important of those was the leadership of the Communist Party of China. Now, the Trump administration has declared them not practitioners of journalism, but rather operatives of the Chinese state. The State Department told China on Tuesday that its five foremost news agencies — Xinhua, CGTN, China Radio, China Daily and The People’s Daily — will officially be treated as foreign government functionaries, subject to similar rules as diplomats stationed in the United States. The new action was described on Tuesday afternoon by two senior State Department officials. The decision — debated in Washington for years but never carried out, in part because of concerns over restricting the freedom of the press — comes at a time when the administration has moved aggressively on multiple fronts to fight what officials describe as extensive Chinese influence and intelligence operations in the United States. In the past month alone, prosecutors have brought cases against Chinese intelligence operations involving scientific research at Harvard and the 2017 hacking of Equifax, one of the United States’ largest credit reporting agencies. They also charged Huawei, the telecommunications company, and two of its subsidiaries with federal racketeering and conspiracy to steal trade secrets. The legal assault on Chinese entities has unfolded even as bilateral tensions have flared over China’s handling of the coronavirus epidemic, which prompted the evacuation of American diplomats and other citizens from Wuhan, the city in central China at the source of the outbreak. It is part of a concerted effort to put new pressure on China’s government barely a month after President Trump signed a temporary truce in the trade war he started. Some of China’s critics in Washington have long called for action against the country’s state media. The senior State Department officials described the new restrictions as part of the Trump administration’s strategy to confront great power adversaries. The officials would not discuss whether Russian media working in the United States would face similar designations. The State Department officials, who briefed reporters only on the condition of anonymity despite requests for public comment, said the new designation would not impede the five Chinese news agencies’ ability to report, broadcast or carry out other journalistic activity. Instead, the officials said, it requires the five organizations to provide names, personal details and turnover of staff in the United States to the State Department. The news organizations would also need to report whether they own or lease property in the United States. The officials would not comment on how the new registration requirements would be enforced. Nor would they predict what backlash foreign journalists in China might face as a result of the designations. One State Department official cited an already tough working environment for journalists in China, where he said that “freedom of the press is under a severe siege.” He also described the five Chinese news organizations as “part and parcel of the P.R.C. propaganda apparatus,” using an abbreviation for the People’s Republic of China. Jonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University, echoed a suspicion held in national security circles that the decision could lead to retaliation against American journalists who work in China — especially those affiliated with the United States government, like Voice of America. “China has long masked intelligence operations with journalistic credentials,” Mr. Turley said. “The danger is China could reciprocate against our journalists.” He added, “The difference is our journalists in China are actually journalists.” The two State Department officials and a third Trump administration official said the restrictions against the Chinese news employees — similar to those required by diplomats in the Chinese Embassy in Washington or in consulates around the United States — were extended because they were substantially owned and effectively controlled by China’s government. The American government has already targeted some of the news agencies under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, which requires anyone lobbying on behalf of foreign governments to submit regular reports on their activities to the Justice Department. Partly in response to Russia’s interference in the 2016 election, the administration has forced parts of China’s official propaganda apparatus to register. They included CGTN, the English-language channel of China Central Television, Beijing’s main domestic network, which was forced to register beginning last year. One of the others, China Daily, has been registered as a foreign agent since 1983. The new action treats the news organizations as part of China’s diplomatic missions whose activities are regulated under the Foreign Missions Act. Enacted in 1982, the law is a legal tool intended to ensure equitable treatment for American diplomats serving in countries around the world, often under onerous government restrictions. It deals with such things as providing visas, acquiring property and extending diplomatic immunity in matters of criminal wrongdoing. Last fall, for example, the State Department began requiring Chinese diplomats to give notice before they have any meetings with local or state officials and with educational and research institutions. That move came in retaliation for similar Chinese government rules imposed on American diplomats. But the five Chinese news agencies whose employees are working in the United States will be exempted from that requirement, the State Department officials said. American officials have become much more suspicious of the activities of Chinese diplomats and have increased scrutiny of their travels and meetings. In September, the State Department secretly expelled two Chinese Embassy officials in Washington after they were caught driving on a sensitive military base in Virginia with their wives. The expulsions appear to be the first of Chinese diplomats suspected of espionage in more than 30 years. It was not clear why the Trump administration decided to act now on the Chinese news organizations, although the administration official said the move reflected long-simmering frustration over the forbearance shown to Chinese official media in the United States, despite evidence that the organizations serve as a front for intelligence agencies. The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, a congressionally mandated agency, warned in its report in 2017 that “Chinese intelligence-gathering and information-warfare efforts are known to involve staff of Chinese state-run media organizations.” In recent years, a growing number of American officials have discussed imposing strict visa reciprocity on Chinese news organizations after Beijing increasingly began limiting visas and residence permits issued to foreign journalists and curtailed the lengths of those documents. Unlike Russia’s information campaigns in the United States, which have been artfully tailored to sow distrust in the American government and the democratic system, China’s media efforts in the United States have tended to reflect more traditional forms of government propaganda. Reports on CGTN or in China Daily, for example, are more likely to extol the country’s economic and diplomatic achievements than to denigrate American democracy. Xinhua, which is China’s main news agency and serves as a channel for most major announcements, maintains bureaus around the world, with its largest in Washington and New York. It is common practice for many of them to produce internal documents, intended for consumption not by the public but by high-ranking officials. Some disagreed with the action. “I don’t see any evidence that they are doing anything nefarious that would warrant this response,” said Maria Repnikova, an assistant professor at Georgia State University and the author of “Media Politics in China: Improvising Power Under Authoritarianism.” China Daily, the English-language version of one of the main state newspapers, regularly publishes advertising supplements in newspapers around the country, including The New York Times. They generally offer an informative, if anodyne, view of world affairs refracted through the lens of the Communist Party. “The China Daily advertisement insert is clearly labeled and meets our advertising acceptability standards,” said Ari Isaacman Bevacqua, a Times spokeswoman. “The New York Times covers China thoroughly and aggressively, and at no time has advertising influenced our coverage.” However, some experts on China say China Daily pushes insidious propaganda onto foreign readers, especially in its attempts to whitewash vast human rights abuses against Uighurs, Tibetans and other ethnic minorities. Sophie Richardson, the China director for Human Rights Watch, has repeatedly denounced China Daily. The paper, she said on Twitter last year, was “nothing more than a mouthpiece for a government that conflates peaceful criticism with terrorism, crushes peaceful protests, and arbitrarily detains shocking numbers of #Uyghurs and other #Muslims.” One issue in particular drew the attention of the White House in 2018. An advertisement placed in The Des Moines Register highlighted the benefits of free trade for Iowa’s farmers at a time Mr. Trump was excoriating what he called China’s unfair trade practices. Mr. Trump, in typical fashion, responded on Twitter. Lara Jakes reported from Washington, and Steven Lee Myers from Beijing. Edward Wong contributed reporting from Washington.",The New York Times
2020,U.S. Divided Over Chinese Drone Bans,"The Interior Department grounded its fleet over national security concerns. But other agencies are more worried about the impact of an all-out ban. WASHINGTON — Federal agencies are split on how best to handle national security concerns surrounding popular and ubiquitous Chinese-made drones, with some policymakers chafing at more protectionist approaches. The Department of the Interior, which uses drones for tasks like wildlife conservation and the monitoring of the state of infrastructure, grounded all those made in China or built with Chinese parts in October. It reaffirmed that decision in January, saying its entire fleet of 810 drones would essentially remain out of commission until it can confirm they pose no security threat. Yet the Department of Agriculture and the Office of Management and Budget raised warnings last year about congressional legislation that would make it impossible for the United States government to buy Chinese drones at all. The Agriculture Department, which uses drones to survey farmland, for example, said it could limit the ability “to carry out our mission-crucial work” and “halt” the Forest Service’s use of drones altogether. The Trump administration has engaged in a steady campaign to wall off America from Chinese technology, saying the Chinese government could use it to spy on the United States. The administration has been trying to keep Huawei, the telecom equipment giant, out of the next generation of wireless networks both in the United States and abroad and has increased scrutiny of Chinese investment in sectors deemed “critical,” like telecom and tech. Federal officials have also investigated whether mobile apps owned by Chinese companies could leak sensitive data. Their efforts have been cheered on by members of Congress from both parties, many of whom have written legislation that would restrict China’s ability to operate in the United States. But the debate over drones, which are primarily made either in China or with Chinese parts, shows how attempts to “decouple” America from Chinese industry can crash into the realities of the global tech supply chain. DJI, a drone manufacturer based in Shenzhen, China, is by far the industry leader, with analysts estimating it has a market share of 70 percent or higher. Its drones are used not only by government agencies but by legions of hobbyists. Even some competing products that are made in America include Chinese parts. “Decoupling isn’t like a magic wand where you just say, ‘We’re not going to use these people anymore,’” said James Lewis, the director of the Technology Policy Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. The prevalence of DJI’s products has drawn concern from government officials for years. In 2017, a memo from the Los Angeles office of Immigration and Customs Enforcement said it had “moderate confidence” that DJI was providing critical United States “infrastructure and law enforcement data to the Chinese government.” While DJI denied the claims, the concerns have persisted. Last year, Congress approved a measure blocking defense agencies from buying Chinese drones. A bipartisan group of lawmakers has also introduced legislation that would effectively bar federal agencies from buying drones made in China, accusing the companies of intellectual property theft and endangering American security. The proposed law triggered concerns from various corners of the executive branch. In letters obtained by The New York Times, Stephen L. Censky, the deputy secretary of the Department of Agriculture, told the acting director of the Office of Management and Budget that the agency had major concerns with the law. A letter, dated late September, said the law would “severely impact the establishment, development and implementation” of the Agriculture Department’s drone program “to carry out our mission-crucial work.” Mr. Censky also said in the letter that drones could be useful to the agency’s efforts in nature conservation, combating wildfires and monitoring the health of forests. By December, the agency had seen a new version of the draft law, according to a second letter, but Mr. Censky said it was still “concerned that none of our previous comments were considered or integrated into this rewrite.” The budget office also said it opposed a version of the ban in a memo circulated in September, which was first reported by Politico. It expressed concerns that prohibiting government use of Chinese drones would prompt Chinese officials to do the same to American companies, hindering their growth. And it said that “banning the use of these systems without any viable alternatives would put undue burden on federal agencies.” The next month, the Interior Department grounded any drones made in China, or with Chinese parts. Last week, it formalized the move — with officials saying that it was “without question” aimed at China — while allowing drones to be used in emergencies. The aircraft will not be used again until they can be vetted for security flaws, the agency has said. Nonemergency missions will use other aircraft or helicopters. The Department of the Interior, the Department of Agriculture, and the Office of Management and Budget did not respond to requests for comment. Representative Mike Gallagher, a Wisconsin Republican and a sponsor of the legislation that would bar federal agencies from buying Chinese drones, said he was unaware of the letters from the Agriculture Department but noted that defense agencies had raised concerns about the flying devices. “While I would defer to the Department of Agriculture on the Dairy Margin Coverage Program, when it comes to threats to our national security, I am inclined to agree with the security-minded experts,” he said. Critics of DJI say that it’s important for the United States to develop its own drone companies that can compete with Chinese firms. One California company, Skydio, makes its drones stateside but still uses some Chinese parts. Its chief executive, Adam Bry, said that all the core components were American — and that the company was moving away from using the Chinese parts altogether. DJI has tried to soothe the Trump administration’s fears, moving some of its production to California and introducing a version of its product explicitly for government users. In a statement, DJI said it supported the development of standards to defuse security concerns about drones, instead of an all-out ban on Chinese products. “They are protectionist ploys to exclude successful competitors in favor of domestic suppliers that don’t exist,” a spokesman said. “Federal officials and lawmakers supporting this country of origin restriction have little understanding of how professionals use drones to do their work, and cannot explain how using drones to manage wildfires, support wildlife conservation and monitor the health of forests is somehow sensitive or puts U.S. national security at risk,” he said.",The New York Times
2020,U.S. Faces Tough ‘Great Game’ Against China in Central Asia and Beyond,"News Analysis The Trump administration sees former Soviet republics in the heart of Asia as critical battlegrounds in the struggle with China over global influence. But American policies could fall short. KHIVA, Uzbekistan — Inside the ancient walls of the Silk Road oasis town of Khiva, China has put down a marker of its geopolitical ambitions. A sign promotes a Chinese aid project to renovate a once-crumbling mosque and a faded madrasa. Outside the town’s northern gate, a billboard-size video screen shows clips of President Shavkat Mirziyoyev of Uzbekistan meeting with world leaders. President Xi Jinping of China features prominently, but there are no shots of President Trump. That China is advertising its aid efforts so boldly in this remote outpost linking Asia and Europe — where camel caravans once arrived after crossing the Kyzylkum and Karakum Deserts — is the kind of action these days that sets off alarm bells among American officials. The Trump administration is trying with greater force to insert itself into the political and economic life of Central Asia to counter China’s presence. American officials see the countries in the heart of the continent’s vast, arid steppe as critical battlegrounds in the struggle with China over global influence. “Whenever we speak to countries around the world, we want to make sure that we’re doing what the people of those countries want,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said last week at a news conference in Tashkent, the capital of Uzbekistan. The Uzbeks want a “good, balanced relationship,” he said. “They have long borders,” he added. “They sit in a region where China and Russia are both present.” Leaders of the five Central Asian nations that became independent republics after the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991 — Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan — are used to walking a regional tightrope. The area was contested during the so-called Great Game of the 19th century, when the British and Russian empires competed to establish influence and control. Now a new game is underway. And officials in Central Asia, like many of their counterparts around the world, are hedging their bets when it comes to aligning with Washington or Beijing. “I’d like to once again note that we want to see Central Asia as a region of stable development, prosperity and cooperation,” said Abdulaziz Kamilov, the foreign minister of Uzbekistan. “And we would really not like to feel on ourselves unfavorable political consequences in relation to some competition in our region between large powers.” The State Department released a Central Asia strategy document on Feb. 5 that said the top priority was to “support and strengthen the sovereignty and independence of the Central Asian states” — a reference to warding off the influence of China and Russia. It is a tough mission for the United States. The nations are in China’s and Russia’s backyards, and there have been decades of close interactions among them. Mr. Xi has made multiple state visits to the countries since he took power in 2012, most recently last year. The Trump administration has hit major setbacks in its attempts to build a global coalition against projects by the Chinese government and by Chinese companies. In fact, Britain said on Jan. 28 that it would not ban technology made by Huawei, a Chinese telecom giant, from its high-speed 5G wireless network, despite intense pressure from American officials. Mr. Pompeo made London his first stop on a recent six-day trip to Europe and Central Asia, and he said there on Jan. 30 that the Chinese Communist Party was “the central threat of our times.” The next day, he spoke about China with leaders in Ukraine. But words go only so far. The Americans fail to present an economical alternative to Huawei. And the Trump administration is discovering that its belligerent approach toward allies has a cost when it comes to China strategy. Withdrawing from the global Paris climate agreement and the landmark Iran nuclear deal, starting trade conflicts with friendly governments and berating members of NATO make those nations less likely to listen to Washington’s entreaties on China. A recent policy report on China by the Center for a New American Security said “critical areas of U.S. policy remain inconsistent, uncoordinated, underresourced and — to be blunt — uncompetitive and counterproductive to advancing U.S. values and interests.” Some analysts say the constant hawkish talk on China by Mr. Pompeo and other American officials paradoxically makes the United States look weak. “And that last point is just the core of it for me. A central problem of US foreign policy today, not just in Central Asia, is that it feels increasingly reactive to me — back footed and on defense, not least in the face of Chinese initiatives,” Evan A. Feigenbaum, a deputy assistant secretary of state on Central Asia and South Asia in the George W. Bush administration who is now at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, wrote on Twitter. “To wit, the secretary of state just made the first visit by America’s top diplomat to Central Asia in five years — five! — but spent a hefty chunk of it talking about China,” he wrote. “The challenge for the US is to get off its reactive back foot and be proactive and on offense.” The United States did not pursue serious partnerships in Central Asia until after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, when the Pentagon needed regional bases for the war in Afghanistan. China has taken a different approach. Beijing says it will help build up the region under what it calls the Silk Road Economic Belt, which is part of the larger Belt and Road Initiative, a blanket term for global infrastructure projects that, according to Beijing, amount to $1 trillion of investment. The Trump administration says the projects are potential debt traps, but many countries have embraced them. The economic liberalization of Uzbekistan under Mr. Mirziyoyev, who took power in 2016 after the death of a longtime dictator, has resulted in greater trade with China. China is Uzbekistan’s largest trading partner, and trade totaled almost $6.3 billion in 2018, a nearly 50 percent increase from 2017, according to Xinhua, the official Chinese news agency. Chinese goods, including Huawei devices, are everywhere in Samarkand, Bukhara, Tashkent and other Uzbek cities. Uzbekistan is also committing to being part of rail and road networks that China is building across Central Asia. Since 2001, China has worked with Central and South Asian nations as well as Russia in a multilateral group, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, to address security issues. China’s People’s Liberation Army has gained a new foothold in the region, in the form of a base in Tajikistan’s Pamir Mountains. For at least three years, Chinese troops have quietly kept watch from two dozen buildings and lookout towers near the Tajik-Chinese border and the remote Wakhan Corridor of Afghanistan. The Afghan corridor is a strategic strip of land whose borders were drawn by Britain and Russia during the original Great Game as a buffer zone. The United States had hundreds of troops at an air base in Uzbekistan that it operated with the Uzbeks. But it wants to move the relationship well beyond the military. “We want private investment, American private investment sector, to flow between our two nations,” Mr. Pompeo said. He added that the United States had committed $100 million to programs in Uzbekistan last year, and that it would give $1 million to help develop financial markets and another $1 million to increase trade and “connectivity” between Uzbekistan and Afghanistan. On his trip, Mr. Pompeo also made a demand regarding human rights in China as he met with officials in Tashkent and Nur-Sultan, the capital of Kazakhstan. He raised the issue of China’s internment camps that hold one million or more Muslims and urged the Central Asian nations, which are predominantly Muslim, to speak out against the camps. In Nur-Sultan, he met with Kazakhs who have had family members detained in the camps. Yet, as in other predominantly Muslim nations, Central Asian leaders have remained silent on this. (Mr. Trump himself has said nothing, and Mr. Pompeo has been accused of hypocrisy by excluding Taiwan, the democratic island that China threatens, from a religious freedom alliance.) In December, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, Geng Shuang, denounced Washington’s prodding of Central Asian nations on the Muslim issue: “If the United States once again tries to get up to its old tricks, it will certainly still be futile for them.” Trump administration policies perceived as anti-Muslim undermine trust in Washington. On Jan. 31, Mr. Trump added Kyrgyzstan and five other nations, all with substantial Muslim populations, to a list of countries whose citizens are restricted in traveling to the United States. In an interview in Nur-Sultan, a Kazakh television journalist, Lyazzat Shatayeva, asked Mr. Pompeo, “What do you think that signals to the other countries and other governments in Central Asia on why it happened?” Mr. Pompeo said Kyrgyzstan must “fix” certain things: “passport issues, visa issues, visa overstays.” “When the country fixes those things,” he said, “we’ll get them right back in where they can come travel to America.”",The New York Times
2020,"U.S. Health Workers Responding to Coronavirus Lacked Training and Protective Gear, Whistle-Blower Says","Team members were not properly trained, lacked necessary gear and moved freely around and off military bases where Americans were quarantined, a complaint says. Get an informed guide to the global outbreak with our daily Coronavirus
 newsletter.
 WASHINGTON — Federal health employees interacted with Americans quarantined for possible exposure to the coronavirus without proper medical training or protective gear, then scattered into the general population, according to a government whistle-blower who lawmakers say faced retaliation for reporting concerns. The team was “improperly deployed” to two military bases in California to assist the processing of Americans who had been evacuated from coronavirus hot zones in China and elsewhere, according to a portion of a narrative account shared with Congress and obtained by The New York Times ahead of a formal complaint to the Office of the Special Counsel, an independent government agency that handles federal whistle-blower complaints. Staff members from the Department of Health and Human Services’ Administration for Children and Families were sent to Travis Air Force Base and March Air Reserve Base in late January and early February and were ordered to enter quarantined areas, including a hangar where coronavirus evacuees were being received, the complaint said. They were not provided safety-protocol training until five days into their assignment, said the whistle-blower, who is described as a senior leader at the health agency. Without proper training or equipment, some of the exposed staff members moved freely around and off the bases, with at least one person staying in a nearby hotel and leaving California on a commercial flight. Many were unaware of the need to test their temperatures three times a day. “I soon began to field panicked calls from my leadership team and deployed staff members expressing concerns with the lack of H.H.S. communication and coordination, staff being sent into quarantined areas without personal protective equipment, training or experience in managing public health emergencies, safety protocols and the potential danger to both themselves and members of the public they come into contact with,” the whistle-blower wrote. House Democrats said on Thursday that the official who voiced concerns to superiors about the situation was subjected to professional retaliation. In a statement on Thursday, the Department of Health and Human Services acknowledged the complaint, which was first reported by The Washington Post, without elaborating. “We take all whistle-blower complaints very seriously and are providing the complainant all appropriate protections under the Whistleblower Protection Act,” said Caitlin B. Oakley, a deputy assistant secretary and a national spokeswoman for the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs. “We are evaluating the complaint and have nothing further to add at this time.” A former department official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said that two senior officials there who were directly involved with the situation believed the whistle-blower was making the accusations in an effort to protect their job after being told they would be reassigned. The officials involved contended that the teams were not in any danger, the person said, and that testing was not done because none of the personnel showed symptoms of being sick. The account surfaced as President Trump seeks to play down the danger of a domestic coronavirus outbreak amid bipartisan concern about a sluggish and disjointed response by the administration to an illness that public health officials have said is likely to spread across the United States. The first American case of coronavirus in a patient with no known contact with hot zones or other coronavirus patients emerged this week near Travis Air Force Base. The complaint raised questions about whether the Trump administration had taken adequate precautions in its handling of the virus, and whether Mr. Trump’s minimization of the risks had been mirrored by other top officials when confronted with potentially disturbing developments. Updated Feb. 29, 2020 The workers who were sent to the scene were not medical professionals and usually help low-income Americans returning to the United States from foreign countries during crises. In a narrative prepared for Congress, the whistle-blower painted a grim portrait of staff members who found themselves suddenly thrust into a federal effort to confront the coronavirus in the United States. The whistle-blower said their own health concerns were dismissed by senior administration officials as detrimental to staff “morale.” They were “admonished,” the complainant said, and “accused of not being team players,” and had their “mental health and emotional stability questioned.” After a phone call with health agency leaders to raise their fears about exposure to the virus, the staff members described a “whitewashing” of the situation, characterizing the response as “corrupt” and a “cover-up,” according to the narrative, and telling the whistle-blower that senior officials had treated them as a “nuisance” and did not want to hear their worries about health and safety. A separate team not connected to the whistle-blower complaint was dispatched to Marine Corps Air Station Miramar in San Diego to help coronavirus evacuees from Wuhan, China, the center of the outbreak, according to two people with direct knowledge of the effort. One of those people said they also lacked protective gear. At Miramar, one of the people said, guidelines were unclear and sometimes contradictory, and different teams appeared to be following different protocols. Professional cleaning crews in full protective gear — eye and respiratory protection and gloves — cleaned the quarantine area at the same time that Centers for Disease Control and Prevention doctors wearing business suits interacted with evacuees at close range. Standards were lax at first, this person said, but once patients appeared to become sick, workers began wearing personal protective equipment. One member of the team is now back at work and has yet to be tested for coronavirus exposure, the person added, although the C.D.C. sends daily texts checking in on whether they have symptoms. Representative Jimmy Gomez, Democrat of California, whose office received the whistle-blower complaint, appeared to allude to it on Thursday morning at a House Ways and Means Committee hearing with Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services. “To your knowledge, were any of the A.C.F. employees exposed to high-risk evacuees from China?” Mr. Gomez asked Mr. Azar. “They should never have been,” Mr. Azar responded, unless they had special suits designed to protect against infection. “To maintain quarantine, that should be the case.” Mr. Gomez said his understanding was that the teams sent to March and Travis air bases faced a “chaotic” situation. “I would not accept your proposition that it was chaotic at all times,” Mr. Azar said. “I am not aware of any violation of quarantine or isolation protocols.” March air base in Riverside, Calif., housed 195 people evacuated from Wuhan, China, for 14 days beginning in late January, while Travis in Northern California has housed a number of quarantined people in recent weeks, including some of the nearly 400 Americans on the Diamond Princess cruise ship that had docked in Japan. At a hearing of the House Foreign Affairs Committee after the accusations surfaced, William A. Walters, a top medical official at the State Department, denied that any protocols had been broken. “Every precaution has been taken,” said Dr. Walters, the head of operational medicine at the department’s Bureau of Medical Services. “I can say unequivocally that everyone involved with those evacuations were properly equipped and trained.” Representative Richard E. Neal, Democrat of Massachusetts and the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said the complaint appeared to be part of a pattern of ineptitude and mistrust of civil servants by the Trump administration. “The president has spent years assaulting our health care system, draining resources from key health programs, and showing utter disdain for career federal employees who are the backbone of our government,” Mr. Neal said in a statement provided to The Times. “It’s sadly no surprise we’re seeing this degree of ineptitude during a terrible crisis.” Mr. Neal and Mr. Gomez requested additional information on Thursday evening from Mr. Azar, from the inspector general’s office at the Department of Health and Human Services and from the Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan watchdog, citing the concerns raised in the whistle-blower report. In a pair of letters, Mr. Neal and Mr. Gomez formally requested a briefing from Mr. Azar within a week, saying that they were “deeply troubled that H.H.S. seems to have ignored valid public health concerns” as well as reports that the agency had retaliated against the whistle-blower instead of taking action. In the letter to the Government Accountability Office, they expressed concerns that “management decisions at H.H.S. could have contributed to the spread of the virus within the United States.” Michael D.

2020,U.S. Imposes Sanctions on Russian Oil Company Supporting Venezuela’s Leader,"The penalties seek to pressure President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela to give up power, nearly two years after he was re-elected in a widely disputed vote. WASHINGTON — The United States on Tuesday imposed tough economic sanctions against a Russian oil giant that is keeping Venezuela’s ruling government afloat, gambling that the newest penalties against President Nicolás Maduro will not roil global oil prices. The broad sanctions were levied against Rosneft Trading, a subsidiary of the Russian state-controlled Rosneft Oil Company, and Didier Casimiro, the subsidiary’s president and board chairman. Mr. Casimiro is also identified on the Rosneft website as the parent company’s vice president for refining. The sanctions may have only a limited impact on global markets, experts said. Venezuela’s oil exports have dwindled since the Trump administration began a campaign last year to pressure Mr. Maduro into leaving power, after his widely disputed re-election in May 2018. Oil markets seemed to shrug off the sanctions, dipping about a half-percent in trading on Tuesday with prices at around $51.80 per barrel. But the sanctions will lash Venezuela’s already-faltering economy. They also follow a highly public effort by Juan Guaidó, the Venezuelan opposition leader, to pressure allies to take a more aggressive stance against Mr. Maduro. On Tuesday, Mr. Guaidó called the sanctions “a victory” on Twitter, adding, “Those who support the dictator, whoever they are, wherever they come from, should assume the consequences.” Venezuela is exporting about 70 percent of its oil through Rosneft in what Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin described as the “looting of Venezuela’s oil assets by the corrupt Maduro regime.” “This is a campaign of pressure,” said Elliott Abrams, the State Department’s special envoy for Venezuela policy. “And the pressure continues to mount.” “I would not say that any individual step can be calculated to bring an end to the crisis,” Mr. Abrams said. “But I think this is a very significant step, and I think you will see companies all over the world in the oil sector now move away from dealing with Rosneft Trading.” Administration officials insisted that the global oil market was stable enough to withstand the new penalties against Rosneft or any entity that does business with it. Officials also said Rosneft’s customers would be given 90 days to unwind themselves from the Russian shipping company. Mr. Maduro has led Venezuela’s economy into shambles and prompted an exodus of millions of people into neighboring South American states. The sanctions are among the biggest hits to Venezuela’s economy since the United States banned Venezuela’s state oil company last January, said Francisco Monaldi, a Venezuela energy expert at Rice University in Houston. “Rosneft will now have to think how much Venezuela is worth from a business standpoint, compared to the costs of remaining under sanctions,” Mr. Monaldi said. But, he added, the sanctions could misfire if Rosneft concludes that the higher costs of doing business in Venezuela are justified by the geopolitical benefit of helping out Russia’s key ally in South America. Rosneft sells about two-thirds of Venezuela’s oil, largely to Asia, and often by obscuring the cargo’s source and destination. Officials said Mr. Maduro was taking the profits from the oil sales facilitated by Rosneft to hang onto power, in part by bolstering the Venezuelan military and its harsh crackdown against the public. Rosneft’s trading subsidiary was created in 2011 to help its Moscow-based parent company carry out foreign projects, including shipping crude oil. In the last few years, faced with American and European sanctions, Rosneft has pushed deeply into places like Cuba, China, Egypt and Vietnam. Its two largest customers are China and India, both of which have struggled to procure sufficient oil supplies after the Trump administration imposed sanctions against Iran. In the case of India, where Mr. Trump is scheduled to visit next week, the government in Delhi has been forced to find new suppliers — including from the United States. Additionally, the world is currently flooded with oil since the coronavirus is cutting millions of barrels a day of demand in the Chinese market. Curtailing Venezuela’s 700,000 barrels of daily production should have little if any impact on global oil prices. Clearview Energy Partners, a consultancy, described Tuesday’s sanctions as “somewhat limited in nature.” It can take weeks, however, for market effects from sanctions to be fully seen. Mr. Abrams noted that global oil prices were down compared with when the Trump administration began its sanctions campaign against Mr. Maduro’s government. “We’re not trying to raise oil prices — we’re trying to diminish the amount of money available to the Maduro regime,” Mr. Abrams told reporters at the State Department. Trump administration officials outlined a series of transactions and planned shipments over the last year — including millions of barrels of crude oil — as evidence of Rosneft’s support to Mr. Maduro. Last month alone, officials said, Rosneft helped deliver two million barrels of crude to West Africa from Venezuela.

2020,"U.S. Maintains Pressure on Iran, Stalling Diplomacy While Expecting Attacks","News Analysis Nearly two months after the death of Iran’s most important general, the Trump administration insists its “maximum pressure” campaign is working. Many allies are skeptical. WASHINGTON — The United States and Iran may have pulled back from the brink of war, but they have refused to stand down since the American drone strike in January that killed Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, commander of Tehran’s elite Quds Force. Instead, the two adversaries have needled each other with increasing pressure. The Trump administration has imposed new sanctions against Iran, while Tehran has flouted Washington’s warnings by shipping weapons to Shiite allies in the Middle East. Iranian-backed militias continue to attack bases in Iraq where Americans are deployed. The stalemate could last for another year at least, officials and experts say. As Iran grapples with a severe coronavirus outbreak and occasional protests, its leaders are signaling it will wait out the American presidential election in November to decide whether to open new nuclear negotiations with world powers. In the meantime, Congress wants to clip President Trump’s authority to strike Iran. With Secretary of State Mike Pompeo scheduled to brief the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Friday about the administration’s next steps, here is a look at where things stand. Mr. Pompeo will be asked about the decision to kill General Suleimani in a Jan. 3 strike in Baghdad after an Iranian-backed militia had protested at the American Embassy. But Congress appeared unconvinced of the urgency of the strike: Both the House and Senate have since voted to restrain Mr. Trump’s war powers against Iran. Over the last two months, the Trump administration has imposed more sanctions against Iran’s oil exports, metals, manufacturing and textile industries, as well as against some of the country’s military commanders, senior officials in its government and officials involved in its elections and nuclear program. On Wednesday, the State Department added the leader of the Iranian-backed Kataib Hezbollah militia in Iraq and Syria to its list of foreign terrorists. The sanctions are the main tool being wielded by the Trump administration in its push for new limits to Tehran’s nuclear and military programs. But the American campaign could backfire if the sanctions so weaken Iran’s economy that its citizens become more dependent on the government for a lifeline, experts say. “It’s been very effective in damaging Iran’s economy,” said Hussein Ibish, a scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington. “But you have to ask, ‘To what end?’” Mr. Pompeo insists it is, but continuing violence exposes the challenges to the policy. The strike on General Suleimani “provided the Iranians with a deep knowledge that our notion of deterrence is real,” Mr. Pompeo said in Saudi Arabia last week. General Suleimani’s death was the climax of tit-for-tat violence that began on Dec. 27, when an American interpreter was killed and others wounded in a rocket attack on an Iraqi base carried out by militias supported by Iran. The Pentagon responded by bombing militia members in Iraq and Syria. That led to the riot outside the American Embassy in Baghdad on Dec. 31. Iran retaliated to General Suleimani’s death by firing missiles at American troops at two Iraqi military bases on Jan. 8. Nobody was killed, but more than 100 troops have reported brain injuries. Iranian-backed militias have since resumed attacks on the American Embassy and Iraqi bases where U.S. troops are stationed. And Iran was caught this month shipping antiaircraft missiles to Houthi rebels in Yemen. One senior Iraqi official said the rocket attacks on compounds hosting Americans have become increasingly worrisome. Some rockets are landing closer to frequently-populated facilities, and Iraqi security forces have found nearby staging platforms equipped to launch up to 36 rockets at a time. In recent months, Mr. Trump has deployed thousands of additional troops to the region. European allies and other world powers have opposed the sanctions against Iran — particularly the oil embargo — while Arab Gulf States have supported them. But both sides are now united over worries that the American pressure campaign will end any hope of negotiating a new nuclear agreement. In Europe, officials do not believe the maximum pressure campaign has curbed Iran’s pursuit of a nuclear weapon. One European diplomat said many Europeans remain concerned that the Trump administration is pursuing regime change — even though American officials insist that is not the goal. That diplomat added that, while the government in Tehran seemed shaken by the recent events, including the accidental downing of a Ukrainian airliner and the protests that followed, it is not likely to fall. Nor do diplomats expect Iran to step back from its support for proxy militias or halt covert attacks. Arab states have warned of widening violence in the region if Tehran feels pushed too hard by the United States. Anti-American sentiments in Iraq are already are on the rise, an American official said. A Middle East diplomat also predicted that Iran will carry out more attacks — similar to those against key oil fields in Saudi Arabia or oil tankers around the Strait of Hormuz — to test the Trump administration. Even Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and an Iran hawk, has recognized that the Trump administration is offering nothing to entice Iran to come to the negotiating table. Mr. Graham has told people he is working on potential inducements for Washington to offer Tehran. Two senior Middle Eastern officials who speak to the Trump administration regularly on Iran said they do not expect Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader of Iran, to agree to start new negotiations with the United States soon. Instead, they said, he will wait to see the outcome of the American presidential election in November before deciding on a new strategy. Mr. Trump said he wants to strike a new deal with Iran that is more expansive than the 2015 nuclear treaty that the Obama administration brokered with world powers and Tehran — and from which Mr. Trump withdrew the United States in 2018. Trump administration officials say they are looking not only for tougher restrictions on Iran’s nuclear program, but also for limits on its ballistic missile efforts and its support for regional militias. Foreign diplomats said Mr. Pompeo wants future negotiations to include more parties — adding Israel, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to the talks that were previously held among Britain, France, Germany, China, Russia, the United States and the European Union. As a way around the American sanctions, European officials are creating a barter system to continue trade with Iran and, in turn, keep the 2015 nuclear deal alive, even though Iran has violated the boundaries of the agreement since Mr. Trump’s withdrawal from it. In January, Britain, France and Germany put Iran on notice that it would reimpose international sanctions if Tehran did not comply with the deal. At a meeting on Wednesday of the deal’s remaining signers, Iranian diplomats said they were eager to salvage the agreement. Senior State Department officials have told foreign diplomats that Iran’s leaders are “finished,” and that Tehran is running out of money, according to Western officials. Brian H. Hook, the State Department’s special representative on Iran, said Tehran is facing its “worst financial crisis and its worst political unrest in its 40-year history.” Last week, Mr. Hook seized on rigged parliamentary elections in Iran as the latest opportunity to encourage domestic opposition, which flared last fall against the government. However, “I don’t think we’re under any delusions that the regime will collapse tomorrow,” said Mark Dubowitz, chief executive of Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington think tank that consults closely with the Trump administration on Iran policy. “We think there will be continued instability inside Iran, because these protests will break out with greater potency and frequency.” Last year, on “Intelligence Matters,” a podcast hosted by Michael J. Morrell, a former acting C.I.A. director, Mr. Pompeo defined the goal of the pressure campaign as creating conditions to turn the opinion of Iranians against their government. “Essentially, he admitted their policy is regime change,” Mr. Morrell said. American intelligence officials who brief Congress have said that the Iranian government remains stable, even if under pressure. “I think the administration, in candor, does not even have a strategy for what would replace the regime,” said Rep. Ro Khanna, Democrat of California and a member of the House Armed Services Committee. He called the American pressure campaign “purely punitive.” And even if the 80-year-old Ayatollah Khamenei left power, diplomats and experts said, his replacement might be even less inclined to pursue diplomacy with the United States. “The people have no say in the matter,” said Haleh Esfandiari, founding director of the Middle East Program at the Woodrow Wilson Center. “Nor is the selection of a moderate cleric as successor likely.”",The New York Times
2020,U.S. Officials Promise ‘Aggressive Measures’ to Contain Coronavirus,"Despite quarantine sites on military bases and local health departments monitoring recent arrivals from China, it remained unclear how many people would be caught up in the effort. Get an informed guide to the global outbreak with our daily Coronavirus
 newsletter.
 Four military bases in Texas, California and Colorado were preparing to house American citizens for up to two weeks as part of a highly unusual federal effort aimed at slowing the spread of the deadly coronavirus. As of late Monday, though, expectations that a large number of Americans who had traveled to parts of China might quickly be held under quarantine had not come to pass. No new travelers from China had been brought to the military bases, federal officials said. The only people under federal quarantine were fewer than 200 people who had been in Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, and were flown to a base in Riverside, Calif., last week. About 250 other Americans who had recently spent time in China and showed signs of symptoms were considered “patients under investigation” by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and have been monitored, the federal authorities said. “This is an unprecedented situation, and we’ve taken aggressive measures,” said Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, part of the C.D.C. The Trump administration ordered that as of Sunday afternoon, any American citizen who in the last two weeks had visited the Hubei province, whose capital city is Wuhan, was subject to a quarantine of up to 14 days after arriving in the United States. It remained uncertain how extensive the quarantine would ultimately become, and how many Americans would be affected. Major domestic airlines have already canceled flights to and from China as information has emerged about the outbreak that has killed hundreds and sickened thousands. The United States had 11 confirmed cases of the coronavirus on Monday evening. [Have you or someone you know faced prejudice in the United States as a result of coronavirus fears? Please contact us at coronavirus@nytimes.com if you are willing to share your story.] The State Department will be transporting more people back to the United States from Wuhan, Dr. Messonnier said, and the C.D.C. has sent four teams to Defense Department locations where their flights will land. She said she did not know yet how many passengers would be returning. A federal quarantine has not been instituted in more than half a century, and brings considerable logistical challenges, legal implications and strains to local authorities. Dr. Messonnier said the C.D.C. had been working with state and local health departments to find places to keep people under quarantine. Possibilities, she said, could include other military bases and hotels, and could vary from state to state. Updated Feb. 29, 2020 Passengers from parts of China other than Hubei province who have symptoms like a cough or fever will be given medical exams, and what happens next will depend on the results of those exams. United States citizens who have visited mainland China will undergo a health screening and can be ordered to quarantine in their homes for up to 14 days, according to the Homeland Security Department. If the passengers display symptoms of the virus, they will be moved to a nearby hospital, where they will be isolated from other patients. It was not clear exactly what home quarantines would entail, or how they would be enforced. The federal government has the power to declare a quarantine under the 1944 Public Health Service Act, an authority that derives from the commerce clause of the Constitution. According to the law, the secretary of health and human services is authorized to act to prevent the transmission and spread of communicable diseases into the United States and between states. But the federal government’s quarantine authority is effectively limited to people coming into the country at the border, and it has rarely been exercised. More commonly, the C.D.C. has given responsibility to states, which have broad powers to quarantine people under the 10th Amendment and are better equipped to handle public health emergencies, said Lawrence Gostin, a law professor at Georgetown University and an expert on public health. During an Ebola outbreak in 2014, a nurse who was held in quarantine in New Jersey for three days after returning from working with patients in West Africa filed a lawsuit against New Jersey. She ended her state lawsuit in 2017 with a settlement that suggested legal rights for people in quarantine. Howard Markel, a medical historian at the University of Michigan and the author of “Quarantine!,” a history of typhus and cholera epidemics in New York City in 1892, said he believed that the current quarantine was a prudent decision, given the spread of the virus. But the process, he said, can have lasting effects. “You can never ameliorate the experience of a quarantine,” Dr. Markel said. “Nobody who comes out of a quarantine says, ‘That was fun.’ It’s psychologically damaging.” The current quarantine order has required a complex, multiagency effort that officials were scrambling over the weekend to put into place. The Transportation Security Administration has directed airline carriers to determine if passengers had traveled to China before allowing them to board flights, a Homeland Security official said. Customs and Border Protection officers have also been told to question travelers upon their arrival at some airports and comb through a travel history database to determine if they were in China, the official said. Tony Reardon, the president of the National Treasury Employees Union, which represents Customs and Border Protection officers at airports, said the Homeland Security agency was allowing officers to wear protective equipment, such as gloves and respiratory masks, while they process travelers coming from China. Efforts to slow the virus’s spread in the United States have already proven costly. The Department of Health and Human Services informed Congress on Sunday that it may transfer up to $136 million to help combat the spread of coronavirus, according to a person familiar with the notification. Around the country, as the four military bases were readied to receive quarantined travelers, officials sought to reassure residents living nearby. At Joint Base San Antonio in Texas, guests at two inns on the base were being relocated to make room for people who could be brought in for quarantine. At Travis Air Force Base in California, officials said a “safety cordon” would be put in place to separate evacuees from people on the base. “This doesn’t seem like a smart plan,” one person posted on the San Antonio base’s Facebook page. “There was not a better alternative than exposing our military and their families?!” Officials at Joint Base San Antonio, who did not immediately respond to an interview request, promised to hold town hall meetings to address residents’ fears about the quarantine. “We hear and understand the concerns of our community and family members,” the base’s Facebook feed said in reply to commenters who questioned the decision. In the hours and days before formal quarantine rules went into effect on Sunday afternoon, many families who had been traveling in China raced to get back to the United States. That left individual passengers to decide how much risk they personally posed to the public. Some families who had returned from China in recent days placed themselves in an informal, self-imposed quarantine, staying away from friends, co-workers and other family members out of caution. Victoria Griffin, a teacher at a school in China, flew from Beijing to Chicago with her 19-month-old son, Teddy, on Sunday, planning to stay with her parents to avoid coronavirus back in China. She and Teddy have had her childhood home to themselves. Her parents decided to temporarily stay elsewhere. “Of course I would love to be with them,” Ms. Griffin said, adding that she and Teddy have been doing little but sleeping, eating and playing with toys stocked at the house. “But I do think it’s for the best.” In Massachusetts, a toddler and his father, who may have shared a plane flight with a man who has been confirmed to have coronavirus, have isolated themselves in the basement of their Winchester home since returning from China on January 28. The man’s wife, who asked not to be identified by name, said that the family had already been planning to isolate themselves for a period of time because of the outbreak. When they realized that her husband and their toddler may have been on the same plane as the student who was confirmed sick, their concerns grew. Each day, the woman said, she dons a mask and gloves, and descends the stairs to bring her husband and son food. “It’s hard, but we are trying to avoid any direct contact,” she said.

2020,How Coronavirus is Affecting the U.S. Oil Industry,"With a decline in China’s demand sending world prices lower, cutbacks by American companies may be ahead, but drivers are benefiting. Get an informed guide to the global outbreak with our daily Coronavirus
 newsletter.
 HOUSTON — At a time when they are already cutting jobs and weighed down by debt, American oil producers are bracing for the latest shock to hit world energy markets: the economic effects of the coronavirus outbreak on China and beyond. Oil and natural gas producers have been suffering from low commodity prices for the past year and now expect a sharp drop in global prices for their products. As a result, they are preparing to slash investments in exploration and production. The price of West Texas intermediate crude, a key benchmark, fell below $50 on Monday, a 20 percent decline in less than a month. After recovering slightly Tuesday morning, the price fell further, ending the day at $49.61, its lowest level in more than a year. China buys only about 200,000 barrels a day of oil and refined transportation fuels from the United States, out of 8.5 million barrels of total daily American exports. But oil is a global commodity, and benchmark prices are set on world markets, not domestically. Lower prices mean lower profits. “It’s a blow,” said Steven Pruett, chief executive of Elevation Resources, a Texas oil company, “especially when you add this to the fact that we’re getting almost nothing for our natural gas, and oil prices are sliding from $55 a barrel to $50. Credit availability is already tight, and it’s going to get that much tighter.” Those concerns reflect the growing influence that China exerts on international energy markets. Just a few weeks after the outbreak of the virus, daily Chinese oil demand is already down 20 percent because of dwindling air travel, road transportation and manufacturing. Since China consumes 13 of every 100 barrels of oil the world produces, every oil company is being hit to some extent. More than 50 million people are affected by a travel lockdown in Hubei Province, the center of the outbreak, slowing gasoline consumption, while international airlines are rapidly scaling back flights, leaving a glut of jet fuel and diesel on global markets at a time when petroleum supplies were already abundant and prices depressed. For producers in places like Iraq and Saudi Arabia, that kind of price drop can mean a 10 percent loss in profits. But in the United States, where the break-even price for the average oil well drilled in shale fields is far higher at roughly $45 a barrel, some producers could lose as much as 60 percent of their profits, according to Michael Lynch, president of Strategic Energy and Economic Research. “The big question is whether the Saudis will put oil in storage and wait to ride this out; and if not, everyone is going to see less money coming in,” said Mr. Lynch, who has advised OPEC in the past. “For the big guys like Exxon Mobil and Chevron, it's not a big deal. But for the small guys, they are going to be hurting, and you could see the number of bankruptcies rise sharply in the next few weeks.” Updated Feb. 29, 2020 Forty-two oil and gas companies filed for bankruptcy protection in North America last year; since oil prices plummeted in 2015, there have been 208 bankruptcy filings by producers, involving roughly $122 billion in aggregate debt, according to the Haynes and Boone law firm. Oil prices have fallen despite the loss of up to one million barrels a day of Libyan exports because of political turmoil there. A hastily convened meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia, a possible prelude to a production cut, helped to stem the price slide, perhaps only temporarily. American oil companies had already tightened their budgets last year, with roughly 14,000 of 750,000 employees in the United States losing their jobs. Over the last week, Exxon Mobil, ConocoPhillips and Chevron reported disappointing earnings because of low oil and gas prices and narrow profit margins. A prolonged price collapse between 2014 and 2017 forced American oil and gas companies to lay off over 160,000 workers, and roughly 100,000 in Texas alone. S&P Global Platts, the energy analytics firm, said the virus could shave global oil demand by as much as 4 percent, or 4.1 million barrels a day, in February. For the full year, the firm projects an average daily fall in global demand of 290,000 to one million barrels. “There’s still too much uncertainty on the virus spread and its consequences on the economy,” said Claudio Galimberti, head of demand and refining analytics at S&P Global Platts. Analysts point to the SARS epidemic of 2002-3 for clues. Asian jet fuel demand fell by 1 percent in 2003 from the year before, after climbing an average of 7 percent per year during the prior five years, according to Citigroup Global Markets research. Demand snapped back powerfully in 2004, and otherwise the impact on global oil markets was short-lived and modest. But China has become a much more important engine to the world economy over the last 17 years, and medical researchers cannot be sure that the new virus will fade during warmer weather like the flu. But while lower oil prices hurt producers, they benefit American drivers. The average national price of regular gasoline has dropped 12 cents per gallon over the last month, according to the AAA motor club. That is a break particularly for lower-income motorists, who tend to drive older vehicles that are less fuel-efficient and spend a higher percentage of their income on energy. Refiners can buy and store cheaper fuels for the summer, when demand will be higher. Producers are not so lucky. The Chinese virus is spreading as oil producers are preparing their 2020 exploration and production budgets, which they will announce over the next two months. When the year began, oil prices had stabilized between $60 and $65 a barrel after cuts in OPEC production targets. But with prices now roughly $10 lower, executives predict that the industry will have to adjust. “People are going to have to drop rigs and scale back production growth,” said Scott D. Sheffield, chief executive of Pioneer Natural Resources, a major Texas shale oil producer. “The question is, how fast can the Chinese stop the virus from spreading and start picking up oil demand.” Mr. Sheffield predicted that if oil prices did not go up soon, domestic shale oil production, recently expected to increase by 500,000 to 700,000 barrels a day this year, instead would be flat. Other countries will come under pressure, too. Most of the 10 million barrels a day that China imports come from Russia, Africa and Iran and other Persian Gulf nations, and producers in those regions have already been forced to sharply discount their shipments. “You have to be concerned when you see demand is going down and economies are faltering,” said J. Nelson Wood, chief executive of Wood Energy, an Illinois-based oil company with wells in four states. “And of course that has a direct impact on price.”",The New York Times
2020,U.S. Passengers Evacuate Quarantined Cruise Ship in Japan,"Americans boarded two flights chartered by the State Department and headed to the United States after the number of coronavirus cases aboard the Diamond Princess grew to 355. Get an informed guide to the global outbreak with our daily Coronavirus
 newsletter.
 TOKYO — American passengers evacuated a cruise ship that had been quarantined for more than a week in the Japanese port city of Yokohama, after hundreds of people on board fell ill with the coronavirus. The Americans boarded two chartered flights to the United States, and the flights departed Tokyo at 7:05 a.m. Monday, according to a statement by the United States Embassy in Japan. As the passengers prepared to leave the country, Japanese health officials said the number of confirmed coronavirus cases found on the ship, the Diamond Princess, had grown by 70, to 355. “Can’t get off here fast enough,” Sarah Arana, 52, a medical social worker from Paso Robles, Calif., told reporters on Sunday. The American Embassy had recommended that its citizens stay aboard the ship during a 14-day quarantine period. But it suddenly changed course on Saturday, citing “a rapidly evolving situation” as conditions appeared to worsen. American passengers said they were told to prepare to leave the ship at 9 p.m. local time. Their flight was scheduled to depart Haneda Airport in Tokyo at 3 a.m. on Monday. Officials said they would be taken to one of two military air bases in the United States. But the process, taken deck by deck, went slowly. It took several hours to load all passengers on buses to take them to Haneda airport in Tokyo. On one of the buses, Gay Courter, 75, an American novelist traveling with her husband, Philip, said the passengers were mostly silent. A doctor in a yellow hazmat suit accompanied the group. “Clearing my throat sounds like thunder,” Ms. Courter wrote in an email from the bus. All passengers were given N95 respirators — a heavy-duty mask fitted to the face that filters out 95 percent of smaller air particles — to wear on board the repurposed cargo planes, Ms. Courter said. Updated Feb. 26, 2020 Some sections of her flight were segregated from others, with those who had tested positive but were not yet showing symptoms sitting in a tented area of the plane, she wrote from on board. Passengers on the charters were told there would be no overhead luggage space, so all carry-ons had to fit under the seats in front of them, and shipped luggage could not exceed 70 pounds. The converted 747 cargo plane could be cold, the officials said, so passengers were advised to shower and dress warmly. They were also told to take their own food. Rachel Torres, 24, who had been on her honeymoon with her husband, Tyler, also 24, said they were trying to clean their stateroom so as not to leave a mess for their cabin steward. “We didn’t sleep much last night,” said Ms. Torres. In preparation for flying, she said, the two were “drinking as much water as we can to hydrate for the flight since we will be wearing masks on the plane.” Including the cases aboard the Diamond Princess, Japan has recorded the highest number of infections from the new coronavirus outside mainland China. Worldwide, more than 70,500 people have been infected, and at least 1,770 have died, almost all in mainland China. When the ship was placed under quarantine, more than 3,700 passengers and crew aboard were on board, including about 400 Americans. Those found to have the virus and some particularly vulnerable passengers were taken off the ship. The State Department said in a statement on Monday that 14 passengers who had tested positive for the virus two or three days ago but were not showing symptoms had been allowed on one of the charter flights. “These individuals were moved in the most expeditious and safe manner to a specialized containment area on the evacuation aircraft to isolate them in accordance with standard protocols,” the statement said. Once in the United States, the passengers will be required to undergo a two-week quarantine at Travis Air Force Base in Fairfield, Calif., or Lackland Air Force Base near San Antonio. Those who did not take the charters will not be allowed to travel to the United States until March 4, two weeks after they would have otherwise been allowed to leave the ship on Wednesday, the embassy said. Some remained hesitant. Linda Tsukamoto, 63, a retired retail manager from Marina del Rey, Calif., said she had signed up for an evacuation flight, but changed her mind at the last minute. Ms. Tsukamoto stuck a Post-it note on her door reading, “I’m staying.” Three military doctors came to her door and advised her to go. Their emphatic tone, she said, was “scary,” but she was standing her ground. “I’d rather go home first class on United Airlines than a cold, noisy military charter when the Japanese Ministry of Health releases us,” she said. “I refuse to be fearful but respect the U.S. government to help others who feel more comfortable rushing home.” According to a letter from the Diamond Princess staff to passengers on Sunday, passengers who test negative for the virus and show no symptoms will be allowed to leave the ship on Feb. 19. The letter noted that passengers “may be subject to additional quarantine requirements by their country of destination when leaving Japan.” After 11 days of being isolated in their windowless cabin, John and Carol Montgomery were finally preparing to board a bus to take them to the airport, where they would then fly next to hundreds of people for about nine hours. “It feels surreal,” said Ms. Montgomery, 67, a retired administrative assistant from San Clemente, Calif. With at least 55 Americans from the ship having tested positive for the coronavirus during the quarantine period, some were left behind in Japan as the charter flights departed. For some, that meant family separations. John Haering, 63, who was taken to a hospital in Chiba Prefecture last week with a fever and tested positive for the virus, will have to stay while his wife, Melanie, heads home. “She’ll be in California quarantine,” Mr. Haering said by telephone from his hospital bed. “And I’m staying here, obviously.” Mr. Haering said he was angry that the United States government had not acted earlier. “If they were going to fly people out, they should have flown them out in the very beginning,” he said. “That way, we wouldn’t have sat there for 12 days, all of us getting sicker. I wouldn’t have been in the hospital; I would have been in the U.S. getting the treatment that I needed, and I could have been in quarantine there.” Tung Pi Lee, 79, was whisked away from the ship Wednesday night with a fever, leaving his wife on the ship. JoAnn LaRoche Lee, one of Mr. Lee’s daughters, said she and her siblings did not want her mother to try to stay in Japan with their father for fear she would not be allowed to come back if she did not take the charter flight. As for their father, said Ms. Lee, “We’re just kind of trusting that the State Department will be able to facilitate my dad’s return.” The United States previously evacuated about 850 people on five charter flights from Wuhan, the city in central China where the coronavirus emerged late last year. Canada and Hong Kong also said they would charter flights for passengers on the cruise ship, though it was not immediately clear when those flights would leave. The Philippines’ labor minister said on Sunday that the country was working to bring home more than 500 crew members. The Australian government said it was sending an expert to Yokohama and would consider the best options for more than 200 of its citizens aboard the ship. The Israeli government said three of its citizens on the ship had been infected. They are the first confirmed Israeli cases. About 330 Hong Kong residents are on the ship, including 260 Chinese citizens and 70 foreigners. Eleven of the Hong Kong passengers have been infected, the Hong Kong government said. An 80-year-old man who took the Diamond Princess from Yokohama to Hong Kong in January tested positive for the coronavirus on Feb. 1, the first documented case on the ship.

 [This briefing has ended. Read the latest updates on the coronavirus epidemic here.] The United States will evacuate Americans from the cruise ship that has been quarantined for more than a week in Japan because of coronavirus infections on board, the United States Embassy in Tokyo told Americans aboard the ship on Saturday. American passengers and crew members were told in an email from the embassy that a chartered flight would arrive on Sunday for those who wanted to return to the United States. The ship, the Diamond Princess, was placed under quarantine at the city of Yokohama early last week with about 3,700 passengers and crew members aboard, after a man who had disembarked in Hong Kong tested positive for the coronavirus. Since then, at least 218 cases have been confirmed aboard the ship. There are about 400 Americans aboard, and at least 40 who were infected with the virus have been taken off the ship for treatment. Americans will be subject to a 14-day federal quarantine and will be housed at two existing quarantine sites, in California and Texas, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a statement on Saturday. Japan has more confirmed coronavirus cases than any country outside China — the vast majority of them from the ship — and it reported its first death from the virus on Thursday. Under fire for its initial response to the coronavirus epidemic, China’s authoritarian government appears to be pushing a new account of events that presents President Xi Jinping as taking early action to fight the outbreak that has convulsed the country. But in doing so, the authorities have acknowledged for the first time that Mr. Xi was aware of the epidemic nearly two weeks before he first spoke publicly about it — and while officials at its epicenter in the city of Wuhan were still playing down its dangers. That new account risks drawing the president, China’s most powerful leader in decades, directly into questions about whether top officials did too little, too late. In the newly released internal speech that Mr. Xi delivered on Feb. 3, when the epidemic had already spiraled into a national crisis, the Chinese president said he had “issued demands about the efforts to prevent and control” the coronavirus on Jan. 7, during a meeting of the Politburo Standing Committee, the highest council of the Communist Party, whose sessions are typically very secretive. In the speech, he also said he had authorized the unprecedented lockdown of Wuhan and other cities beginning on Jan. 23. “I have at every moment monitored the spread of the epidemic and progress in efforts to curtail it, constantly issuing oral orders and also instructions,” Mr. Xi said of his more recent involvement. Mr. Xi’s advisers may have hoped that publishing the speech would dispel speculation about his recent retreat from public view and reassure his people that he can be trusted to lead them out of the epidemic. The speech could expose Mr. Xi to criticism that he didn’t treat the initial threat urgently enough, and make it difficult for him to shift blame onto local officials for what many see as the government’s early mishandling of the epidemic. The remarks also raise questions about what top leaders knew at the time and what instructions they issued based on that knowledge. Updated Feb. 26, 2020 In early January, leaders in Wuhan, the city at the epicenter of the outbreak, were giving open assurances that there was no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission. The virus has infected more than 87,500 people in at least 60 countries. French officials announced a new coronavirus case on Saturday, just hours after reporting that an 80-year-old Chinese tourist had died of coronavirus at a hospital in Paris. The patient in the newly confirmed case is a British national who stayed in the chalet of Les Contamines-Montjoie, where a cluster of five other cases was detected more than a week ago. The patient had been under surveillance in a hospital in Lyon since last Saturday. The new case brings the number of confirmed cases in France to 12. Four of those infected have recovered and seven are still hospitalized. The person who died was the first coronavirus-related death in Europe, and only the fourth outside mainland China. He was not part of the cluster of cases detected at the chalet. France’s health minister, Agnès Buzyn, said on Saturday that the patient, who died on Friday, was from the Chinese province of Hubei, the center of the outbreak. He had arrived in France on Jan. 16 and been hospitalized at the Bichat-Claude Bernard Hospital since Jan. 25. “His condition had quickly worsened and he had been in critical condition for several days,” Ms. Buzyn said in a televised statement. She did not name the patient. The man’s daughter also has the coronavirus and was also hospitalized in Paris, Ms. Buzyn said, adding that she was likely to be discharged soon. In mainland China, about 1,500 people have died, most of them in Hubei Province. The Philippines, Hong Kong and Japan have each reported one death. The number of infections and deaths continued to climb, days after the government changed the criteria for how it tracks cases. Officials early Sunday reported 2,009 new coronavirus cases and 142 additional deaths in the previous 24 hours. Most of the new cases and deaths were reported in Hubei Province, the epicenter of the epidemic. In all, more than 68,500 people have been infected and at least 1,669 have died worldwide, officials say. The vast majority of cases, and all but a few of the deaths, have been in mainland China, with the heaviest concentration in Hubei. The tally in Hubei jumped drastically on Thursday after the authorities changed the diagnostic criteria for counting new cases. The government now takes into account cases diagnosed in clinical settings, including the use of CT scans, and not just those confirmed with specialized testing kits. In an interview with the news agency Reuters on Friday, China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, declared that the outbreak was “over all, under control.” “We have taken the most correct, the most rigorous and decisive measures,” he said, rejecting widespread criticism that the authorities had suppressed warnings and restricted vital information in the early days of the outbreak. The minister also told Reuters that some of the travel restrictions imposed on Chinese citizens by other countries were an overreaction and likely to be eased. “I’m sure that those countries are reflecting on this as the situation evolves,” he said, adding, “because at the end of the day, these countries need to interact with China.” Speaking at the Munich Security Council on Saturday, the director of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, called for vigilance surrounding the coronavirus, but warned against sowing fear and hysteria through false information. “We must be guided by solidarity,” he said, adding that the organization was working with Facebook, Google, Twitter, TikTok and other media companies to stop the spread of misinformation about the virus. Africa is stepping up its efforts to detect the coronavirus as fears mount that the continent’s first case, confirmed on Friday, could lead to a regional outbreak, and as many Chinese citizens return to Africa for work after the Chinese New Year holidays. Countries across Africa are rushing to train health workers. Officials are also screening passengers at airports and equipping laboratories in all 54 countries to detect the virus. John Nkengasong, director of Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, told reporters on Friday that while 16 countries currently have the ability to test for the coronavirus, another 20 will gain it by February 20. “We are scaling up very rapidly across the continent,” he said. “As we speak here now, there is a training going on in Nairobi, Kenya, on enhanced surveillance at airports and ports of entry screening.” Over 40 countries will get that training, he said. Dr. Nkengasong said it’s possible that more cases of coronavirus have already emerged in Africa but have not been detected because the continent has weak surveillance systems. The Africa C.D.C. has called on governments in Africa to bring back any African students currently trapped in China under the lockdown of Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak. Dr. Nkengasong said the situation in Wuhan could easily become “a humanitarian crisis,” just as it could in Africa. “We are seeing what is happening in China, that even with the amount of resources, that in China it has been a struggle,” he said. “If the virus was to hit a fragile state in Africa, the concern is that the consequences would be very, very devastating.” Protests against neighborhood clinics designated by the Hong Kong government to treat suspected coronavirus cases cropped up in multiple districts across the city on Saturday. Many of the demonstrators, numbering in the hundreds, were dressed in black, the signature color of the city’s antigovernment protests. The government has said that the clinics would treat people with mild symptoms of the virus to relieve pressures on hospitals, but critics said residents had not been consulted. In the northern town of Tin Shui Wai, protesters tried to set a train station turnstile ablaze, and riot officers fired pepper spray at other demonstrators, according to local reports. Separately, the city’s Hospital Authority said that a clinic in the district of Tai Po had been vandalized. A police spokesman said broken glass pieces were found near the clinic’s door on Saturday morning and a bottle containing an unknown liquid was found nearby, but he did not say if the property was damaged. Another clinic has suffered two arson attacks over the past week. Last month, the government shelved a plan to turn an unoccupied housing project into a quarantine center after protesters set a fire in the lobby. At least two workers who were sent to Wuhan at the end of January to help build one of the new hospitals to treat victims of the coronavirus have been infected with it, company and health officials said. Huoshenshan Hospital, whose name means fire god mountain, was one of two hospitals built in the city in a matter of days to help cope with the crush of patients. Ma Ke, 28, tested positive for the coronavirus on Thursday, a manager for his company, Hunan Dawei Construction, said. The second, a 48-year-old worker identified only by his surname, Lin, tested positive for the virus on Feb. 10 after spending two days in quarantine in a hospital in Xiangtan, according to that city’s health commission. Hunan Dawei sent 10 workers, including Mr. Ma, to help with the construction. The company’s general manager, Li Guangda, said in a telephone interview that working conditions at the construction site were poor and that there were shortages of protective equipment, including high-quality masks. “There were several types of workers working on things at the same time,” Mr. Li said. “The workers there were also crowded together as they worked. The population density was very high.” Mr. Li said that Mr. Ma, who with the others worked on installing water and electricity, was asymptomatic. Mr. Lin’s condition was not immediately known. The central banking authorities of China are disinfecting, stashing and reportedly even destroying cash in an effort to stop the spread of the coronavirus. Fan Yifei, deputy governor of the People’s Bank of China, said at a news conference on Saturday that the cash collected by commercial banks must be disinfected before being released back to customers. Cash collected from hospitals and food markets must be handled separately and disinfected before depositing the notes to the People’s Bank of China, Mr. Fan said. In severely hit regions, the collected cash must undergo ultraviolet or high-temperature disinfection and be stored for 14 days before going back to the market, he added. In less affected areas, the bank notes must be disinfected and stored for a week before use. A People’s Bank of China branch in the southern city of Guangzhou is even destroying bank notes that came from hospitals, food markets and public transportation, according to a report by Nanfang, a state-owned outlet in Guangdong Province. Many people in major Chinese cities use their smartphones primarily to pay for just about anything, increasingly rendering cash obsolete. But hundreds of millions of people in the country are not connected to the internet, and some older residents still prefer cash. Quarantines, travel restrictions, and widespread shutdowns of stores and malls in China have taken a heavy toll on the global luxury goods sector, long dependent on the spending of Chinese shoppers at home and abroad. The investment bank Jefferies estimates that Chinese buyers accounted for 40 percent of the 281 billion euros, or $305 billion, spent on luxury goods globally last year, and drove 80 percent of the past year’s sales growth in the sector, making them the fastest-growing luxury shopper demographic in the world. With the latest season of fashion weeks well underway — and several runway show cancellations in New York, London, Milan and Paris — some of the biggest names in the industry are publicly counting the cost of coronavirus-related disruption on bottom lines. A man who became ill while on a vacation in Hawaii and his wife, who was traveling with him, have both tested positive for the coronavirus, officials said. The couple, who are in their 60s, visited Hawaii in late January and early February, and the man fell ill during the second week of the vacation, while they were staying at a time-share in Honolulu, on the island of Oahu. Before that, the couple had been in Maui, but neither showed symptoms while there. Officials said the man began showing symptoms on Feb. 3, and wore a mask when he went outside the time-share, the Grand Waikikian. He was most likely infected either before he came to Hawaii or while he was on his way to Hawaii in late January, said Dr. Sarah Park, the state epidemiologist. He tested positive for the coronavirus in Japan on Friday. On the same day, the woman went to a hospital with a fever and on Saturday, her case was confirmed, according to Japan’s Health Ministry. The ministry said she is from Nagoya, the country’s fourth largest city. NHK, the public broadcaster, and Nagoya city officials said she and the man who tested positive were married. Lt. Gov. Josh Green, who is an emergency physician, said in an interview on Friday that the authorities were contacting the management at the guest facilities where the man stayed, as well as those who were working there. “The only way to do this right is to contact everyone,” he said. “We are not worried about minimal contact, but those who had extensive contact will be given whatever support is necessary.” Reporting and research were contributed by Elian Peltier, Motoko Rich, David Yaffe-Bellany, Keith Bradsher, Elaine Yu, Claire Fu, Elizabeth Paton, Alex Marshall Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs and Melissa Eddy.",The New York Times

South Korean and American “health professionals are actively conducting contact tracing to determine whether any others may have been exposed,” the military said. The military added that it was “implementing all appropriate control measures to help control the spread of Covid-19 and remains at risk level ‘high’” for all its 28,500 soldiers stationed in South Korea “as a prudent measure to protect the force.” Those measures include advising all troops to “limit non-mission essential” meetings and “off-installation travel.” At the gates of the American military bases across South Korea, stations have been set up to administer temperature checks and screening questionnaires. On Tuesday, the United States and South Korea said they would consider scaling back joint military exercise after an outbreak among South Korean soldiers had infected at least 13. South Korea reported 169 new patients on Wednesday, bringing the total number to 1,146, the biggest outbreak outside China. More than half of the patients were residents of Daegu. Americans should brace for the likelihood that the coronavirus will spread to communities in the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned Tuesday. “It’s not so much of a question of if this will happen in this country anymore but a question of when this will happen,” said Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. [Update: Nigeria records Sub-Saharan Africa’s first case of coronavirus.] President Trump, in India, said that the United States was well able to protect itself against the spread of the coronavirus and offered an optimistic outlook. “I think the whole situation will start working out,” Mr. Trump said during a news conference. [Watch the video.] But his own health officials were not so upbeat. Dr. Messonnier said that public health officials have no idea whether the spread of the disease to the United States would be mild or severe, but that Americans should be ready for a significant disruption to their daily lives. “We are asking the American public to prepare for the expectation that this might be bad,” Dr. Messonnier said. The secretary of health and human services delivered an equally sobering message on Tuesday. The secretary, Alex M. Azar II, told a Senate committee, “This is an unprecedented, potentially severe health challenge globally.” “We cannot hermetically seal off the United States to a virus,” Mr. Azar said. “And we need to be realistic about that.” Federal and local health departments will need as many as 300 million masks for health care workers and additional ventilators for hospitals to prepare for a major outbreak of the coronavirus, he said. On Monday, the Trump administration requested $2.5 billion to help stop the spread of the virus. Lawmakers from both parties made it clear they were unconvinced the Trump administration was prepared. When Senator John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana, pressed for an exact number of people expected to be infected, the acting secretary of the Homeland Security Department, Chad F. Wolf, could not answer. “I’m all for committees and task forces but you’re the secretary,” Mr. Kennedy responded. “I think you ought to know that answer. The virus has infected more than 87,500 people in at least 60 countries. A clinical trial has begun in Nebraska to test whether an experimental drug can treat the new coronavirus, starting with an American who was quarantined on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan, the National Institutes of Health said on Tuesday. Meanwhile, the Food and Drug Administration said it was closely watching the supplies of 20 unrelated drugs that are either made in China, where the epidemic has drastically reduced manufacturing, or contain ingredients from China. The agency did not say which drugs, but the world relies heavily on China for supplies of many essential medications, like aspirin and penicillin. Updated Feb. 26, 2020 In the trial, the patient is being treated with the drug remdesivir, an antiviral developed by Gilead Sciences. The test is taking place at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha, which has a special biocontainment unit, according to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of the N.I.H. Thirteen people from the cruise ship have been taken there for treatment. There are no approved treatments for illnesses caused by coronaviruses, including the new one, known as Covid-19. Remdesivir is already being tested in two clinical trials in China, but efforts to enroll patients there have faltered. “We urgently need a safe and effective treatment for Covid-19,” said Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the allergy and infectious diseases institute, at a briefing at the Department of Health and Human Services. Several companies are also working to develop a vaccine for the virus. One of them, Moderna, said Monday it had delivered an experimental vaccine to the N.I.H. for early testing in humans, a record-setting pace. But “even at rocket speed,” releasing a vaccine would take at least a year, Dr. Fauci cautioned. He projected that initial human trials would begin in a month and a half, with about 45 people, and last three to four months. Then it would have to be expanded to “hundreds, if not thousands” of subjects in countries with active disease transmission, which would take six to eight months, he said. A day after its worst one-day slide in two years, the S&P 500 fell 3 percent on Tuesday in response to the coronavirus threat, a decline that put the blue chip index firmly in the red for the year. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to a record low, a possible sign that investors expect growth in the United States to slow. Investors continued to dump stocks a day after the S&P 500 had lost 3.4 percent, after officials in Italy and South Korea reported new infections on Monday. Tuesday’s decline came as federal officials warned that the epidemic was likely to reach the United States with potentially severe impacts. For weeks, U.S. investors had largely shrugged off the economic risks of the virus even as it disrupted global supply chains and shut down factories in China. As recently as last Wednesday, the S&P 500 was at a record high. Fears have grown stronger about the virus’s effect on the global economy. The declines in the S&P 500 were led by energy, industrial and materials shares, the sectors of the market closely tied to Chinese demand for raw materials. As stocks dropped sharply, investors moved into the safety of government bonds, pushing their prices up and yields down. A coronavirus outbreak in Italy, the worst outside Asia, appears to be spreading. New cases — most linked to the Italian epicenter, Lombardy — were reported on Tuesday in Spain, Austria, Croatia, Switzerland and France. The authorities in Algeria reported their country’s first confirmed case, an Italian, though it was not immediately clear if the person had been in Italy recently. Italy reported a total of 322 infections through Tuesday, up from 229 a day earlier, with reports of new cases in Tuscany and Sicily. The death toll rose to 10, from seven. Austrian authorities said two 24-year-olds from Lombardy living in Innsbruck, Austria, had tested positive. A 36-year-old Italian woman living in Barcelona tested positive after returning from a trip to Lombardy, according to Spanish authorities. They are also dealing, on the island of Tenerife, with a couple from Lombardy who are both infected. A man who visited Milan in mid-February has become Croatia’s first confirmed coronavirus patient, the Croatian prime minister, Andrej Plenkovic, said in a news conference. France announced two new cases, one a young Chinese woman who arrived in early February and the other a Frenchman returning from a trip to Lombardy. The reports added to fears that the virus could spread rapidly across the Continent, where the Schengen zone allows largely free movement among 26 countries. Olivier Véran, France’s health minister, said after a meeting of European health ministers that they were working on a “collective strategy.” “As of now, we wish to be extremely clear on the fact that there is no reason to close the borders between our countries, which would be disproportionate and inefficient,” he told reporters in Rome. Italy has installed checkpoints and deployed its army to the “red area” in Lombardy, Michele Capone, a carabinieri official, told the Italian news agency ANSA. With public gatherings restricted, the soccer team Internazionale of Milan will play its home game on Thursday, against Ludogorets of Bulgaria, without fans in the stadium. In southern Italy, the region of Basilicata has said it will quarantine arriving northerners, while the regions of Puglia and Calabria have asked travelers from affected areas to inform the local authorities. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said on Monday that such restrictions were “not justified.” The government of Croatia took pains to emphasize its preparedness and project calm. But the virus’s emergence in the Balkans could test poorly funded health systems, which are hemorrhaging medical professionals bound for western Europe. Budapest Airport announced that it procured a thermal camera last week and would rent another to screen travelers for fevers, while experts warned that Hungary was ill-equipped for an outbreak. Just one day after confirming Bahrain’s first infection, the country’s health ministry said Tuesday that it had 23 cases — most of them people arriving on flights from the United Arab Emirates. On Monday, Bahrain imposed a 48-hour ban on flights arriving from Sharjah and Dubai, in the U.A.E. Those flights often carry people traveling to and from Iran, regional news media said, but Bahrain’s health ministry did not say if any of the new cases involved such people. The case reported on Monday was linked to Iran. If any of the new infections are tied to Iran, it would deepen concerns that the country is playing down both the extent of the outbreak there and its role in spreading the virus to other nations. Cases in Iraq, Afghanistan, Kuwait, Oman, Lebanon, the U.A.E. and Canada have all been traced to Iran. Bahrain’s health ministry said that “all passengers arriving from affected countries are being tested in a well-equipped and isolated area within the Bahrain International Airport.” The infected passengers, a mix of Bahraini citizens and foreigners, were being quarantined and treated at a hospital, and people who have been in contact with them are also in quarantine, the ministry said. China’s battle to contain the deadly coronavirus epidemic showed new signs of success, with a plunge in the rate of new infections. But that news was overshadowed by the unbridled expansion in Iran, South Korea and Italy, underlining the threat of a global pandemic racing out of control. The World Health Organization said that the pace of confirmed new cases in China, which exceeded 2,000 a day a month ago, had dropped steadily, to a low of 508 on Monday. It said the severe measures imposed by the Chinese authorities to isolate patients and the hardest-hit areas had likely prevented hundreds of thousands of additional infections. The city of Beijing has imposed new rules on workplaces, including one that prohibits workers from eating face-to-face. No more than half of an office’s employees should be at work on a given day, they must keep at least one meter apart from each other, each must have at least 2.5 square meters of working space, and elevator capacity cannot exceed 50 percent, the city said. But while China appears to be having some success in managing the epidemic, W.H.O. officials have warned that the world at large is unprepared for a leap in infections, which could overwhelm medical resources in many countries. They also cautioned that new cases could suddenly resurge in China, as the government struggles to get people back to work. By Wednesday, South Korea had reported a total of 1,146 cases, the second most in the world, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States warned Americans not to travel there. Most of the cases reported by South Korea’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention continue to come from Daegu, the city at the center of the outbreak in that country. In Iran, a spike in coronavirus infections — including the top health official in charge of fighting the disease — has prompted fears of a contagion throughout the Middle East. In Italy, one of Europe’s largest economies, officials are struggling to prevent the epidemic from paralyzing the commercial center of Milan. The emergence of Italy, Iran, and South Korea as new hubs of the outbreak underscored the lack of a coordinated global strategy to combat the coronavirus, which has infected more than 80,000 people worldwide and caused more than 2,600 deaths. Brazil’s health ministry said Tuesday night that a 61-year-old man who recently traveled to São Paulo from Italy may have contracted the coronavirus. A preliminary test was positive, and health authorities said they were awaiting the results of a second test. If confirmed, it would be the first known case in Latin America. It would also come at a worrying time in Brazil, which is in the midst of celebrating Carnival. The patient, who lives in São Paulo, had recently traveled to northern Italy for work. He sought medical help after getting a fever, cough and sore throat, according to health officials. Health officials said they were trying to track down all the people he had contact with at home, at the hospital and aboard the flight he returned home in. A hotel on the Spanish resort island of Tenerife was locked down under a police cordon on Tuesday after an Italian guest and his partner tested positive for the new coronavirus, the authorities said. Around 1,000 guests are booked at the hotel, the H10 Costa Adeje Palace, at a resort that is popular with British tourists. Tenerife is the largest of the Canary Islands, off the coast of West Africa. The first patient, a doctor, had been on Tenerife for a week before he fell ill with a fever. He checked in at a local hospital, where he tested positive on Monday night and was placed in an isolation ward. His partner tested positive on Tuesday, health officials said. The Spanish authorities said that more tests were being done in Madrid to confirm the diagnosis, and they ordered guests at the hotel not to leave until they were complete. For those guests, it would be hard to imagine how their vacation could get worse. Over the weekend, a storm swept sands from the Sahara over the Canary Islands, forcing airports to close and stranding thousands of tourists. Spain previously confirmed two cases of the virus, both foreigners who were hospitalized on Spanish islands: a German citizen on La Gomera and a Briton on Majorca. Iran’s deputy health minister, Iraj Harirchi, who has spearheaded the country’s efforts to contain the coronavirus, has contracted the illness, the Health Ministry said on Tuesday, renewing concerns about the spread of the virus in a country that has become a focal point of the epidemic. In an interview with the state-run news outlet IRNA, a spokesman for the ministry said that Mr. Harirchi had been experiencing weakness and flulike symptoms on Monday before holding a news briefing, and tested positive for the virus later in the day. During the briefing, Mr. Harirchi could be seen repeatedly wiping sweat from his brow and shifting from foot to foot. On Tuesday, he posted a video from home detailing his diagnosis and self-quarantine. A prominent member of Parliament, Mahmoud Sadeghi, posted on Twitter that he also had the virus. Health officials quoted in Iranian state news media confirmed three more deaths, bringing the country’s total to 15. At least 95 people nationwide have tested positive for the coronavirus, most of them in the northern city of Qom, health officials said. Qom is an important religious center that draws millions of visitors annually, many from abroad. Experts fear that the government may be concealing the true scale of the problem, and may not have the capacity to respond effectively if things begin to spiral out of control. President Hassan Rouhani, in a televised speech, blamed Iran’s enemies for sowing panic in an attempt to shut down the country. “This is one of the enemy’s plots to create panic to close down our society,” he said. “No, we all have to work, carry on with our activities and be careful and take the sick to the hospital.” Calling the coronavirus “a plague,” an Iraqi lawmaker demanded on Tuesday that the government seal its borders with Iran “until the disease is completely controlled,” the same day that Iraq’s Health Ministry announced four more cases of the virus. The demand, by Qutayba al-Jubori, chairman of the Iraqi Parliament’s Health and Environment Committee, came as governments across the region sought to limit the entry of Iranian travelers following an outbreak in that country that has killed at least 15 people. The Iraqi government said it would suspend all flights from Iran beginning Monday afternoon, but by Tuesday morning, flights were still scheduled to and from Najaf, a central Iraqi city that is home to Shiite shrines popular with Iranian pilgrims. Iraq reported its first case of the virus on Monday, a 22-year old religion student in Najaf. On Tuesday, the Health Ministry confirmed that a family of four from Kirkuk who had just returned from Iran had contracted the coronavirus. The government told citizens to avoid crowded places including shrines, universities and schools, shopping malls and stores, sports activities and entertainment parks. Officials recommended avoiding kissing or shaking hands with others and urged people to use disposable napkins. The firebrand cleric Moktada al-Sadr said he would suspend vast protests against his political opponents. Other nations in the region issued travel restrictions on Tuesday. The United Arab Emirates, home to Dubai International Airport, one of the world’s busiest, has suspended all flights to Iran. American citizens were advised on Monday to avoid nonessential travel to South Korea because of the rapid spread of the coronavirus there. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has raised the travel warning to Level Three, its highest warning. “There is a widespread, ongoing outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a novel (new) coronavirus that can be spread from person to person,” the C.D.C. said in an advisory. “Older adults and people with chronic medical conditions may be at risk of severe disease.” The C.D.C. also warned that “there is limited access to adequate medical care in affected areas.” The warning came as South Korea reported Tuesday that the number of cases in the country continued to climb fast, reaching 977, up from 156 on Friday. The majority have been centered in the area in and around Daegu, South Korea’s fourth-largest city, 180 miles southeast of Seoul. And roughly half the patients in the country are members of the Shincheonji religious group, a church that has a large following in the city. President Moon Jae-in has put the country on the highest possible alert in its fight against the coronavirus. But Daegu has not resorted to the kind of strict lockdown China has imposed on its hardest-hit places. Though the shops, offices and restaurants of Daegu are unusually empty, they are open for business.

2020,U.S. Stocks Plunge as Coronavirus Crisis Spreads,"As outbreaks spread outside China, spiking in Italy and South Korea, investors are growing increasingly concerned about a global economic slowdown. Get an informed guide to the global outbreak with our daily Coronavirus
 newsletter.
 Investors in the United States have mostly shrugged off the impact of the coronavirus ravaging China. That changed on Monday, when news of the outbreak’s spread drove them to sell stocks — at a furious pace. The S&P 500 index, which had reached a record high as recently as Wednesday, fell 3.4 percent, its worst single-day performance since February 2018. As analysts issued new warnings that the outbreak could drag down economies around the globe, stocks fell enough to wipe out all of the index’s gains for 2020. It was a turbulent day for stocks worldwide: European markets recorded their worst session since 2016, and major benchmarks in Asia also closed down. “There was a cavalier attitude about the virus,” said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Baird, an investment banking and money-management firm. With the threats appearing to increase, he added, “you have to think about the global economy slipping enough to cause a shortfall in earnings.” On Monday, fears were rising that the outbreak could spread further into Asia and Europe. Italy reported it had 219 cases and locked down 11 towns, restricting the movements of 50,000 people. Police and military forces were deployed to ensure that only people with special permission left or entered towns covered by the order. Officials in Lyon, France, stopped a bus from Milan on Monday and confined the passengers inside over suspicions of a case onboard, the newspaper Le Parisien reported. South Korea, a major industrial center, reported 231 new cases a day after its government said it was prepared to use emergency powers if necessary. And state-owned media in Iran reported that the virus had killed 12 people there — the highest death toll outside China. Updated Feb. 26, 2020 In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said there were 53 people infected with the virus, up from 34 on Friday. Nearly all the new infections involve former passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise ship docked in Japan, who have been quarantined on military bases in California and Texas. British officials announced that four passengers who had been in quarantine since returning to the country were infected, raising that country’s number of cases to 13. Not all the news was bad. China may be getting the outbreak under control, the World Health Organization said. Health officials said the daily tally of new infections had been declining since Feb. 2 because of the lockdown around Wuhan, the city at the center of the outbreak. The Chinese government and businesses have begun chartering trains, buses and airplanes to retrieve workers who were stranded by travel restrictions put in place during the Lunar New Year holiday. “We’re encouraged by the continued decline in cases in China,” said Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the organization’s director general. Still, he cautioned that the outbreak could worsen. “Does this virus have pandemic potential?” he said. “Absolutely it has.” New pessimistic forecasts about the economy began to emerge last week. In a note published on Friday, economists at JPMorgan Chase wrote that they expected global growth to slow to a 1 percent annual pace in the first quarter, which would be the weakest quarter of the economic expansion that began after the deep recession that started 12 years ago. In the United States, the consensus estimate for first-quarter domestic growth has slipped to 1.5 percent, according to data from FactSet on Monday, from 1.7 percent at the end of 2019. Economists at Goldman Sachs, who were expecting first-quarter domestic growth of 2 percent as recently as late January, have been steadily lowering their estimate, which fell to 1.2 percent on Sunday. “The risks are clearly skewed to the downside until the outbreak is contained,” they wrote. Airline and technology stocks were particularly hard hit on Monday. Delta Air Lines shares fell 6.3 percent and American Airlines slid 8.5 percent, while Apple stock fell 4.8 percent. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index dropped 3.7 percent. The sell-off continued in Asia on Tuesday morning, starting in Japan: The Nikkei 225 fell about 4 percent after the start of trading in Tokyo. Oil prices dropped, with a barrel of West Texas Intermediate crude slipping nearly 4 percent to roughly $51, a result of the reduced demand from idled factories and restricted travel. Investors rushed to safety: Gold — viewed as a haven during market tumult — rose to a seven-year high. It’s up nearly 10 percent since the start of 2020. And money poured into government bonds, pushing down bond yields, which move in the opposite direction of prices. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.37 percent, near the record low closing of 1.36, a level touched back in July 2016. The yield on the 30-year bond is already in record-low territory at 1.83 percent. Falling yields can buttress the stock market if they reflect increased expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts. But a similar decline might also be bad news if it is a result of broad-based expectations that growth will weaken. The difference between the two is a matter of interpretation. But the sharp decline in recent days seems to have pushed investors toward the latter view. “It’s that shift in the narrative that is forcing equity investors to have to wake up from the complacent stupor that they’ve been in,” said Lisa Shalett, chief investment officer at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management. Officials at the Federal Reserve and within the Trump administration are watching the situation closely, although the central bank’s main tool for stoking growth — lowering interest rates — might not help much if factories are not producing goods and supply chains are disrupted by quarantines. Central bank officials have been clear that they did not expect to cut interest rates again unless rising risks upend their outlook for stable growth. So far, they have cautiously suggested there was no need to sound any alarms. But that was before the spike in infections outside China over the weekend. “The odds of Fed cuts are growing a lot,” Roberto Perli at Cornerstone Macro wrote in a note Monday. “But we need to understand that monetary policy is not well equipped to help in the situation we are facing.” Like the Fed, the White House has been cautious in declaring the disease a major source of concern. Tomas Philipson, acting chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said at the National Association for Business Economists conference in Washington that it was too early to tell how significant the effects of the virus will be. “We don’t know yet, we’re sort of taking a wait-and-see approach,” he said, also noting that the scale of the seasonal influenza is much more significant and that “in terms of the public health impact on the economy, I think that’s been exaggerated.”",The New York Times
2020,U.S. Supports Aid to North Korea for Fighting the Coronavirus,"The North has reported no cases of the virus, but relief groups say it is woefully unprepared to deal with an outbreak. Get an informed guide to the global outbreak with our daily Coronavirus
 newsletter.
 SEOUL, South Korea — The United States said it would approve humanitarian assistance to North Korea to help international aid agencies fight the coronavirus there, amid fears that the impoverished country may be hiding an outbreak. North Korea has not reported any cases of the new coronavirus. But in the past week, some South Korean news reports, citing unnamed sources within the secretive North, said there had been deaths that were suspected to be related to the virus. The reports could not be confirmed. North Korea shares a 930-mile border with China, where the coronavirus emerged. It has since spread to numerous countries; more than 1,500 deaths have been reported, almost all of them in China. North Korea has taken aggressive steps to keep the virus out, including suspending all flights and trains to and from China. But the border has long been porous for smugglers, who ferry goods across the shallow river frontier that separates the two countries. North Korea’s public health system is dysfunctional, and the travel restrictions have made it harder for the North to buy or smuggle medicine, goods or other supplies from China. Relief organizations have complained that American-led international sanctions against the North, imposed because of its nuclear weapons program, have prevented them from providing aid quickly. This week, the Red Cross called for a sanctions exemption that would let it transfer money to its office in North Korea, describing it as “a lifesaving intervention.” It cited an urgent need for personal protective gear and testing kits to prepare for a possible outbreak in the North. The United States has also expressed alarm, and it encouraged American and international aid groups to help the North counter and contain the virus. “The United States is deeply concerned about the vulnerability of the North Korean people to a coronavirus outbreak,” Morgan Ortagus, a State Department spokeswoman, said in a statement. So far, North Korea has said nothing about how many people it may have quarantined or tested for the virus. But it is clearly taking the threat seriously, having suspended international tourism and, more recently, extended the quarantine period for people with coronavirus symptoms, from 14 days to 30 days. Updated Feb. 26, 2020 Its state media has carried photos of mask-wearing officials holding emergency meetings at disease-control centers and disinfecting ports and train stations. The North also asked South Korean officials to vacate a joint liaison office in the North Korean city of Kaesong as a precaution against the virus. ​Earlier this month, state media said health officials had stepped up inspections on “all routes leading to the capital city,” Pyongyang, which is home to North Korea’s elite, including the top leader, Kim Jong-un. It said the authorities were requiring all people passing through Pyongyang’s main train station to wear masks. Amid the many signs that North Korea fears an outbreak, its state media has reported no public appearances by Mr. Kim since he watched a concert​ in Pyongyang a few weeks ago. North Korea has also shut its ports and borders to foreign goods and summoned back​ officials who had been earning hard currency​ in China​, quarantining them on the border, Daily NK said. North Korea’s military​ has also been smuggling in​ large ​quantities of South Korean face masks​ through China, it ​said. Kim Seung-eun, a ​Christian ​pastor​ and human rights activist​ in South Korea who ​works with informants inside the North, said on Friday that he had not heard of any deaths from the coronavirus in the country. He said the North Korean authorities had drastically stepped up border controls, even ordering guards to fire at those attempting to cross the border illegally. That draconian measure has made it impossible for groups like his to smuggle refugees out of North Korea, he said. “North Korea has to take such an extreme step because their medical infrastructure is so bad that if an epidemic breaks out, it could run out of control,” Mr. Kim said. The coronavirus emerged as North Korea seemed to be retreating from a period of relative openness, with the diplomacy between Kim Jong-un and President Trump having produced no concrete agreements on ending the North’s nuclear arms program or the international sanctions. In recent months, North Korea has opened resort towns ​in hopes of attracting Chinese visitors ​and badly needed tourist cash. But the coronavirus has halted that effort. The disruptions in border trade could hurt the national economy. More than 90 percent of North Korea’s official external trade goes through China. “North Korea is under increasing stress because of the coronavirus outbreak in China,” said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor in the international studies division at Ewha Womans University in Seoul. “The revenue stream Kim was anticipating from tourism is running dry and the informal economy is suffering from draconian border and travel restrictions.” “North Korea may be on lockdown now, but it will soon be in need of economic concessions,” he added. That raises the possibility that Pyongyang could return to diplomacy — or resume weapons tests to strengthen its negotiating hand, analysts said. ​",The New York Times
2020,"U.S. Trade Deficit Shrinks, but Not Because Factories Are Returning","New trade data for 2019 reflects a cooling economy and a year of aggressive trade clashes, particularly with China. WASHINGTON — The overall United States trade deficit shrank last year for the first time in six years as the American economy cooled, domestic oil production soared and President Trump waged an aggressive global trade war to rewrite America’s trading terms. The trade deficit for both goods and services fell to $616.8 billion in 2019, down $10.9 billion from the previous year, according to data released by the Commerce Department on Wednesday. Both imports and exports fell as American factory activity slowed and businesses and consumers felt the impact of tariffs imposed on China, the European Union, Canada, Mexico and other nations. Total American exports dropped $1.5 billion to roughly $2.5 trillion, while imports fell $12.5 billion to $3.1 trillion. Soaring domestic oil production was a major factor in the shrinking trade deficit, cutting into imports of foreign crude oil by $30.3 billion last year. Exports of civilian aircraft also fell $12.6 billion last year, reflecting the fallout from the deadly crashes of Boeing’s 737 Max airplane. But the most dramatic changes in global trade flows occurred with China, the target of Mr. Trump’s biggest economic offensive. The trade deficit in goods with China shrank $73.9 billion to $345.6 billion in 2019. It was the first drop on an annual basis since 2016, as both the United States and China placed tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of each others’ products. In particular, American imports from China fell sharply in the final two months of the year, as companies worked to avoid tariffs that Mr. Trump has placed on $360 billion worth of Chinese goods and the potential that he could tax nearly everything from China. Mr. Trump and his advisers have pointed to trends in trade flows as evidence that his trade policies are helping to revive factories and construction sites around the nation. “This is a blue collar boom,” Mr. Trump said in the State of the Union address on Tuesday evening. But most economists have been skeptical, saying that the country’s factory activity weakened last year, and that the trade flows largely reflect a cooling American and global economy. Economists say the hefty tariffs Mr. Trump has placed on China have encouraged American consumers to purchase goods from other countries and have not led to an American manufacturing renaissance. “Tariffs to date have clearly had a significant impact on imports from China,” said Brad Setser, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. “They equally clearly have not led to a stronger U.S. manufacturing sector.” Rather than bringing manufacturing back to the United States, the clash with China has caused American companies and consumers to shift purchases to other countries, like Mexico, Vietnam and South Korea, said Mary E. Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. Data released Wednesday morning showed the trade deficit in goods with Mexico increased $21.1 billion last year to a record $101.8 billion, as the United States brought in more goods from its southern neighbor. The trade deficit in goods with Canada grew by $8 billion, while the gap with Taiwan increased by $7.8 billion. “You’re going to see this rearrangement of the deck chairs,” Ms. Lovely said. The trade deficit in goods with the European Union also expanded to a record $177.9 billion in 2019, presaging Mr. Trump’s next conflict. In recent weeks, Mr. Trump has said that his attention was shifting to Europe now that he has signed trade deals with China, Japan, Canada and Mexico. Mr. Trump has criticized Europe for selling more to the United States than it buys and has accused its central bank of pushing down the value of the euro to make it easier for European companies to compete against American rivals. His administration is already imposing tariffs on Europe over airplane subsidies, and is threatening further levies in response to its digital taxes and on its cars. Many economists have predicted that Mr. Trump’s trade deal with China would give businesses more certainty about trading conditions and cause imports from China to rebound, at least in part, in the coming months. But the spread of a deadly coronavirus has thrown those predictions into question. China has shuttered factories, canceled flights and placed entire cities on lockdown to stop the spread of the virus, weighing heavily on trade. And China may delay some of its planned purchases of American goods as a result. Mr. Trump has long pointed to the United States trade deficit — the gap between what America exports and what it imports — as proof that America is at a competitive disadvantage because of unfair practices by China and other countries. In the president’s view, American businesses would be making more at home and consumers would be buying more domestic goods if countries like China weren’t subsidizing their industries and manipulating their currencies to make their products cheaper. Some analysts agree with that perspective. Michael Stumo, the chief executive of the Coalition for a Prosperous America, which has supported Mr. Trump’s trade moves, said the shrinking trade deficit showed that American consumers were shifting to buying more American-made products, and that Mr. Trump should make his China tariffs permanent. “Rebuilding U.S. manufacturing is the single most important step Washington can take to increase prosperity for America’s middle class,” Mr. Stumo said. But most economists argue that the trade deficit is a poor metric for measuring the health of the economy or America’s trading relationships. While a falling trade deficit can be a sign of a growing economy, the measure can fall for a variety of other reasons, many of them unrelated to trade and not all of them positive. Mr. Setser said that a falling trade deficit can sometimes be a sign of the kind of manufacturing boom that the Trump administration has been trying to engineer. In that case, American factory production would be rising, displacing foreign products from the American market and causing imports to fall and exports to rise. But that is not the situation the United States finds itself in, he said. Instead, factory activity has been weak, and both American imports and exports have contracted, he said. In addition, tariffs and trade uncertainty appear to have cut into business investment, slowing economic growth. When petroleum products are excluded, the United States trade deficit in goods actually rose compared with the year before. Speaking at an event at George Washington University on Tuesday, Janet L. Yellen, the former Federal Reserve chair, said that the bilateral trade deficit between the United States and China was “not the proper focus.” Ms. Yellen said that Mr. Trump and some of his advisers see the trade gap “as a symptom of relationships being unfair.” But for many economists, a country’s overall trade deficit with the rest of the world just means that country is spending more than the output it can produce itself, she said. “Most economists think that a country’s savings and investment are decisions that aren’t affected by trade policy,” she said. Economists point to another major reason focusing on the trade deficit can be misleading: The gap with China is exaggerated because of how the data is calculated. United States trade data counts the entire value of a good as coming from the country it was assembled in. China is still a global center for assembling products like smartphones and laptops, but many of the components and the technology that goes into these goods are made elsewhere. Take a smartphone, for example. A touch screen might be made in Taiwan, or a microprocessor in South Korea. The chips may come from American companies like Qualcomm or Texas Instruments, and the product may have been developed and marketed in the United States. All of those companies and their employees will receive a share of the final profits. But if all of those components are assembled in China before being shipped to the United States, trade statistics will record the entire value of the phone as being generated in China. Economists say this method of measurement may exaggerate the trade deficit with China, perhaps by as much as one-third. Some analysts do see a victory for the United States in the falling trade deficit with China: those in Washington who see China as an increasing national security threat. China’s profits from what it sells to the United States and other nations helps fund its efforts to expand its influence around the globe, like its Belt and Road infrastructure building project, activities that do not benefit the United States, said Derek Scissors, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. “I’d rather put the hard currency in the hands of the South Koreans, the Vietnamese. And normal economists just don’t think that way,” he said. “Economists will say, ‘Oh great, the president has had success on a meaningless indicator he made up for political reasons,’” Mr. Scissors added. “I agree with that. But I want to trade more with my friends” and less with dictators, he said. Jeanna Smialek contributed reporting from Washington.",The New York Times
2020,"U.S. Trade Deficit Shrinks, but Not Because Factories Are Returning","New trade data for 2019 reflects a cooling economy and a year of aggressive trade clashes, particularly with China. WASHINGTON — The overall United States trade deficit shrank last year for the first time in six years as the American economy cooled, domestic oil production soared and President Trump waged an aggressive global trade war to rewrite America’s trading terms. The trade deficit for both goods and services fell to $616.8 billion in 2019, down $10.9 billion from the previous year, according to data released by the Commerce Department on Wednesday. Both imports and exports fell as American factory activity slowed and businesses and consumers felt the impact of tariffs imposed on China, the European Union, Canada, Mexico and other nations. Total American exports dropped $1.5 billion to roughly $2.5 trillion, while imports fell $12.5 billion to $3.1 trillion. Soaring domestic oil production was a major factor in the shrinking trade deficit, cutting into imports of foreign crude oil by $30.3 billion last year. Exports of civilian aircraft also fell $12.6 billion last year, reflecting the fallout from the deadly crashes of Boeing’s 737 Max airplane. But the most dramatic changes in global trade flows occurred with China, the target of Mr. Trump’s biggest economic offensive. The trade deficit in goods with China shrank $73.9 billion to $345.6 billion in 2019. It was the first drop on an annual basis since 2016, as both the United States and China placed tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of each others’ products. In particular, American imports from China fell sharply in the final two months of the year, as companies worked to avoid tariffs that Mr. Trump has placed on $360 billion worth of Chinese goods and the potential that he could tax nearly everything from China. Mr. Trump and his advisers have pointed to trends in trade flows as evidence that his trade policies are helping to revive factories and construction sites around the nation. “This is a blue collar boom,” Mr. Trump said in the State of the Union address on Tuesday evening. But most economists have been skeptical, saying that the country’s factory activity weakened last year, and that the trade flows largely reflect a cooling American and global economy. Economists say the hefty tariffs Mr. Trump has placed on China have encouraged American consumers to purchase goods from other countries and have not led to an American manufacturing renaissance. “Tariffs to date have clearly had a significant impact on imports from China,” said Brad Setser, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. “They equally clearly have not led to a stronger U.S. manufacturing sector.” Rather than bringing manufacturing back to the United States, the clash with China has caused American companies and consumers to shift purchases to other countries, like Mexico, Vietnam and South Korea, said Mary E. Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. Data released Wednesday morning showed the trade deficit in goods with Mexico increased $21.1 billion last year to a record $101.8 billion, as the United States brought in more goods from its southern neighbor. The trade deficit in goods with Canada grew by $8 billion, while the gap with Taiwan increased by $7.8 billion. “You’re going to see this rearrangement of the deck chairs,” Ms. Lovely said. The trade deficit in goods with the European Union also expanded to a record $177.9 billion in 2019, presaging Mr. Trump’s next conflict. In recent weeks, Mr. Trump has said that his attention was shifting to Europe now that he has signed trade deals with China, Japan, Canada and Mexico. Mr. Trump has criticized Europe for selling more to the United States than it buys and has accused its central bank of pushing down the value of the euro to make it easier for European companies to compete against American rivals. His administration is already imposing tariffs on Europe over airplane subsidies, and is threatening further levies in response to its digital taxes and on its cars. Many economists have predicted that Mr. Trump’s trade deal with China would give businesses more certainty about trading conditions and cause imports from China to rebound, at least in part, in the coming months. But the spread of a deadly coronavirus has thrown those predictions into question. China has shuttered factories, canceled flights and placed entire cities on lockdown to stop the spread of the virus, weighing heavily on trade. And China may delay some of its planned purchases of American goods as a result. Mr. Trump has long pointed to the United States trade deficit — the gap between what America exports and what it imports — as proof that America is at a competitive disadvantage because of unfair practices by China and other countries.

2020,"U.S. Tweets Support for Iranian Chess Official, but Ban Wouldn’t Let Her In","American embassies appeared to sympathize with an Iranian woman who feared returning to Iran after an image of her looking like she was not wearing a hijab circulated online. The Iranian chess official said she began seeing the messages of support from American government officials soon after she said she was afraid of returning to her country. An image of the official, Shohreh Bayat, appearing not to wear a hijab at a world chess tournament in China had circulated online and in Iranian media and she quickly went public with her fears that she would be arrested if she returned to Iran. It is against Iranian law for a woman to appear in public without a head scarf. “No wonder Shohreh Bayat is afraid of returning to #Iran,” the United States Embassy in Lisbon said on Twitter on Jan. 24, about a week after her story began appearing in news outlets around the world. “Since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, women risk harsh prison sentences for violating the mandatory hijab law.” Similar messages on the Twitter accounts of American embassies in Armenia and Madrid and the United States Consulate in Barcelona appeared around the same time. Ms. Bayat, 32, a high-level chess referee, said on Friday she was grateful but also confused. “It does seem a little ironic to outwardly support individual Iranians while simultaneously barring their entry to the country,” she said in an email. Iran is one of five Muslim-majority countries that face restrictions under a policy enacted in 2017 by the Trump administration, which argued that those countries needed to satisfy security requirements for travel into the United States. The administration has said the countries, which also include Yemen, Syria, Libya and Somalia, had failed to thoroughly assess the security threat of citizens traveling into the United States. On Friday, the administration added six countries to the list of nations facing stringent travel restrictions, including Myanmar, where the Muslim minority is fleeing genocide. A spokesman for the State Department, declined to say whether the tweets about Ms. Bayat signaled a change in how the administration viewed cases like hers and other Iranians who could be considered dissidents in their country. “We cannot speculate on whether someone may or may not be eligible for a visa,” the spokesman said. “Whenever an individual applies for a U.S. visa, a consular officer reviews the facts of the case and determines whether the applicant is eligible for that visa based on U.S. law.” Ms. Bayat was in Shanghai on Jan. 8 presiding over a chess match during the Women’s World Chess Championship, which began in China and concluded in Russia. During a break, she turned on her phone and saw a picture of herself at the tournament circulating on Iranian media, which is heavily monitored by the government. The picture appeared to show her without the hijab, and Ms. Bayat said Iranian media were accusing her of flouting Iranian law. Ms. Bayat said she was wearing the scarf but it had slipped to the back of her head and the angle of the photograph made it appear as if her entire head was uncovered. “At first, I was deeply shocked and panicked,” she said. “If I could be condemned on Iranian media, with false motives ascribed to me, on the basis of a deceptive photo, without anyone from Iran having even contacted me, then the stark implications of returning home were clear.” She decided that day to stop wearing the hijab, which she said she never wore willingly. Ms. Bayat said she was soon getting supportive messages from around the world, including the American embassies. Ms. Bayat asked to be interviewed by The New York Times by email because she wanted to answer questions carefully and “make sure my answers won’t cause a problem for me or my family.” The tweets from the embassies also linked to an article about Ms. Bayat on ShareAmerica, a website run by the State Department that describes itself as “a platform for communicating American foreign policy worldwide.” The article described how “Iranian women continue to strive for equality” and noted the case of Kimia Alizadeh, an Olympic bronze medal winner who recently announced she was defecting from Iran. The tweets underscore the hypocrisy of the Trump administration “when it comes to Iran,” said Mariko Hirose, litigation director of the International Refugee Assistance Project in New York. She noted how the Trump administration verbally supported Iranian Christians, who face discrimination and persecution in Iran, but declined to allow many of them entry into the United States. “Now, while the American embassies express support for a woman fearing return to Iran, the president has doubled down on a ban that has for three years blocked Iranian families from reuniting with their loved ones in the United States,” Ms. Hirose said. Ms. Bayat is in London where she is trying to sort out her options. She declined to say whether she is seeking asylum. But she said she would not ask for permission to come to the United States, primarily because she is ineligible under the current restrictions. “I had a U.K. visa so I came to the U.K., which is a lovely country,” Ms. Bayat said. She added that most chess events held by the International Chess Federation are in Europe. She remains in contact with her husband and parents in Iran. “For some time they were so emotional that it was even difficult for them to talk to me, but now they are recovering,” Ms. Bayat said. “It is extremely difficult to be far from my family, but I am doing my best to stay strong.”",The New York Times
2020,U.S. Warns of Sexual Assault Risk in Spain,"A security alert issued by the American Embassy in Madrid also warned about the challenge of dealing with the Spanish legal system. MADRID — The United States Embassy in Madrid has warned Americans visiting Spain to take extra precautions because of “a steady increase in the number of sexual assaults” over the last five years in the country. Embassy officials said they were unaware of any similar alerts for a European nation. The security alert, issued on Monday, came as the Spanish authorities are investigating a rape accusation filed by three American sisters against three Afghan men over events on New Year’s Eve in Murcia, in southeastern Spain. It also warned of the challenges that those who experience sexual assault face when seeking justice in the Spanish legal system. The embassy said its alert was a response to an increase in sex attacks “against young U.S. citizen visitors and students throughout Spain.” It cited data from Spain’s interior ministry, noting that the embassy in Madrid had dealt with six reported cases of sex attacks in January, which followed from 34 such reports last year. In an interview with the Spanish newspaper ABC, Benjamin G. Ziff, the deputy chief of the United States mission in Madrid, said “the issue is not only about data of sexual attacks and harassment, but the treatment that North American citizens get after the attack.” In response to the alert, a spokesman for the Spanish interior ministry acknowledged on Wednesday that Spain had seen an increase in the number of reports of sexual assault, but said that Spain still had one of the lowest sex crime rates in Europe. He also suggested that the rise in reported crimes in part reflected a greater readiness by victims to come forward and was in line with the trend in other Western countries. Spain had just under three reported rape cases per 100,000 inhabitants in 2017, according to Eurostat, the statistics agency of the European Union. That was lower than in many other European countries, including in Sweden, where the incidence of rape reached almost 70 that year. However, Eurostat noted, its data does not necessarily reflect actual levels of rape, since it only records attacks against victims who reported the crime to the police. The United States has issued travel warnings for Spain and other European countries over the risk of terrorism, notably after a van attack on Barcelona’s most famous promenade killed 16 people in 2017. That warning was updated last October after a secessionist conflict in the Catalonia region spiraled into several nights of violence in Barcelona and other northeastern cities. The embassy also issued a specific warning in September against a Seville-based tour operator who was accused of assaulting American students. Spain is a highly popular destination for tourists around the globe, with a record 83.7 million visitors last year, according to data released on Monday by its national statistics office. That included over three million Americans, a 13 percent increase from the previous year. Yet Spain has faced stinging criticism over its handling of several high-profile sexual assault cases in recent years, with women’s rights activists charging that the country’s judiciary is dominated by men who judge cases based on faulty ideas about issues like what constitutes consent. Several verdicts have prompted street protests, including some of the world’s largest marches on International Women’s Day. One of the most contentious cases came to the spotlight in 2018, when a court sentenced five men to prison for the “continuous sexual abuse” of an 18-year-old woman during the Pamplona bull-running festival, but cleared them of the more serious charge of rape, which under Spanish law must involve violence or intimidation. That verdict against the five men — who had filmed the assault using a cellphone and who dubbed themselves the “wolf pack” — was overruled in June by Spain’s Supreme Court, which found them guilty of rape and increased their prison sentences on the main charge to 15 years, from nine. Yet in October, a case involving the sexual assault of an unconscious 14-year-old girl also resulted in the conviction of five men on a charge of sexual abuse rather than rape, when that Spanish court ruled that they had not used violence. That type of distinction is part of what led the American Embassy to issue its caution this week, warning that “U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault in Spain can find it very difficult to navigate the local criminal justice system, which differs significantly from the U.S. system.” In the interview with the Spanish newspaper, Mr. Ziff, the United States diplomat in Madrid, also cited other problems with the institutional response to sex attacks in Spain, ranging from how women were treated when reporting to a hospital to how they were questioned by police, including about the clothing they were wearing and their alcohol consumption, as well as whether they had an insurance policy to cover a possible sexual assault. In the court case involving the three American sisters who are accusing three Afghans of raping them on New Year’s Eve, the lawyer of the defendants has cited the fact that the sisters were insured against such an attack as evidence that they fabricated their rape accusations.

2020,U.S. Watchdog to Investigate Trump’s Farm Bailout Program,"The Government Accountability Office will review how the $28 billion farm bailout aimed at cushioning trade-related losses was spent. WASHINGTON — The U.S. Government Accountability Office is opening a review of President Trump’s $28 billion bailout for farmers harmed by his trade war amid allegations that the money was mismanaged and allocated unfairly. The investigation came at the request of Senator Debbie Stabenow, a Michigan Democrat, who has been vocal in her concern that the aid program was biased, providing more funds to southern states that voted for Mr. Trump and favoring large and foreign agriculture companies over small farms. The Trump administration, which signed an initial trade deal with China last month, said the farm subsidies would end this year. The program began in 2018 as a $12 billion effort to mitigate losses for farmers who lost sales or faced retaliatory tariffs from China, the European Union, Canada and Mexico as a result of the trade war. The program grew to $28 billion last year as Mr. Trump’s conflict with China festered. Critics have faulted the program for the formulas it used to determine payments for certain crops and for providing funds to big corporate farms. The program, which used a Depression-era fund, allowed farmers earning less than $900,000 a year to receive money if they produced one of the agricultural products that faced retaliation. The government also purchased certain products, such as apples, oranges and pork. “It’s clear that the Trump administration’s trade assistance payments pick winners and losers rather than help the farmers who have been hit the hardest by this president’s trade policies,” Ms. Stabenow said in a statement on Friday. Ms. Stabenow requested that the G.A.O. study why payments disproportionately went to large farm operations, if the Agriculture Department was effectively preventing fraud, waste and abuse in the program and whether the model the U.S.D.A. used to distribute payments accurately reflected trade damage that farmers experienced. Democrats have complained that the program paid subsidies to some farmers that did not need them while leaving those that were suffering from Mr. Trump’s tariff war with China without benefits. The G.A.O. is a nonpartisan congressional watchdog that audits government programs. The agency notified Ms. Stabenow’s office in a letter transmitted on Thursday that it would take up the investigation. Democrats are not the only ones that have expressed concerns with the farm bailout program. Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, joined with Senator Bob Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey and Representative Rosa DeLauro, Democrat of Connecticut, in asking Sonny Perdue, the agriculture secretary, to investigate JBS, a Brazilian-owned meat-processing company that received $67 million in bailout funds. Lawmakers raised concerns about the payments given the company’s past legal problems: In 2017, two of JBS’s former top executives, brothers Wesley Batista and Joesley Batista, pleaded guilty to corruption charges in Brazil. The brothers remain majority shareholders with control over the company. Mr. Rubio and Mr. Menendez also asked the Treasury Department to investigate possible ties that JBS has with the government of Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela, whom the United States does not recognize as the legitimate president. In a letter to Ms. DeLauro last month, Mr. Perdue said that he did not intend to ask his inspector general to open an investigation into JBS, noting that the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission were already looking into the company’s practices.",The New York Times
2020,U.S. Women’s Soccer Team Sets Price for Ending Lawsuit: $67 Million,"In court filings ahead of a looming gender discrimination trial, the players and U.S. Soccer proposed resolutions to a long-running equal pay fight. The United States Soccer Federation and the members of its World Cup champion women’s national team each proposed a way out of their bitter equal pay lawsuit in court filings late Thursday night. The federation sought to avoid a looming gender discrimination trial by asking the judge to dismiss the players’ claim. The women’s players also asked for a pretrial decision, but on far different terms: They are seeking almost $67 million — and potentially millions more — in back pay and damages. The diametrically opposed motions, filed Thursday in federal court in California before a midnight deadline, showed just how far apart the players and U.S. Soccer remain not only in what they consider a fair outcome but also in their basic concepts of what constitutes equal pay despite years of litigation, depositions, public relations campaigns and — amid it all — two straight World Cup championships. The judge, R. Gary Klausner of United States District Court for the Central District of California, can choose either solution, called a motion for summary judgment, and render moot a trial that he has set to begin in May. But while Klausner appeared to support some of the women’s claims about unequal pay and working conditions when he granted the players class-action status in November, both the players and U.S. Soccer expect him to allow the case to proceed to trial rather than pick a winner now on one side’s terms. The kind of multimillion-dollar award sought by the players — a pool of dozens of athletes, including stars like Alex Morgan and Carli Lloyd but also players who have made only a handful of appearances for the national team — would be a significant blow to U.S. Soccer’s finances, potentially affecting spending not only the men’s and women’s national teams but also youth development, coaching and referee education and dozens of grass-roots soccer programs. In their filing, and in publicly placing a dollar amount on a possible award for the first time, the women’s players presented their motion for summary judgment as a simple matter, the “rare case” where they were entitled to prevail because their claims of unequal pay and gender discrimination were laid out explicitly in contracts with the federation. “There are no genuine issues of fact to prevent the core issues of U.S.S.F.’s liability for wage discrimination from being decided in Plaintiffs’ favor now,” the players’ lead lawyer, Jeffrey Kessler, wrote, citing as support the words of current and former U.S. Soccer officials and even a recent statement from the men’s national team players union. Saying the federation’s actions were in clear violation of federal law, specifically the Equal Pay Act and Title VII, an expert hired by the players calculated an award of back pay and damages of $66,722,148, “with more to be sought in punitive damages at trial in May.” The figure was reached, the players’ expert said, by taking the women’s performances, schedules and match results and calculating what they would have earned under the separate compensation schedule in place for the United States men’s national team. Calculations like those, U.S. Soccer has long argued, are inaccurate — and unfair — because they include World Cup bonuses paid by FIFA, the sport’s global governing body, for the far more lucrative men’s World Cup. Those payments dwarf the ones paid for competing in the Women’s World Cup, but they are set by FIFA, not U.S. Soccer. In bolstering their case, the players’ lawyers quoted comments by U.S. Soccer’s current president, Carlos Cordeiro, and his predecessor, Sunil Gulati, that they said proved the federation was guilty of gender-based decision making. U.S. Soccer’s filing countered by quoting the star midfielder Megan Rapinoe, an outspoken advocate for the players’ cause. In the quote, she praised the federation’s long support for women’s soccer generally and for the national team specifically, and said comparing the jobs of the women with the men was “just apples and oranges.” In its motion, U.S. Soccer argued — as it has, sometimes clumsily, in other forums — that the men’s and women’s players are separate groups who perform different work, and that any disparities in compensation are a direct result of separate collective bargaining agreements negotiated by each team. “As a result of the collective bargaining process, the WNT players obtained many contract terms the MNT players do not enjoy in their contract,” U.S. Soccer said, listing, among other items, guaranteed club salaries, maternity and child-care benefits, and severance pay when they are no longer on the team. U.S. Soccer also noted that the players have long prioritized — and did once again in their latest contract in 2017 — a compensation system that emphasized security, in the form of guaranteed salaries, over potentially higher rewards in the bonus-based payment structure that the men play under. It would contravene the law, U.S. Soccer’s lawyers contended, to allow a jury to “retroactively and selectively” rewrite the plaintiffs’ collective bargaining agreement to give them the benefit of the higher reward “when they never took the higher risk.” In fact, U.S. Soccer argued, the players on the women’s team have actually been paid millions of dollars more than their men’s counterparts by the federation in recent years: $37 million for the women, when their club salaries were included, to $21 million for the men. But that calculus, too, is misleading: The players earn their club salaries by playing dozens more games than the men do, and the calculation covers a time period in which — conveniently for the federation — the women have earned two multimillion-dollar FIFA bonuses for winning the World Cup while the men missed the 2018 World Cup, and thus received no FIFA bonus at all. As in 2016, the women’s players, by pressing their cause, risk seeing their bid for equal pay becoming entangled with their preparations for the Summer Olympics. Earlier this month, the United States qualified for the Tokyo Games by winning a regional championship. In March and April, the team will play a series of matches against top rivals also headed to Tokyo — including England, Japan, Brazil and Australia — all while the American players, united in the equal pay fight, maneuver against one another to try to secure one of the 18 places on the Olympic roster. Then, if Klausner takes no action on the dueling motions for summary judgment, the sides are set to meet in his courtroom on May 5.",The New York Times
2020,U.S. Women’s Team Qualifies for Olympic Soccer Tournament,"The Americans, the reigning World Cup champions, will look to claim their fifth Olympic crown at the Tokyo Games this summer. CARSON, Calif. — The United States women’s national team, starting 10 of the 11 players that delivered a victory in the Women’s World Cup final last July, clinched a berth in the Tokyo Olympics with a 4-0 win over Mexico on Friday night. The Olympic spot was the prize in the teams’ winner-take-all semifinal at their regional qualifying tournament, but perhaps more important, the result positioned the Americans, winners of the past two World Cup titles, to atone for the most humbling chapter in their recent history: an embarrassing quarterfinal exit from the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. Friday’s job was done early, with goals by Rose Lavelle and Sam Mewis in the first 14 minutes that disabused Mexico of any ideas about an upset. Mewis added another goal on a scorching low free kick midway through the second half, and the substitute Christen Press scored the Americans’ fourth in the 72nd minute, five minutes after she had entered the game. The United States will face Canada, which claimed the region’s other spot in the Tokyo Games with a 1-0 victory over Costa Rica in Friday’s first semifinal, in Sunday’s championship game. But regardless of how that goes, the team’s first job under its new coach, Vlatko Andonovski — qualifying for Tokyo — is now a box ticked. “It’s exciting,” Andonovski said. “I’m glad that they’re just as excited, and maybe more.” “It’s very important for a team that just won two World Cups back to back, that those emotions and that motivation is something that’s the hardest to get back up again. I was just glad to see that the emotions are there, that the motivation is there to make it happen. We are moving in the right direction, and I’m very happy with the stage we are at.” Lavelle, the breakout star of the Americans’ World Cup run in 2019, opened the scoring against Mexico in the fifth minute, running onto a back-heel pass from Megan Rapinoe and driving at two defenders at the top of the circle. Before the backpedaling Mexican players knew what was happening, Lavelle had pulled a left-footed shot from the top of the circle behind them into the lower right corner. Mewis doubled the lead less than 10 minutes later, pouncing on a Julie Ertz backheel off a bounding Rapinoe corner and one-timing a finish from near the penalty spot. Barely 15 minutes after kickoff, the game felt over. The United States, which has outscored its four opponents in this tournament by 22-0, and Canada, which has done one better at 23-0, have once again been the class of the region. Canada’s victory meant that the best player in the country’s women’s soccer history, Christine Sinclair, will head back to the Olympics just a month after her 37th birthday. She can thank her heir apparent, Jordyn Huitema, who is only 18, for the trip. Huitema’s goal, in the 72nd minute, sent Canada to its fourth straight Olympics. The Games will also be the fourth to include Sinclair, who earlier in the tournament broke Abby Wambach’s international record for goals by a women’s player. The goal that delivered Canada was at once accidental and clinical. Meeting a driven cross from Kadeisha Buchanan in the goal mouth, Huitema calmly redirected the ball toward the left post with her left foot — only to see it carom directly back to her. Huitema, who made her senior national team debut as a 15-year-old in 2017, calmly met the ricochet with her right foot and slotted her second chance inside the right post. The team’s celebrations may have given a hint at their mind-sets about what lies ahead: When the final whistle blew in Canada’s win, its substitutes sprinted off the bench and swallowed their teammates in joyous hugs. When the United States’s victory was assured, its starters and reserves mingled among themselves shaking hands, the emotion barely rising above the goodbyes at the end of a Rotary club meeting. There were smiles and even a little dancing later on as they circled the field thanking fans, but this was — at its core — a get-the-job-done performance. “Throughout all of this we kind of didn’t want to take anything for granted,” forward Carli Lloyd said, “so it’s good to get that out of the way.” Canada, the bronze medalist in London in 2012 and again at the Games in 2016, and the United States, the gold medalist in four of the previous Olympic tournaments, became the seventh and eighth nations to claim a place in the 12-team Olympic field. They joined the host, Japan; Brazil; New Zealand; and the three European qualifiers: Great Britain, Sweden and the Netherlands. Four places remain: two from Asia, one from Africa and a one from an Africa-South Africa playoff in April. The penultimate round of Asia’s qualifying tournament is currently being played in two groups, in South Korea and Australia. The latter four-team group, which includes the favorites Australia and China, was originally scheduled to play in Wuhan, China, but was moved to Australia last month because of the coronavirus outbreak. The delegation from China arrived in Brisbane without several of its players, and was immediately quarantined in a hotel. Despite having to practice in hallways, the Chinese opened with a 6-1 victory against Thailand on Friday. The Olympic women’s tournament begins July 22, two days before the opening ceremony in Tokyo.",The New York Times
2020,U.S. and Allies Blame Russia for Cyberattack on Republic of Georgia,"Britain and Australia joined the State Department’s effort to deter Moscow from interfering in the 2020 U.S. presidential election. The United States and its key allies on Thursday accused Russia’s main military intelligence agency of a broad cyberattack against the republic of Georgia in October that took out websites and interrupted television broadcasts, in a coordinated effort to deter Moscow from intervening in the 2020 presidential election in the United States. The accusation, issued by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, was particularly notable at a time when President Trump has been seeking to shift blame for interference in the 2016 election from Russia to Ukraine, a central element of his impeachment trial last month. Russian military intelligence, known as the G.R.U., was one of the agencies implicated in the cyberoperations aimed at interfering in that election and in a 2017 attack that struck major companies around the world, including Merck, Federal Express and Maersk. That attack is considered one of the most destructive and expensive in history, causing billions of dollars in damage. By comparison, the attack on Georgia in October was limited, and received only modest press coverage at the time. So it was a surprise when Mr. Pompeo’s statement on Thursday was backed up by simultaneous accusations from Britain, Australia and a host of European nations, all lending credence to the American conclusion that Russia’s Main Center for Special Technology, a unit with the G.R.U., was responsible. For the first time, the State Department also linked the Russian military unit to a notorious Russian hacker group known as Sandworm, which is believed to be responsible for some of the most brazen cyberattacks around the world over the past decade. “This action contradicts Russia’s attempts to claim it is a responsible actor in cyberspace and demonstrates a continuing pattern of reckless Russian G.R.U. cyberoperations against a number of countries,” Mr. Pompeo said of the attack on Georgia. “These operations aim to sow division, create insecurity and undermine democratic institutions.” A senior administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the decision to name Russia, said it was notable that the accusation came from Mr. Pompeo — one of Mr. Trump’s most vociferous defenders but also a hawk on Russia’s use of hybrid warfare. The official said the announcement was specifically meant as a warning to the Kremlin. It mirrors the National Security Agency’s move in 2018 to briefly shut down the Internet Research Agency, another Russian unit that operates outside the formal government structure and that had been involved in the attacks related to the last presidential election. The decision to name the G.R.U., and its special cyberunit in particular, was part of a new strategy of calling out attackers in hopes of preventing future strikes, the official said. But it is far from clear that the administration’s new “name and shame” effort, along with criminal prosecutions and counterattacks on Russian cyberunits, is successfully deterring attacks. Members of the G.R.U. were indicted in 2018 by Robert S. Mueller III as part of his investigation into Russian election interference. Yet the attack in Georgia took place last fall, a year later, and involved techniques that American officials have been studying to determine if they might be used against the United States in the coming election. Neither the United States nor its allies released any evidence used to establish how they tied the attacks to the G.R.U. That made it easier for the Russian Foreign Ministry to deny that Moscow was behind the assault. “Russia did not plan and is not planning to interfere in Georgia’s internal affairs in any way,” said the deputy foreign minister, Andrey Rudenko, according to the news site RIA. There could be any number of reasons the United States has not released evidence. It may have wanted to avoid revealing its sources and methods, including getting inside Russian networks — though in the G.R.U. indictment, it was clear the United States was reading text messages and other communications of the agency’s officers. Under a relatively new American strategy for countering cyberattacks, called “persistent engagement,” the National Security Agency and United States Cyber Command, its military partner, operate inside adversary networks. For years, Russia has tormented neighboring countries with targeted cyberattacks, including orchestrating two blackouts in Ukraine and broad online assaults on Estonian institutions. There were cyberattacks on Georgia in 2008, as part of a hybrid action in which Russia took control of some Russian-speaking parts of the country. It retains that control today. The United States never formally attributed the cyberelement of those attacks to Russia, though outside experts say it was all part of a unified military operation that, in retrospect, was a crude but effective foreshadowing of Russian operations to come. Mr. Trump has never publicly called out Russia for its cyberoperations. During the 2016 presidential debates, he argued that it was impossible to determine where a cyberattack originated — though that is exactly what his intelligence agencies and the State Department did in the Georgia case on Thursday. Early in Mr. Trump’s administration, the White House cybercoordinator announced that there was evidence that Russia was the source of the NotPetya attack. That strike was aimed at crippling Ukraine but resulted in considerable collateral damage, including the shipping operations at Maersk and Federal Express. During his now-famous July 25, 2019, telephone conversation with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, Mr. Trump appeared to be seeking to deflect blame from Russia and its intelligence units for the attacks on the Democratic National Committee in 2016. “The server, they say Ukraine has it,” Mr. Trump said, according to a reconstructed transcript released by the White House last fall. In fact, the primary server — one of several — is blocks from the White House at the committee’s headquarters. The attack on Georgia was a classic act of disruption, though relatively modest by current standards. It affected more than 2,000 government and privately run websites, interfered with government operations and interrupted television broadcasts, including that of the national television station. In the attack, for example, the image of a former president of Georgia, Mikheil Saakashvili, was pasted to the home pages of many sites, with the caption, “I’ll be back.” Mr. Saakashvili served two terms from 2004 to 2013. He gave up his Georgian citizenship in 2015 and is wanted in the country on criminal charges, which he says are politically motivated. Vladimer Konstantinidi, a spokesman for Georgia’s Foreign Ministry, told reporters at a news briefing on Thursday, “The investigation conducted by the Georgian authorities, together with information gathered through cooperation with partners, concluded that this cyberattack was planned and carried out by the main division of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation.” Mr. Pompeo pledged to support Georgia and other nations threatened by cyberaggression from Russia. “The United States calls on Russia to cease this behavior in Georgia and elsewhere,” he said. “The stability of cyberspace depends on the responsible behavior of nations.”",The New York Times
2020,"U.S. and Taliban Agree to Reduce Violence, in First Step To Peace Deal","American negotiators had insisted on a decline in hostilities — though not a complete cease-fire — before signing an agreement with the Taliban. MUNICH — American officials said on Friday they had agreed with the Taliban on a seven-day reduction in violence in Afghanistan that, if it holds, would be followed by an Afghan peace agreement after 18 years of war. The decrease in hostilities would be the first step in a plan leading to withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan, though there have been indications that the United States would want to keep some counterterrorism and intelligence forces there. The agreement on a reduction in violence was announced by a senior administration official at the annual Munich Security Conference, where Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper are defending American policies. But the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the Taliban would have to adhere to that reduction for seven days before a formal peace pact could be signed. The timing is notable. If the seven-day period begins this weekend or early next week, and it holds for a week, the peace agreement would be ready to sign around the time that President Trump is scheduled to travel to India. That opens the possibility that the president, who previously attempted to bring members of the Taliban to Camp David for a signing, would have the option of traveling to a secure location, like Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan, to formalize an agreement. A truce has been widely expected, and Mr. Pompeo and Mr. Esper met on Friday in Munich with Ashraf Ghani, Afghanistan’s president. But there was no announcement of an imminent deal, and similar efforts have fallen apart. Mr. Trump pulled back on an accord last year after an attack that killed an American soldier and 11 others. The senior official who briefed reporters in Munich said that the agreement would not go into effect until a verified, successful reduction in hostilities, which is far short of a blanket cease-fire. The violence reduction deal, the official said, is highly specific, saying that it would have to be nationwide and include violence against Afghans as well as members of the American-led coalition, and would apply to all the elements of violence that have become familiar in 18 years of war: roadside bombs, suicide bombs and rocket attacks. The pace of an American pullout is the issue of most political importance to Mr. Trump. One of the few issues on which he and the Democratic challengers for president agree is the need for the United States to get out of Afghanistan — though many of the candidates said in a survey published by The New York Times last week that they would keep a small counterterrorism force and some intelligence presence. The Trump administration seems likely to do the same. But officials would not discuss any side agreements with the Taliban that might permit such a presence, including by the C.I.A. The senior official said any American presence depends on whether the Taliban deliver on their promises. All sides are keenly aware that history suggests there will be multiple chances for the deal to break down. But it is the closest they have come to President Trump’s goals of withdrawing many of the American troops in Afghanistan and ending the United States’ longest war. The initial seven-day reduction in violence is seen as a test not only of good intentions, but also of the ability of the Taliban and the Afghan government to rein in their forces and those of their allies, in a war made more complex by internal rivalries and local disputes. A decline in hostilities would be an abrupt shift, coming off one of the most violent years in the long conflict. In 2019, the civilian death rate averaged almost seven per day, the United States dropped more than 7,000 bombs and missiles, and the Taliban and smaller armed insurgent groups carried out about 25,000 attacks. The deal would lay out a 135-day timetable for drawing down American troop strength in Afghanistan from about 13,000 to 8,600; United States officials had indicated that they planned to make the reduction with or without an agreement in place. It calls for a complete withdrawal within three to five years, though it is not clear what constitutes “complete withdrawal.” It also calls for the start of negotiations between the government in Kabul and the Taliban — something the Taliban has long refused — on a long-term power-sharing settlement. Afghan leaders have been frustrated by the United States’ acceding to the Taliban’s demand that negotiations, held over the past year in Doha, Qatar, exclude the government, even as deadly violence continued. In September, American and Taliban negotiators were close to an agreement, and Mr. Trump planned to meet Taliban leaders in person, before he dropped the deal because of a Taliban attack.",The New York Times
2020,U.S. to Start Trade Talks With Kenya to Counter China’s Influence,"A deal would have a limited impact on the American economy, but the Trump administration sees it as an important geopolitical move. WASHINGTON — The Trump administration announced on Thursday that it would begin talks for a free-trade deal with Kenya, a step partly designed to counter China’s influence in Africa. The deal, which is likely to require many months of negotiations, would be the United States’ first trade pact with a sub-Saharan African nation and its second with an African country. It signed an agreement with Morocco in 2004. While the agreement could help some farmers and other industries sell into and invest in Kenya, it is unlikely to have much influence on the American economy overall. Kenya is the United States’ 98th-largest trading partner in goods, with $1 billion in two-way trade in 2018, according to the Office of the United States Trade Representative. Kenya’s biggest American imports include aircraft, machinery and agricultural goods; the United States buys Kenyan apparel, tree nuts and coffee. But the Trump administration and other officials in Washington see the move partly in geopolitical terms, believing it could provide a model for other trade deals with African countries and be a step toward countering China’s growing influence on the continent. President Trump welcomed Kenya’s president, Uhuru Kenyatta, to the White House on Thursday afternoon to discuss the plan. When a reporter asked if he planned to sign a trade agreement with Kenya, Mr. Trump responded, “Probably.” At the U.S. Chamber of Commerce later in the afternoon, during an event sponsored by Uber and other companies, Mr. Kenyatta said the agreement “will not only serve Kenya and the United States but will probably set the base for renewed engagement between the United States and other African countries.” “We see clearly the opportunity that exists, and we want to be trailblazers and set a path for others on the continent to follow,” he told a gathering of American and Kenyan officials and businesspeople. He added, “Don’t let others take what should be yours.” Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, said in a statement that Kenya was “an important strategic partner of the United States, and there is enormous potential for us to deepen our economic and commercial ties.” The administration believes that an agreement with Kenya “will receive broad bipartisan support in Congress,” he added. The Trump administration had discussed for more than two years which African country to select for trade talks — an effort explicitly aimed at countering China. Mr. Lighthizer said in a radio interview in early 2018 that Africa was only a few years away from being the world’s population center, “and if we don’t figure out a way to move them right, then China and others are going move them in the wrong direction,” according to the publication Inside U.S. Trade. China has lent vast sums of money to African governments and built ports, roads, airports and bridges around the continent as part of its Belt and Road Initiative. The projects include a 300-mile, $4 billion railway in Kenya that has linked Nairobi and Mombasa. China says its investments in Africa are aimed purely at driving economic development, and many countries have welcomed improvements to their infrastructure that have aided the flow of commerce. But some projects have left governments, including Kenya’s, saddled with billions of dollars of debt to China and sparked distrust and resentment. In a 2018 speech in Washington attended by many African officials, Mr. Lighthizer said that many African countries had signed free-trade agreements with some of America’s largest “competitors,” like the European Union and China, and that these governments were investing heavily. “My sense, however, is that many of you recognize the value of diversifying your commercial ties, and I know you recognize what American companies bring to the table,” Mr. Lighthizer told the African officials. Scott Eisner, the president of the U.S.-Africa Business Center at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said in a call with reporters on Wednesday that Kenya had made the most forceful case to the administration for starting trade talks. “It really is who was willing to raise their hand and who had the most political will behind it,” he said. Mr. Eisner said the trade deal could benefit American agricultural producers who would sell into Kenya; textile manufacturers looking to invest in the country; and companies, like John Deere and Caterpillar, that would sell and service equipment. But if the deal is a comprehensive, high-standard trade agreement, it probably won’t be completed this year, he said. An agreement that addresses the bulk of trade between the countries would require congressional approval. Whether such a deal could pass Congress remains to be seen. For example, Democrats could be concerned about Kenya’s low wages and labor standards. Nations across Africa are pursuing a large-scale effort to break down trade barriers and integrate their economies. In May, the African Union initiated the African Continental Free Trade Area, a deal aimed at breaking down trade barriers and minimizing trade disputes. Also, preferential trading terms that the United States has offered certain sub-Saharan African countries are set to expire in the coming years. The African Growth and Opportunity Act, which allows those countries to send goods to the United States duty free, is scheduled to expire in 2025, and it’s unclear whether Congress will renew it. Over 70 percent of Kenya’s exports to the United States enter under those terms, according to the United States trade representative’s office.",The New York Times
2020,"U.S.C. Offers Free Tuition to Students Whose Families Make $80,000 or Less","Recognizing the high cost of living in California, the university will also no longer include the value of a home in the calculation used to determine financial need. The University of Southern California announced Thursday that it would wipe out tuition for students from lower and middle-income families, becoming the latest institution to confront skyrocketing costs amid a national debate over rising student debt loads. American students from families with annual incomes of $80,000 or less will be eligible for the full undergraduate tuition waiver at U.S.C. starting in the fall. The move comes as the school is attempting to draw students with more socio-economic diversity, competing with both the University of California system and prestigious private universities that offer generous financial aid programs. U.S.C. is one of the largest private universities in the country, and its palm tree-lined campus of 48,500 students, where the children of immigrants study alongside those of celebrities, plays an outsize role in Los Angeles, a city wrestling with income inequality. The class divide was further emphasized by last year’s college admissions scandal, in which numerous wealthy parents were accused of bribing their children’s way into the school. In the last decade, U.S.C. has recruited pre-eminent faculty and poured money into research to become a top-tier academic institution and athletic powerhouse. But it has also been rocked by scandal, including accusations of sexual misconduct by the longtime head gynecologist of the university’s health center, and the resignation of the dean of the medical school over allegations of drug use on campus. U.S.C.’s president, Carol L. Folt, who was hired last year, said the offer of free tuition would help the university compete for students who might otherwise go to California’s public system, which is relatively generous with financial aid and offers significantly lower costs. “More students who want to come to U.S.C. will be able to choose that,” she said. Tuition at U.S.C. was roughly $57,000 this academic year, but the total cost of attending, including housing, food and books, reached almost $77,500. In offering financial support, the university will also take into account the skyrocketing cost of living in Southern California, Dr. Folt said. Owning a home will no longer be considered in the calculation used to determine a student’s financial need. High real estate prices can exaggerate the wealth of lower- and middle-class families who have a large part of their net worth tied up in their homes. “People work so hard to have a house,” Dr. Folt said, “and we didn’t want that to count against their chances of having their kids going to the school.” Other private schools around the country have moved to promote racial, ethnic and income diversity by reducing the price of college. The free-tuition movement has been concentrated at opposite ends of the educational spectrum, in community colleges in cities like Chicago and states like Tennessee, as well as in the most elite schools. Both Harvard and Stanford make tuition free or close to it for students from families with incomes of up to $150,000, nearly twice the threshold set by U.S.C. States have also sought to reduce costs at their public colleges, with nearly half, including New York, Oregon and Tennessee, guaranteeing free tuition at two- or four-year schools to their lowest-income residents. New Mexico lawmakers are debating a plan to make tuition at the state’s public colleges and universities free for all residents. And the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where Dr. Folt was chancellor until recently, has steadily increased its percentage of low-income students. U.S.C.’s plan takes a page out of the University of California’s playbook, setting the same family income limit for tuition-free education — $80,000 — as the public system’s “Blue and Gold Opportunity Plan.” U.S.C. said it will increase the amount of undergraduate aid it offers by more than $30 million a year, mainly through philanthropy, giving more help to 4,000 students a year. About a third of the fall 2020 and spring 2021 entering classes will benefit either from free tuition or larger aid packages, the school said. “This will be a focus of our fund-raising efforts going forward,” said Eric Abelev, a school spokesman. Its last campaign raised $7 billion, including $636 million for scholarship support. Currently, 31 percent of U.S.C.’s undergraduate students come from families in the bottom 60 percent of income earners nationwide, the school said. The student body, including graduate and undergraduate students, is 29 percent white, 5.3 percent African-American, 16.9 percent Asian-American, and 14.6 percent Hispanic, with 25.4 percent from other countries. “It’s fitting that U.S.C., which was at the center of the Varsity Blues scandal, would take this important step,” said Richard D. Kahlenberg, a senior fellow at the Century Foundation who studies college opportunity for low-income students. But for U.S.C. to truly change the socioeconomic balance of its student body, the school would probably have to admit some applicants with lower SAT scores, which correlate strongly with the advantages that come from growing up in a higher-income family, Mr. Kahlenberg said. U.S.C.’s announcement comes amid a national push to make college tuition more affordable. About 42 million borrowers owe $1.5 trillion in outstanding student loans across America, experts say. Relieving student debt and providing some level of free public college tuition have become universal goals of the Democratic presidential candidates, although their plans differ in who would be covered and for how much. Some low- and middle-income students have been scared off by college debt from even attempting to go to the best college they are qualified for, potentially reducing their future earnings, studies show. Experts point out that even if tuition is free, other college costs remain substantial and can be prohibitive for students of modest means. And continually rising costs mean that the debt load on Americans isn’t likely to drop much in the next few decades, despite efforts such as U.S.C.’s. The average student borrower takes out about $26,000 in loans over the course of earning a bachelor’s degree — debt that is impossible to discharge in bankruptcy, difficult to have forgiven and increasingly unlikely to be fully repaid on schedule. While acknowledging the need to help more people afford college, Dr. Folt defended the high cost of schools like hers, saying it was an outgrowth of the many opportunities for research, travel and learning that an institution like U.S.C. provides. “It’s expensive to do,” she said. “Wherever we can make it so the cost is not prohibitive, I think that’s where we focus our efforts.”",The New York Times
2020,"UBS Names Ralph Hamers, From ING, to Be Its Next C.E.O.","Mr. Hamers will succeed Sergio Ermotti at UBS, the world’s biggest wealth management firm. UBS Group has named the head of ING, Ralph Hamers, as the successor to Sergio Ermotti, the Swiss bank’s chief executive. In a surprise announcement late on Wednesday, UBS said Mr. Hamers would leave Netherlands-based ING in June after a 29-year career to join UBS, the world’s biggest wealth manager, in September. Mr. Ermotti has spent close to a decade at UBS, winning plaudits for overhauling its strategy after the financial crisis, cutting its investment bank and growing its wealth management business. But UBS missed its profit and cost targets for 2019 amid ultralow interest rates in Europe and increased competition from U.S. rivals, forcing Mr. Ermotti to dial back some of its goals. UBS shares fell sharply last year, and the company was hit by a 4.5 billion euro ($5 billion) fine in a French tax fraud case. UBS becomes the second major Swiss lender this month to replace its C.E.O. On Feb. 7, Credit Suisse said Thomas Gottstein would succeed Tidjane Thiam, who resigned following a spying scandal. ING, the Dutch bank and financial services firm, did not immediately disclose its plans on finding a new chief but said a succession process would begin “if and when appropriate.” Mr. Hamers’s appointment ends speculation that Iqbal Khan, a prominent wealth manager who joined UBS last year after leaving Credit Suisse, could be in line to replace Mr. Ermotti.",The New York Times
2020,UEFA Warns Staff of Safety Concerns Amid Manchester City Backlash,"European soccer’s governing body has ordered its employees to keep a low profile at matches involving Manchester City as fans fume over the club’s Champions League ban. Facing abuse and anger over its decision to ban Manchester City, the English soccer champion, from its competitions, European soccer’s governing body this week took the unusual step of ordering its staff members not to wear branded clothing when they travel to matches involving the team, or even to games played in Manchester. The warnings from the body, UEFA, included the Europa League match on Thursday between Manchester United and Club Brugge of Belgium. Manchester City fans have fumed for years about what they consider the mistreatment of their club by UEFA. But that anger has increased since Feb. 14, when UEFA issued Manchester City a two-season ban from the Champions League, starting next season, and a fine of 30 million euros ($27 million) after an investigation into accusations that City had violated UEFA’s cost-control regulations. The club’s response throughout the process has been a full-throated denial, and accusations that UEFA’s process has been biased and prejudicial. It filed its official appeal of the punishment on Wednesday at the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Switzerland. But fan vitriol — taking aim not only at UEFA and its executives, but also at news media outlets that have reporters on the case and individual journalists — has continued to appear on social media and fan message boards and even inside City’s stadium, where last week fans displayed signs that called UEFA a “mafia” and a “cartel.” Manchester City, which has never won the Champions League, moved a step closer to the quarterfinals of this year’s competition on Wednesday with a dramatic 2-1 victory at Real Madrid. The victory came hours after news that City had filed its appeal at CAS. But the UEFA officials traveling to the game at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in Madrid wore plainclothes, said two people familiar with the contents of an internal memo that was sent to staff members. UEFA will take the same precautions when the two teams meet for the deciding game in Manchester on March 17. A spokesman for UEFA declined to comment on the memo, saying the organization does not discuss the safety guidance it gives to its employees. Some UEFA officials are accustomed to keeping a low profile, especially those who work what the organization considers high-risk matches. But the warnings about fans of City, who do not have a reputation for crowd violence, were unusual. Manchester City fans’ antipathy toward UEFA predates the European ban. Spectators have long jeered the Champions League anthem when it is played before matches in the competition, amid a festering sense that the team — which was lifted out of decades of mediocrity by the riches of its Gulf ownership group — is treated unfairly because it is not a part of soccer’s established elite. Shortly after Manchester City’s ban was announced, the club issued a statement in which it decried a “prejudicial process” that was “initiated by UEFA, prosecuted by UEFA and judged by UEFA.” “Ultimately,” the team’s chief executive, Ferran Soriano, said in an interview with the club’s website, “this seems to be less about justice and more about politics.” Still, the scale and the tone of fan frustration have led UEFA to take no chances. And it is not the only group facing a backlash. At last year’s F.A. Cup final, which City won to complete a sweep of English titles in one season, a fan stormed into the press seating area at Wembley Stadium and profanely berated members of the news media over what he called bias toward City’s title rival Liverpool. Paul McCarthy, an official with the Football Writers’ Association, an organization that represents soccer journalists, told The New York Times that he had been in communication with Manchester City about the hostile messages, which have included not only personal abuse but also threats of violence and the publication of personal information. One popular unofficial fan forum has in recent days taken down some of the offending material. “The forum in question, which is independent of Manchester City F.C., is responsibly managed and has been since its inception,” a City representative said. “Manchester City F.C. has always been impressed with its ability to both present a platform for open debate whilst robustly policing antisocial or offensive posts. The small number of messages which appear to have breached the self-imposed strict rules of the forum were swiftly removed by the moderators themselves prior to any concern being raised by the club, the NYT or indeed any third party.”",The New York Times
2020,"Uber Posts Faster Growth, but Loses $1.1 Billion","Uber’s ride-hailing business grew faster in the fourth quarter of 2019, even as the company grappled with continued challenges. SAN FRANCISCO — Uber capped a difficult 2019 by posting faster growth in its ride-hailing business, even as it lost more money. On Thursday, Uber said its revenue in the fourth quarter of 2019 increased 37 percent to $4 billion from a year ago, faster than the 30 percent growth it recorded in the previous quarter. The company lost $1.1 billion, more than the $887 million it lost a year earlier. “We recognize that the era of growth at all costs is over,” said Dara Khosrowshahi, Uber’s chief executive. “I’m gratified by our progress, steadily delivering against the commitments we’ve made to our shareholders on our path to profitability.” The results were driven by Uber’s main ride-hailing business, with the number of trips rising 28 percent to more than 1.9 billion from a year earlier and revenue increasing 27 percent to more than $3 billion. In contrast, Uber’s food delivery business, Uber Eats, lost $461 million on revenue of $734 million. Mr. Khosrowshahi previously said Uber aimed to make an operating profit by 2021. But on Thursday, he said the company would reach that milestone by the final quarter of 2020. Nelson Chai, Uber’s chief financial officer, added that Uber expected to earn adjusted revenue of $16 billion to $17 billion this year as it worked to become profitable. The company also plans to cut back on the discounts and coupons it has used to grow, he said, calling them “bookings that are essentially empty calories.” Uber had gone into retreat for much of 2019 after staging a disappointing initial public offering in May. The company, which spends a lot of money to attract passengers and drivers, immediately faced doubts over whether it could ever make a profit. Since then, Uber’s stock has plunged. In response to its critics, Mr. Khosrowshahi has cut costs at the company and pulled back parts of its business. Last year, he laid off more than 1,000 employees and withdrew Uber’s food delivery service from South Korea. Last month, Mr. Khosrowshahi also sold Uber’s food delivery business in India to a local competitor, Zomato. “Clearly, Uber has put out a somewhat aggressive timeline for profitability,” said Tom White, a senior equity research analyst at D.A. Davidson. “These exits are partly a function of them making sure they meet that target.” Uber is dealing with other challenges. On Jan. 1, California legislation went into effect that may force the company to reclassify its drivers, who are freelancers, as employees. That would drive up Uber’s costs because it would have to provide them with benefits and other perks. Uber sued to block the law last year and has asked for a preliminary injunction that would give it a reprieve from the new rules until the case was resolved. The company also faces hurdles in London, one of its biggest markets. In November, London authorities decided not to extend Uber’s taxi operating license because of persistent safety problems. Uber continues to operate there while it appeals the decision. “Regulation of ride sharing is finally catching up,” Mr. White said. “These businesses are looking less and less like these completely transformative, transportation-as-a-service models, and more and more like tech-enabled taxi companies. You have a lot more regulation, a lot more fees and a lot more oversight, which generally raises costs.” It has not been all bad news for the company. A court in Brazil ruled on Wednesday that Uber’s drivers could not be considered employees.",The New York Times
2020,Ukraine Is Threatening to Arrest Its Former President,"The Ukrainian authorities have threatened to arrest Petro O. Poroshenko, the former president and current leader of the political opposition. MOSCOW — The Ukrainian police on Friday questioned Ukraine’s former president, Petro O. Poroshenko, after threatening to arrest him if he failed to appear, in what a growing chorus of critics including the European Union say is a politically motivated vendetta. They say the failure of the United States to discourage the new Ukrainian government’s legal assault on Mr. Poroshenko illustrates how the once-dominant American role and moral authority in Ukraine’s internal politics have been undermined by President Trump’s efforts to persuade the country’s new leaders to investigate Mr. Trump’s political opponents. Political prosecutions have haunted Ukraine since independence. A former president, Viktor F. Yanukovych, in 2011 imprisoned the opponent he narrowly beat in a presidential race, Yulia V. Tymoshenko, and other opponents. Mr. Poroshenko is not just a former president but also a prominent political opponent of President Volodymyr Zelensky, who won election last spring on an anti-corruption platform that included a pledge to end politically motivated investigations. Since Mr. Zelensky became president, the police have questioned Mr. Poroshenko as a witness in 16 distinct criminal cases. Over the months, the investigations have piled up, even after a critical September meeting between American and Ukrainian officials, and in December, Mr. Poroshenko became the subject of a treason investigation. The September meeting surfaced during the fall impeachment proceedings in testimony from George P. Kent, the deputy assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs, who did not attend the meeting but based his account on conversations with a U.S. diplomat who did. The meeting took place well after the Ukrainians had become aware that President Trump was withholding military aid while asking them to announce the investigations into former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and allegations that Ukraine tried to help Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign. During the course of the meeting, an awkward moment arose. Kurt D. Volker, at the time special envoy for Ukraine settlement talks, told the Ukrainians that investigating Mr. Poroshenko was “not a wise way forward for the country,” Mr. Kent said. It was bread-and-butter advice from an American diplomat in the former Soviet Union, where political prosecutions are common. This time, however, Mr. Kent said it elicited a startling response from the top Ukrainian official present, Andriy Yermak, now Mr. Zelensky’s chief of staff. “Oh, you mean the type of investigations you’re asking us to open against Clinton and Biden,” Mr. Yermak responded, according to Mr. Kent. Mr. Volker did not respond to the question, Mr. Kent said. Since then, as investigations of Mr. Poroshenko have become more overtly political, and the European Union has publicly objected, the Trump administration has remained mute. The treason case relates to Mr. Poroshenko’s negotiation of a French- and German-brokered settlement agreement with Russia in 2015 called the Minsk II accord, which forced painful concessions on Ukraine. It is unclear, however, how any Ukrainian leader could have achieved a more favorable deal while Russian and separatist forces had surrounded thousands of Ukrainian soldiers in eastern Ukraine and a massacre seemed imminent. Nonetheless, the Ukrainian police are investigating whether Mr. Poroshenko committed crimes by agreeing to a series of steps in the settlement deal that allowed local elections before restoration of Ukrainian control of separatist territory. Mr. Poroshenko rejects the accusations categorically. “All the cases against me are purely political,” he said in written replies to questions. The arrest warrant, issued to force his appearance for questioning Friday and again next month, stepped up the pressure. Mr. Poroshenko said he agreed to appear voluntarily. In all the cases, Mr. Poroshenko has been questioned as a witness rather than having been formally identified as a suspect. “Doesn’t the government understand that such actions do not hurt me — because I am supported by people — but discredit the country as a whole and the legal system in particular?” Mr. Poroshenko said. In a statement, Mr. Zelensky’s office denied any role in the investigations now underway related to Mr. Poroshenko. “The Office of the President does not have any influence on the law enforcement or judiciary system,” the statement said. “This is important to build a new transparent system of the rule of law in Ukraine.” But even critics of Mr. Poroshenko’s tenure as president have spoken out against the onslaught of investigations. “We can clearly see bias,” Maryna Lilichenko, a lawyer and human rights activist, said. “I don’t support either side in this affair, but everything indicates that this is political.” Maria Varenikova contributed reporting from Kyiv, Ukraine.",The New York Times
2020,Ukrainian Political Shake-up Involves Figures in U.S. Impeachment,"A personnel shuffle by President Volodymyr Zelensky could be felt in United States politics, but appears to stem from a domestic dispute between the government and a controversial oligarch. MOSCOW — Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, fired his chief of staff on Tuesday in a personnel shake-up affecting central figures on the Ukrainian side of the events leading to the impeachment trial of President Trump. The shuffle in Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, offered fresh evidence of how deeply entangled Ukrainian and American politics have become. The new chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, negotiated last summer with President Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, as Mr. Giuliani and American diplomats pressured Ukraine to start investigations that would benefit Mr. Trump politically. Mr. Yermak, who at the time was a senior presidential adviser on foreign policy, has sought to maintain good ties with the Trump administration. The man he replaced, Andriy Bohdan, a former lawyer for the oligarch Ihor Kolomoisky, reportedly became chief of staff last year over Mr. Giuliani’s objections. Mr. Giuliani was at odds with Mr. Kolomoisky at the time, but later pivoted to working with Kolomoisky associates in his search for evidence against Mr. Trump’s political enemies. Yet the shake-up appears to have more to do with Ukraine’s internal workings — specifically, a growing clash between Mr. Zelensky’s administration and Mr. Kolomoisky, a billionaire with oil, television and real estate holdings who was implicated in a major banking scandal. Mr. Yermak’s name popped up often in the House impeachment investigation. In talks and text message exchanges with him, Mr. Giuliani and United States diplomats sought an announcement of Ukrainian investigations, including one into former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his family, while withholding a White House visit and military assistance. Mr. Yermak later sought to smooth relations during the impeachment hearings. After Mr. Trump’s ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, testified that he had told Mr. Yermak that military aid was “likely” linked to the announcement of investigations — a key accusation in the Democrats’ case — Mr. Yermak told a journalist he didn’t remember this part of the conversation. The comment bolstered Mr. Trump’s defense. “Yermak tries to present himself as a person who can negotiate with the Americans,” Volodymyr Yermolenko, the editor of Ukraine World magazine, said in a telephone interview. The stance could help Mr. Yermak in his new role, he said, though Mr. Zelensky promoted him mostly for domestic reasons. Before running for office last year, Mr. Zelensky was a comedian starring in a television show on a station owned by Mr. Kolomoisky, and their relationship is seen as pivotal in Ukrainian politics. The president, who ran on an anti-corruption platform, has had to fend off allegations that he was a tool of the oligarch. Mr. Kolomoisky has annoyed officials in Mr. Zelensky’s government by opposing a land reform measure and an agreement with the International Monetary Fund. The I.M.F. deal promises to deliver billions of dollars in aid to Ukraine, though it harms Mr. Kolomoisky’s business interests. His allies pushed back on social media, mocking supporters of the I.M.F. deal and broad economic overhauls as “Sorosaty,” a word derived from the billionaire philanthropist George Soros’ last name. In Ukrainian, it rhymes with piglet. “Kolomoisky is a toxic figure in the West,” Mr. Yermolenko said, and Mr. Zelensky seems to be inching toward easing his allies out of government. One sign of this conflict came into view this month, when agents of the domestic intelligence agency searched the office of a close ally of Mr. Kolomoisky, Oleksandr Dubinsky, in relation to a scandal involving electronic eavesdropping. Separately, Mr. Yermak and Mr. Bohdan, the Kolomoisky associate, were reportedly at odds over appointments to the Kyiv city administration. And some in the Zelensky team had grown dissatisfied with Mr. Bohdan’s handling of reform legislation in Parliament, which has become bogged down, the magazine Novoye Vremya reported. Though the reasons for sidelining Mr. Kolomoisky may be domestic, they could also resonate in American politics. Mr. Kolomoisky has been an on-again, off-again ally of Mr. Giuliani in his efforts in Ukraine. Last spring, they were at odds, and through an associate, Lev Parnas, Mr. Giuliani asked Mr. Zelensky to refrain from hiring Mr. Bohdan as chief of staff, according to Mr. Parnas’s lawyer. Mr. Parnas later became a key figure in the impeachment inquiry. By December, Mr. Giuliani had swiveled to cooperating with the oligarch’s allies in a continuing effort to gather information against Mr. Biden, who is running against Mr. Trump, and other Democrats. Among those whom Mr. Giuliani met on a trip to Kyiv, for example, was Mr. Dubinsky, the Kolomoisky associate whose offices were later searched by the domestic intelligence agency. It was not clear whether that search and the firing of Mr. Bohdan indicated that those who had been aiding Mr. Giuliani were being pushed aside. On Monday, Attorney General William P. Barr said that the Justice Department would consider, but carefully vet, the information Mr. Giuliani was turning up in Ukraine and had established a channel for the president’s lawyer to provide it to a United States attorney outside of Washington.

2020,"Opinion | Um, What Just Happened in Iowa?","The conversation Buttigieg and Sanders were triumphant. But Trump had a few things he wanted to say for himself. Ms. Collins and Mr. Stephens are opinion columnists. They converse every other week. Bret Stephens: Just when I thought the Iowa caucus, and maybe the Democratic nomination, was in the bag for Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg pulled out what looks to be either a largely unpredicted first-place finish in the Hawkeye State or at least a close second-place. My faith in pollsters is kaput. But my faith in democracy — and Democrats — just got a boost. Your thoughts, Gail? Gail Collins: Bret, this is turning into a truly fascinating contest. Bernie Sanders, who is 78, is appealing to the youth vote. Pete Buttigieg, 38, has a very strong following among older Democrats. Joe Biden, who was the surefire winner, had an astonishingly poor showing. And Michael Bloomberg is looking like a genius for passing up all the big make-or-break first primaries. But before we move on with the candidates, tell me what your feelings were about Iowa. Was the first-state-to-vote a disaster or were we just cranky from being kept up late? Bret: My feeling was, welcome to the Twilight Zone. This has already spawned some kooky conspiracy theories, but it’s also going to raise serious doubts about the integrity of elections. Gail: I do like your Twilight Zone nostalgia. Who can ever forget the episode where space aliens descended on a small Midwestern state and ate all the ballots? Bret: Of course: Rod Serling’s famous Hanging Chads episode. Go on …. Gail: But I have to admit, having gotten past that looong period of who-won impatience, I’m feeling more sympathetic to the Iowa Democratic Party. Their priority was not making a mistake. And after all the boredom and the waiting, I’m very confident in their ability to deliver an accurate count. Not that I don’t think other states should get a turn to go first. Bret: Beyond that, though, there’s a larger civilizational question: Why are things that used to be relatively easy now so darn hard? Counting ballots used to be a fairly straightforward affair. In Iowa, someone had the remarkable idea that an app could make things easier, and instead it did precisely the opposite. We’ll have to add this to the list of things we used to be able to do as a country but no longer can: fly to the moon; build highway intersections in under a decade; and teach long division in a comprehensible fashion. Gail: As a technological illiterate, I have long worked under the code of Beware the App. I identify with the people who were running the caucuses on the ground level, just hanging on to the paper ballots. Bret: Both of us know that you are much more technologically literate than I am. But back to Iowa. Does this mean Biden’s toast? Gail: Well, he certainly looks crispy. I don’t know that he’s done — he’ll be hanging on at least to South Carolina. But so far there is absolutely nothing about the campaign that suggests he’s going to go all the way. I’m wondering if the big winner is the man who decided to duck all the cute “We’re first!” primaries and wait for Super Tuesday. That would be Michael Bloomberg. Any thoughts? Bret: The consistent theme of this nomination process has been inconsistency: Every candidate who was given up politically for dead, including Sanders and Buttigieg, has roared back to life. And everyone who was supposed to be a heavyweight contender, including Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris, has underperformed. So I’d give both Biden and Warren at least one more chance before we write them off for the year. As for Bloomberg, I wish him well but I have my doubts. The strategy of waiting out the early states didn’t work for Rudy Giuliani when he ran for the Republican nomination in 2008, skipping Iowa and New Hampshire and hoping to win big in Florida. Gail: True, but trust me — he was the worst presidential candidate in the history of elections. Bret: Bloomberg’s strategy is to wait until Super Tuesday, but by then it may be too late to make much of an impression, no matter how much money he spends. Politics, like skiing, has a lot to do with momentum, and the results in Iowa and New Hampshire will carry their respective winners a long way. Gail: Yeah, but I’m hoping the Iowa-New-Hampshire dictatorship is fading. Next time in Nebraska? Meanwhile, this Iowa meltdown really was kind of embarrassing … Bret: Which is to say, a boon to Donald Trump, who is already gloating. “The Democrat Caucus is an unmitigated disaster,” he tweeted. “Nothing works, just like they ran the Country.” If we were to have something like this on Election Day in November, he’d be liable to claim victory before the results came in, or declare a stolen election in the event the Democratic nominee eventually won. Gail: I have a sinking feeling that whatever happens in November, Trump will be declaring victory. My list of election nightmares range from Russians hacking the system to a massive computer crash in some swing state, to Donald Trump simply claiming “Vote fraud!” and refusing to leave the White House if he loses. Bret: Or, alternatively, the Democratic Party nominating a candidate who can’t beat him fair-and-square. He previewed his campaign themes in his State of the Union — the first time in history a president delivered a speech to Congress while awaiting the verdict of an impeachment trial in which he will almost certainly be acquitted. My sense is that Trump has emerged from the impeachment drama no worse off, and possibly politically stronger, than he was at the beginning. Do you agree? Gail: Bret, it’s sort of cruel of you to pile that on top of the Dems-can’t-run-an-election theme. But yeah, you’re probably right. Trump’s surviving. In the long run, history will judge him as a terrible, crooked president who misused his constitutional powers to try to guarantee himself re-election. And confirm that the House Democrats were right in taking a stand against him. In the short term, it looks as if he’s going to avoid any punishment for his astonishingly awful misdeeds. Although I nurture hope that before the election there’ll be some new evildoing uncovered that makes the sleaziness and corruption of Trump’s administration clear even to his fans. Looking at you, Rudy. Bret: Imagine, Gail, if Trump turned the Oval Office into a meth lab. First, the president would call it fake news. Next, Mick Mulvaney would admit it is a meth lab, but that was O.K. because he hadn’t yet cooked up any meth, that his real intention was to teach chemistry to indigent 9th graders, and that Democrats are “anti-science.” Finally, his lawyers would insist that it’s unimpeachable because, if the president does it, it’s legal. Gail: Bret, you made me smile. Was not planning on smiling for at least two days. Bret: But back to the State of the Union, Gail. Trump emphasized the very low unemployment rate and good stock-market returns. He talked about the new U.S.-Canada-Mexico free trade deal and claimed victory in the trade war with China. He made a pitch to African-American voters by pointing to criminal-justice reform and strong job figures for black America. He stressed that he ordered the killing of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and Iranian general Qassim Suleimani. All in all, it was a fairly effective performance. Who among the Democratic contenders is best positioned to rebut it? Gail: We need somebody who can speak to the large number of Americans who are still struggling to make ends meet in a country where the rich get richer while paying precious little taxes. The vast number of citizens who have nightmares about medical bills. All the people, from farmers to families on food stamps, who are teetering on the brink of disaster because of Trump’s ideology-driven, intellectually impoverished management of government programs. And then chart a clear alternative. While reminding the nation that the good parts of the economy are mainly the products of the Obama administration. My vote goes to Elizabeth Warren. Who, sigh, didn’t do that well in Iowa. But there’s always New Hampshire. The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

2020,Un día sin mujeres en México como señal de protesta,"México Hartas del aumento de los feminicidios y ataques a mujeres, grupos de activistas han llamado a un paro nacional de todo un día para exigir un mayor respeto a sus derechos. Regístrate para recibir nuestro boletín por correo con lo mejor de The New York Times. CIUDAD DE MÉXICO — Ni una sola mujer en oficinas ni en escuelas. Ninguna mujer en restaurantes y en tiendas. Ni en el transporte público, en los automóviles ni en las calles. Un país sin mujeres, por un día. Es la visión que propone una alianza de grupos feministas en México. Inspirados por la creciente violencia que sufren mujeres y niñas, cuya muestra más reciente son los dos espantosos asesinatos que horrorizaron a la nación este mes, han convocado a la población femenina del país a participar en un paro de veinticuatro horas el 9 de marzo. Esta convocatoria se hace para protestar en contra de la violencia de género, la desigualdad y la cultura del machismo, además de exigir más apoyo a los derechos de las mujeres. Promovida con la etiqueta #UNDÍASINNOSOTRAS, ha ganado una extraordinaria fuerza en este país de más de 120 millones de habitantes, con una amplia aceptación de los sectores público y privado, grupos cívicos, líderes religiosos y muchas mujeres, si no es que la mayoría. Este apoyo ha superado las barreras de clase, raza, nivel económico y afiliación política que tienen fragmentada a la nación, lo que ha llenado de esperanza a sus organizadoras de que no solo sea un evento monumental, sino un punto de inflexión en la historia moderna de México. “Muchas de nuestras consignas (como ‘La revolución será feminista’ o ‘El futuro es feminista’) hablaban de este momento”, señaló Arussi Unda, vocera de Las Brujas del Mar, un colectivo feminista del estado de Veracruz que ha ayudado a difundir información sobre el paro. “Y ese momento parece estar llegando”. Desde hace un año, el activismo feminista en México, inspirado en parte por el movimiento global #MeToo, ha ganado nuevo impulso. Las mujeres, hartas y frustradas, han salido a las calles para protestar contra la violencia de género y las arraigadas actitudes machistas. Las protestas han sido tumultuosas y en ocasiones violentas, pues las participantes han roto ventanas y pintarrajeado monumentos públicos, incluido Palacio Nacional, con eslóganes y consignas feministas. Sabina Berman, novelista y activista feminista mexicana, dijo que el núcleo de estas protestas recientes es una generación de mujeres más jóvenes que ya se cansaron del enfoque más moderado del activismo. “Son estas chavas las que dijeron ‘ya no más protestas pacíficas’, marchando en la calle con una sonrisa. Y optaron por romper ventanas y estaciones de policía”, dijo. “Son ellas las que encendieron la chispa al dar ese paso. Ellas nos despertaron”. El movimiento, que se mantuvo un tanto contenido durante meses, explotó este mes tras darse a conocer una noticia sobre los terribles asesinatos de una mujer y una niña. Ingrid Escamilla, una residente de Ciudad de México de 25 años, fue apuñalada, desollada y eviscerada. Sus restos aparecieron el 9 de febrero, y fotos de su cuerpo mutilado se filtraron a los tabloides, los cuales publicaron las imágenes en primera plana, lo que exacerbó la indignación social. El 11 de febrero, Fátima Cecilia Aldrighett, de 7 años, fue secuestrada de una escuela primaria en Ciudad de México y su cuerpo se descubrió envuelto en una bolsa de plástico junto a un sitio de construcción a las afueras de la capital. Unda aseveró que su grupo activista feminista se cimbró hasta lo más profundo por estas muertes, así que se reunieron con otros grupos para decidir cómo debían responder. “Nos volteamos a ver y dijimos: ‘¿Qué más tiene que pasar para que esto cambie?’”, recordó. En vez de ocupar espacios públicos, que es la acción acostumbrada para expresar protesta, decidieron preparar una acción que simbolizara la desaparición de las mujeres de esos espacios “para transmitir un mensaje de enojo y rechazo hacia la violencia que sufren las mujeres”, dijo. Para quienes quieran participar en el paro del 9 de marzo, las instrucciones son muy sencillas: Quédense en casa. El paro será al día siguiente del Día Internacional de la Mujer, fecha en que se espera que las manifestantes salgan a las calles por todo el país. El Consejo Coordinador Empresarial de México, una influyente coalición de grupos de negocios, emitió una declaración instando al sector privado a apoyar a las trabajadoras que participen en el paro. “Sin duda la respuesta de las autoridades en los últimos años no ha sido adecuada ni suficiente”, decía el consejo en referencia a la crisis de violencia contras las mujeres. “Pero todos fallamos como sociedad en nuestra parte de responsabilidad”. “Es tiempo de solidaridad y empatía”, continuaba el comunicado, “pero también de responsabilidad y acciones. Cada uno debemos hacer lo que nos corresponde”. Un gran gremio empresarial, Concanaco Servytur, estima que el paro de un día le costaría a la economía mexicana 1.370 millones de dólares. Muchos organismos gubernamentales a nivel local, estatal y federal también han dado su apoyo a las funcionarias y trabajadoras que participen en la huelga. Claudia Sheinbaum, la jefa de Gobierno de Ciudad de México, dijo que había dado instrucciones a todos los líderes de departamento en el gobierno de la ciudad para que no penalizaran a ninguna empleada que faltara al trabajo el día del paro. Dijo que la ciudad emplea a unas 150.000 mujeres. El presidente de México, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, ha dicho que apoya en general el derecho de los ciudadanos a manifestarse. Sin embargo, también ha percibido cierta sombra de maquinaciones políticas en la huelga, pues ha dicho que sus oponentes pretenden aprovechar el momento para atizar la oposición política hacia su gobierno. “No a la manipulación, no al oportunismo”, advirtió durante una conferencia de prensa esta semana. Con todo, las organizadoras de la huelga y muchas otras han ignorado las insinuaciones del presidente de que, para algunos, el evento es una maniobra política. “La protesta no es en contra de este gobierno ni de ningún otro”, subrayó Berman. “Es en contra del Estado mexicano en su conjunto, contra el sector privado, contra los hombres que acosan, violan y matan y en contra de los hombres buenos que se quedan cruzados de brazos, sin hacer nada”. Las organizadoras esperan que el paro no sea solo una protesta fugaz sino que inspire un diálogo nacional robusto y cause cambios significativos en la sociedad mexicana. Entre ellos, medidas concretas —como la mejora en las condiciones de guarderías para madres trabajadoras— y transformaciones más amplias en las actitudes hacia las mujeres y sus derechos. “Lo que queremos es que esto no se quede en anécdota o una foto bonita de la marcha”, dijo Unda, “sino que se convierta en acciones concretas de todos los que participen y apoyen”.",The New York Times
2020,"Un escritor pederasta va a juicio (y con él, las élites francesas)","Gabriel Matzneff escribió abiertamente sobre su pedofilia durante décadas, protegido por los poderosos del mundo editorial, el periodismo, la política y los negocios. Ahora, en una entrevista, ataca la ‘cobardía’ de quienes le han dado la espalda. El escritor francés Gabriel Matzneff en la Riviera italiana en febrero de 2020. Matzneff fue citado para comparecer en un tribunal de París el miércoles 12 de febrero, acusado de promover activamente la pederastia a través de sus libros.Credit...Andrea Mantovani para The New York Times PARÍS — Gabriel Matzneff, el escritor francés que está siendo investigado por promover la pederastia, estaba refugiado este mes dentro de una lujosa habitación de hotel en la Riviera italiana, incapaz de relajarse, dormir o escribir. Se encontraba a solas y oculto, abandonado por las mismas personas poderosas de la industria editorial, el periodismo, la política y los negocios que lo habían protegido semanas antes. Únicamente salía para dar caminatas solitarias escondido detrás de unos lentes oscuros y se sorprendió cuando lo encontré en una cafetería que menciona en sus libros. “Me siento como los muertos vivientes, como un muerto que anda, que camina por el lungomare”, dijo, refiriéndose en italiano al paseo marítimo, después de cierta labor de convencimiento. Ocultarse es algo nuevo para Matzneff. Durante décadas, fue homenajeado por escribir y hablar abiertamente acerca de acosar adolescentes afuera de las escuelas en París y tener contacto sexual con chicos de 8 años en Filipinas. Matzneff fue invitado al Palacio del Elíseo por el expresidente François Mitterrand y convivió con el dirigente de la extrema derecha Jean-Marie Le Pen. Se benefició de la generosidad del diseñador de modas Yves Saint Laurent y su socio y pareja, el magnate empresarial Pierre Bergé. No obstante, Matzneff ha sido citado a comparecer ante un tribunal de París el miércoles 12 de febrero, acusado de promover activamente la pederastia a través de sus libros. Matzneff podría enfrentar hasta cinco años de prisión; sin embargo, el caso también es una denuncia implícita de una élite que promovió su carrera y acalló las voces aisladas que pedían su arresto. [Actualización: Gabriel Matzneff ha sido acusado después de años de escribir sobre su pedofilia] El ajuste de cuentas se presentó el mes pasado con la publicación de Le Consentement (El consentimiento), de Vanessa Springora, el primer testimonio de una de las víctimas menores de edad del escritor. Aunque el libro no hacía ninguna nueva revelación sobre el pasado sexual de Matzneff, sí propició un abrupto cambio cultural en Francia. “Este es el #MeToo de la industria editorial francesa”, afirmó François Busnel, presentador de La Grande Librairie, el programa televisivo literario más importante de Francia. “Se ha liberado una voz en un ámbito, el ámbito literario francés, que es machista, bastante misógino y que permanece callado: omertà, la ley del silencio”. Aunque la caída de Matzneff llegó tarde, fue veloz. Sus tres editores lo abandonaron. La dirección del Centro Nacional del Libro afirmó que Matzneff perdería un estipendio vitalicio que se otorga en pocas ocasiones. Los fiscales iniciaron una investigación. Se cree que en el caso de Springora ya han prescrito los delitos. Pero además de la acusación de promover la pedofilia, Matzneff podría enfrentar cargos penales por actos sexuales con menores de edad más recientes, ya sea en Francia o en otros países. Desde su escondite en la Riviera italiana Matzneff descartó las acusaciones en su contra. “¿Quiénes son ellos para juzgar?”, dijo. “Estas asociaciones de virtuosos, ¿cómo duermen? ¿Qué hacen en la cama y con quién se acuestan? ¿Y sus deseos secretos y reprimidos?”. Muchos han dicho que la historia de Matzneff es una que “solo en Francia” podría suceder. De Voltaire a Victor Hugo a Zola a Sartre, el escritor ha sido una figura sagrada en Francia. En París, innumerables calles dedicadas a autores son recordatorios físicos de su descomunal influencia. Cada miércoles, una gran cadena dedica 90 minutos de tiempo estelar en vivo a discutir libros en el programa La Grande Librairie. Aunque no es uno de los más grandes escritores franceses, Matzneff se benefició ampliamente de esta tradición. Escribió casi 50 novelas, colecciones de ensayos y diarios que jamás habrían llegado a las librerías si la industria hubiera estado más preocupada por hacer negocio. Los editores franceses aceptaron diligentemente hasta diarios cuyo contenido a veces se empalmaban unos con otros y que eran poco más que registros cotidianos. Pero dichas obras también incluyen meticulosos detalles sobre los individuos que ayudaron a Matzneff y las adolescentes a las que sedujo, entre ellas Springora. El mes pasado, repentinamente envalentonados, los fiscales allanaron la sede de Gallimard, una prestigiosa editorial, para confiscar copias de los libros. En el caso programado para comenzar el 12 de febrero, los editores y promotores del Matzneff también podrían rendir cuentas, con los libros como evidencia. “Sabemos de hombres emocionalmente conflictuados que justificaban la pedofilia tras leer los libros de Matzneff”, dijo Méhana Mouhou, abogado de l’Ange Bleu, la organización antipedofilia que ha presentado el caso. Matzneff desapareció a finales de diciembre, justo antes de la publicación del libro autobiográfico de Springora. Mientras el escándalo explotaba en París, yo leí con detenimiento sus libros y diarios. Cuando una breve entrevista que le concedió a una cadena televisiva francesa me dio una pista sobre su paradero, me dirigí a la Riviera italiana y encontré a Matzneff (un hombre de costumbres, como dejaba claro en sus diarios) en su cafetería favorita. Sobresaltado al principio, a la defensiva y molesto, el escritor reconoció que estaba “sumamente solo” y comenzó a abrirse. Expresó su perplejidad ante el repentino cambio cultural en Francia y su caída abrupta. También confirmó los pasajes de sus libros que describen el apoyo que recibió de personajes poderosos y ofreció nuevos detalles. Estaba resentido y molesto porque quienes lo habían apoyado antes han guardado silencio, se han distanciado o se han vuelto en su contra. Matzneff, quien pidió que no se divulgara su ubicación exacta, accedió a hablar por tres horas y media. Expresó desconcierto ante el repentino cambio cultural en Francia y su caída precipitada. No mostró remordimiento por sus acciones pasadas y no repudió ninguno de sus escritos. También confirmó los pasajes en sus libros que describen el apoyo que recibió de personas poderosas, y proporcionó nuevos detalles. Estaba enojado y amargado porque sus antiguos seguidores callaron, se distanciaron o se volvieron en contra suya. “Están demostrando su cobardía”, dijo. “Podemos decir precaución, pero es más que precaución viniendo de gente que yo consideraba mis amigos”. Las amistades de Matzneff hicieron algo más que celebrar su obra. También ayudaron, a veces intencionalmente, otras sin darse cuenta, a protegerlo de las autoridades. En 1986, unos oficiales de la policía francesa citaron a Matzneff, quien en esa época tenía 50 años, para interrogarlo después de recibir cartas anónimas en las que se afirmaba que Springora, quien entonces tenía 14, lo visitaba en su apartamento; sin embargo, cuando llegó a la estación de policía, Matzneff llevaba un talismán en su bolsillo: un artículo escrito por Mitterrand en el que lo enaltecía. Matzneff había llamado la atención de Mitterrand dos décadas antes, luego de la publicación de su primer libro, una colección de ensayos titulada Le Défi (El desafío). “Le gustó tanto que se lo regaló a sus hijos, que tenían 15, 16 años” recordó Matzneff, “y me invitó a almorzar”. Mitterrand socializó con el prometedor autor y siguió siendo su admirador, incluso después de que Matzneff publicó en 1974 una vociferante defensa de la pedofilia titulada Les Moins de Seize Ans (Menores de 16 años). Después de convertirse en presidente en 1981, Mitterrand invitó a Matzneff a almorzar al palacio presidencial al menos una vez, en 1984, según el Instituto François Mitterrand. El presidente también escribió un artículo elogioso para una pequeña revista literaria, Matulu, que dedicó un número especial en julio de 1986 a Matzneff. En él, Mitterrand describía a Matzneff como un “seductor impenitente” y escribió que el autor “siempre me ha sorprendido con su gusto extremo por el rigor, por la profundidad de su pensamiento”. El artículo fue publicado solo unas semanas antes de que la policía de París comenzara a investigar a Matzneff. “Posiblemente haya, tal vez, recortado el artículo y lo tenía en mi billetera” dijo Matzneff. Springora recuerda en su libro: “En caso de arresto, cree que el artículo tiene el poder de salvarlo”. De acuerdo con lo que declaró, al ver el documento, los detectives desestimaron las pistas anónimas que habían recibido y las consideraron obra de un rival literario. “Uno de los detectives me había dicho ‘Son formas de envidia, estas cartas anónimas, sin duda es envidia’”, dijo. Además del artículo de Mitterrand, Matzneff recibió ayuda más directa. Primero, su amigo y autor galardonado Christian Giudicelli, aceptó esconder cartas y fotografías de Springora que lo incriminaban, escribió Matzneff. Luego, cuando necesitaron un lugar más seguro, Matzneff y la adolescente se mudaron a un hotel. Las facturas las pagaba el diseñador de moda Yves Saint Laurent, quien murió en 2008, y los arreglos los hacía su ayudante cercano, Christophe Girard, según Matzneff. Matzneff recuerda que Girard le dijo que “‘nos encargaremos de todo, comidas, todo’”. Agregó: “Y creo que eso duró como dos años”. “‘Para nosotros es una gota en el océano, no es nada y te queremos’”, dijo Girard, según Matzneff. Girard no quiso dar entrevistas. Era —y sigue siendo— ilegal en Francia que un adulto tenga relaciones sexuales con un menor de 15 años. Pero a diferencia de Estados Unidos y otros países con leyes de estupro, donde los menores de edad se consideran demasiado inmaduros para consentir plenamente las relaciones sexuales, Francia no tiene edad de consentimiento. Tan recientemente como 2018, abandonó los intentos para establecerla. En Francia, Matzneff tuvo cuidado de moverse sobre todo en lo que algunos consideraban una “zona gris”, al dedicar diarios y novelas a sus relaciones con chicas adolescentes. Es en Filipinas donde escribe sobre claros actos de pedofilia, sobre todo con chicos prepubescentes. “A veces tengo hasta cuatro chicos —de 8 a 14 años— en mi cama al mismo tiempo y les hago el amor de la manera más exquisita”, escribió en Un Galop d’Enfer, su diario publicado en 1985. Algunas personas se indignaron. “Debería estar en la cárcel”, recordó recientemente una solitaria voz crítica, Denis Tillinac, editor de La Table Ronde, quien se negó a publicar los diarios de Matzneff. “Pero no, no está en la cárcel, es recibido y mimado por el presidente de la república, Mitterrand”. La crítica más pública sucedió en 1990, en el programa literario de televisión Apostrophes. En el programa, el presentador y los tertulianos discutieron el diario de más reciente publicación de Matzneff en esa época, Mes Amours Décomposés (Mis amores en descomposición). En él, el autor se jactaba de haber tenido sexo con innumerables menores, entre ellos niños filipinos de 11 y 12 años a los que describe como “una rara especia”. La única participante extranjera, la periodista Denise Bombardier de Quebec, denunció su pedofilia. La intelectualidad francesa lo defendió con rapidez. Josyane Savigneau, quien editó el suplemento literario del diario Le Monde de 1991 a 2005, reprendió públicamente a Bombardier y defendió la obra de Matzneff. En una entrevista reciente, Savigneau recordó haber sentido repugnancia por algunos de los escritos de Matzneff, pero dijo que sus libros eran superiores a otros que aterrizaron en su escritorio. “Lo veía como un hombre al que le gustaban las mujeres jóvenes”, dijo. “En Francia nunca se le vio con niños”. Philippe Sollers, un famoso novelista y editor principal en Gallimard, más tarde se refirió a Bombardier con una grosera alusión sexual. Sollers no respondió a un pedido de entrevista. El único apoyo público para Bombardier vino de un sitio inesperado: el presidente Mitterrand. Bombardier recuerda que fue invitada al palacio presidencial, donde Mitterrand le dijo que a pesar de que alguna vez había “reconocido virtudes” en Matzneff, el autor desafortunadamente se había “hundido” en la “pedofilia”. A pesar de que continuó produciendo libros prolíficamente durante la década de 1990, Matzneff estaba muy lejos de ser rico y recurría a sus amigos poderosos. Para 2002, Christophe Girard, asistente cercano de Yves Saint Laurent, se había convertido en delegado de cultura del alcalde de París. Girard ejerció mucha presión para que Matzneff ganara un estipendio anual vitalicio que el Centro Nacional del Libro otorga en contadas ocasiones, le dijo el director actual del centro, Vincent Monadé, al diario L’Opinion. Para 2005, el editor original del elogio a la pedofilia de 1974 se negó a volver a publicarlo. Matzneff dijo que otro aliado de toda la vida, un poderoso abogado y autor llamado Emmanuel Pierrat, le presentó a otro editor que le dio una segunda vida. “No rechazo una sola línea, ni una palabra”, escribió Matzneff en un prefacio a la edición de 2005. Pierrat, quien ahora representa a Matzneff, también es el presidente del PEN Club en Francia y secretario general del Museo Yves Saint Laurent. No respondió a múltiples llamados y correos electrónicos donde se le pedía una entrevista. Para 2013, las posturas de Matzneff ya no estaban en boga. Sus libros apenas se vendían. El año anterior se había enterado de que tenía cáncer de próstata. Pero incluso en su desdicha fue capaz de recurrir a antiguas conexiones. Un gran premio literario, el Renaudot, se le había escapado de entre las manos a pesar de las maniobras de un jurado: Giudicelli, a quien Matzneff le había confiado las fotos y cartas comprometedoras de Springora a los 14 años cuando temía un operativo policial. Además de su amigo, Giudicelli también era uno de los editores de Matzneff en Gallimard y un acompañante frecuente a sus viajes a Manila. Gallimard no permitió que Giudicelli, ni nadie de la editorial, diera entrevistas. Tan cercanos eran ambos que se llamaban el uno al otro por el número de la habitación que habían ocupado en su primera estancia en el hotel Tropicana de Manila. “Cuando se trata de evocar aquí y allá, en un párrafo corto, recuerdos de maldades y picardías de las que muy apenas nos sentimos culpables, mi querido Ocho-cero-cuatro se cuida de ocultar a su querido Christian bajo el ala protectora de Ocho-cero-uno”, escribe Giudicelli de su amigo. Giudicelli ayudó a garantizarle a su amigo el prestigiado premio Renaudot, después de confiarles a sus colegas del jurado deliberadamente que Matzneff padecía cáncer. “Es un argumento que escuchábamos muy a menudo: ‘Lo necesita, pobre hombre’”, recordó uno de los miembros del jurado, Franz-Olivier Giesbert, escritor y editor. Dominique Bona, la única mujer entre los diez integrantes del jurado, y quien pertenece a la Academia Francesa, reconoció que las “amistades” intervinieron en la decisión de otorgarle el premio a Matzneff. Busnel, el presentador de La Grande Librairie, dijo recientemente: “Los jurados literarios en Francia son totalmente corruptos”. Pero el premio relanzó la carrera de Matzneff, algo que con el tiempo le valió una invitación a La Grande Librairie. Una inusual crítica vino del blogger literario Juan Asensio, quien publicó un mordaz artículo sobre el premio y la pedofilia de Matzneff. “Creo que los periodistas como que se acobardaron en lugar de decir que el premio era un escándalo”, recuerda. Una persona estaba especialmente furiosa: Vanessa Springora. Molesta e indignada por el regreso triunfal de Matzneff, comenzó a escribir Le Consentement. “Yo jamás había ganado un premio importante. Debió alegrarse por mí”, dijo Matzneff. “¿Pero se enfadó?”. Matzneff afirmó que se enteró en noviembre de la inminente publicación de Le Consentement gracias a sus amigos en Grasset, la editorial del libro. Pronto se marchó a Italia mientras el libro de Springora aparecía como un relámpago en una Francia que recién despertaba. Solo en su escondite en la Riviera italiana, Matzneff aseguró que no sabía cuándo regresará a París. Además de sus caminatas en el paseo marítimo, cena solo en el restaurante del hotel. Arriba, en su habitación, relee viejos diarios inéditos. Dice que no leerá el libro de Springora. Padece de insomnio. No escribe. “Soy muy desdichado”, dijo. En París, ahora era el turno de Springora de aparecer en horario estelar, en vivo, mientras subía al estudio de La Grande Librairie. Lo que comenzó con un libro solo podía terminar con un libro. Solo en Francia. “En realidad mi objetivo era encerrarlo en un libro, hacerlo caer en su propia trampa”, afirmó Springora en el programa, “porque eso es lo que hizo conmigo y con muchas otras jóvenes”.

2020,Un inmigrante brasileño ha cambiado muchas vidas como entrenador. ¿Podrá quedarse en Estados Unidos?,"Estados Unidos Hicu Motta convirtió a un grupo de chicas de clase trabajadora en deportistas de primer nivel. Pero las autoridades de inmigración rechazaron su solicitud de residencia permanente. [Suscríbete a nuestro boletín y recibe por correo y en español lo mejor de The New York Times] LOS ÁNGELES — Durante los últimos tres años, el entrenador de remo Henrique “Hicu” Motta ha logrado crear historias de éxito en un deporte que desde hace mucho tiempo se asocia con la gente privilegiada. Ha llevado a su equipo de niñas de bachillerato procedentes de familias de la clase trabajadora a los campeonatos nacionales y ha conseguido que varias de ellas entren en universidades de la División I con becas deportivas. “Soy latina, pequeña y nunca había estado en un equipo deportivo”, dijo Isabella Soto, de 17 años, hija de una niñera y un maquinista. Tiene esperanzas de remar en una universidad de élite a finales de este año. Isabella, quien fue aceptada en el equipo RowLA a pesar de que solo mide 1,52 metros, es una estadounidense de primera generación cuyos padres son mexicanos indocumentados. Kassie Kim es hija de inmigrantes coreanos, una cajera y un instalador de alarmas contra incendios. Samadhi Dissanayake, una estadounidense-esrilanquesa criada por una madre soltera en una vivienda subsidiada, toma dos autobuses para llegar al entrenamiento. “Odiaba los deportes antes de venir aquí”, dijo Samadhi, quien también está considerando remar en la universidad. “Ahora me encanta remar y el sentido de comunidad”. Pero Motta, de 39 años, un brasileño que se encuentra en el país con una visa de trabajo, ha sido notificado de que su petición para permanecer en Estados Unidos ha sido rechazada. Las autoridades de inmigración de Estados Unidos le exigen que, para poder quedarse, debe demostrar que tiene una “habilidad extraordinaria” para hacer un trabajo que, de otro modo, sería realizado por un estadounidense. En un deporte dominado por atletas que son blancos y ricos, RowLA, bajo el liderazgo de Motta, ha logrado enlistar a jóvenes que normalmente no tendrían acceso al remo. Ni la constitución física ni la perspicacia atlética determinan quién puede competir y triunfar. “Él puede tomar a una joven, independientemente de su tamaño y habilidad, y convertirla en una remera seria. Eso es raro entre los entrenadores”, dijo Liz Greenberger, analista de seguridad internacional retirada que hace una década fundó el equipo y trajo a Motta como su segundo entrenador en 2017. “La filosofía de Hicu es perfecta para nuestro programa”, afirmó. La filosofía de Motta es simple: “Trato de hacer especial a cualquier chica que quiera darle una oportunidad al remo”, explicó. La pregunta es la siguiente: ¿eso equivale a tener una habilidad extraordinaria? En los tres años transcurridos desde que recibió una visa de trabajo, Motta ha construido un programa de remeras dedicadas que han competido en Rowing Youth Nationals de Estados Unidos, el nivel más alto para remeros de bachillerato, y han ganado becas universitarias. Pero Motta no solo es un entrenador. Nutriólogo de formación, instruye a sus atletas para que mantengan una dieta equilibrada (nada de alimentos procesados antes de las carreras. Solo fruta para tener energía y agua de coco para hidratarse). Motta anima a sus remeras a invertir tiempo en sus estudios y pensar en futuros que puedan estar llenos de posibilidades. “No solo nos enfocamos en cómo se desempeñan al remar; estamos haciendo atletas estudiantes”, dijo Motta en el estacionamiento 77 en Marina del Rey, en el oeste de Los Ángeles, donde el equipo se reúne seis días a la semana para entrenar aunque llueva, truene o relampaguee. RowLA es un pequeño programa de remo apoyado por donaciones privadas, y no se puede comparar con muchos de los equipos de élite con amplios fondos que hay a lo largo del país, algunos de los cuales han existido desde hace un siglo. El programa carece de un cobertizo para botes. Los 17 remos dobles, las máquinas de remo y otros equipos de RowLA se dejan en el estacionamiento, protegidos por lonas. “Lo que Hicu hace es extraordinario”, dijo Iva Obradovic, una veterana entrenadora de remo y exremera de competencias. “Está compitiendo contra equipos ricos y privados. Casi ningún entrenador lo haría. No recibirá elogios ni gloria por eso”. La composición de atletas de RowLA demuestra la filosofía de entrenamiento de Motta, dijo Obradovic. “Estas chicas no son las remeras típicas, pero asisten, tienen disciplina y trabajan”. Cuando RowLA patrocinó la visa temporal de trabajo de Motta en 2017, su solicitud, de 250 páginas, documentaba dos décadas de éxito como remero y entrenador. Incluía cartas de altos funcionarios del deporte en Brasil, recomendaciones de entrenadores y atletas de distintos países y una lista detallada de sus logros: más de 20 campeonatos brasileños en distintas categorías. La visa se aprobó en una semana. “Todos habían dicho que era muy complicado. Estaba feliz”, recordó Motta. La visa permitió que su esposa, Emanuelle “Manu” Abreu, una remera de competencia de Brasil, se le uniera en Estados Unidos, donde ha estado entrenando y desempeñándose como voluntaria en RowLA. Una vez al mando, Motta comenzó a hacer que RowLA creciera. Estableció un programa de desarrollo para niñas de bachillerato y amplió el alcance del programa de remo bajo techo de la organización: de dos escuelas en el área de Los Ángeles ahora hay ocho que atienden a más de 4000 estudiantes cada año. A principios de 2019, RowLA decidió patrocinar a Motta para que lograra tener su residencia legal permanente en Estados Unidos. En la solicitud de 300 páginas, Greenberger describió a Motta como un “activo invaluable” para RowLA. Rob Glidden, presidente de la Asociación de Remo de Long Beach, reconoció los métodos de entrenamiento, el asesoramiento nutricional y las cualidades personales de Motta por haber creado un programa “excepcional” para desarrollar remeras. “La confianza que inspira en estas jóvenes es palpable”, escribió Glidden, afirmando que eso había permitido que muchas de ellas alcanzaran un éxito académico y deportivo “que no habrían logrado de otra manera”. No obstante, el gobierno respondió pidiendo más pruebas para demostrar que Motta era “extraordinario”. Su abogado, Richard Wilner, presentó 150 páginas adicionales de documentos, solo para recibir una negativa en agosto. En una carta de cinco páginas, el Servicio de Ciudadanía e Inmigración de Estados Unidos —la agencia responsable de aprobar los permisos de residencia— describió las razones por las que Motta no cumplió con los criterios para ser considerado alguien con “habilidad extraordinaria”. La decisión de la agencia hizo referencia a un manual de capacitación desarrollado por Motta para RowLA que, si bien reconoció que era “una contribución original”, no había ofrecido “evidencia objetiva de que esta innovación es ampliamente utilizada por otros en ese campo, más allá de su empleador o clientes”. Motta tampoco había demostrado que se desempeñara “en un papel clave o esencial para organizaciones o establecimientos que tienen una reputación distinguida”, se decía en la carta de rechazo. Lo que más lo afectó era que los funcionarios sostenían que la evidencia no mostraba que Motta había recibido un “galardón o premio importante, reconocido internacionalmente” para su equipo. Como atleta y entrenador competitivo, Motta afirma que obviamente quiere ganar. Pero tal vez, dijo, las victorias no deberían contarse solo con medallas. “En otros clubs todo es el desempeño. Aquí el objetivo es que las chicas vayan por el camino correcto, a la universidad”, dijo. “Remar es una herramienta”. Wilner dijo que el gobierno está midiéndolo con el parámetro equivocado: “Tal vez debemos evaluar su extraordinaria habilidad como entrenador con una medida de éxito que no contemplan las regulaciones”, dijo. “Es que está ayudando a estas chicas a ganar en la vida, en ser las primeras de su familia en ir a la universidad, no solo a ganar medallas”. Un portavoz del Servicio de Ciudadanía e Inmigración dijo que la agencia no podía comentar sobre casos individuales. “Hay un umbral de elegibilidad extremadamente alto que debe cumplirse para recibir esta visa”, dijo. De aproximadamente 1,1 millones de tarjetas de residencia permanente emitidas en el año fiscal 2018, alrededor de 39.500 personas las obtuvieron bajo la categoría de habilidad extraordinaria, según el gobierno, una cifra que además incluye cónyuges e hijos del solicitante. Wilner ha apelado el rechazo del permiso y los gastos legales están aumentando, que hasta ahora acumulan más de 15.000 dólares. RowLA también solicitó una extensión de su visa original de trabajador invitado, que expiró oficialmente el viernes, por otros tres años. En vez de otorgar una renovación, las autoridades de inmigración solicitaron a principios de este mes que Motta presentara más evidencia de su “habilidad extraordinaria”. Tiene permiso de permanecer en el país y continuar entrenando hasta que se tome una decisión final sobre cualquiera de las solicitudes. Así que eso es lo que está haciendo. Un domingo reciente, entre el estruendo de los graznidos de gaviotas, Motta estaba de pie en un bote de motor en la marina y dirigía al equipo. “¡Remos paralelos! Atentas al cataviento”, dijo a través de un radio. En perfecta sincronía, las chicas sumergieron las palas en el agua e impulsaron los botes hacia adelante.

2020,"Un trabajador latino, una construcción riesgosa y una familia de luto","A pesar de las regulaciones, los trabajadores de la construcción en Nueva York —muchos de ellos indocumentados— siguen muriendo. NUEVA YORK — La esposa de Segundo Huerta dice que una semana antes del accidente, su marido se había quejado de que el jefe del sitio de construcción donde estaba trabajando, en el Bronx, presionaba a los obreros y los regañaba por trabajar muy lento. María Guazhco, la esposa de Huerta, comentó que su esposo le había contado que, después de 17 años con la compañía, iba a tratar de encontrar otro trabajo. Sin embargo, regresó a la construcción la semana siguiente. “Y después, todo colapsó”, dijo Guazhco, de 39 años. Huerta, de 46 años, murió el 27 de agosto de 2019 después de que se derrumbó el tercer piso del edificio donde estaba trabajando. Su cuerpo quedó sepultado y atrapado debajo de cientos de kilos de escombros. Fue una de las doce personas —diez de ellas pertenecientes a la comunidad latina— que el año pasado murieron en accidentes relacionados con la construcción, según datos preliminares del Comité de Seguridad y Salud Ocupacional de Nueva York, un grupo de defensa de la seguridad de los trabajadores, y el Departamento de Edificios. El número de muertes relacionadas con la construcción ha sido constante durante los últimos cuatro años. La muerte de Huerta refleja los peligros que persisten en los sitios de construcción de Nueva York a pesar del montón de reglas y normas que la ciudad ha impuesto para proteger a los trabajadores, muchos de los cuales, como Huerta, son latinos y residen en el país de manera ilegal. Las familias que dejan atrás tienen pocos recursos para llenar el vacío financiero provocado por ese tipo de tragedias. De 2006 a 2016, casi la mitad de los empleados en lugares de trabajo de la ciudad que no están sindicalizados eran hispanos o latinos, en comparación con casi un 30 por ciento en sitios pertenecientes a un sindicato, de acuerdo con Lawrence Mishel, economista del Economic Policy Institute, un centro de pensamiento liberal. El porcentaje de trabajadores en sitios no pertenecientes a un sindicato que son hispanos o latinos probablemente supera el 50 por ciento en este momento, señaló Mishel. Es menos probable que los trabajadores inmigrantes no autorizados tengan las mismas salvaguardas que otros trabajadores. “Con frecuencia, los trabajadores indocumentados temen alzar la voz debido a su condición”, dijo Rubén Colón, representante del sindicato del Consejo Distrital de Carpinteros de la Ciudad de Nueva York. “Los empleadores y los contratistas sin escrúpulos se aprovechan de esa situación y traspasan los límites de lo permitido”. Poco después de la muerte de Huerta, la ciudad emitió una orden de suspensión de actividades a Pioneer General Construction Co., el contratista de la edificación en el Bronx. También le ordenaron a la compañía frenar todas las operaciones en un sitio en construcción en Brooklyn, según muestran los registros de la ciudad. Después, el Departamento de Edificios emitió una infracción contra Pioneer General por no notificar a la ciudad sobre el accidente que provocó la muerte de Huerta, y le impusieron a la empresa una multa de 25.000 dólares. Varias agencias aún están realizando una investigación del accidente. Pioneer General no respondió a varias peticiones para hacer comentarios. En la mañana del fatal accidente, Guazhco no despertó a tiempo para prepararle el café y el almuerzo a su esposo, como era su costumbre. Huerta había planeado ir a Queens después del trabajo para comprar útiles escolares para tres de sus cinco hijos. Volverían a la escuela en unos cuantos días. “Me dijo: ‘Nos vemos en la tarde’”, comentó. Ambos se conocieron en Ecuador a través de sus familiares. Su hermana se había casado con uno de los primos de Huerta, y ella lo había visto en un evento familiar. Fue amor a primera vista, dijo. Huerta cruzó la frontera desde México para llegar a Estados Unidos en 2001. Había viajado desde su ciudad de origen, Cuenca, en el sur de Ecuador, donde también había trabajado en el sector de la construcción. Se abrió camino hasta Nueva York, donde tenía familiares que trabajaban en construcciones. Guazhco, que estaba embarazada en ese momento, lo alcanzó en la ciudad. Tuvieron dos hijos en Ecuador y tres en Estados Unidos, incluyendo unos gemelos que nacieron en 2015. En un día normal, Huerta recogía a los gemelos de la guardería tras su jornada en el sitio de construcción. Guazhco trabaja en un salón de manicura en el Bronx. Casi al mediodía del 27 de agosto, ella recibió una llamada de uno de los hermanos de su esposo, quien le dijo que Huerta había sufrido un accidente grave. De inmediato fue al lugar. Huerta había pasado la mayoría de la mañana con Manuel Huerta, su sobrino, en el segundo piso del edificio, pasándole cubetas de ladrillos y bloques de concreto a otro trabajador que se encontraba sobre un andamio en el mismo piso. Durante casi cuatro horas, dijo Manuel Huerta, los hombres pasaron bloques como una “cadena humana” al resto de los trabajadores, que los apilaban sobre vigas en el tercer piso. Casi habían acabado cuando Segundo Huerta le dijo a su sobrino que fuera al tercer piso para ayudar a los demás. Poco después, dijo Manuel Huerta, el edificio se derrumbó. “Se vino abajo”, comentó. Seis de los siete hombres que estaban trabajando en el sitio en ese momento lograron salir. Pero nadie encontraba a Segundo Huerta. Guazhco comenzó su propia búsqueda cuando llegó al lugar. Subió a cada ambulancia que vio, con la esperanza de encontrar a su esposo. Un trabajador le dijo que ya no siguiera buscando, recordó. “Segundo está adentro”, recordó que le dijo el trabajador. “Él se perdió ahí”. En las semanas posteriores a la muerte de Huerta, miembros del Proyecto Justicia Laboral (WJP, por su sigla en inglés), un grupo de defensa, dijeron que habían sido contactados por un conocido de alguien que estaba trabajando en el sitio del Bronx. El conocido le dijo a la agencia que los trabajadores creían que el sitio podía ser poco seguro, pero que tenían miedo de expresarlo. Las personas asociadas con el grupo de defensa dijeron que les habían mostrado fotografías del sitio, que fueron compartidas con The New York Times, las cuales retrataban un techo que cedía bajo el peso del material que estaba apilado encima. Demostrar que un contratista es directamente responsable de la muerte de un trabajador puede ser difícil, dijeron los funcionarios de la ciudad. En vez de cargos penales, los contratistas a menudo enfrentan multas por violaciones de seguridad u otros actos indebidos; órdenes para frenar o ralentizar actividades; o, en casos más graves, una suspensión o la revocación de sus licencias. En 2018, se llevaron a cabo 25 arrestos relacionados con construcciones debido a diversos delitos como sobornos, licitaciones fraudulentas o robo de salarios, de acuerdo con el Departamento de Investigación de la ciudad. Según la ley estatal de Nueva York, los contratistas que sean declarados penalmente responsables por la muerte de un trabajador pueden ser multados por un máximo de 10.000 dólares, una cantidad que, según los defensores de los trabajadores, es mísera. La ciudad señaló que los contratistas normalmente enfrentan multas adicionales por otras faltas. El accidente en el Bronx no fue el primero en el que un obrero de Pioneer General resultó lesionado en el trabajo. En 2018, dos trabajadores involucrados en otros accidentes demandaron a la compañía por lo que consideran condiciones laborales poco seguras. Ambas demandas siguen en proceso. Guazhco ha experimentado una presión financiera considerable desde la muerte de su esposo, comenzando con el costo de la repatriación del cuerpo a Ecuador. Varios despachos de abogados la contactaron tras el accidente, y ella decidió entablar una demanda. Guazhco dijo que aún trata de explicarles a los gemelos de la pareja, de 4 años, qué pasó con su padre. Además de tener que reunir los 2000 dólares mensuales que paga por la renta de su departamento, también debe atender las tareas de las que normalmente se encargaba su esposo. La hija mayor de la pareja, que vive en el departamento de la familia en el Bronx, hace poco dio a luz a una niña. María Huerta, de 20 años, dijo que le había dado el nombre de Esperanza a su hija para reflejar lo que su llegada significaba tras la muerte de su padre. En una noche reciente, otra hija, Mirian, entraba de vez en cuando a la cocina para ayudar a su madre con una de las gemelas. Mirian era una nueva presencia en el hogar. Había sido detenida por las autoridades de inmigración en Luisiana en junio de 2019 después de intentar ingresar a Estados Unidos procedente de Ecuador. Fue liberada para asistir al funeral de su padre y esperaba obtener permiso para quedarse con su familia permanentemente. Para Guazhco era un alivio tener a ambas hijas en casa. Pero también significaba más bocas que alimentar. La presión de responder por los cinco hijos, dijo, a veces era insoportable. “Hay momentos que yo no quiero llegar a la casa porque tengo tantas cosas en la cabeza”, dijo entre lágrimas. “Pero lo tengo que hacer por mis hijos, por los pequeños”.

2020,Un écrivain pédophile — et l’élite française — sur le banc des accusés,"Gabriel Matzneff écrit ouvertement sur sa pédophilie depuis des décennies, protégé par des personnalités influentes des médias, de l’édition, du monde politique et du milieu des affaires. Désormais ostracisé, il attaque leur « lâcheté » dans un entretien rare. L’écrivain français Gabriel Matzneff sur la Riviera italienne ce mois-ci. Il se vante depuis longtemps de ses relations sexuelles avec des mineurs.Credit...Andrea Mantovani pour The New York Times PARIS — Gabriel Matzneff, l’écrivain français poursuivi pour son éloge de la pédophilie, se terre dans une chambre d’hôtel de la Riviera italienne sans arriver à se détendre, ni à dormir, ni à écrire. Lâché par les puissantes personnalités des médias, de l’édition, du monde politique et du milieu des affaires qui le protégeaient il y a encore quelques semaines, il est seul et à l’abri des regards. Il ne sort que pour des promenades solitaires, caché derrière ses lunettes de soleil, et quand je réussis à le retrouver dans un café qu’il avait mentionné dans ses livres, il tombe des nues. « Je me sens un mort-vivant, un mort qui marche, qui marche sur le lungomare, » dit-il au cours du long entretien qu’il accepte finalement de m’accorder, désignant le front de mer par son nom italien. M. Matzneff n’a pas l’habitude de se cacher. Longtemps il a été célébré parce qu’il ne cachait rien, justement; ni sa chasse aux jeunes filles devant les collèges parisiens, ni ses rapports sexuels avec des garçons de huit ans aux Philippines. Il a été invité à déjeuner à l’Élysée par François Mitterrand et a fréquenté Jean-Marie Le Pen, le dirigeant d’extrême-droite. Il a bénéficié des largesses du couturier Yves Saint Laurent et du compagnon de ce dernier, le puissant homme d’affaires Pierre Bergé. Mais M. Matzneff est convoqué par le tribunal correctionnel de Paris ce mercredi 12 février, accusé d’apologie de la pédophilie dans ses livres. Il risque jusqu’à cinq ans de prison. Mais, en filigrane, c’est aussi une certaine élite qui est sur le banc des accusés: celle qui a promu sa carrière, qui a ignoré les rares appels réclamant son arrestation et, volontairement ou pas, qui a aidé l’homme à échapper à la justice. Le soutien dont il a bénéficié est à l’image d’une vieille contradiction hexagonale : la France a beau être un pays profondément égalitaire, son élite tend à se démarquer des gens ordinaires en s’affranchissant des règles et du code moral ambiant, ou, tout au moins, en défendant haut et fort ceux qui le font. Il y a dix ans, Dominique Strauss-Kahn fut éjecté de son poste à la tête du Fonds monétaire international à la suite d’une accusation de harcèlement sexuel par une femme de ménage d’un hôtel. Un de ses soutiens balaya l’affaire sous prétexte qu’il s’agissait d’un « troussage de domestique », une expression qui évoque le passé féodal de la France. Ce mardi, le procureur de Paris a annoncé sur Europe 1 qu’un appel à témoins avait été lancé pour retrouver d’éventuelles victimes de M. Matzneff. « On est dans une société très égalitaire où il y a une poche de résistance qui effectivement se comporte comme une aristocratie, » explique Pierre Verdrager, un sociologue spécialiste de la pédophilie. M. Matzneff était de ces figures transgressives que les élites ont toujours aimées. Pour des intellectuels de gauche grisonnants, ses ouvrages prolongeaient l’esprit libertaire de Mai 68, tandis qu’une nouvelle génération d’écrivains de droite a pu voir en lui un symbole de l’anti-politiquement correct. Mais le vent a tourné. M. Matzneff et ses soutiens sont maintenant sommés de s’expliquer face à un nouveau mouvement social – la libération de la parole des femmes, si longtemps étouffée par des hommes puissants. C’est la publication il y a un mois du livre Le consentement, premier témoignage d’une des victimes mineures de l’écrivain, Vanessa Springora, qui a donné le signal. Le livre ne contient aucune révélation sur l’historique sexuel de M. Matzneff, mais il a provoqué un revirement culturel radical en France. « C’est le #MeToo de l’édition française. On libère une parole dans un milieu, le milieu littéraire français, qui est machiste, assez misogyne et qui se tait – omerta, » confirme François Busnel, producteur et présentateur de La Grande Librairie, l’émission littéraire télévisée la plus suivie en France. La chute de Gabriel Matzneff a beau être tardive, elle est brutale. Ses trois éditeurs l’ont lâché. Le directeur du Centre national du livre a annoncé que l’écrivain perdrait une allocation annuelle prestigieuse et rarement attribuée. Le ministère de la Culture a remis en cause deux décorations que l’État lui avait octroyées au milieu des années 1990. Le Point lui a retiré sa chronique hebdomadaire. Une enquête judiciaire est ouverte à son encontre. Le délai de prescription est a priori dépassé en ce qui concerne Mme. Springora. En revanche, M. Matzneff risque d’être poursuivi au pénal pour avoir eu des relations sexuelles avec des mineurs plus récemment en France et à l’étranger, outre l’accusation d’apologie de la pédophilie. Réfugié en Italie, il s’insurge contre ces reproches. « Qui sont-ils pour juger leurs semblables ? » dit-il. « Des associations pour la vertu, et eux comment ils couchent, qu’est-ce qu’ils font au lit et avec qui ils couchent, et leurs désirs secrets et refoulés ? » Pour beaucoup, l’histoire de M. Matzneff, ne pouvait avoir lieu « qu’en France ». De Voltaire à Hugo et de Zola à Sartre, la France est un pays où la figure de l’écrivain est sacralisée. D’innombrables rues parisiennes portent le nom d’hommes de lettres, comme pour marquer physiquement leur extraordinaire influence. Chaque mercredi, La Grande Librairie consacre 90 minutes de prime time aux sorties littéraires sur une des principales chaînes de télévision française. M. Matzneff n’est peut-être pas l’un des plus grands écrivains français, mais il a largement bénéficié de cette tradition. Il est l’auteur de plus de 50 romans, collections d’essais et volumes de journaux qui ne seraient sans doute jamais parvenus en librairie si l’industrie avait été plus soucieuse de ses résultats financiers. Ses éditeurs français ont même consciencieusement accepté de publier plusieurs journaux intimes pour des périodes parfois identiques et dont la minutie évoque davantage de la comptabilité. Mais ces ouvrages regorgent de détails méticuleux sur les gens qui le soutenaient et les jeunes filles qu’il séduisait, parmi lesquelles figurait Mme. Springora. Il y a un mois, la justice, soudainement enhardie, a débarqué chez Gallimard, une prestigieuse maison d’édition française, pour saisir seize exemplaires de ses livres. Au procès qui s’ouvre mercredi, ces livres pourraient servir de preuves à charge contre les éditeurs et les soutiens de M. Matzneff. « Nous connaissons des hommes qui souffraient de troubles émotionnels, qui ont justifié la pédophilie en lisant les livres de Matzneff, » explique Méhana Mouhou, avocat de L’Ange Bleu, l’association à l’origine de la citation à comparaître de M. Matzneff. L’écrivain s’est éclipsé fin décembre, juste avant la publication du témoignage de Mme. Springora. Alors que le scandale éclatait à Paris, je me suis plongé dans les journaux et les livres de M. Matzneff. Quand une courte interview accordée à BFM TV donna des indices sur son lieu de refuge, je pris la direction du littoral italien, où je l’ai trouvé – l’homme a ses habitudes, ses journaux le montrent – dans son café préféré. D’abord sur la défensive, à la fois surpris et en colère, il finit par reconnaître qu’il se sent « très, très seul, » et se livre peu à peu, demandant à ce que son adresse exacte ne soit pas révélée avant de se confier pendant trois heures et demie. Il se dit déconcerté par le brusque revirement culturel en France et par sa chute précipitée. Il n’exprime aucun remords vis-à-vis de ses agissements et ne renie aucun de ses écrits. M. Matzneff confirme aussi les passages de ses livres qui évoquent le soutien de personnalités influentes dont il a bénéficié, en ajoutant quelques nouveaux détails. Il paraît à la fois amer et en colère de savoir que ses vieux amis se taisent, prennent leurs distances, ou se sont retournés contre lui. « Ils témoignent de leur lâcheté, » dit-il. « On peut dire prudence, mais, enfin, c’est quand même plus que de la prudence pour certains que je prenais pour des amis. » Les amis de M. Matzneff ne se contentaient pas d’admirer son œuvre. Volontairement ou pas, ils contribuaient à protéger l’écrivain des autorités. En 1986, des policiers à Paris avaient convoqué M. Matzneff, âgé à l’époque de 50 ans, après avoir reçu des lettres anonymes affirmant qu’il vivait dans son appartement avec Vanessa Springora, qui avait alors 14 ans. Il s’était bien rendu au commissariat, mais avec un talisman en poche : un article très élogieux à son égard, signé par François Mitterrand, le président à l’époque. Ce dernier avait remarqué M. Matzneff vingt ans plus tôt, lors de la sortie de sa première collection d’essais, Le Défi. « Cela lui a tellement plu qu’il l’a offert à ses fils qui devaient avoir 15, 16 ans… et il m’a invité à déjeuner, » se souvient M. Matzneff. M. Mitterrand continua à fréquenter ce jeune écrivain prometteur dont il demeura admiratif, y compris après son apologie retentissante de la pédophilie, parue en 1974 sous le titre Les moins de seize ans. Une fois élu président en 1981, M. Mitterrand invita M. Matzneff au moins une fois à déjeuner au palais présidentiel, précisément en 1984, d’après l’Institut François Mitterrand. Le président signa également un article enthousiaste dans une revue culturelle éphémère, Matulu, pour un numéro spécial consacré à M. Matzneff, en juillet 1986. Qualifiant l’homme de « séducteur impénitent », le président écrit qu’il « m’a toujours étonné par son goût extrême de la rigueur et par la densité de sa réflexion. » La chronique fut publiée quelques semaines à peine avant que la Brigade des mineurs ne s’intéresse à Gabriel Matzneff suite à la lettre de dénonciation. « Sans doute, j’avais peut-être découpé l’article dans mon portefeuille, » avance Gabriel Matzneff. Dans son livre, Mme. Springora se souvient qu’« en cas d’arrestation, il pense qu’elle [la chronique de Mitterrand] aurait le pouvoir de le sauver. » Selon M. Matzneff, c’est précisément ce qui est arrivé. Quand les inspecteurs l’ont vue, ils ont rejeté les lettres de dénonciation comme étant le fruit d’un rival littéraire. « Un des inspecteurs m’avait dit, ‘Mais ça c’est des genres de jalousies, ces lettres anonymes, c’est certainement de la jalousie,’ » dit M. Matzneff. Outre François Mitterrand, M. Matzneff bénéficiait d’appuis plus directs. D’abord, celui de son ami Christian Giudicelli, un écrivain maintes fois primé qui avait accepté de cacher chez lui des lettres et les photos de Mme. Springora qui étaient compromettantes pour M. Matzneff, relate-t-il. Puis, cherchant un abri plus sûr, M. Matzneff et l’adolescente s’installèrent à l’hôtel. M. Matzneff explique que les factures de ce dernier étaient réglées par Yves Saint Laurent, le couturier décédé en 2008, par l’entremise d’un de ses collaborateurs proches, Christophe Girard. L’arrangement lui avait permis de se remettre d’une opération de l’œil, et d’ « échapper aux visites de la Brigades des mineurs (qu’il appelle des “persécutions”), » écrit Mme. Springora. M. Matzneff se rappelle de M. Girard lui disant, « Nous nous occupons de tout, les repas, tout. » Il précise: «et ça a duré je crois, deux ans, à peu près. » « Pour nous, c’est une goutte d’eau, ce n’est rien, nous vous aimons beaucoup, » lui avait dit M. Girard, toujours d’après M. Matzneff. M. Girard a refusé de nous accorder un entretien pour cet article. Les rapports sexuels avec mineurs âgés de moins de quinze ans étaient et sont toujours illégaux en France. Mais contrairement aux États-Unis ou à d’autres pays dont les lois estiment que les mineurs sont trop immatures pour consentir pleinement à des relations sexuelles, la France ne définit pas d’âge minimum de consentement. Récemment encore, en 2018, le gouvernement a retiré d’un projet de loi un article qui établissait une présomption de non-consentement des mineurs de moins de 15 ans. En France, M. Matzneff a toujours veillé à ne pas sortir de ce que certains appellent une « zone grise » quand il s’épanche sur ses relations avec des jeunes filles dans ses journaux et ses romans. Quand il décrit clairement des escapades pédophiles, surtout avec des garçons pré-pubères, c’est aux Philippines que cela se passe. « Il m’arrive d’avoir jusqu’à quatre gamins – âgés de 8 à 14 ans – dans mon lit en même temps, et de me livrer avec eux aux ébats les plus exquis, » écrit-il dans Un Galop d’enfer, son journal publié en 1985. Certains lecteurs en furent abasourdis. « Il devrait être en prison, » se souvient avoir pensé Denis Tillinac, une des rares voix critiques, qui dirigeait la maison d’édition La Table Ronde et qui avait refusé de publier ses carnets intimes. « Mais non, il n’est pas en prison, il est reçu et choyé par le président de la République, Mitterrand. » La critique la plus publique eut lieu en 1990, au cours de l’émission littéraire télévisée Apostrophes. L’animateur et les invités commentaient le dernier volume du journal de M. Matzneff, Mes amours décomposés, dans lequel l’écrivain se vante de ses innombrables relations sexuelles avec des mineurs, dont des garçons Philippins de 11 et 12 ans qu’il qualifie de « piment rare ». Une seule voix s’éleva pour dénoncer les pratiques sexuelles de M. Matzneff: celle de la journaliste québécoise Denise Bombardier, l’unique étrangère sur le plateau. La réaction de l’intelligentsia française ne se fit pas attendre. Josyane Savigneau, rédactrice en chef du Monde des livres de 1991 à 2005, critiqua publiquement Denise Bombardier et prit la défense de l’écrivain. Interrogée récemment à ce propos, Mme. Savigneau dit avoir été scandalisée par certains textes de M. Matzneff, mais estime que ses livres étaient meilleurs que d’autres qui atterrissaient sur son bureau. « Je le voyais comme un homme qui aime les jeunes filles. En France, on ne l’a jamais vu avec des garçons, » dit-elle. Philippe Sollers, l’éditeur de M. Matzneff chez Gallimard, fustigea la journaliste québécoise en l’affublant d’un terme sexuel grossier. M. Sollers n’a pas souhaité répondre à notre demande d’interview. Le seul à prendre publiquement la défense de Mme. Bombardier fut celui qu’on attendait le moins : M. Mitterrand. Mme. Bombardier fut invitée à l’Élysée, raconte-t-elle, et M. Mitterrand lui avoua qu’il avait reconnu « quelques qualités » à M. Matzneff, mais que ce dernier avait malheureusement « sombré » dans la « pédophilie ». M. Matzneff avait beau publier des livres à la chaîne, il avait du mal à joindre les deux bouts, si bien qu’il se tourna vers ses amis haut placés. En 2002, M. Girard, l’ancien collaborateur d’Yves Saint Laurent, était devenu adjoint à la culture du maire de Paris, un poste qu’il occupe de nouveau à l’heure qu’il est. Il fit pression pour que M. Matzneff obtienne une allocation annuelle à vie du Centre National du Livre, un privilège rarement attribué, comme l’a révélé son directeur actuel, Vincent Monadé, au quotidien L’Opinion. En 2005, l’éditeur d’origine des Moins de seize ans rechignait à le republier. C’est alors, selon M. Matzneff, qu’un autre de ses vieux alliés, un puissant avocat et écrivain nommé Emmanuel Pierrat, le présenta à un nouvel éditeur, qui donna une seconde vie au livre. « Je n’en renie pas une ligne, pas un mot, » écrit l’auteur dans la préface de cette édition de 2005. M. Pierrat, qui représente désormais M. Matzneff , est également Président du PEN Club en France et le secrétaire général du musée Yves Saint Laurent. Il n’a pas répondu aux nombreux mails et messages que nous lui avons envoyés pour l’interviewer. Arrivé 2013, les opinions de M. Matzneff sont passées de mode. Ses livres se vendent à peine. Un an plus tôt, un cancer de la prostate lui était diagnostiqué. Même désespéré, il réussit à faire jouer ses relations. Le Renaudot lui avait échappé à deux reprises, en dépit des manœuvres farouches d’un des jurés, M. Giudicelli, l’écrivain à qui il avait confié les lettres et les photos de Mme. Springora lorsqu’il redoutait une descente de la police. M. Giudicelli était non seulement l’ami et l’un des éditeurs de M. Matzneff chez Gallimard, mais aussi son acolyte régulier lors de ses virées à Manille. Gallimard n’a donné aucune suite à nos demandes d’interview, ni avec M. Giudicelli, ni avec d’autres représentants de la maison. Les deux hommes sont si proches qu’ils se réfèrent l’un à l’autre en utilisant les numéros des chambres qu’ils occupaient lors de leur premier séjour au Tropicana Hotel à Manille. « Lorsqu’il s’agit d’évoquer, ici et là, en un court paragraphe, de menues coquineries et fredaines dont nous ne nous sentons guère coupables, mon cher Eight o four prend soin de dissimuler son cher Christian sous l’aile protectrice d’Eight one one, » écrit M. Giudicelli. En 2013, M. Giudicelli aida à garantir le prix Renaudot pour son ami, après avoir soigneusement confié aux jurés que ce dernier souffrait d’un cancer. « C’est un argument qu’on a beaucoup entendu : il en a besoin, le pauvre, » confirme Franz-Olivier Giesbert, écrivain, journaliste et membre du jury. L’académicienne Dominique Bona, seule femme de ce jury de dix personnes, admet que les « liens d’amitié » ont joué un rôle important dans l’attribution du prix à M. Matzneff. Selon M. Busnel, l’animateur de La Grande Librairie, « les jurés littéraires en France sont totalement corrompus. » Mais le Renaudot relança la carrière de M. Matzneff et lui valut même d’être convié sur le plateau de l’émission. Seules quelques rares voix s’élevèrent pour s’en étonner, dont celle du blogueur littéraire Juan Asensio, qui se fendit d’un article cinglant sur le prix et sur la pédophilie de M. Matzneff. « Je pense qu’il y a eu une forme de trouille de la part des journalistes de dire que ce prix était scandaleux, » dit-il. S’il y en a une que le Renaudot de M. Matzneff rendit particulièrement furieuse, ce fut Mme. Springora. En colère et dépitée d’assister au retour triomphant de M. Matzneff, elle décida d’écrire Le Consentement. « Moi qui n’ai jamais eu de prix important, elle aurait dû être heureuse pour moi. Mais ça l’a mise en colère, » s’étonne M. Matzneff depuis son refuge italien. Il précise qu’il avait appris la parution imminente du Consentement en novembre dernier, par des amis chez Grasset, l’éditeur du livre. Il partait peu après pour l’Italie, alors que le témoignage de Mme. Springora faisait l’effet d’une bombe dans une France en pleine prise de conscience. Isolé dans sa cachette de la Riviera italienne, M. Matzneff dit qu’il ne sait pas quand il rentrera à Paris. Le jour, il se promène sur le lungomare, le soir, il dîne seul au restaurant de l’hôtel. Dans sa chambre, il relit d’anciens carnets intimes inédits . Il refuse de lire Le Consentement. Il a des insomnies. Il n’écrit plus. « Je suis trop malheureux, » explique-t-il. À Paris, c’est au tour de Mme. Springora d’être accueillie en direct et en prime time sur le plateau de La Grande Librairie. Ce qui avait commencé par un livre ne pouvait que s’achever par un livre. Only in France. « J’avais effectivement cet objectif de l’enfermer dans un livre, de le prendre à son propre piège, » Mme. Springora déclara pendant l’émission, « parce que c’est ce qu’il a fait avec moi et c’est ce qu’il a fait avec de nombreuses jeunes filles. » Daphné Anglès et Constant Méheut ont contribué à ce reportage.",The New York Times
2020,Una aplicación de reconocimiento facial ha identificado a víctimas de abuso infantil,"Aunque la herramienta podría ayudar a resolver casos, esa tecnología podría permitir que la hermética empresa Clearview recopile datos e imágenes extraordinariamente sensibles. Agencias de seguridad de Estados Unidos y Canadá están usando Clearview AI —una hermética empresa que usa tecnología de reconocimiento facial a partir de una base de datos de 3000 millones de imágenes— para identificar a niños que son víctimas de abuso sexual. Es un poderoso incentivo para usar la tecnología, pero genera nuevos cuestionamientos sobre la precisión de esa herramienta y el manejo de los datos que hace la empresa. Según los investigadores, las herramientas de Clearview les permiten saber los nombres o el paradero de menores que aparecen en videos o fotos de explotación sexual y que, de otro modo, tal vez no habrían sido identificados. En un caso en Indiana, los detectives pasaron imágenes de 21 víctimas del mismo delincuente por la aplicación de Clearview y recibieron catorce identidades, de acuerdo con Charles Cohen, un jefe retirado de la policía estatal. La víctima más joven tenía 13 años. “Eran chicos o mujeres jóvenes. Queríamos encontrarlos para decirles que habíamos arrestado a este tipo y ver si querían declarar en calidad de víctimas”, señaló Cohen. Otro funcionario, uno de los responsables de la identificación de víctimas en Canadá, quien no estaba autorizado para hablar en público sobre las investigaciones, describió la tecnología de Clearview como “el avance más importante en la última década” en el terreno de los delitos de abuso sexual infantil. Sin embargo, según defensores de la privacidad, no se ha probado ni regulado la base de datos de la empresa, la cual podría causar nuevos tipos de daños. En sus servidores, Clearview almacena fotos que suben los investigadores —conocidas como “imágenes de sondas”—, es decir que podría acumular un conjunto de datos de una delicadeza extraordinaria sobre víctimas infantiles de abuso sexual y explotación. “Comprendemos la sensibilidad extrema involucrada con la identificación de niños”, escribió en un correo electrónico Hoan Ton-That, fundador de Clearview. “Nuestra misión es proteger a los menores”. De acuerdo con un documento que la empresa comparte con sus clientes, “las búsquedas se guardan para siempre” por omisión, pero los administradores pueden cambiar sus configuraciones para que las imágenes de esas búsquedas sean purgadas después de 30 días. En su mayor parte, Clearview había operado en las sombras hasta el mes pasado, cuando la publicación de un reportaje de The New York Times reveló el uso que le daban agencias de seguridad a nivel local y federal de todo Estados Unidos. La empresa ha recolectado miles de millones de fotos de individuos de todo el internet público, en sitios como Facebook, Twitter, Venmo y YouTube. Cuando un usuario sube la foto de una persona a Clearview, la aplicación muestra otras imágenes de la persona y las direcciones web donde aparece. En numerosos documentos publicitarios, Clearview promueve el uso que le dan las agencias de seguridad a su tecnología para resolver casos de abuso sexual infantil. No obstante, hasta hace poco, la empresa se centraba en su participación para identificar a los perpetradores, no a las víctimas. Quienes han alertado sobre los riesgos de Clearview han argumentado que los beneficios de ese tipo de base de datos no son mayores que los daños que podían causar. “Es difícil. Todo el mundo quiere seguridad y salvar a los niños”, dijo Liz O’Sullivan, directora de tecnología en Surveillance Technology Oversight Project. “Siempre hay alguna manera de normalizar la vigilancia, pero sería peligroso que nos enfocáramos en las ventajas potenciales. El reconocimiento facial comete muchos errores”. O’Sullivan mencionó que le preocupaba que una agencia independiente no hubiera probado la precisión del software de Clearview. Los algoritmos de reconocimiento facial pueden ser deficientes en la gente joven, en parte porque sus rostros cambian con la edad y también porque los niños a menudo no están incluidos en los archivos de datos que se usan para entrenar a los algoritmos. O’Sullivan advirtió que, si la herramienta se equivoca en una coincidencia, podría provocar efectos devastadores para los niños que hayan sido identificados de forma errónea y para sus familias. “Intercambiar la libertad y la privacidad por alguna evidencia anecdótica que pudiera servirles a ciertas personas nunca es suficiente para ceder nuestras libertades civiles”, opinó O’Sullivan. Las agencias de seguridad deben verificar cada identidad cuando usan la aplicación de Clearview, comentó Ton-That en su correo electrónico. Sin embargo, no supo decir cuántos niños había en su base de datos. “No monitoreamos el desglose de edad, género o raza de nuestra base de datos de imágenes”, comentó. “Somos un motor de búsqueda de imágenes públicas, no un sistema de vigilancia”. Las fuerzas especiales de Florida, Indiana y Dakota del Sur dedicadas a investigar casos de abuso infantil, así como el Departamento de Seguridad Nacional estadounidense y las agencias de seguridad de Canadá, utilizan la aplicación. Al igual que varios funcionarios que declararon para el Times, el investigador canadiense fue reacio a hablar sobre Clearview por temor a que los delincuentes cambiaran sus tácticas. “Nos preocupa que, cuando los criminales sepan que está disponible, cubran más el rostro de sus víctimas”, comentó el oficial. “No queremos que ellos sepan que se puede hacer esto”. Hay riesgos legales asociados con el manejo de este tipo de imágenes. La empresa violaría la ley si recibe imágenes de abuso y no informa de inmediato a las autoridades y borra el material de sus servidores. Ton-That mencionó que la aplicación de Clearview solo transmite rostros, no imágenes completas. El Times verificó esto al analizar una versión para Android de la aplicación de Clearview, pero no pudo examinar la oferta de la empresa para iOS ni una versión para web. Ninguna de las agencias de seguridad con las que habló el Times mencionó si había realizado una auditoría técnica a Clearview antes de usar el software. Tampoco respondieron a las preguntas relacionadas con el uso específico de la aplicación, al argumentar que no comentaban sobre sus técnicas de investigación. Britney Walker, una vocera de la Unidad de Investigación de Explotación Infantil del Departamento de Seguridad Nacional de Estados Unidos, mencionó que la división colabora con otras agencias para que le ayuden con las investigaciones, pero que la estrategia “centrada en las víctimas” que utiliza la unidad prohíbe compartir imágenes ilegales. “La agencia, en ninguna circunstancia, compartiría material de abuso sexual infantil a empresas privadas”, comentó Walker. Otras compañías ya trabajan de cerca con funcionarios de agencias de seguridad para investigar casos de abuso sexual infantil. Johann Hofmann, director ejecutivo de Griffeye, señaló que el software de la empresa que analiza las imágenes fue instalado dentro de las redes de las agencias de seguridad y estaba diseñado para evitar el envío de imágenes a terceros, incluida la misma Griffeye. Otra empresa que ofrece herramientas analíticas a los investigadores de abuso sexual infantil, CameraForensics, también comentó que sus sistemas estaban diseñados para nunca recibir ningún tipo de imágenes de agencias de seguridad, incluidos rostros. El fundador de la empresa, Matt Burns, mencionó que su firma había considerado incorporar la tecnología de reconocimiento facial en su software, pero había decidido no hacerlo por “razones éticas”. “Consideramos que era una herramienta demasiado controversial porque es muy fácil caer en casos de abuso con esa funcionalidad”, dijo. “Y también es una pesadilla legal”. Pero Burns entiende por qué los investigadores querrían usar un software de reconocimiento facial. “Se enfrentan a una tarea muy sombría y, si hay una herramienta que les da la posibilidad de proteger a las víctimas, no los culpo por usarla”, dijo. Desde que salieron a la luz las prácticas de Clearview, compañías como Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Venmo y YouTube han enviado cartas en las que le solicitan a la empresa dejar de tomar fotos de sus sitios y borrar las imágenes existentes de sus bases de datos. El fiscal general de Nueva Jersey les prohibió el uso de Clearview a los funcionarios del estado y solicitó una investigación sobre el uso que les daban las agencias de seguridad a la empresa y a las tecnologías similares. En Illinois, donde una dura ley de privacidad de los datos biométricos prohíbe el uso de los rostros de los habitantes sin su consentimiento, se presentó una demanda colectiva en busca de certificación. El 3 de febrero, se presentó otra en Virginia. Recientemente, en Nueva York y Washington, se han presentado proyectos de ley que le prohíben el uso del reconocimiento facial a la policía. Además, Clearview recibió una carta de Edward Markey, senador demócrata de Massachusetts, en la que le pidió una lista de las agencias de seguridad que han usado la aplicación y si se ha recabado la información biométrica de niños menores de 13 años. “Aunque este tipo de tecnología existe desde hace bastante tiempo, creemos que hemos creado algo que permite a las fuerzas del orden público resolver crímenes que antes no se podían resolver y, lo más importante, proteger a menores vulnerables”, dijo Ton-That en su correo electrónico. “Al mismo tiempo, estamos respondiendo a las solicitudes de información del gobierno estadounidense y otras partes interesadas, según corresponda, y esperamos entablar conversaciones constructivas con ellos mientras trabajamos para hacer que nuestras comunidades sean más seguras”. En octubre, grupos de agencias policiales enviaron una carta a los miembros del congreso de Estados Unidos en la que hacen un llamado a no prohibir el uso del reconocimiento facial para sus investigaciones. “Entendemos la preocupación del público sobre los derechos civiles y la protección de su privacidad”, escribieron. “Con políticas claras y disponibles al público, creemos que esas inquietudes pueden abordarse”. Muchas agencias ya habían estado usando Clearview durante meses, pero la carta no mencionaba eso. Michael H. Keller y Aaron Krolik colaboraron en este reportaje.

2020,Una imagen vale más que mil lágrimas,"Comentario Las fotografías de niños que sufren tiene el poder de ablandar la opinión que tenemos sobre “el otro”. ¿Seguirá sucediendo en una era polarizada? La autora es columnista de The New York Times. [Suscríbete a nuestro boletín y recibe por correo y en español lo mejor de The New York Times.] NASHVILLE — El 8 de junio de 1972, Nick Ut, un fotógrafo vietnamita de The Associated Press, capturó una fotografía ahora icónica en la que se ve a unos niños que huían del napalm lanzado por error en su aldea por fuerzas survietnamitas. En el centro de la imagen puede verse a una niña desnuda de 9 años llamada Phan Thi Kim Phuc. Está en agonía. Su piel parece estar derritiéndose. Ninguno de los soldados del fondo está viendo a los niños. Solo el fotógrafo observa el dolor de la niña. Ahora todos vemos el dolor de la niña. La foto, publicada por The New York Times y otros periódicos tres días después, impactó a los lectores por su contundente representación de los costos de la guerra. La fotografía ganó un Premio Pulitzer en 1973. Más tarde ese año, las fuerzas estadounidenses se retiraron de Vietnam. Haya estado o no la foto directamente relacionada con la retirada, como mínimo alimentó el creciente sentimiento antibélico en Estados Unidos y tal vez apresuró el final de la guerra. “La niña del napalm” forma parte de una tradición de fotoperiodismo que promueve la justicia social. Está también la imagen capturada por David Jackson en 1955 del niño de 14 años Emmett Till en su ataúd, asesinado por ser negro en Misisipi cuando regían las leyes de Jim Crow. O la foto de 1976 de Sam Nzima que muestra a un adolescente llevando el cadáver de un niño en brazos durante la masacre de Soweto en Sudáfrica. La imagen capturada por Kevin Carter en 1993 en la que se ve a un niño sudanés hambriento siendo observado por un buitre. La fotografía de 2015 de Nilufer Demir de un niño de 3 años acostado boca abajo en el oleaje, tras haberse ahogado junto con su madre y hermano en un intento desesperado por huir de la guerra en Siria. La foto de John Moore de 2018 de una aterrorizada niña hondureña de dos años en busca de asilo junto a su madre en la frontera entre México y Estados Unidos. Estas fotografías precisan un momento cultural particular. Destilan la vasta masa de la historia en una sola imagen tan impactante que se manifiesta en tus sueños y te hace llorar en la oscuridad. Así como con la foto tomada por Ut de Kim Phuc, nunca queda completamente claro si esas imágenes son la verdadera causa del viraje comunitario hacia la empatía, pero la correlación, al menos, casi siempre es evidente. El gobierno federal eliminó las leyes de Jim Crow en el sur segregado, aun si lo hizo a regañadientes. Los soldados estadounidenses terminaron abandonando Vietnam. El apartheid en Sudáfrica acabó. Los países europeos al final abrieron sus fronteras a los refugiados. Luego de defenderla durante meses, el gobierno de Donald Trump puso fin a su brutal política de separación familiar en la frontera con México, al menos oficialmente. El reciente resumen fotográfico de la década pasada del Times me hizo pensar en el poder de las fotografías para afectar el curso de la historia. Muchas de estas fotos fueron realizadas durante momentos profundamente extremos: guerras, desastres naturales, graves conflictos sociales. Hay fotografías desgarradoras de supervivencia y muerte entre los escombros, de un hombre desarmado y una mujer desarmada enfrentando a policías con equipo antidisturbios, de miembros de tribus protestando contra el proyecto Dakota Access Pipeline, de muerte en la búsqueda de la libertad. Imágenes de atrocidades codo a codo con imágenes de honor, fotos de furia junto a fotos de amor. Sin embargo, las fotos que destacan, una y otra vez, son las de los niños: un bebé en una cuna portátil viendo cómo un equipo encargado de desalojos desmantela su hogar, sobrevivientes aterrorizados de la masacre de la Escuela Primaria de Sandy Hook que son escoltados fuera del edificio, una pequeña niña gritando junto al ataúd abierto de su padre, un bebé refugiado de la minoría rohinyá que huye de Birmania sujeto a la cadera de su madre con un chal, una niña de siete años muriendo de hambre en Yemen. Estas fotografías tienen el poder de atormentarnos en formas que otras fotos, sin importar cuán conmovedoras sean, raramente logran hacerlo. Detonan una empatía que es tan profunda como incondicional: cuando vemos a un niño en peligro, nuestro impulso inmediato es intervenir, y nunca nos detenemos a cuestionar ese impulso. ¿Qué clase de persona se pregunta si será correcto proteger a un niño? En parte, esta reacción es biológica: el llanto de un bebé inspira una respuesta inmediata de atención en el cerebro de los adultos, sean o no responsables del niño. Esto tiene sentido, al menos en términos evolutivos. Las criaturas indefensas que no inspiran la ayuda de los poderosos son criaturas indefensas que no sobreviven. Sin embargo, más allá de eso, lo que sentimos cuando vemos imágenes de niños adoloridos, aterrorizados o muertos con toda seguridad se vincula a nuestra capacidad innata para la justicia. Los niños no causan ni pueden entender lo que les estamos haciendo, y su inocencia es un recordatorio de nuestras obligaciones morales; su sufrimiento es un llamado a la acción. El mundo ha cambiado desde que David Jackson fotografió el rostro desfigurado de Emmett Till y Nick Ut capturó el cuerpo quemado con napalm de Phan Thi Kim Phuc. El año pasado, Julia Le Duc fotografió los cadáveres de Óscar Alberto Martínez Ramírez y su hija de 23 meses, Valeria, boca abajo en el lodo junto al río Bravo. La fotografía se hizo viral en las redes sociales y se convirtió en un recordatorio visceral de la desesperación de los inmigrantes que buscan asilo en Estados Unidos. Sin embargo, este país está tan lejos de tener una política migratoria razonable como cuando la pequeña Valeria murió con su pequeño brazo alrededor del cuello de su padre. Tampoco estamos más cerca de una política de armas que cuide a los estudiantes o de una política económica que proteja a los trabajadores pobres. Quizás en la actualidad haya demasiadas fotos, demasiadas vertientes sangrientas de sufrimiento en demasiados lugares olvidados por Dios, como para lograr enfocarnos el tiempo suficiente en cualquiera de esas tragedias. Quizá nuestra desconfianza en la tecnología, nuestra sospecha de que las imágenes han sido manipuladas, o de que nosotros mismos estamos siendo manipulados, facilita demasiado que desconfiemos también de nuestra propia reacción ante ellas. Pero mientras nos sigan conmoviendo las fotografías icónicas de nuestra época, aunque sea inconscientemente, habrá esperanza. En tanto que las fotografías —y las novelas, los poemas, las canciones, las obras de teatro, las pinturas y cualquier otro tipo de arte que filtre el mundo a través de la imaginación moral— nos enseñen a mirar lo que de otra manera podríamos pasar por alto, existirá la posibilidad de un cambio. El fracaso de Estados Unidos en desarrollar una política humana y coherente para los conflictos que causan el sufrimiento de niños es un fracaso temporal. Las oficinas gubernamentales pueden cambiar de funcionarios. Las políticas pueden cambiar su rumbo. Lo único que no cambia es la autoridad de un corazón humano vulnerable al dolor de otros. La fotografía capturada por Nick Ut de Phan Thi Kim Phuc nos enseñó algo vital acerca de la brutalidad casual de la guerra, pero también nos recordó algo igualmente importante: el poder de la compasión humana. El hermano menor de Kim Phuc murió por las lesiones que sufrió durante el mismo ataque de napalm al que ella sobrevivió. Y logró sobrevivir gracias a las rápidas acciones de Ut, que la empapó con agua y la trasladó a un hospital en Ho Chi Minh para que recibiera atención médica. Solo después de que ella estuvo a salvo fue que Ut llevó su rollo de película al cuarto oscuro para ver lo que había retratado.

2020,Una nueva patria para la diáspora venezolana,"Comentario Un fallo de la Corte Constitucional de Colombia le dio a los hijos de venezolanos nacidos en ese país el derecho a la nacionalidad. Es el primer paso para resarcir una deuda histórica con la nación que recibió a miles de colombianos en sus años de bonanza. El autor es periodista. BOGOTÁ — Un fallo reciente de la Corte Constitucional dio a los hijos de venezolanos nacidos en Colombia el derecho a la nacionalidad. Al menos 15.000 niños estaban en riesgo de apatridia frente a dos burocracias que los discriminaban al mismo tiempo. Venezuela, con sus sedes diplomáticas cerradas en este país, negaba cualquier trámite a los ciudadanos emigrados. Mientras Colombia imponía trabas para acceder a su nacionalidad. Yo también busqué un porvenir al otro lado de la frontera. A fines de los setenta, junto a mi familia, dejé atrás Colombia, un país azotado por el narcotráfico y la guerra interna; y nos instalamos en Venezuela, donde el petróleo había fabricado una burbuja de bienestar excepcional para esta región maltrecha. Allá crecí con las mismas oportunidades que disfrutaban los locales: trabajos bien pagados para mis padres, educación gratuita en la universidad y, además, una distancia prudente que me eximió del peligroso servicio militar colombiano. Nunca tuve el pasaporte, pero fui tan venezolano como cualquiera. En una región acostumbrada al destierro, Colombia es uno de los países con el mayor número de ciudadanos fuera de sus fronteras: unos 4,7 millones en 2013, según la Organización Internacional para las Migraciones. Mi familia fue parte de esos números. Cuando nos fuimos a Venezuela, atraídos por la bonanza, la verdad es que no todo brillaba. Allá los hijos de colombianos padecimos la xenofobia, siempre marcados por el estigma de nuestro origen. Pero en general pudimos desarrollarnos dentro de una sociedad que tendía a ser tolerante y hospitalaria con los extranjeros. Como individuos, con nuestras acciones, adquirimos compromisos morales; y sucede lo mismo con los países. Colombia, un lugar desigual y violento, desplazó durante décadas a cientos de miles de personas que encontraron refugio en Venezuela. Ahora que la arepa se ha volteado y el flujo migratorio cambió de sentido, llegó el momento de pagar. Con el fallo de la Corte, mi país empieza a resarcir una deuda antigua. Es una nueva posibilidad que se abre para los hijos de extranjeros nacidos en Colombia. Una buena noticia para los hijos de la diáspora venezolana. Pero el reto es grande: debemos asimilar un tercio del mayor desplazamiento migratorio que ha conocido Latinoamérica, con más de cuatro millones de personas que han salido de Venezuela. En las calles de Bogotá y otras ciudades, muchos de ellos piden ayuda con mensajes urgentes escritos en carteles. La constitución colombiana reconoce la nacionalidad a un hijo de extranjeros si “alguno de sus padres estuviere domiciliado en la república en el momento del nacimiento”. En estos casos la condición se cumple: 1,6 millones de venezolanos viven en este país, pero la mayoría no tiene una visa de residente. Durante los últimos años, cada vez que nacía un hijo de venezolanos, la Registraduría Nacional anotaba en su registro civil una advertencia: “No válido para nacionalidad”. Crear trabas para adquirir la nacionalidad por nacimiento era una forma eficaz de eliminar un estímulo para los migrantes, que buscan lugares de acogida en condiciones formales. En la práctica, el Estado colombiano negaba el derecho a la identidad y, además, restringía el acceso a la salud y la educación de esos niños sin documentos. El fallo de la Corte surgió como respuesta a un recurso del Programa de Protección Internacional de la Facultad de Derecho y Ciencias Políticas de la Universidad de Antioquia, cuya tutela argumentó que la Registraduría vulneraba el derecho de dos niños, Yoel y Sara, a tener una nacionalidad. Un juez de Medellín había negado un primer amparo y luego un Tribunal Superior había confirmado esa decisión. Fue entonces cuando la Corte, máxima autoridad constitucional, concedió la razón a los demandantes. La decisión, además, afloja el corsé legal y dice que un migrante no necesita una visa para demostrar su domicilio en este país. El fallo le tuerce el brazo a un Estado que creó las condiciones para expulsar y no para recibir. Ahora el gobierno debe hacer lugar en la cama para cobijar a más y más miembros de una familia en crecimiento. Venezuela, mi otro país, practicó durante casi todo el siglo pasado una política de puertas abiertas que dio refugio a italianos, españoles y portugueses cuando huían de la Segunda Guerra, y a latinoamericanos que escapaban de las dictaduras y las crisis sucesivas. Varias generaciones de extranjeros se integraron al escenario venezolano e hicieron aportes en diversas disciplinas. Ese pasado reciente ofrece un espejo donde Colombia puede mirarse. Nuestra sociedad debe proveer oportunidades que permitan incorporar a los recién llegados y hacerlos parte de una comunidad que, hasta ahora —tal vez por el trauma de la guerra—, ha sido muy cerrada y celosa. Ni siquiera se trata de conceder lujos: con seguridad, salud, educación y otras garantías fundamentales será más factible que los extranjeros y sus hijos se conviertan en nuevos colombianos productivos. Cierto discurso xenófobo dice que la atención a los migrantes implica postergar las necesidades locales. Falso. Reconocer un derecho esencial a los hijos de los extranjeros es un gesto básico que no riñe con la atención urgente de los colombianos más necesitados. De hecho, son dos acciones de política pública que responden al mismo fenómeno: la pobreza y sus consecuencias. Este país, que mantiene otra deuda con la mayoría de sus ciudadanos, puede saldarla mientras facilita a los recién llegados unas condiciones mínimas para su desembarco. Miles de colombianos emigrados, desde Venezuela sobre todo, han vuelto a su país en estos años recientes. El descalabro de la nación vecina y cierta mejoría en la nuestra han colaborado para producir este retorno masivo. Ese también es mi caso. Cuarenta años después, de vuelta en el origen, evalúo nuestro vaivén histórico y siento la culpa típica del migrante por haber saltado de dos barcos que se hundían. Pero me consuelo pensando que los países deberían proveer las condiciones para que nadie deba escapar hacia naves más estables. O al menos garantizar la más esencial de todas: que ningún ser humano llegue al mundo sellado como un intruso con demominación de origen.

2020,Kobe Bryant Memorial: Full Coverage of the Tributes at Staples Center,"Tears and tributes flowed early and often at a memorial service for Kobe and Gianna Bryant on Monday, punctuated by moments of levity and optimism nearly one month after the N.B.A. star and his daughter died in a helicopter crash. The ceremony at Staples Center lasted about two hours, with many luminaries from the basketball world and beyond paying their respects, and fans around Southern California and the rest of the world watching live. “God knew they couldn’t be on this earth without each other,” Bryant’s widow, Vanessa Bryant, said in her first public comments since the crash. “He had to bring them home together.” In many ways, Vanessa Bryant’s speech was the emotional heart of the memorial — deeply personal and moving for those who watched her speak. The memorial began with an uplifting performance by one of Bryant’s longtime friends, Beyoncé Knowles, singing “XO,” a tune she said was one of Bryant’s favorites. Jimmy Kimmel, the comedian and late night talk show host, was emotional throughout. “I’ve been trying to come up with something positive to take away from this, and it was hard because there isn’t much. But the best thing I was able to come up with is this: Gratitude,” Kimmel said. “It seems to me that all we can do is to be grateful for the time we had with them and for the time we have left with each other.” Diana Taurasi, Sabrina Ionescu and Coach Geno Auriemma of Connecticut — a trio of women’s basketball titans — spoke about the impact of the Bryants on women’s basketball. Michael Jordan, Shaquille O’Neal and Rob Pelinka, Bryant’s former agent, also spoke and Alicia Keys and Christina Aguilera performed. Jordan, to whom Bryant was compared as a player, delivered one of the best punchlines of the day. “I’m going to have to look at another crying meme,” he said, referring to the oft-cited “Crying Jordan” meme that has been popular on social media since he was inducted into the basketball Hall of Fame.",The New York Times
2020,Uncovering Charles Lindbergh’s Secret Lives,"Children’s Books When writing nonfiction for young readers, it’s never a bad idea to start with someone cutting off his arm. It’s a definite grabber, and, as Candace Fleming tells us in this rich and unflinching biography, THE RISE AND FALL OF CHARLES LINDBERGH (Schwartz & Wade/Random House, 384 pp., $18.99; ages 12 and up), the scene sheds light on one of the most famous and controversial Americans of the 20th century. What happened is simple enough: In the Minnesota woods in the summer of 1861, Lindbergh’s grandfather, a recent immigrant from Sweden, got his arm caught in a sawmill. The wound was horrific; the man’s beating heart was visible through the hole in his side. He was expected to die. But he refused. By sheer force of will, according to family lore, he was soon out of bed and back to work. Born 41 years after the incident, Charles Lindbergh grew up enthralled by the tale, coming to see himself in the story. He was born of special stock, he concluded, stronger than others, destined for greater things. Fleming calls this section “The Origin Story,” and that’s fitting. Lindbergh developed an “exaggerated confidence,” as she puts it, that became a kind of superpower. Examples of Lindbergh using and misusing it run like a spine through his story. Charles was a restless kid, a loner and a terrible student, the kind of person who was only happy when obsessed with a challenge of his own choosing. He had no use for the flashy lure of the Roaring Twenties, but the budding field of aviation — that was worth his time. At 25, he flew solo from New York to Paris, a feat of skill and daring that catapulted him to a level of public scrutiny beyond anything we’ll ever see with today’s crowded 24-hour news cycle. Lindbergh was badly suited to stardom. He looked the part, but was intensely private and socially awkward, and he came to resent the relentless adulation. We sympathize with his discomfort, though it hardly excuses what came next. Nothing in this story is that simple. As the title promises, this is a full-blown rise-and-fall drama, with enough plot for half a dozen novels. Fleming does a masterly job juggling story lines, from Lindbergh’s marriage and flying partnership with Anne Morrow, to the kidnapping of their son and the resulting media circus, to Lindbergh’s quest to invent machines that could prolong the “right” sort of human life — a demented vision born of his belief in white supremacy. He began spending time in Nazi Germany, impressed with what he saw as strength and order. He parroted Nazi talking points about Germany’s “Jewish problem” and dismissed Hitler’s increasingly violent anti-Semitism as trivial. When World War II erupted in Europe, Lindbergh jumped into the “America First” movement, an isolationist group that came to be dominated by Nazi sympathizers. At raucous rallies, Lindbergh attacked American journalists as “dishonest parasites” under the control of “dangerous elements.” He urged the country to close its borders to “alien blood,” while loyal crowds berated protesters with chants of “Throw him out! Throw him out!” This sounds familiar to anyone aware of today’s news, and it’s obviously meant to. But Fleming respects her readers’ intelligence and curiosity — she tells us the story, but not what to think about it. Reading the book becomes an interactive experience, with Lindbergh inspiring awe in one chapter, empathy in another, then disappointment and disgust, with a steady supply of “Who is this guy?” We get the sense even Anne didn’t understand the man she was living with, and this suspicion is confirmed when Lindbergh’s stunning secret life is revealed in the book’s final section. So many kids (and former kids) think of history as nothing more than names and dates to regurgitate on a test paper, then forget. Books like this one change the game, giving young readers a story to dive into, to wrestle with, quite possibly to shout at in fury. And that’s a beautiful thing.",The New York Times

2020,"Under Armour, Already Struggling, Says 2020 Will Be Rocky","The company said that revenues were likely to grow at a low single-digit rate, and that further declines in North America were expected. For the sportswear giant Under Armour, 2020 is off to a rocky start. Shares in the company tumbled on Tuesday after it released disappointing earnings for 2019 and warned that this year may not be much better. The company warned that overall revenues were likely to grow at a low single-digit rate in 2020, and that it expected further declines in North America, its biggest market. It also said its revenues in the first quarter — and potentially beyond — would take a hit of $50 million to $60 million because of the coronavirus outbreak in China. Under Armour, which has already undergone waves of restructuring over the last two years to improve its profitability, also announced yet another potential plan that could result in a charge of $425 million. Roughly half of that would be related to giving up plans to open a flagship store in New York. (In the summer of 2016, Under Armour signed a lease to take over a 53,000-square-foot store on Fifth Avenue that was the former flagship for the toy store F.A.O. Schwarz.) The weak earnings reflect the company’s continued struggles to attract consumers to its once-thriving brand. For 2019, the company’s revenues grew only 1 percent, to $5.3 billion. Camilla Yanushevsky, an analyst at CFRA Research, called the North American outlook “abysmal” in a note to investors. She noted that Under Armour had “largely missed out in the athleisure trend and continues to lose share to the likes of Nike and Lululemon.” Despite that criticism, Under Armour executives reiterated in a call with Wall Street analysts that the company remained focused on athletic-performance gear. “There are those who believe our focus on athletic performance may currently be too narrow,” said Patrik Frisk, Under Armour’s chief executive. “We disagree. We see an even greater opportunity to drive harder towards our vision and mission. Of course, being in athletic performance requires us to make innovative, highly functional products, but it must also be great looking and on trend.” In trading on Tuesday, the company’s stock slumped nearly 19 percent to close at $16.59, well off its high of more than $50 in 2015 amid 26 consecutive quarters of 20 percent or greater year-over-year revenue growth. Various cost-cutting and restructuring moves over the last two years have improved profit margins at the company, which has also gained some control over issues involving inventory and expenses. There has also been change in the company’s leadership. Last month, Kevin Plank, who founded Under Armour, stepped down as chief executive. Mr. Plank now holds the titles of executive chairman and brand chief, and Mr. Frisk reports directly to him. Under Armour continues to fall short, however, in attracting consumers to its shoes and apparel. That is particularly true in North America, where revenues slipped 2 percent last year to $3.7 billion. The Asia-Pacific region made up about 12 percent of Under Armour’s total sales in 2019 and has been one of its faster-growing markets. “Given the significant level of uncertainty with this dynamic and evolving situation, full-year results could be further materially impacted,” the company said. Mr. Frisk said Under Armour, like other corporations, was monitoring the situation in China, which could affect its ability to obtain materials like trim and fabric from the region. “With respect to factories, we are continuing to see closures and changing timelines of when they might reopen and trying to assess what it means for production fulfillment, capacity and the prioritization of which products to make,” Mr. Frisk added.",The New York Times
2020,"Under O’Brien, N.S.C. Carries Out Trump’s Policy, but Doesn’t Develop It","WASHINGTON — When President Trump’s national security adviser, Robert C. O’Brien, convenes meetings with top National Security Council officials at the White House, he sometimes opens by distributing printouts of Mr. Trump’s latest tweets on the subject at hand. The gesture amounts to an implicit challenge for those present. Their job is to find ways of justifying, enacting or explaining Mr. Trump’s policy, not to advise the president on what it should be. That is the reverse of what the National Security Council was created to do at the Cold War’s dawn — to inform and advise the president on national security decisions. But under Mr. O’Brien, the White House’s hostage negotiator when Mr. Trump chose him to succeed John R. Bolton in September, that dynamic has often been turned on its head. Mr. O’Brien, a dapper Los Angeles lawyer, convenes more regular and inclusive council meetings than Mr. Bolton. But developing policy is not really Mr. O’Brien’s mission. In the fourth year of his presidency and in his fourth national security adviser, Mr. Trump has finally gotten what he wants — a loyalist who enables his ideas instead of challenging them. Two of Mr. O’Brien’s predecessors, Mr. Bolton and the retired Lt. Gen H.R. McMaster, had strong policy views informed by deep military or diplomatic experience that differed from Mr. Trump’s in basic ways, and each sought to steer his policies. Mr. O’Brien does not, and the limited role he plays reflects a broader change in the president’s national security team. Mr. Trump’s original team included independent figures like Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson and the director of national intelligence, Dan Coats, who were considered “the adults” who could counter the president’s impulsive tendencies. They have been replaced by relatively little known loyalists anxious to carry out Mr. Trump’s will and eager to embrace his zeal in rooting out members of the so-called deep state involved in his impeachment or seen as dissidents. In the president’s most recent personnel move, he replaced Joseph Maguire, the acting director of national intelligence, with Richard Grenell, an outspoken Trump supporter serving as ambassador to Germany who has no background in intelligence. At the National Security Council, a particular target was Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman, a Ukraine expert who provided crucial testimony to support the impeachment of Mr. Trump, and was fired along with his twin brother, also an Army officer. Asked about their dismissals during an appearance last week at the Atlantic Council, a Washington think tank, the usually voluble Mr. O’Brien was curt. “Their services were no longer needed,” he said. “We are not a country where a bunch of lieutenant colonels can get together and decide what the policy is of the United States. We are not a banana republic.” In the years since the National Security Council was started by President Harry S. Truman in 1947, its influence has fluctuated, depending on the president, the national security adviser and the relative power of the cabinet members and agency chiefs the national security adviser must coordinate. Mr. O’Brien has said he is rebuilding an apolitical National Security Council, following the model of Brent Scowcroft, the national security adviser to Presidents Gerald Ford and George Bush, who was famed for acting as a neutral arbiter between the competing views of the Pentagon, the State Department, the intelligence agencies and the Treasury. But virtually every national security adviser says they emulate Mr. Scowcroft. In reality, they selectively choose the elements of his style they admire. And many national security veterans see in Mr. O’Brien’s approach an intentional weakening of the council. By the end of this month, Mr. O’Brien will have completed what he calls a streamlining of the National Security Council, chopping the council’s staff from 174 policy positions in October to fewer than 115. The reductions have focused on the dozens of career officials who are detailed to the council from other federal departments and agencies, including the C.I.A., the Pentagon and the State Department. Former officials say the practice of loaning personnel, typically for terms of about 12 to 18 months, has blossomed over the years in part because it allows the White House to employ people without tapping its own budget. It also means the White House is populated by career officials whose policy views do not necessarily reflect those of the president but which they are expected to mirror. Current and former Trump administration officials blame the detailees for not only slow-walking the enactment of some of Mr. Trump’s decisions with which they disagree, but also for undermining him with leaks to the news media. Reflecting widespread complaints among Trump allies, the Fox Business Network host Lou Dobbs, whose program Mr. Trump regularly watches, singled out the National Security Council as a hotbed of dissent during an interview last week with Mr. O’Brien. “Given what we’ve witnessed in the three years, a little over three years, of this administration, I couldn’t blame the president if he said, ‘Keep them 50 blocks away,’” Mr. Dobbs said. “The vast number of those leaks that have been so harmful to the president and to the administration have come from the National Security Council. Hopefully that’s all changed as a result of your good efforts.” Mr. O’Brien smiled and nodded in response. Mr. O’Brien often notes that both Democrats and Republicans have long said the council, whose staff peaked at 236 policy staff members during the Obama era, had grown unwieldy, prone to micromanagement and in need of culling. “One thing a polarized Washington has been able to agree on is that the N.S.C. got too big,” said John Gans, who has worked at the Pentagon and is the author of a book on the National Security Council. But shrinking the size of the National Security Council may actually hurt the president’s agenda since it holds departments and agencies accountable for carrying it out, according to Nadia Schadlow, who served as Mr. McMaster’s deputy and was the principal author of Mr. Trump’s national security strategy. “I understand why this is happening,” Ms. Schadlow said. “But at some point, it could hurt the implementation of the president’s policies.” As Mr. O’Brien has whittled down the council he manages, declaring it was all about efficiency, the president has made little effort to disguise his appetite for purging his own government. “DRAIN THE SWAMP!” he tweeted last week, adding: “We want bad people out of our government.” The same day, Mr. Trump said in a radio interview that he may drastically limit how many national security officials can listen in on his calls with foreign leaders, breaking from decades of White House procedure. “I may end the practice entirely,” he said. Such commentary “creates the clear impression that this is about retribution, not reform,” said Senator Christopher S. Murphy, a Democratic member of the Foreign Relations Committee. But Mr. Murphy questioned how much the National Security Council’s structure really matters under a president who often rejects professional advice in making impulsive policy decisions. “It’s not terribly clear what the N.S.C. has been doing for the last three years,” he said. “The N.S.C.’s function now seems to be war-gaming for potential presidential tweets instead of developing policy recommendations for presidential decision-making.” Mr. Trump is unlikely to mind that. After more than three years in office, he feels more confident than ever in his management of national security, aides say, especially after some of his major decisions — including the killing of the Iranian commander Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani — failed to elicit the disastrous consequences many experts predicted. Mr. O’Brien’s willingness to trim the National Security Council, Mr. Gans said, “says something about Trump’s Washington.” “The national security adviser should have the strongest staff possible,” he continued. “But it seems like Robert O’Brien is focused more on that audience of one — and making sure that Donald Trump is happy.” The case of China may be the most vivid example of the council’s diminishment. In past administrations, the national security adviser has been central to the complex balancing of security and economic issues the making of China policy requires. But Mr. O’Brien has been a minor player in the administration’s open warfare on China policy. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper have publicly called for a broad containment policy that would counter Beijing militarily and cripple key Chinese companies like Huawei, the telecommunications giant. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has taken the opposite view, working to mitigate the confrontation. And much of the White House policymaking has been overseen by Larry Kudlow, a key economic adviser loath to rattle markets. Normally, the National Security Council would play a role in settling this kind of dispute. But when Mr. Trump tweeted on Tuesday against heavy restrictions on technology sales to China — days after Mr. Esper gave a fiery speech calling for just that — a White House meeting next week on the subject was abruptly postponed. Not only is the policy in some chaos, it is unclear who is supposed to resolve it. Mr. Trump’s Syria policy is another case in point. When the president pledged in December 2018 to pull out of Syria, stunning top officials, Mr. Bolton worked to mitigate the decision, adding public conditions to the withdrawal that Mr. Trump had not mentioned. But in October, when Mr. Trump abruptly pulled forces out of the way of a Turkish invasion of northeastern Syria, he did so with no National Security Council policy process — and no serious weighing of the costs to U.S. influence. Mr. O’Brien, still new to the job, offered no objections, officials say. Mr. O’Brien held midlevel government posts, including a stint as a deputy to Mr. Bolton when he was ambassador to the United Nations before serving as Mr. Trump’s chief hostage negotiator. He impressed the president in that job by securing the release of several Americans imprisoned by foreign governments and armed groups. Mr. Trump views the release of detained Americans as tactical “wins” that even his critics are reluctant to question, and Mr. O’Brien continues to pursue those cases in his new job. Some White House aides joke that his experience navigating fraught situations is ideal preparation for serving Mr. Trump. The president, for his part, appreciates Mr. O’Brien’s quiet manner and tailored suits after his complaints about the gruff personalities and unstylish appearances of Mr. McMaster and Mr. Bolton, whose bushy mustache he often privately mocked. Mr. O’Brien also gets along better than his predecessors did with Mr. Pompeo, who feuded with Mr. Bolton, and with Mr. Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who often gives foreign policy advice. And he has been friends with Mr. Grenell, the latest addition to the national security team, for over a decade. He speaks with the president several times a day, often first thing in the morning and sometimes in the White House’s private residence before Mr. Trump descends to the Oval Office. But he has no prior ties to Mr. Trump or previously known affinity for the president’s “America First” style of nationalism. A book of essays he published in 2016 channeled mainstream conservative views. Some national security professionals who have worked with or advised Mr. O’Brien say that it is a mistake to underestimate him and that he has a deft managerial touch that reflects his tenure leading dozens of lawyers in the Los Angeles office of Arent Fox, the Washington law firm. Others complain that he lacks fluency in policy details and delegates heavy lifting to his chief deputy, Matthew Pottinger, a former Wall Street Journal reporter and Marine who is among a handful of White House aides to survive all three years of Mr. Trump’s presidency. In a television interview in late December, Mr. O’Brien incorrectly referred to the North Korean ruler, Kim Jong-un, swapping the leader’s surname for his given one. It was, his critics said, not a mistake that a more experienced official would have made. Julian E. Barnes, Adam Goldman, Katie Rogers and Edward Wong contributed reporting.",The New York Times
2020,"Under Pressure From Trump, Extraditions to U.S. From Mexico Soar","The increased pace follows a threat by President Trump to designate drug traffickers as terrorists and amid two visits by his attorney general to Mexico to push for more cooperation. MEXICO CITY — The Mexican government is on track to dramatically increase the number of extraditions of criminal suspects to the United States this year, as the Trump administration has pressured Mexico to step up its fight against organized crime. With the first two months of this year not yet over, the government already has extradited at least 30 suspects to the United States, a sharp acceleration of extraditions from the more leisurely pace of recent years. In all of 2019, 58 suspects were extradited to the United States, according to Mexico’s attorney general’s office, with 69 sent in 2018, and 57 in 2017. The increased number of extraditions in the early months of 2020 comes as President Andrés Manuel López Obrador of Mexico, who took office in December 2018, has struggled to show gains in his government’s effort to rein in organized crime groups and the violence they sow. “The security of the region is a shared responsibility,” Mexico’s foreign ministry said in a statement late Monday. “All of Mexico’s actions on security, including extraditions, comply with our current legal framework and respond to the national interest and the commitment to provide security for Mexicans.” Last year, Mexico recorded more than 34,500 murders, the highest tally since the government started keeping such data in the late 1990s. Corruption remains rampant and the rule of law weak. Criminals operate with near-total impunity despite a major overhaul of the judicial system. Several recent and spectacular acts of violence have highlighted the gravity of the nation’s security situation, have cost the López Obrador administration public support and have fed concern among American officials. In October, gunmen working for the Sinaloa Cartel paralyzed Culiacán, a major Mexican city, forcing the government to release the captured son of the imprisoned drug trafficking kingpin Joaquín Guzmán Loera, better known as El Chapo. The next month, three women and six of their children, all dual citizens of the United States and Mexico, were murdered in an ambush in northern Mexico by suspected members of a criminal group that holds sway over swaths of the northern border region. After that ambush, Mr. Trump said on Twitter that the time had come “for Mexico, with the help of the United States, to wage WAR on the drug cartels and wipe them off the face of the earth.” Several weeks later, Mr. Trump said he planned to designate Mexican drug trafficking groups as foreign terrorist organizations because of the high number of Americans killed by their activities. Mr. Trump eventually backed off the threat after vehement pushback from Mexican officials who suggested that the designation could challenge their nation’s sovereignty and jeopardize bilateral relations. Analysts interpreted Mr. Trump’s designation threat as a way to force the Mexican government to strengthen its fight against criminal groups and the corruption that enables them. Since making the threat, Mr. Trump has twice sent the attorney general, William P. Barr, to Mexico City for bilateral meetings with the Mexican authorities. In early December, Mr. Barr met with Mr. López Obrador, Alejandro Gertz Manero, Mexico’s attorney general, and other officials to discuss gang violence, immigration corruption and the trafficking of drugs, weapons and migrants. They vowed to work more closely to prosecute members of the transnational gangs that control Mexico’s illegal drug trade. Mr. Barr was back in Mexico City last month, focusing his meetings on bilateral efforts to fight criminal organizations as well as drug and arms trafficking. Mexico appeared to speed up extraditions soon after Mr. Barr’s December visit. In the last two weeks of 2019, eight suspects were sent to face charges, followed by 30 more during the first eight weeks of 2020, according to the office of Mexico’s attorney general. American officials have grown particularly concerned with the fact that much of the illegal methamphetamine consumed in the United States is manufactured in Mexico and smuggled across the border. The Drug Enforcement Administration has increased efforts to target Mexican cartels that control major drug trafficking networks and flood the United States with meth along with other drugs. Alejandro Hope, a security analyst based in Mexico City, said fentanyl, a powerful synthetic opiate, was also a growing matter of concern in United States-Mexico relations. The authorities have recently discovered large fentanyl labs in Mexico, possibly alarming American officials that Mexico could soon replace China as a source of illegally manufactured fentanyl, Mr. Hope said. “My guess is that they’re very worried about fentanyl, and fentanyl is driving the increasing pressure,” he said. American governments, concerned about the weaknesses of the Mexican justice system, have often pressed for the extradition of criminal suspects. Mexican officials have at times been reluctant to comply with these requests, citing national sovereignty or the desire to see the suspect prosecuted and imprisoned in Mexico. After Mr. Guzmán, the former head of the Sinaloa Cartel, was captured following his escape from a maximum-security prison, Mexico’s then-attorney general, Jesús Murillo Karam, suggested he would resist an American request for extradition. “El Chapo must stay here to complete his sentence, and then I will extradite him,” he told The Associated Press in 2015. “So, about 300 or 400 years later — it will be a while.” Mr. Murillo Karam also sought to dispel concerns that Mr. Guzmán might escape a second time. That risk, he said, “does not exist.” But later that year, Mr. Guzmán escaped again, through a tunnel that led from his prison cell to freedom. The Sinaloa cartel boss was eventually recaptured and extradited to the United States where he was sentenced to life in prison. Arturo Sarukhán, a former Mexican ambassador to Washington under President Felipe Calderón, said the Mexican government’s use of extradition has varied from administration to administration. During his years as ambassador, he recalled, “there was a clear determination that extradition was a key component of our strategy to confront organized crime.” In Mexico’s weak penitentiary system, Mr. Sarukhán said, criminal leaders were still able to continue running their organizations from behind bars. The Calderón administration decided to employ extradition “very muscularly” as a means of degrading the kingpins’ command and control capabilities. Last week, in one of the latest extraditions, the Mexican government sent Rubén Oseguera, the son of one of the nation’s most powerful drug lords, to the United States to face drug-trafficking and firearms charges. American officials say that until his capture in 2015, Mr. Oseguera was the second-in-command of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, which is led by his father, Nemesio Oseguera, and is considered Mexico’s most violent criminal group.

2020,Under the Stars with Shiraz and Scorpions,"Mini-Vows Simone Rachel Press and Michael Richard Foy met at the end of December 2016 after joining a tour group at a hostel in the remote town of Alice Springs in Australia’s Northern Territory. “They had a massive rainstorm,” said Mr. Foy, who had locked eyes with Ms. Press during the orientation for a rigorous 10-day tour through the Australian Outback to Melbourne. “They get that amount of rain once every 20 years,” he said, adding that waterfalls were rolling off Uluru, the massive sandstone rock formation. While the group of 25 were stuck at the hostel an extra day, they had dinner at a local pub where Ms. Press offered Mr. Foy her leftover chicken Parmesan. “Once she gave me her chicken parm,” said Mr. Foy, who was from Auckland, New Zealand, he recalled thinking ‘I’ll be nice to her.’’’ On the road, where daily temperature averaged 105 degrees, he gave her a hand with her bags and they became bus buddies. “He’s very charming, calming and confident,” said Ms. Press, who grew up in Brooklyn, and in recent years lived in Santa Monica, Calif. During the trip they rode a camel together, ate kangaroo burgers and stayed at a hotel in the underground opal mining town of Coober Pedy. “I thought she was a go-getter and knew what she wanted, he said. “Not precious.” Ms. Press’s sense of adventure reached its limit in the desert, where they had enjoyed beer and Shiraz under the stars, and had their first kiss. “There was an eight-inch poisonous spider and a ton of creepy crawlies everywhere,” she said, and after a scorpion jumped out of a woman’s swag, a canvas sleeping compartment, she swiftly joined Mr. Foy in his swag. As skeptical as they both were about anyone pairing off in the group, Ms. Press said they became a “tour couple,” and they kept in touch after the trip. They soon visited each other in Santa Monica and Auckland, and later in 2017 Ms. Press showed up for a more extended stay with a one-way ticket and four suitcases. A few months later they got an apartment in Ponsonby, New Zealand. After two years, she was ready to go home to friends and family and to her dachshund, Ellie, but before she did, Mr. Foy engineered a proposal in July 2019 at the CRC Speedshow Car Expo in New Zealand, where they each accompanied a racing professional — she in a Toyota Starlet and he in a Nissan March — in a racing and stunt demonstration. They then got out of their cars for an interview by the M.C. Their drivers got back into their cars, but Mr. Foy’s driver, Paul Radisich, a retired popular racer, got out of his car again. “Hey mate,’’ Mr. Foy recalled him saying, as he held out a box. “You forgot this.’’ After Mr. Foy got down on one knee on the track, Ms. Press said yes to the rousing cheers and applause of spectators. “My life has been a complete and utter adventure,” she said, and on Feb. 1 Mr. Foy relocated to Santa Monica. ■ The couple were married Feb. 14 by a clerk at the Santa Barbara County Courthouse in California. A small gathering enjoyed sparkling New Zealand wine and a three-tier pink rose cake with matching flowers made by Jordan Rondel, who owns the Caker, a popular bakery in Auckland. ■ Three of Mr. Foy’s cousins traveled from New Zealand for the wedding. His older brother, Phillip, surprised him and was also in attendance. ■ Ms. Press, 33, is the recruiting lead at Whip Media Group in Santa Monica, Calif. She graduated from Tufts University. She is the daughter of Risë Zucker Press and Leonard S. Press of Cherry Valley, N.Y. ■ Mr. Foy, also 33, until January was a project engineer at JMP Engineering, a mechanical engineering firm in Auckland. He graduated from the Manukau Institute of Technology. He is a son of Margaret Foy and Ernest Foy of Auckland, who own a tomato farm on the outskirts of the city.",The New York Times
2020,Solano County Residents Near Mystery Coronavirus Case Worry and Wonder,"Officials in California, Oregon and Washington State said on Friday that people had tested positive for the coronavirus without a known explanation for how they became ill. Get an informed guide to the global outbreak with our daily Coronavirus
 newsletter.
 SEATTLE — Troubling new signs that the coronavirus is spreading in the United States emerged on Friday, as cases not explained by overseas travel or contact with a person known to be infected were reported in California, Oregon and Washington State. Officials from the three states announced that their testing had found new cases: a high school student from north of Seattle; an employee of an elementary school in Oregon, near Portland; and a woman in Santa Clara County, Calif., in the heart of Silicon Valley. Sixty-five cases of the virus have been reported in the United States, but until this week, all of the cases could be explained by overseas travel or contact with someone who had been ill. The three new cases on Friday, and a case earlier in the week, in California, were the first in the United States where the cause was mysterious and unknown — a sign, experts warned, that the virus, which has killed more than 2,800 people worldwide and sickened tens of thousands of others, might now be spreading in this country. “If we were worried yesterday, we are even more worried today,” said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. “Now we have to ask: How widely, really widely, is this virus out there?” As word emerged of the unexplained cases, local officials scrambled to trace everyone who had come in contact with those who were ill. California health officials said they were increasing testing. And in Washington State, officials suggested that people needed to prepare for the possibility of schools closing and businesses keeping workers home. “We’re going to be increasingly recommending that people try and avoid crowds and close contact with other people,” Dr. Jeff Duchin, health officer for Public Health Seattle & King County, said. “We may get to a point where we want to recommend canceling large public gatherings — social events, sporting events, entertainment — until we get over a hump of what might be a large outbreak.” In some of the new cases, officials described situations where those who were ill may have had contact with many people in recent days. The student in Washington State who tested positive for coronavirus, according to state officials, had visited two health clinics and gone to his school in Snohomish County, Henry M. Jackson High School, on Friday before the diagnosis, although he did not attend classes. Dr. Chris Spitters, health officer of the Snohomish Health District, said he suspected that the teenager probably got sick from someone with a mild form of the illness who did not seek care. “I think we’re going to find as time goes on that there’s more of that,” Dr. Spitters said. In Oregon, a state that had not reported any previous cases of coronavirus, officials said an employee of Forest Hills Elementary School in Lake Oswego appeared to have contracted the virus more than a week ago. Updated Feb. 29, 2020 Oregon health officials said their public health laboratory, which began testing samples on Friday, had detected the positive case; the sample will also be tested at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for confirmation, as will the new cases from Washington and California. In California, a woman from Santa Clara County with chronic health conditions who was hospitalized for a respiratory illness was reported on Friday to have tested positive for infection with the virus. Two days earlier, officials in Solano County, Calif., 90 minutes from Santa Clara County, had announced the first case in the nation with no clear ties to any previous case or overseas travel. In counties in and around each of the new type of cases, officials were bracing for what it might mean for everyday life. Some school districts were adding cleaning staff, scrubbing buildings and preparing for absences from school. Emergency medical officials were weighing new protocols. And some businesses were contemplating what working from home might mean for their operations. One of the cases appeared in Santa Clara County, where Google and Apple have their headquarters and which also includes San Jose, the 10th-largest city in the nation. “This has become very real for everyone in our community,” Sam Liccardo, the mayor of San Jose, said on Friday evening as he prepared to meet with city staff about the implications. “There’s certainly a lot of concern and the concern is justified.” Emergency medical workers in San Jose who answer calls from people with coronavirus-like symptoms will now be instructed to wear protective clothing, he said. “We are going to need to take every reasonable precaution without resorting to panic or finger-pointing.” For weeks, local and state health departments across the country have been stretched thin by the coronavirus outbreak, and the cases of unknown origin signaled a new front in their efforts. “Most public health departments can respond to one case or two cases,” Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, a public health professor at Johns Hopkins, said. “But it’s going to be many more than that.” On Friday, California health officials said they had greatly expanded their ability to test for the virus, and experts said the public health response in the affected counties should include examining specimens of people who may have been hospitalized for or killed by a respiratory illness in recent weeks. “This case does signal to us that it’s now time to shift how we respond to the novel coronavirus,” Dr. Sara Cody, the public health director for Santa Clara County, said. “Now we need to add other public health tools to the mix,” including looking systematically for the disease to understand its scope and magnitude, she said. In Solano County, where the first U.S. case of unexplained origin was announced earlier in the week, local officials have fielded calls from scores of concerned residents. “I’m middling alarmed,” said Rick Lodwick, as he tossed a jumbo pack of sanitizing wipes into the back of his car in the parking of a big box store in Vacaville. “When I heard it was here, I thought, ‘We’re going to have trouble,’” Mr. Lodwick said. Solano County, northeast of San Francisco, is a place of cattle ranches, biotechnology research facilities, a military base and vineyards. An investigation was started into all contacts the sick woman from the county might have had with friends, neighbors and medical workers. “People are concerned and they’re paying attention,” said Jeremy Craig, the city manager of Vacaville. “But I don’t think there’s a panic.” Restaurants were full on Friday, the manager of a movie theater said there had been no decline in ticket sales, and it was very rare to see someone wearing a mask. Dr. Bela T. Matyas, the public health officer in Solano County, said officials had begun monitoring dozens of people with whom the woman who fell ill there had interacted in recent weeks — including relatives, co-workers and others she might have had contact with through her job — and had asked them to quarantine themselves at home. At least 124 nurses and other health care workers were under self-quarantine, a nurses’ union reported. The woman was later taken by ambulance to the University of California, Davis Medical Center in Sacramento. At that hospital in recent days, some workers seemed deeply concerned about possible exposure. “I’m worried how this will affect my baby,” said Vickie Poncalo, a cashier at the hospital’s cafe who is seven months pregnant. “Should we be wearing a mask and worrying that people are walking around here?” she asked. “Should I even be here?” Mike Baker reported from Seattle, Thomas Fuller from Vacaville, and Sheri Fink and Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs from New York.

2020,Unions Push F.T.C. to Study if Amazon Warps the Economy,"So far, the Everything Store has dodged some of the scrutiny dogging Google and Facebook. SEATTLE — The International Brotherhood of Teamsters, with its 1.4 million truck drivers, warehouse workers and other transportation laborers, does not represent any Amazon workers, nor is it organizing them. But the union keeps butting into the e-commerce giant, which ships billions of packages a year. The Teamsters joined several other major labor unions in filing a petition Thursday asking the Federal Trade Commission to open a wide-ranging study into Amazon’s business practices. The unions, which represent more than five million American workers, hope to sic the antitrust regulator on a company increasingly reaching into the industries they represent. “We wanted to demonstrate that there is a real desire to see them take this on,” said Michael Zucker, director of Change to Win, a federation of labor unions that led the effort. The petition asks the F.T.C. to use its broad powers to gather nonpublic information about a company’s or industry’s effects on commerce. In a 28-page document with 149 footnotes, the unions lay out areas they think the F.T.C. should explore, including whether Amazon requires companies to use more of its services to succeed on its marketplace. The petition, which took several months to prepare, is a greatest hits of concerns reported in the press, but the unions said it should just be a starting point. “You could just say to the F.T.C., ‘Look into this company,’” Mr. Zucker said. “The reason why we laid out a detailed case for why was because we were trying to convince the F.T.C. in the request that they look at the company in all of its manifestations and all of its systems.” Amazon said it had created more than 500,000 jobs domestically for people with various education levels, training and skills. In an Op-Ed published in The New York Times this month, Jay Carney, who runs the company’s communications and policy teams, argued that Amazon used its scale for good. “Because Amazon is a large company with hundreds of thousands of employees, as well as contractual relationships with hundreds of thousands of other businesses of all sizes, what we do can generate positive ripple effects across the country,” he wrote. Mr. Carney said the company’s minimum wage of $15 an hour had pushed other employers to increase pay, and “in keeping with what political leaders say they want to see from companies, Amazon has plowed $270 billion into the domestic economy since 2010.” That sum includes money Amazon has spent on payroll, buildings, equipment and other business investments. Various liberal groups have gone after Amazon for its impact on workers, competition and communities around the country. Last year, many of the groups formed a coalition called Athena to coordinate their criticism of the company. Competitors like Walmart have funded research into negative impacts of Amazon. The company has also become a target for elected officials, including candidates vying to be the Democratic nominee for president. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont has pressured it over the wages and working conditions for its warehouse employees. Senator Elizabeth Warren has said it should be broken up. And former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. said last year that he had “nothing against Amazon, but no company pulling in billions of dollars of profits should pay a lower tax rate than firefighters and teachers.” Amazon has yet to disclose receiving requests for information from antitrust investigators at the Justice Department or F.T.C., and it has not been publicly targeted by state attorneys general, unlike Google and Facebook. The company has continued its push into even faster deliveries and recently announced it was building a warehouse dedicated to the kind of house-brand products that critics say push smaller competitors out of the market. While Amazon’s workers are not unionized, those at some suppliers and competitors are, and they feel pressure to adapt to Amazon’s business. For the Teamsters, Amazon is a major customer of the transportation companies where they work, and the company is building its own delivery network through a series of small contractors and gig-economy drivers, who aren’t unionized. “We have watched Amazon’s logistics infrastructure grow pretty exponentially over the past few years,” said Iain Gold, a director with the Teamsters. “That has a direct impact when we are at the bargaining table with UPS or DHL or other companies.” In their 2018 contract negotiations, UPS and the Teamsters agreed to create a new job type, with lower pay, to service demand for weekend e-commerce deliveries, a trade-off that some union members resisted. In their petition, the unions ask the F.T.C. to study whether Amazon forces its third-party merchants to buy its delivery fulfillment services if they want to rank high and succeed on the site, a move that they say could harm competing shipping and logistics providers. Amazon said its fulfillment services were optional, but many sellers loved them “because it gives them peace of mind knowing that shipping logistics and customer service are taken care of 24-7, year-round,” a spokesman, Jack Evans, said in a statement. A spokeswoman for the F.T.C., Betsy Lordan, said the agency had received the labor groups’ petition. In 2000, the Communications Workers of America tried to organize Amazon’s customer service workers, as an outgrowth of its work with the telecom industry. The company pushed back, and the unionization effort failed. The union has since followed how the company affects its industries. It represents workers in AT&T’s retail stores, which compete with Amazon for phone sales, for example, and the union in January announced plans to organize tech workers, starting with people in the gaming industry. Tom Smith, head organizer at the communication workers’ union, said it turned to the F.T.C. because much about Amazon’s business is still a mystery, even to a union that has followed it for two decades. “We see a company that we know very little about, that is very secretive, that there are just tons of unknowns,” Mr. Smith said. Mr. Smith declined to comment on whether his union was trying to organize Amazon’s tech workers. (The NewsGuild, which represents journalists at The New York Times, is part of the C.W.A.) The United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, which represents grocery workers at companies like Kroger and Safeway, began closely tracking Amazon after it bought Whole Foods for more than $13 billion in 2017. The move catapulted Amazon from the 17th-largest grocer in the country to the sixth largest, according to the investment bank Cowen. The grocery workers’ union was particularly interested in a question the petition asks the F.T.C. to study: whether Amazon depresses wages in areas where it is a major employer. The petition estimated that half of all warehouse workers in Mercer County, N.J., were employed by Amazon. Federal data shows that warehouse wages in the county have fallen 18 percent since 2014, when Amazon opened its largest fulfillment center in the state there, according to the petition. Mr. Evans said that Whole Foods represented just 4 percent of grocery sales domestically, and that Walmart and Kroger sell far more. “This competition ultimately leads to innovation for consumers, as you can see across the grocery industry right now,” he said. The Service Employees International Union, with two million members in health care, the public sector and other industries, also joined the petition. The labor groups are making a novel use of the F.T.C.’s right to conduct research into how a market or industry works, using its legal authority to compel companies to provide private information. The results of these studies can influence policy changes at the agency or inform its efforts to police an industry. In the past, these studies have been used to look at other industries, as varied as data brokers and pharmaceuticals. One study into hospital mergers bolstered the agency’s ability to successfully challenge new deals, while others have led to legislative changes. This year, the agency said it would research smaller acquisitions by major tech companies, including Amazon. It is far less common for the agency to do what the unions are requesting: begin an inquiry explicitly into a single company. “Generally, if you want to investigate a company you open up an investigation and you investigate them using the normal enforcement authority,” said Michael Kades, the director of markets and competition policy at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth and a former F.T.C. lawyer. While these types of studies are separate from the agency’s enforcement investigations into specific alleged legal violations, information they unearth can be used to advance cases against the companies in question. Tim Wu, a professor at Columbia Law School and an advocate for greater antitrust enforcement, said the approach made sense because the F.T.C. has struggled to find a single route into an investigation of Amazon — where low consumer prices provide a shield against antitrust action. (Mr. Wu is on the advisory board of the Open Markets Institute, an influential group that has called for the breakup of Amazon. He is also a New York Times contributing opinion writer.) “I think the unions here are thinking, ‘There’s a lot of concerns raised by Amazon and the F.T.C. kind of has a blind spot,’” said Mr. Wu, who reviewed a draft of the groups’ petition. Karen Weise reported from Seattle, and David McCabe from Washington.",The New York Times
2020,Unit 5: Argumentative Writing,"Writing curriculum Writing prompts, lesson plans, webinars, mentor texts and a culminating contest, all to inspire your students to tell us what matters to them. Welcome to our fifth writing unit of the school year. Below you will find a detailed description of each element, which you can customize to make your own unit. To learn more, visit our writing curriculum overview. Right now, the concept of “student voice” is having a moment. Thanks to the work of people like Malala Yousafzai and Greta Thunberg, the Parkland students and the teenagers in the streets of Hong Kong, the power young people can wield when they stand up for a cause is clear. And the fact that many members of Gen Z, the most ethnically and racially diverse generation the United States has ever seen, will vote for the first time this year, makes those voices even more critical. As the Times video above puts it: “We wanted to know what young Americans think. After all, they’ll get to decide the direction of this country.” On our site, we’ve been offering teenagers ways to tell the world what they think for over 20 years. Our student writing prompt forums encourage them to weigh in on current events and issues daily, while our Student Editorial Contest has offered an annual outlet since 2014 for formalizing those opinions into evidence-based essays. Now we’re bringing together all the resources we’ve developed along the way to help students figure out what they want to say, and how to say it effectively. Here is what this unit offers, but we would love to hear from both teachers and students if there is more we could include. Let us know in the comments, or by writing to LNFeedback@nytimes.com. How young is too young to use social media? Should students get mental health days off from school? Is $1 billion too much money for any one person to have? These are the kinds of questions we ask every day on our site. In 2017 we published a list of 401 Prompts for Argumentative Writing. This year, we’ve followed it up with 130 more, all drawn from our daily Student Opinion column. Teachers tell us their students love looking at these lists, both to inspire their own writing and to find links to reliable sources about the issues that intrigue them. In fact, every year we get many contest submissions that grow directly out of these questions. Several, like this one, have even gone on to win. But even if you’re not participating in our contest, you might use these prompts to invite the kind of casual, low-stakes writing that can help your students build skills — in developing their voices, making claims and backing them up with solid reasoning and evidence. And, if your students respond to our most recent prompts by posting comments on our site, they can also practice making arguments for an authentic audience of fellow students from around the world. Each week we choose our favorites to honor in our Current Events Conversation column. Over the years, we’ve published quite a few lesson plans to support our Editorial Contest — so many, in fact, that we finally rounded them all up into one easy list. In “10 Ways to Teach Argument-Writing With The New York Times,” you’ll find resources for … Exploring the role of a newspaper opinion section Understanding the difference between fact and opinion Analyzing the use of rhetorical strategies like ethos, pathos and logos Working with claims, evidence and counterarguments Helping students discover the issues that matter to them Breaking out of the “echo chamber” when researching hot-button issues Experimenting with visual argument-making You probably already know that you can find arguments to admire — and “writer’s moves” to emulate — all over the Times Opinion section. But have you thought about using the work of our previous Student Editorial Contest winners as mentor texts too? Here are ways to use both: Learn from the Op-Ed columnist Nicholas Kristof’s writing process: Our latest edition of our “Annotated by the Author” Mentor Text series is by Mr. Kristof. See what he has to say about the writing challenges he faced in a recent column and how he did the kinds of things students will have to do, too, from fact-checking to fixing grammar errors to balancing storytelling with making a larger point. Get to know one writer’s rhetorical style: Many teachers use an “adopt a columnist” method, inviting students to focus on the work of one of the 16 Times Op-Ed writers — Charles M. Blow, Jamelle Bouie, David Brooks, Frank Bruni, Roger Cohen, Gail Collins, Ross Douthat, Maureen Dowd, Thomas L. Friedman, Michelle Goldberg, Nicholas Kristof, Paul Krugman, David Leonhardt, Farhad Manjoo, Jennifer Senior and Bret Stephens — to get to know his or her issues and rhetorical style. In 2019, an English teacher in Connecticut wrote for our site about how he does this exercise, in which his students choose from among columnists at The Times, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal. Use the work of teenage winners to help your students identify “writer’s moves” they can borrow: Teachers have told us there is no better way to prepare students to enter our contest than to have them examine the work of previous winners. On our current site, you can find the essays of the top winners and the runners-up from 2019, 2018, 2017 and 2016. Invite your students to read one and answer the questions we pose in all our Mentor Texts columns: “What do you notice or admire about this piece? What lessons might it have for your writing?” Then, have them borrow one or more of this student’s “writer’s moves” and imitate it in their own work. The video above, “How to Write an Editorial,” is only three minutes long, but in it Andy Rosenthal, the former editor of the Times Opinion page, gives students seven great pieces of advice. You can register now for our Feb. 26 webinar, “Teach Argumentative Writing With Our Student Editorial Contest,” which will be a broad overview of how to use our writing prompts and the work of our student winners to help your own students find topics they care about, and craft solid arguments around them. Both students and teachers are welcome to watch our popular on-demand 2017 webinar, “Write to Change the World: Crafting Persuasive Pieces With Help From Nicholas Kristof and the Times Op-Ed Page,” which includes a wealth of practical tips from Mr. Kristof, as well as from Kabby Hong, a Wisconsin English teacher who works with this contest annually, and his student, Daina Kalnina, whose 2017 essay was one of our top winners that year. The culmination of this unit? Our Seventh Annual Student Editorial Contest, of course. This year we have both high school and middle school categories, and you can find all the information you need, plus the entry form, here. As always, all student work will be read by our staff, volunteers from the Times Opinion section, and/or by educators from around the country. Winners will have their work published on our site and, perhaps, in the print New York Times.",The New York Times

2020,"Uniting Trumpers, Never Trumpers and Democrats With a New Deputy at the State Dept.","Can Stephen E. Biegun calm a simmering revolt at the department? WASHINGTON — When Stephen E. Biegun was sworn in as deputy secretary of state, it was in front of an unusual crowd at the State Department — one that included loyalists to President Trump, but also a mix of Never Trumpers and Democrats. Denis R. McDonough, President Barack Obama’s White House chief of staff and deputy national security adviser, was there that day in December. So was John D. Negroponte, a former director of national intelligence under President George W. Bush who in 2016 refused to vote for Mr. Trump. There were career diplomats, congressional officials and national security experts from both parties who had worked with Mr. Biegun in his various roles in the Senate, the National Security Council and Ford Motor. Which gave rise to some crucial questions: How had Mr. Biegun navigated Trump world to land such a senior position, No. 2 at the State Department? Could he calm a simmering revolt among career State Department employees who have accused Mr. Biegun’s immediate boss, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, of abandoning veteran diplomats and letting the president’s personal political agenda infect foreign policy? More to the point, would he even survive? The job is a risk — Washington is full of people who have catapulted from the Trump administration with reputations diminished — but friends say they are betting on Mr. Biegun. “If anyone can figure out how to navigate it, I think it can be Steve,” said Stephen J. Hadley, Mr. Bush’s second national security adviser. It helps, friends say, that Mr. Biegun has the even temperament of a man who thrives in the background. Never one to upstage the boss, be it the president or secretary of state, Mr. Biegun is mild-mannered and deferential, the anti-Pompeo. While Mr. Pompeo is prone to profanity-laced rants, Mr. Biegun is a Republican of another era who projects calm. “He listens,” said Mr. McDonough, who was Mr. Biegun’s Democratic counterpart when the two men served as the chief foreign policy advisers to their parties’ Senate leaders in the mid-2000s. While Mr. Pompeo has sought to bring back “swagger” to diplomacy, Mr. Biegun is described as a careful negotiator. And while Mr. Pompeo allowed a shadow foreign policy campaign to undermine the United States Embassy in Ukraine, Mr. Biegun has insisted that, in diplomacy, “politics best stop at the water’s edge.” John R. Beyrle, who was one of Mr. Obama’s ambassadors to Moscow, said that Mr. Pompeo most likely viewed Mr. Biegun as “somebody who could help ameliorate that almost toxic situation” at the State Department. “So if there is that vacuum or deficit of trust, which I think there is, Steve is well placed to fill it,” said Mr. Beyrle, who worked with Mr. Biegun on the board of the U.S.-Russia Foundation, which promotes entrepreneurship and education with Moscow. Notably, Mr. Biegun has described Marie L. Yovanovitch, the former American ambassador in Kyiv who was ordered back to Washington and accused of being disloyal to Mr. Trump, as “a very capable foreign service officer.” Since first meeting Ms. Yovanovitch years ago, when they were both working on Russia policy, “my esteem has done nothing but grown for her,” Mr. Biegun told senators at his confirmation hearing in November. Colleagues say the secret to Mr. Biegun’s success, so far, is that he gained the trust of Mr. Trump by enabling the president’s bromance with Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader. Officials said the president twice considered appointing Mr. Biegun as national security adviser, but made him the chief envoy to North Korea instead. In that job Mr. Biegun has tried to move talks between Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim forward when other administration officials wanted to shut them down. Mr. Biegun also declined to join the so-called Never Trumper movement in 2016, putting him among a relatively small number of Republicans with high-level foreign policy experience who were not blacklisted by the White House after Mr. Trump won the presidential election. “He’s friends with Republicans and Democrats, he treats people well, he knows how to operate in Washington, he knows the think tanks, he knows the press, he knows the diplomatic community,” said John B. Bellinger III, the State Department’s former top lawyer who worked with Mr. Biegun on Mr. Bush’s National Security Council. Born in Detroit to a large family — more than 30 relatives attended his December swearing-in ceremony — Mr. Biegun was in high school in Pontiac, Mich., when a history teacher wrote the word “czar” on the chalkboard in the Cyrillic alphabet. He was immediately fascinated and went on to study Russian at the University of Michigan. Mr. Biegun lived in Moscow in the early 1990s, when he worked for the International Republican Institute, which promotes democracy with some funding from the State Department and the United States Agency for International Development. But he mostly developed his national security credentials on Capitol Hill — first as a top Republican staff member on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and later to Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, then the majority leader — and at the White House as a top aide to Condoleezza Rice, who was the first national security adviser in the Bush administration. He traveled to Russia as a vice president at Ford, negotiating new business ventures, but also took time off to briefly advise Sarah Palin, the Republican vice-presidential nominee in 2008. That position, according to colleagues, revealed his ability to maintain patience under pressure and to avoid a condescending tone — even when having to explain the most basic foreign policy axioms to his boss. In his new job, Mr. Biegun will also remain the lead negotiator with North Korea — a dual role, he has said, that elevates “the priority on North Korea to the deputy secretary position, and I think that’s very important.” But the diplomacy has fizzled since Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim abruptly left a summit meeting in Vietnam a year ago, unable to agree on a path for denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula. Critics say the Trump administration was too willing to keep the talks going — and the president too eager to meet with Mr. Kim — even as North Korea was busily building up its arsenal. Mr. Biegun was not only trying to negotiate with the North Koreans, but he was also engaged in a behind-the-scenes fight with Mr. Trump’s national security adviser at the time, John R. Bolton, who believed Mr. Biegun was pursuing a useless mission. “This idea that they can be coaxed into giving up” their nuclear program “was flawed from the start,” Mr. Bolton said on Monday in remarks at Duke University. Still, Joseph Y. Yun, a career diplomat who negotiated with North Korean officials until he retired in March 2018, said Mr. Biegun’s new status could convince Pyongyang that the United States was serious enough about restarting the discussions that it had promoted one of its most senior officials to devote to the details. “It’s a very good signal to North Korea,’’ said Mr. Yun, who retired in part out of frustration with the State Department’s diminished role in the talks. “This will elevate the negotiations.” Mr. Biegun’s greatest challenge, however, is the diplomatic morass of Russia and Ukraine. No one senior official has run the policy since Mr. Bolton left the White House as national security adviser in September, and few have been eager to embrace the portfolio. But Mr. Biegun has told colleagues he is eager to try to resolve Russia’s undeclared war in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region. The conflict has killed more than 13,000 Ukrainian troops and civilians and threatened Kyiv’s sovereignty since it began in 2014, the same year that Russia annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea. Ukrainian officials have anxiously looked to Washington for more help as Kyiv broadens talks with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to ratchet back tensions. Mr. Pompeo visited Kyiv last month to signal continued American commitment to Ukraine. But the country’s leaders have not yet been invited to meet with Mr. Trump at the White House, even though the president has been acquitted of impeachment charges that he demanded that Ukraine announce an investigation into his political rivals before releasing security aid for Donbas. Eric Rubin, a former ambassador to Bulgaria who is now president of the union that represents career diplomats, noted that during his Senate confirmation hearing, Mr. Biegun committed to work “to bridge whatever divides may exist” at the State Department. “This is not an easy time for our country or our profession,” Mr. Rubin said. “We wish him well.” Mr. Biegun faces another source of tension with the 2011 New START arms control treaty with Russia, which drove American and Russian nuclear arsenals to their lowest levels in nearly 60 years. The treaty is set to expire in February 2021, and people who have spoken to Mr. Biegun believe he wants to extend it. But Mr. Trump and his aides have signaled repeatedly that they intend to let the treaty expire unless it can be broadened to include other nations with strategic weapons, chiefly China — and the Chinese are not interested. In his confirmation hearing, Mr. Biegun summed up his approach in a single line that somehow conveyed both optimism for diplomacy and cleareyed realism about the Trump administration’s view of the world, given its “Make America Great Again” mantra. “I’ve long thought America was great,” Mr. Biegun said.",The New York Times
2020,"University Condemns Comparison of ‘OK, Boomer’ to Racial Slur by Professor","A professor at the University of Oklahoma provoked outrage by saying the phrase “OK, boomer” was like a racial slur for black people. He later apologized to students. The president of the University of Oklahoma on Tuesday condemned the remarks of a professor who told his class that the phrase “OK, boomer” was comparable to a racial slur against black people, provoking outrage from students in the class and around campus. Peter Gade, the director of graduate studies at the university’s journalism school, made the remarks in a class on Tuesday, during a discussion of social media and journalism. In the comparison, Mr. Gade used the slur. Many students were aghast that a white tenured professor would be comfortable comparing the phrase, an internet meme that is quickly becoming a generational flash point, to an epithet associated with the horrors of slavery and racism. And within hours, the university’s interim president responded with a statement that criticized the professor and touched on issues of history, ethics and speech. “While the professor’s comments are protected by the First Amendment and academic freedom, his comment and word choice are fundamentally offensive and wrong,” said the interim president, Joseph Harroz Jr. “The use of the most offensive word, by a person in a position of authority, hurt and minimized those in the classroom and beyond,” Mr. Harroz said. “Our university must serve as an example to our society of both freedom of expression and understanding and tolerance. His words today failed to meet this standard.” Mr. Gade, who has been a faculty member at the university since 1998, did not immediately answer an email or return a call seeking comment. Hours after class, Mr. Gade sent an email to students, apologizing. In the class on Tuesday, Mr. Gade and his students were discussing how technology and social media were changing journalism when a student said that news organizations needed to adapt to stay relevant with younger audiences, according to The OU Daily, a student newspaper. Mr. Gade said that the student’s comment was like saying, “OK, boomer,” referring to a phrase that has alternately been called a dismissive, even ageist retort against older people and a rallying cry of younger generations. The class tittered at that remark, but then fell into shock as he continued: “Calling someone a boomer is like calling someone a” racial slur, Mr. Gade was quoted by the newspaper as saying. Molly Kruse, a 21-year-old senior who was in the class, said that the word jolted her. “I said, ‘Dr. Gade, I don’t think you should be using that word here,’” she said in an interview. Ms. Kruse said she was too stunned to remember the professor’s response, but other students later told her he quickly moved on from the topic. Ms. Kruse, however, said she walked out of the class at that moment and went to the dean’s office. Other students later joined her. Miles Francisco, a senior and co-director of the Black Emergency Response Team, a student group, said it was not the first time a professor at the campus had used the slur in class and justified uttering it “for educational reasons.” Those instances have been infuriating, but Mr. Gade’s use of the word was particularly upsetting, he said. “Here, it was, ‘Let’s compare ‘boomer’ to a word that’s rooted in historical violence,” said Mr. Francisco, who was not in the classroom. “This was a bit more jarring because it can’t even be excused as, ‘Oh, I was using it educationally or it was in the literature.’” The Black Emergency Response Team, an organization of black student leaders with the stated mission of confronting racism on campus, said on Twitter that it expected “full action to be taken against the professor and college.” “We do not condone or accept this behavior from any member of the O.U. community regardless of occupation or student status,” the organization said. “In addition, we expect accommodation be made for the students who have experienced trauma because of this.” In his email to students, Mr. Gade wrote, “I made an inexcusable mistake this morning in class with my choice of a word.” “I was wrong. I am sorry. I realize the word is hurtful and infuses the racial divisions of our country, past and present. Use of this word is inappropriate in any — especially educational — settings,” he added. He asked students to “please give me an opportunity” to show he was an instructor who was “trustworthy and respectful of all.” Ms. Kruse said she hoped the incident spurred changes at the university. “The fact that someone could really think that ‘boomer’ is the equivalent of the n-word, I don’t know,” she said. “I hope this is a wake-up call that our college needs more diversity and professors need to be trained in how to include all students.” Mr. Francisco, 22, said scholars at the university had developed a program called “Unlearning,” which teaches staff members how to recognize racism, sexism and homophobia and to promote inclusion. “There have been a lot of faculty and staff who have taken these trainings,” he said, but they are not mandatory. “The faculty who really need it are not taking it,” Mr. Francisco said. In a separate statement, university officials said that the First Amendment protected Mr. Gade from disciplinary action. Deans from the Gaylord College of Journalism and Mass Communication, the journalism unit of the university, will attend Mr. Gade’s next class on Thursday, Ms. Kruse said that students had been told. In its statement, the university said students “will have the opportunity to meet with Gaylord College leadership to voice concerns and have a conversation about moving forward.”",The New York Times
2020,Unjust America,"Subscribe: iTunes | Google Play Music | How to Listen “Supreme Inequality,” the new book by Adam Cohen, argues that over the past 50 years, the United States Supreme Court has exacerbated economic inequality through aggressive jurisprudence. “It’s not just an arbitrary half century,” Cohen says on this week’s podcast. “Something very specific happened 50 years ago. Nixon was elected in 1968, and he had a vision, which was to end the liberal Warren court and replace it with a conservative court. It’s amazing how quickly he was able to do that.” Nixon “completely shifted” the court, Cohen says, and it’s a shift that “we live with today.” Madeline Levine visits the podcast this week to talk about her new book, “Ready or Not: Preparing Our Kids to Thrive in an Uncertain and Rapidly Changing World,” about the epidemic of anxiety among contemporary parents and its effects on children. “Every time we accommodate to a normal developmental challenge,” Levine says, “we rip away the possibility that that kid can master it on their own.” Also on this week’s episode, Tina Jordan, Barry Gewen and Concepción de León talk about what people are reading. Pamela Paul is the host.

2020,"Unloved by Trump, NPR Carries On","Donations to the public broadcaster went up sharply after the president said it was “a very good question” to ask why it still existed. First President Trump questioned the existence of National Public Radio in a tweet. Then, as part of the annual budget request released last Monday, he recommended slashing federal funding to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the body that distributes taxpayer dollars to NPR and other public media outlets, to $0 by 2023. Past budget proposals from Mr. Trump have apparently had little influence over the amounts that public media has received from the government. For the 2020 fiscal year, the White House recommended $30 million for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Congress, which has traditionally shown support for public media, ultimately decided on $465 million. Although Congress controls how much federal money goes to public broadcasters, NPR is not taking the potential threat lightly. About 1 percent of its budget comes from federal money, but Mike Riksen, an NPR vice president, said the funding was “essential” to public radio. “Elimination of federal funding would result in fewer programs, less journalism — especially local journalism — and, eventually, the loss of public radio stations, particularly in rural and economically distressed communities,” Mr. Riksen said. “We are fully engaged with policymakers to ensure a complete understanding of federal funding and its importance to our stations and the public media system.” The White House budgeted $30 million for public broadcasting in 2021. For 2022 — the last year of federal funding for public media, if the president got his way — Mr. Trump proposed $28 million. Despite the lack of support from the administration, Paul G. Haaga Jr., a longtime Republican donor who is the chairman of NPR’s board of directors, said he believed public media was not in danger. He recalled conversations that he’d had with Republican lawmakers soon after he joined the board. “They’d leaned over and say, ‘Don’t tell anybody in the caucus, but I love NPR and couldn’t live without it,’” Mr. Haaga said. “And I’d lean over and say, ‘Don’t tell anybody, but everybody in the caucus tells me that, too.’” Nevertheless, NPR has been under scrutiny lately after tensions arose between Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the journalist Mary Louise Kelly. Ms. Kelly, an anchor of the NPR news show “All Things Considered,” said Mr. Pompeo had used foul language during a tense exchange on Jan. 24 after she pressed him on the administration’s Ukraine policy as part of a taped interview. Two days after the encounter, Mark Levin, the conservative host of a syndicated radio program and a Fox News show, asked on Twitter, “Why does NPR still exist?” He described the outlet as a “Democrat Party propaganda operation.” Mr. Trump retweeted Mr. Levin’s post, adding a comment of his own: “A very good question!” That same day, the State Department barred the NPR correspondent Michele Kelemen from traveling as a member of the press pool on a government airplane with Mr. Pompeo. Ms. Kelemen, who has covered the State Department for nearly two decades, was set to travel with Mr. Pompeo to Europe and Central Asia. The State Department Correspondents’ Association, lawmakers and commentators spoke out in support of NPR afterward. A Fox News host, Steve Hilton, referred to Mr. Pompeo as a “baby” and a “bully.” Donations to many NPR affiliates spiked in the days after the president’s tweet and the clash with the State Department, according to an NPR spokeswoman. Direct contributions to Southern California Public Radio increased 250 percent, said Rob Risko, the director of membership. Donations to the public station KMUW in Wichita, Kan. — a city in the congressional district once represented by Mr. Pompeo — rose 90 percent, the general manager, Debra Fraser, said. Pledges came in from 12 states. KMUW, a station with 25 employees, would survive if federal funding disappeared, Ms. Fraser said. “The problem is the rural stations,” she added. “They can’t make that up.” NPR started in 1970, three years after President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Public Broadcasting Act. President Richard M. Nixon became the first of many Republican leaders who tried to cut funding to public media when he vetoed a bill to fund the Corporation for Public Broadcasting in 1972. In 1984, President Ronald Reagan vetoed a bill that authorized spending increases for public broadcasting. In the 1990s, Speaker Newt Gingrich championed a movement to “zero-out” federal funding for public media, and President George W. Bush recommended cuts to the corporation’s budget each year he was in office, only to be overridden by Congress. The bulk of NPR’s funding comes from corporate sponsors and fees it receives from affiliate radio stations. Congress approves the Corporation for Public Broadcasting’s annual budget two years in advance — meaning the budget for 2020 was approved in 2018. While the White House can request a reduction of that money in its annual proposal, the lead time affords public broadcasting some protection, said Bill Davis, the president emeritus at Southern California Public Radio. “That forward funding does provide a modicum of a heat shield, if you will, from this kind of political dust-up,” he said. Mr. Davis added that it would be “catastrophic” for small NPR stations if federal funding for public media shrank to zero. NPR affiliates are often the main sources of news in rural areas, said Mr. Haaga, the board chairman. He added that public media, despite the criticism from some Republicans that it has a liberal bias, should be seen as a good thing for conservatives. “As I tell my Republican friends, our ideas are better than the Democrats’ ideas, so we benefit disproportionately from an informed public,” Mr. Haaga said. “Sometimes people chuckle over that. But then they realize it’s true.” Jaclyn Peiser contributed research.",The New York Times
2020,"Unmarried, Happily Ever After","Being single isn’t a bad thing. In fact, many women prefer it. Despite the increasing number of dating apps, matchmakers, and love advice designed to facilitate romantic connections, many women are opting out of relationships. Instead of moping over singledom or aggressively trying to find partners with arbitrary deadlines in mind, they are declaring to be happily unmarried and proudly find solace in living solo. Danielle Clare, 31, a physical therapist in Washington, ended a two-year relationship with her live-in boyfriend last year. “It was honestly one of the best decisions that I’ve made,” Ms. Clare said. “Finding what makes you happy is the most important thing.” More than seven months after her split, Ms. Clare has settled into her new life, where she now enjoys yoga classes, seeing friends, or staying in on a Friday night watching the series “Outlander,” rather than going out on dates. She also cherishes her sleep. “When you’re feeling someone out and starting to spend the night together, you don’t sleep well,” she said. “A few years ago, I would have been like, ‘of course, sleep over. No big deal.’” Now, she chooses to work out in the morning, make breakfast or sleep in if she so desires. “A lot of times in relationships, you need to make sacrifices,” said Genesis Games, a therapist in Miami. “You don’t have any sacrifices to make when you’re on your own. You make all the decisions. If you feel like you want to change your friends, you want to move, you want to start from zero — whatever you think is a radical change that’s needed in your life — you have the full liberty to do that and not worry about anyone else.” [Sign up for Love Letter and always get the latest in Modern Love, weddings, and relationships in the news by email.] In November, the actress Emma Watson, 29, spoke to British Vogue about being single. “I’m very happy. I call it being self-partnered.” In the same interview, Ms. Watson described the stress she felt before adopting this notion. “There is suddenly this bloody influx of subliminal messaging around. If you have not built a home, if you do not have a husband, if you do not have a baby, and you are turning 30, and you’re not in some incredibly secure, stable place in your career, or you’re still figuring things out … There’s just this incredible amount of anxiety.” Even outside monogamy, casually dating, courtship and chasing potential love interests take energy and time. “When you’re not seeking partnership, you are in a very relaxed calm inner space and generally more comfortable with who you are,” said Carla Manly, a clinical psychologist who specializes in relationships and self-awareness, who is based in Santa Rosa, Calif. “You’re not trying to impress anyone and you’re not trying to please anyone, except that inner being.” Dr. Manly says that for centuries, men and particularly women were raised to believe they are more valuable when married. This concept remains prevalent, despite people having a more relaxed attitude about marriage. (In the 2012 General Social Survey, more than half of adult Americans reported that getting married is not an experience they consider important to becoming an adult.) “If you look at social media, movies or any messages out there, many of them are oriented toward the happy family and the happy couple,” Dr. Manly said. “You’re coloring your hair so you can get the perfect partner. You’re taking the medication so you can walk on the beach with your partner. There are these overt and subliminal messages that being partnered is the ideal.” On Instagram, more than 12.9 million posts utilize the hashtag #engaged. Many of these photos feature up-close pictures of diamond-clad left ring fingers. On the other hand, #single is used more than 17.9 million times, #singlewoman has more than 96,100 mentions and #singlegirl is featured in more than 915,000 posts. In 2016, 110.6 million U.S. residents 18 years and older were unmarried. Women accounted for 53.2 percent of these individuals, according to the United States Census Bureau. In support of the unattached population, the Instagram account @notengaged (which has 164,000 followers) depicts what life is like without an engagement ring. The account’s creator, Mary McCarthy, 31, of Astoria, Queens, has uploaded more than 800 pictures of her bare left ring finger while on vacation, at home with wine, at the movie theater, and in other locations since September 2016. “There are times that I’m posting pictures of my far-flung adventures, but there are also times that I’m posting cleaning my tub on a Saturday night, because that’s real life — no matter if you’re coupled up or not,” said Ms. McCarthy, who is unmarried and also #notengaged. On New Years Eve 2018, an Instagram post featuring Ms. McCarthy’s jewel-free left hand in front of a Christmas tree garnered more than 8,800 likes and about 500 direct messages. “People were like, ‘I’m celebrating New Year’s on the couch, too. I’m by myself, and I’m totally fine,’” she said. Beyond couple-centric holidays, Ms. McCarthy says she’s received “overwhelmingly positive” feedback from her audience which is 96 percent female. In addition to the Instagram page, Ms. McCarthy created a fake wedding website via The Knot, where she details her relationship with herself (and tacos) and requests actress Anne Hathaway attend an imaginary Dec. 31, 2022 wedding as her flower girl. (For context: banana bread is the bridesmaid and TV is the matron of honor.) To date, more than 250 people electronically submitted R.S.V.P.s to the nonexistent party. “I have nothing against marriage or people getting engaged, or even posting their engagements on the internet,” said Ms. McCarthy. “Especially online, on social media, you’re seeing these highlight reels from so many other people. You immediately start feeling behind in life.

2020,Highlights From the Nevada Caucuses: Bernie Sanders Is Declared the Winner,"Officials with the Nevada Democratic Party and the Democratic National Committee stressed all week that they had gone to school on lessons learned from the bungled Iowa caucuses, when a smartphone app for reporting results crashed and phone lines to report results were jammed for hours. But by 11:00 p.m. Eastern time — more than seven hours after Nevada’s caucuses began, and four hours after most of them closed — Nevada Democrats still have only reported results from about 23 percent of the state’s precincts. The tardiness stems from new caucus rules mandated by the D.N.C. that require the state party to collect more than 100 data points from each of Nevada’s 2,097 precincts. The state party also installed a duplicative reporting system to try to prevent Iowa-style mishaps that led to a litany of mathematical errors that had to be corrected later. Nevada’s protracted vote-counting served to rob several Democratic candidates who had hoped to claim a second-place finish on Saturday night and position themselves as the moderate alternative to Bernie Sanders, who won what appears to be a commanding victory in Nevada.",The New York Times
2020,Up to 91% More Expensive: How Delivery Apps Eat Up Your Budget,"tech fix Uber Eats, DoorDash and Postmates might be convenient, but the apps are making you pay a juicy premium. After a long day, you have probably done some back-of-the-napkin math and decided there was no point in going out for dinner when you could get food brought to your door for the same cost, plus a tip. So you fired up a delivery app. Too bad the numbers aren’t that simple. When you order through a delivery app, you pay multiple parties, including the driver and the companies that offer the apps, like Uber Eats and Postmates. In some cases, you pay the restaurants extra fees as well. The markups can be downright egregious. Take Panda Express, the fast-food chain. If you ordered a $39 Family Feast value meal using Uber Eats, your tab would be 49 percent higher than if you bought the same meal at the restaurant. You would have to really love Panda Express to pay this kind of premium — and that doesn’t even include a tip. The extra fees creep into your bill for various reasons. Some restaurants hike the prices of food ordered for delivery. And most of the popular apps charge a delivery fee and cram tax and extra service costs into a single line on the bill, making it difficult to notice the inflated costs. To give you an idea of the true cost of delivery app convenience, I tested some of the apps. Read on for what I found. (Hint: It wasn’t pretty.) I focused my tests on DoorDash, Postmates, Grubhub and Uber Eats, the four largest delivery apps in the United States. To compare them, I used all four apps to make identical orders — such as the same kind of pizza — from four restaurants. The results, for the most part, followed this trend: Cost Grubhub DoorDash Postmates Uber Eats Restaurant 6-inch Turkey Breast Sub (x2) $11.98 $14.78 $14.78 $14.78 $12.58 Delivery fee $1.99 $1.99 $2.99 $3.99 Service fee $1.29 $1.20 $2.42 $2.22 Sales tax $1.20 $1.29 $1.33 $1.26 $0.63 Misc. $3 Total cost $16.46 $19.26 $21.52 $25.25 $13.21 Markup 25% 46% 63% 91% The markups on the food deliveries were 7 percent to 91 percent more than what you would pay if you bought the meal directly from the restaurant. Yep, you read that right. Uber Eats bills were high across the board, which was surprising because it offers practically the same type of service as Grubhub and DoorDash. But unlike the other apps, Uber Eats charged a $3 “small order” fee when I ordered the sandwiches from a Subway. Plus it added a 15 percent service charge and a separate $3.99 delivery fee, which was determined by my proximity to Subway. Meghan Casserly, a spokeswoman for Uber, said that the company’s goal was to deliver meals to people as quickly as possible, and that the transparent fees covered operating expenses while fairly compensating workers. Yet among the four apps, Uber’s service charges were also the most unpredictable, I found. Its delivery fees fluctuated depending on the availability of couriers when I placed an order. That was similar to Uber’s so-called surge pricing for rides, which it uses to get more people to drive when rides are in high demand. Postmates’ markups were also confusing. Its delivery fees and service fees both vary widely, depending on the merchant you are ordering from. For the same Subway order, its delivery fee was $2.99, lower than Uber’s $3.99. But its service charge was highest at about 16.4 percent, or $2.42. Postmates service charges can skew higher in part because it doesn’t deliver only meals. Its couriers offer to bring you practically anything they can pick up, from a pair of sneakers to a birthday cake. Other delivery apps generally have relationships only with restaurants, so their offerings are more limited and they charge a smaller service fee. DoorDash’s service fee for the Subway order was 11 percent, and Grubhub’s was 5 percent. Another thing to look out for are food prices that are inflated to cover delivery expenses. In my tests, this practice was most evident at Panda Express. While the family value meal’s normal cost was $39, the price was listed at $44.85 in Postmates and $47.10 on Uber Eats, DoorDash and Grubhub. Cost Grubhub DoorDash Postmates Uber Eats Restaurant Family Feast $47.10 $47.10 $44.85 $47.10 $39 Delivery fee $1.49 $5.99 $2.99 $4.99 Service fee $4.71 $5.18 $9.73 $7.07 Sales tax $4.61 $4 $3.81 $4 $3.32 Total $57.91 $62.27 $61.38 $63.16 $42 Markup 37% 47% 45% 49% For another comparison, I created identical orders for two entrees and a smoothie from Little Szechuan, a local Chinese restaurant. The spicy spare ribs, normally $13.98 at the restaurant, cost $16.98 at Uber Eats, Postmates and DoorDash. What’s going on here? It depends on the app and the restaurant. DoorDash, Postmates and Uber said restaurants controlled their food prices. Grubhub said it worked with restaurants on their pricing, and though it encourages them to keep prices consistent, it allows merchants like Panda Express to offer different prices for delivery. Big national chains also tend to give smaller commissions to delivery apps, so menu prices are sometimes inflated for the apps to collect more commission, according to a person at Postmates, who asked to remain anonymous. Panda Express said its delivery prices allowed it to provide delivery services nationwide. Little Szechuan did not respond to requests for comment. After you rack up the exorbitant costs of delivery, going to a restaurant to eat or grab takeout probably feels like a bargain. Here’s another idea: Consider cooking your own meal. You may need to plan a little to buy some groceries ahead of time, but there are many simple weekday meals you can prepare in a fairly short time. My favorite go-to is fresh chicken with a side of vegetables, roasted in my toaster oven. No tips or markups required.",The New York Times
2020,Uphill Skiing at 75: ‘There’s No One Left in My Category’,"Sharon Crawford, a multisport athlete from Colorado, is still competing, still going against gravity and against the grain, at age 75. “I’m more of an endurance person,” she says. Credit...James Stukenberg for The New York Times BRECKENRIDGE, Colo. — It’s 6 a.m. on a January day, dark as night, and a handful of local athletes are skiing as fast as they can — uphill. Each of the 31 participants is wearing a headlamp, and nearly all of them are wearing skis that weigh less than an average pair of hiking boots. One of them is Sharon Crawford. Crawford, 75, who lives in Frisco, Colo., about 10 miles away, is no stranger to uphill ski racing. In fact, she is no stranger to any type of race that involves strain, endurance or pushing one’s body to the limit. This event, a part of the Breckenridge Ascent Series, took Crawford from the base of the Breckenridge Ski Resort, which has an elevation of 9,600 feet, up a black-rated trail for nearly two miles and more than 1,500 vertical feet. The fastest racer, Jill Sorensen, knocked it out in 32 minutes. Crawford clocked in at 1 hour 2 minutes. “I’ve never had speed,” Crawford, a retired software engineer, said after the race. “I’m more of an endurance person.” Compared with other competitions in her athletic career, which began in earnest when she was over 30, this race was fairly easy. She has won medals in marathons, triathlons, cross-country ski races, orienteering and multiple-day events. Competitions in uphill skiing, or ski mountaineering — skimo, for short — are increasingly popular and present challenges even for the seasoned athlete. “When you start getting tired, you think, O.K., I’ve got to be ready because the steep part is going to come,” she said. “You have to be prepared to push yourself when you need to.” Unlike five- or 10-kilometer running races, which attract a broad range of participants with a broad range of athletic talent, high-elevation winter competitions like the Breck Ascent Series tend to attract superbly fit athletes, many of whom compete internationally. “You’d think more people would come, but they’re scared,” said Sorensen, 42, who last year won the Xterra Pan American Tour title in the age 40-44 women’s division in triathlon. “Sharon isn’t. I look at her and feel so inspired. My goal is just to last, to take care of my body so I can participate in the sports I love until I’m her age. Not only is she participating, she’s competing.” Crawford spent her early childhood in Colorado, Arizona and California when her father worked for the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The family eventually settled in Billings, Mont., where she was a Girl Scout, loved the outdoors and pursued interests that were, at the time, dominated by boys. “All my life it’s been like that,” she said. “I’ve been one of few women. When I was in high school, there were three of us that did physics and chemistry. Women didn’t do sports. Both of my brothers ran cross-country or played basketball. Girls were cheerleaders or played in the band. My father was from an old pioneer family. We’d go fishing and camping all the time.” Crawford pursued a bachelor’s degree at Stanford and a master’s degree at Montana State before finishing in 1969 and moving to Massachusetts, where she became a software engineer and took up running and orienteering. Her first major event was the Boston Marathon in the early 1970s. “I needed some exercise,” she said. “The North Medford Club needed women for the old men to beat. A guy started selling shoes out of the back of his car. I bought a pair of Adidas Antelope. I remember running in those the first time I ran the Boston Marathon.” Crawford became a regular marathoner and competitive orienteer. Upon retiring, she moved to Colorado, where her family has deep roots (her great-grandfather James Harvey Crawford founded the town of Steamboat Springs) and where she has continued to broaden her interest in outdoor sports. Her first uphill ski competition was in Breckenridge in 1996. It was the Imperial Challenge, in which competitors bike or run 6.2 miles from town to the base area of one of the peaks, then climb — either on skis, boards with skins or snowshoes — 3,000 vertical feet to a summit before skiing down to the finish. Initially, Crawford did the race on Nordic skis with no metal edges. She has worked up to the lightweight ski mountaineering gear she uses today, and also competes in uphill-downhill skimo events like the long course version of the Breck Ascent Series and the Rando Series at Arapahoe Basin, in which competitors ascend the mountain multiple times and descend on double-black-rated terrain. When asked about the most difficult aspect of these events, Crawford laughed and said, “Doing them.” “Waking up early in the morning and being able to pace yourself,” she said. “That’s tough. Then the challenge of the transitions — taking off the skins and skiing down on steep, rough snow on those light skis — that’s the really hard part.” In such races, Crawford is typically among the last to finish, but not always the very last. “I was born too early for this sport, in a sense,” she said. “In these events, there’s no one left in my category. I’m beating some younger people, but not very often. My goal is, can I do as well or better than I did last year?” Crawford’s schedule revolves around races. In January, a week before the Breck Ascent, she was in Innsbruck, Austria, competing for six consecutive days in Nordic and ski orienteering races at the Winter World Masters Games, where she won five gold medals and a silver. Last weekend, she was in Vermont competing on classic skis in the national masters championship, finishing first in her class and significantly ahead of a handful of much younger racers. This month, she will be in Wisconsin, competing in the classic ski 55-kilometer American Birkebeiner (her 11th of such long-distance events, including the Birkebeiner in Norway). In March, she’ll return to Europe to compete in the Masters World Cup cross-country ski races in Cogne, Italy. From being one of the few girls in her high school physics class and in the Boston Marathon to becoming the token 75-year-old in an extreme ski mountaineering contest, Crawford has always told herself, “I can do it, too.” “You have to have your own criteria,” she said. “Sometimes it’s just to participate. In others, you want to really be competitive. Now my age group is 75 and up, which is good. I’m going to take advantage of that.”",The New York Times
2020,"Utah Powder and Steeps, Without the Crowds","Head north from Salt Lake City to visit Snowbasin and Powder Mountain, relatively undiscovered gems of the state’s ski scene. During a quick swing through Utah last spring, I texted my husband a photo from a ski area of rock- and tree-lined steeps. “Is that Snowbird or Alta?” he responded. His guess was good, but he was about 70 miles off. I was at Snowbasin in northern Utah, a 45-minute drive from Salt Lake City. Most skiers from out of state head to one of the resort clusters on the city’s eastern edge, to Snowbird and Alta, or Brighton and Solitude, or Park City and Deer Valley, which draw thousands of skiers on weekends and powder days. Snowbasin, with 3,000 acres of varied terrain, efficient lifts and luxurious on-mountain facilities, stands apart and has yet to see the crowds descend. It does have a few neighbors. The small Nordic Valley ski area attracts local families. And then there’s 8,464-acre Powder Mountain, the country’s largest ski resort. It’s the yin to Snowbasin’s yang, with seemingly endless rolling slopes, an appealingly old-school vibe, and a funky uphill transport system consisting of chairlifts, snowcats and shuttle buses. The city of Ogden, emerging as a destination on its own, serves as a convenient base camp for visiting Snowbasin and Powder Mountain, each about a half-hour drive away. Closer yet is Huntsville, one of several small towns in the Ogden Valley, where a 15-room boutique property, the Compass Rose Lodge, opened last winter. In early January, I returned to Snowbasin for another visit and to explore Powder Mountain. I stayed the first night in Ogden. Long a feisty counterpart to Salt Lake City, this one-time railroad hub now trumpets its proximity to outdoor recreation. After checking into the Bigelow, the grand but aging dame of Ogden hotels, dating from 1891, I wandered next door to the Monarch, an arts incubator and event space that is part of what is being called the Nine Rails Creative District. A former garage for the Bigelow and now on the National Register of Historic Places, the industrial-chic building houses 40 working artist studios, a cafe, gift shop and more. On this First Friday evening, the place buzzed as locals wandered in and out of studios, wine in hand, and an alt-rock band played in the entryway. At Thomas-Printers, a letterpress studio with a vintage Heidelberg press, cheeky notecards riffed on the city’s ongoing transformation: “Greetings from Ogden. Utah’s Foremost ‘It Used to Be Waaay Worse City.’” The first clue that Powder Mountain offers something different is the ski tracks. They scribble down through trees and ungroomed pitches on both sides of the resort access road, their origins unclear. Turns out these runs are part of Powder Country: 1,200 acres of backcountry-style terrain that funnels down from three chairlifts. To return to the base area, skiers traverse to a designated pickup spot and catch a free shuttle bus. 10 miles Powder Mountain Whisper Ridge Eden Nordic Valley 39 Ogden Huntsville Snowbasin 15 84 antelope island utah Great Salt Lake Salt Lake City Deer Valley 80 Park City Solitude Mountain Alta Street data from OpenStreetMap Brighton Snowbird IDAHO 50 MILES WYOMING Salt Lake City COLO. NEV. UTAH By The New York Times To me these tracks signify that PowMow, as it’s commonly known, means adventure. As I soon discovered, the mountain feels like a big playground, fitting in somewhere between a traditional ski area and the backcountry (albeit avalanche controlled). Runs — 154 of them — spill every which way off the 8,900-foot main summit. With topography that resembles a crumpled piece of paper, the terrain encompasses four major drainages and several ridges. Get the lay of this vast land during one of the free, twice-daily mountain tours that meet at 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. outside the Timberline Lodge. We picked destinations to inspire you, delight you and motivate you to explore the world. That morning, I arced big turns down long, groomed cruisers and tucked through trees and around boulders, charting my own course off-piste. It didn’t take long to find fresh tracks on low-angle slopes in Cobabe Canyon, even though the last storm was more than two days ago. PowMow earns its moniker by receiving an average of 500 inches annually of Utah’s dry, light fluff — the area doesn’t even have snow-making. Of the six chairlifts that ferry skiers up the mountain, only one is high-speed, which helps preserve the powder from getting too tracked up between storms. Not that there’s much danger of that happening anyway. As of 2016, the resort preemptively instituted a daily skier cap of 4,500 that has yet to be reached. Belying the area’s adventurous feel, 40 percent of PowMow’s runs are rated intermediate. That rolling terrain also makes the slopes popular among snowboarders, who enjoy the surfy feel. I found steeper runs off the Paradise lift and in Powder Country, but some of the resort’s best expert trails require a bit longer to access. I bought a $25 ticket to take a 15-minute snowcat ride up Lightning Ridge (an additional cat serves an area on the resort’s opposite side on weekends). From the drop-off spot, I traversed and sidestepped for several minutes to ski Hook Chute, which funnels into a long tongue of snow between two rock walls. Had I wanted to boot-pack up another 500 vertical feet for 30 minutes to the summit of James Peak, I could have skied PowMow’s longest inbounds descent, some 2,500 feet down to the bottom of Paradise. But I chose to explore more of the mountain instead. For even more adventuring, PowMow offers full- and half-day guided out-of-bounds trips. And last year the resort partnered with Whisper Ridge, an adjacent heli- and cat-skiing outfit that operates on 70,000 acres; book a trip directly at the resort. For a late lunch, I ducked into the Powder Keg in the lower level of the 1980s-era Timberline Lodge. It was packed with people enjoying three kinds of ramen (including a sinus-clearing green curry), huge banh mi sandwiches, and burgers, along with nine local brews on tap and free popcorn from the machine by the entrance. When I left, a band from Salt Lake was already starting to set up on the small stage for après ski. Upstairs in the lodge, the wooden tabletops are burnished to a glossy finish from years of use. A large banner by the fireplace bears a quote from Alvin Cobabe, a rancher-turned-medical doctor and the resort’s founder, about Powder Mountain’s bewitching spell. Dr. Cobabe opened the resort on his family’s land in February 1972 and ran it until 2006. More recently, in 2013, a group of young entrepreneurs behind a networking enterprise known as Summit teamed up with two venture capitalists with local ties to purchase the resort; they have big plans. A pair of rustic-chic mountaintop yurts now hosts events through the Summit Series, invitation-only, socially conscious conferences that resemble a hybrid between Allen and Co.’s annual Sun Valley gatherings and Burning Man. High-end modern chalets have started to dot the mountain’s upper reaches; eventually the plan is to have 500 of them, along with a commercial village, condos and a hotel. What does this mean for PowMow’s longtime no-frills persona? Other than a new lift and some additional ski acreage in 2016, it’s been business as usual on the slopes. For now, at least, the resort remains the type of down-home place that recently named a swath of terrain — Woody’s World — after a 40-year employee who died last year. From Powder Mountain, I headed south, passing farmhouses and ranchland while driving from the small town of Eden to the equally small town of Huntsville, where I checked into the Compass Rose Lodge. Opened in January 2019 by Jeff and Bonnie Hyde, both of whom have long ties to the ski world, the hotel has creatively repurposed industrial-farmhouse décor, large guest rooms and a coffee shop. Moreover, its size and setup encourage the type of casual socializing I associate with old-time ski lodges. That evening over the daily complimentary wine and snacks, I chatted about skiing and auto racing with a couple from Alabama. There’s also an observatory, cleverly built to look like a silo from the outside. I toured it one night (access is half price for hotel guests) with a student from Weber State University as my guide. Clouds obscured most of the stars, good for the next day’s skiing, though we did get some glimpses of the moon through one of the three telescopes. Compass Rose adds a much-needed new option to Ogden Valley. Until Powder Mountain’s village is built, skier lodging for both ski resorts consists primarily of off-site condos and a few bed-and-breakfasts. As I drove toward Snowbasin the next morning, the resort’s topography revealed itself. The ski area resembles a vast white curtain strung along six high peaks, trails plummeting for 3,000 vertical feet among the folds and ripples. Thanks to the billionaire Earl Holding, who purchased Snowbasin in 1984 (he already owned Sun Valley), the resort benefited from a slew of upgrades that kicked into high gear in time for the 2002 Olympics. Mr. Holding, who also owned Sinclair Oil and Salt Lake City’s ornate Grand America hotel, specified some of the most majestic base-area buildings and on-mountain restaurants you’ll ever see, with gigantic timbers, plush carpeting, overstuffed couches, creamy marble and oversize chandeliers. What you won’t find: slopeside lodging. Mr. Holding died in 2013 and though his family still owns the resort, including two square miles at the base, it’s unclear whether building real estate is among its priorities. The resort’s lift system enables skiers to access much of the mountain via two gondolas and a tram (there are six other chairlifts), meaning one can ride in warmth and comfort when the weather turns blustery. The grooming is thoughtful, too. As the snowcats rake perfect corduroy overnight, they’ll often leave some ungroomed snow on one side, allowing skiers of different ability levels or preferences — moguls versus packed-down snow — to descend the same run. The day began sunny and cold. Even though it was a weekend (and Snowbasin now accepts the Epic Pass, which allows skiers to visit multiple resorts for one fee), the slopes were relatively uncrowded. After riding the Needles Gondola up the mountain, I skied a series of top-to-bottom, flowy cruisers served by the Strawberry Gondola — that is, after pausing near the top to view the Great Salt Lake’s Antelope Island. On clear days, those in the know begin on the Strawberry side of the mountain and work their way across to follow the sun. Late morning, I decided it was time to hit one of the resort’s classic steep runs. From the top of the Strawberry Gondola, I traversed right and slightly uphill to Lone Tree, a svelte chute with a precipitous drop. Some 610 vertical feet of short-radius turns later, I was back on flat ground by the Needles on-mountain lodge. As clouds started to roll in, I zigzagged my way across Snowbasin’s vast expanse, dipping into the trees between runs and even trying out Bear Hollow Woods, a new-this-year children’s zone that wends it way among gladed aspens. The trail map lists 106 runs but there could easily be twice as many — skiable lines exist all over the mountain. I made it a point to stop for lunch at the John Paul Lodge, a window-lined circular aerie that looks out on the improbably steep start of the Olympic men’s downhill course. With a new executive chef at the resort this year, the lodge has added Bavarian fare like schnitzel and giant pretzels, as well as an all-day waffle bar. Munching on a pretzel, I took a closer look at the massive gold-plated chandelier overhead; two tiers of winged dragons encircle it, one dragon per each electric candle. At what other ski resort could you see fixtures this ornate and still enjoy some serious terrain, without having to fight the crowds, to boot? By then, the clouds had begun to unleash swirls of snow and visibility was low, so a post-lunch foray up No Name Peak no longer seemed like a good idea. It’s the site of some of Snowbasin’s most technical terrain and a five-minute hike from the top of the Allen Peak tram. Instead, I navigated the trees under the John Paul Express lift, finishing up in a gully that guided my skis side to side, up and down, like a natural halfpipe. The blizzard had set in. If I had snapped a photo at that moment, not even I would have been able to figure out later where I’d been. Rooms at the historic Bigelow Hotel in Ogden (2510 Washington Boulevard, 801-627-1900) start at $90 for a spacious, serviceable suite with a queen bed. More modern lodging downtown includes the Courtyard by Marriott (247 24th Street, 801-627-1190; from $140); the Hilton Garden Inn Ogden (2271 South Washington Boulevard, 801-399-2000, from $150); and the Hampton Inn and Suites, in the renovated historic Eccles Building (2401 Washington Boulevard, 801-394-9400, from $140). Ogden’s Slackwater Pub and Pizzeria (1895 Washington Boulevard, 801-399-0637) offers 18 types of specialty pizza, and an extensive beer menu. At Powder Mountain (6965 East Highway 158, Eden, 801-745-3772), daily adult lift tickets are $95, and tickets for night skiing off the Sundown chairlift are $33. Lunch dishes at the Powder Keg range from $9 to $13. Whisper Ridge (4776 East 2600 North, Eden, 801-876-4664) runs daylong cat-skiing trips for $795 per person, and day heli-skiing trips for $1,440 per person on terrain next to Powder Mountain. Backcountry yurt overnights are $380 per person. Rooms at the Compass Rose Lodge (198 South 7400 East, Huntsville, 385-279-4460) start at $209 for a room with a king bed. Two rooms with two queen beds and two bunks are also available, starting at $279. The $20 observatory tours ($15 for children 5 to 12) are half-price for hotel guests. Dining options in the Ogden Valley are still limited. Kuna Bistro (2429 North Highway 158, Eden, 801-500-2335), new this winter, serves dinner Tuesday through Saturday. The Brazilian-inflected dishes include coffee-roast short ribs, vegetarian ceviche and cassava fries (entrees $15 to $29). Powder Mountain also offers weekly Tuesday community dinners at its mountaintop Skylodge ($50 per person) and, on Thursdays, “Pizza and Pints” ($20 for unlimited food; alcohol not included) at a lodge the resort owns in the valley. At Snowbasin (3925 East Snowbasin Road, Huntsville, 888-437-5448), daily adult lift tickets are $125 on weekdays and $139 on weekends, with discounts for advance purchase online.

2020,Opinion | Valentine’s Day: A Festival of Love or a Giant Scam?,"Breaking hearts, brains and bank accounts since at least the 14th century. Mr. Bokat-Lindell is a writer in The New York Times Opinion section. This article is part of the Debatable newsletter. You can sign up here to receive it Tuesdays and Thursdays. Nobody really knows how Valentine’s Day began. Depending on your sources, its origins can be traced back to an ancient Roman fertility festival involving sacrificial goats or to a Chaucer poem about birds. “It is one of those mysterious historical or antiquarian problems which are doomed never to be solved,” The Times wrote in 1853. It’s perhaps just as well that the holiday’s history remains disputed. Either thousands or hundreds of years later, Americans seem likewise unable to agree on whether Valentine’s Day is a hallowed celebration, a marketing scam that entrenches the hegemony of the nuclear family or just a harmless convention that everyone needs to calm down about. Here’s a bouquet of perspectives to help you figure out your feelings about the tradition, which, unlike most relationships, is not going to end. This year, Americans are expected to set a record for Valentine’s Day spending: $27.4 billion, up 32 percent from last year’s $20.7 billion, which was also a record. That’s about $196 per celebrator (about $15 of which goes to friends and $12 to pets). If that seems like too much money to you, perhaps consider joining in the long tradition of anti-consumerist Valentine’s Day curmudgeonry. “There was a time when Valentine’s Day meant something. … We hate this modern degeneracy, this miscellaneous and business fashion,” The New York Daily Tribune wrote in 1847. “Now nobody makes more than a joke of it.” E.g.: The commercialization has gotten so extreme that it needs to be protested, wrote Samhita Mukhopadhyay back in 2012. (Ms. Mukhopadhyay is now the executive editor of Teen Vogue.) Modern love is governed by a romantic-industrial complex, she argued, that profits by enforcing and then exploiting romantic desires and insecurities: “The more you express your love through candies, chocolates, diamonds, rentals and registries, the more the R.I.C. makes!” In her view, romantic people deserve better, more authentic and sustainable ways to express their affections. “Above all, let’s find a way to honor ourselves that does not rely on buying stuff.” [Related: Why are roses so expensive?] But there is something to be said for extravagant displays of affection, writes Elizabeth Flock. A child of divorce, she recounts an experience of interviewing over the course of a decade three couples in Mumbai, whom she perceived as modeling a more generous, less reserved form of love than she was accustomed to. “Over that time, their relationships and marriages waxed and waned. But they never gave up the over-the-top gestures,” she writes. “It seemed to me then — and does now — a perfect antidote to the fatigue of a marriage. A way to cut through the mundane.” The yearly ritual of Valentine’s Day is sometimes just what’s needed to keep a seasoned relationship vibrant, writes Annaliese Griffin. “I’m hugely cynical about branded opportunities to buy things and romantic love as sold to us by movies and magazines, yet my husband and I celebrate this manufactured consumer holiday every year with a bottle of delicious wine, a cheese plate and sparkling conversation,” she writes. “The excuse to sit and do nothing but chat, to reminisce a bit about when we were younger and less harried, is a gift, one that emerged from repetition, from doing the same thing every year on this maudlin, crushed-velvet, chocolate-dipped holiday that I love.” More often than not, the anti-consumerist critique of Valentine’s Day is a defense mechanism, says Alana Massey. “Valentine’s Day is so difficult not because it makes love a commodity but because it presents us with the challenge of looking at the richness, or lack thereof, of our romantic lives,” she writes. “When people say, ‘I hate Valentine’s Day,’ what they often mean is, ‘I hate being forced to take inventory of the quality and volume of love in my life.’” Few holidays inspire a greater sense of victimization among those who fall outside the charmed circle of its intended devotees than Valentine’s Day. Said one sad single person in The Journal of Business Research: “I would like to extend a warm thanks to Hallmark, the official sponsor of Valentine’s day, for reminding me that without a significant other, how truly worthless my life is.” But romantic love is not the only kind of love worth honoring, as Briallen Hopper argues in her book of essays, “Hard to Love.” She is one of a growing number of people who now observe “Galentine’s Day,” a holiday on Feb. 13 that Amy Poehler’s character on the TV show “Parks and Recreation” invented to celebrate female friendships. In Estonia and Finland, Feb. 14 is known as “Friend’s Day,” a celebration of platonic love, as Mélissa Godin reports for Time. You can also use Valentine’s Day as an occasion to practice self-compassion, as Tara Parker-Pope suggests in The Times. Single people may actually be better off on Valentine’s Day anyway, write the philosopher Neil McArthur and the economist Marina Adshade. The compulsion to give gifts creates a version of what game theorists call a prisoner’s dilemma, they contend, which inevitably leaves lovers feeling either slighted or inefficiently satisfied: “If you are single on Valentine’s Day, you are only missing out on the opportunity to participate in an exercise that makes everyone involved worse off than they would have been had the holiday not existed at all.” Valentine’s Day perpetuates a tyrannical fantasy of what love should look like, according to Deborah Carr, a professor of sociology at Boston University. “The whole holiday conspires to make people feel that they’re not living up to this standard of lovely romance,” she told The Washington Post in 2015. Even then, social media was already making matters worse by expanding public practices of self-performance and concealment: “No one puts up an ugly picture of themselves, or the bad gift they got from CVS.” The social pressure the holiday exerts can be particularly irksome for queer people, writes Yas Necati. “It pushes society’s ideal of what our relationships ‘should’ look like — heterosexual, monogamous, sexual, romantic,” they write. “If you don’t have this — whether that’s because you don’t want to or you just don’t — you are considered to be failing in the eyes of a society that pushes us all, inevitably, towards the nuclear family ideal.” [Related: “I’m Polyamorous and Valentine’s Day Is … Complicated”] But you can always accept that this holiday isn’t for you, Vanessa Rasanen has argued in The Federalist. “If you don’t need a special day to celebrate your marriage or your relationship — or you don’t have any special someone to celebrate with — no one is forcing you,” she writes. “This holiday is for the people with busy lives, who don’t mind chocolate coming in a heart-shaped box once in a while, who like having one day marked on their hectic calendars to take a bit more time to celebrate love and relationship and life together.” Do you have a point of view we missed?

2020,"Valpolicella, the Old-Fashioned Way","Wine School I don’t think of myself as a contrarian, but I am fascinated with wines that seem to have gone out of style. Our last subject, Rioja Gran Reserva, was one such wine, and so is our next, Valpolicella. Light, crisp, refreshing Valpolicella used to be a famous name among Italian reds, but it has been overshadowed by its sibling in the Veneto region of northeastern Italy, Amarone della Valpolicella, better known by the more informal Amarone. This big, powerful, expensive, often syrupy red is made from the same set of grapes as Valpolicella, primarily corvina, with some rondinella and corvinone. To make Amarone, those grapes are dried after harvest until they become sweet and concentrated, and then fermented. In the last 50 years, another version of Valpolicella became popular, one that occupied a middle ground between the ordinary style and Amarone. This version, ripasso, is made by pouring already fermented Valpolicella over the dried skins left over from making Amarone. This repassing, or ripasso, adds weight and intensity to the wine. Over time, ripasso has become the dominant style of Valpolicella. But I still have an affection for the fresh purity and drinkability of the old style, which is not always so easy to find. Here are my three suggestions: Brigaldara Valpolicella 2018 (Vinifera Imports, Ronkonkoma, N.Y.) $16 Zenato Valpolicella Superiore 2017 (Winebow, New York) $18 Prà Valpolicella Morandina 2018 (Polaner Selections, Mount Kisco, N.Y.) $25 If you can’t find these bottles, look for wines from Ca’ Rugate, Monte Dall’Ora, Vaona, Adalia, Le Albare, Tomassi, Allegrini or Viviani. It’s not always easy to tell the ripassos from the normal styles by the label, as the term is not always used. If you end up with a ripasso, enjoy it. Valpolicellas go well with pork chops with herbs, sausages and simple chicken dishes. Some people like them with tomato-based sauces, but I gravitate toward Chianti or barberas for that. Valpolicellas are often light enough to go well with fish. Give these wines a light chill before serving. No decanting is necessary.

2020,The Final Scramble Before the Iowa Caucuses,"DES MOINES — Less than 48 hours from now, hundreds of thousands of Iowans will gather in schools and churches and libraries and gymnasiums, from the Mississippi River to the Missouri, and participate in the first nominating contest of the 2020 election. At that point, all the candidates will be able to do is wait: for the verdict and, they hope, for one of those elusive “tickets out of Iowa.” But for now, they are trying to make the most of the few hours in which their Iowa fates are still, sort of, in their hands. And so candidates here held more than 20 events today, under the ever-present shadow of the 2016 primary. After months of ideological sparring, they seemed to have just one thing left to tell caucusgoers: If you want to beat President Trump, you had better pick me.

2020,Kobe Bryant Memorial: Full Coverage of the Tributes at Staples Center,"Tears and tributes flowed early and often at a memorial service for Kobe and Gianna Bryant on Monday, punctuated by moments of levity and optimism nearly one month after the N.B.A. star and his daughter died in a helicopter crash. The ceremony at Staples Center lasted about two hours, with many luminaries from the basketball world and beyond paying their respects, and fans around Southern California and the rest of the world watching live. “God knew they couldn’t be on this earth without each other,” Bryant’s widow, Vanessa Bryant, said in her first public comments since the crash. “He had to bring them home together.” In many ways, Vanessa Bryant’s speech was the emotional heart of the memorial — deeply personal and moving for those who watched her speak. The memorial began with an uplifting performance by one of Bryant’s longtime friends, Beyoncé Knowles, singing “XO,” a tune she said was one of Bryant’s favorites. Jimmy Kimmel, the comedian and late night talk show host, was emotional throughout. “I’ve been trying to come up with something positive to take away from this, and it was hard because there isn’t much. But the best thing I was able to come up with is this: Gratitude,” Kimmel said. “It seems to me that all we can do is to be grateful for the time we had with them and for the time we have left with each other.” Diana Taurasi, Sabrina Ionescu and Coach Geno Auriemma of Connecticut — a trio of women’s basketball titans — spoke about the impact of the Bryants on women’s basketball. Michael Jordan, Shaquille O’Neal and Rob Pelinka, Bryant’s former agent, also spoke and Alicia Keys and Christina Aguilera performed. Jordan, to whom Bryant was compared as a player, delivered one of the best punchlines of the day. “I’m going to have to look at another crying meme,” he said, referring to the oft-cited “Crying Jordan” meme that has been popular on social media since he was inducted into the basketball Hall of Fame.",The New York Times
2020,Vape Shops Face a Choice: Close or Rebrand?,"Hundreds of stores are stocked almost entirely with flavored nicotine products that will soon be illegal to sell in New Jersey. EAST HANOVER, N.J. — Adam Mitrani opened his first Darth Vapor e-cigarette shop six years ago after his carwash business collapsed. Before long, Mr. Mitrani, 48, had a second store in New Jersey and one in New York. Business was brisk, he said, and he was optimistic that offering smokers an alternative to tobacco would help him coast into retirement within 10 years. Instead, he is shutting down one of his New Jersey stores at the end of the month and preparing to stock the very item he has spent years helping customers quit — tobacco — in the other. Darth Vapor, like roughly 270 similar shops in New Jersey, is filled almost entirely with products that will be illegal to sell in the state by mid-April. Faced with growing fear about the risks of vaping, New Jersey last month became the second state to adopt legislation outlawing all nicotine vaping liquids other than those flavored to taste like tobacco. It has banned all fruit- and menthol-flavored e-cigarettes and cartridges, which are popular with teenagers, as well as most nicotine-infused liquids that are used in larger, hand-held vaping devices and are commonly sold in vape shops. Under New Jersey’s new law, Darth Vapor’s rows of disposable e-cigarettes, menthol Juul pods and flavors with names like “God Nectar,” “Joy on the Off Ramp” and “Apple Cinnamon Donut” must be gone by April 20. Only a handful of tobacco-flavored products can remain. “How does a whole store that pays employees and rent survive on five flavors of tobacco?” Mr. Mitrani said. “The answer is it can’t.” Many shop owners say they are selling off as much inventory as possible, operating on month-to-month leases and preparing to close. Others are making plans to sell pipes, tobacco products, CBD oil and kratom, an herbal supplement that the Food and Drug Administration has said can be dangerous, to try and stay afloat. New Jersey’s move is part of a flurry of government action aimed at slowing the alarming rate of vaping by teenagers. Vape shops nationwide are grappling with F.D.A. restrictions on flavored e-cigarette cartridges that took effect this month. More than five million youths — one in four American high school students and one in 10 middle school students — now vape, according to the National Youth Tobacco Survey released last summer. And across the nation, the sale of electronic cigarettes has become big business, climbing to $3.6 billion in sales last year, up from $1.5 billion in 2014, according to an industry report. Massachusetts adopted legislation similar to New Jersey’s in November after hundreds of people nationwide, many of them young men, were hospitalized over the summer with a mysterious vaping-related lung illness that as of late January had killed 60 people. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said the lung disease is “strongly linked” to vitamin E acetate, an additive in some products used to vape THC, the high-inducing ingredient in marijuana. Many shops in Massachusetts have undergone a metamorphosis similar to the ones stores in New Jersey are now considering: Close, or rebrand with a new inventory. Some states, including New York and Michigan, tried to temporarily stop the sale of flavored vaping products through executive orders, but lawsuits stalled those efforts. Cities like New York and San Francisco have outlawed many vaping products on their own. New Jersey’s law goes well beyond the new federal rules, which ban the sale of fruit- and dessert-flavored e-cigarette cartridges, or pods, that are placed in slim penlike devices, vaporized by a heated coil and smoked. Menthol cartridges are still permitted under the F.D.A. guidelines. The federal rules also gave vape shops a lifeline by continuing to permit the sale of a staple product: liquids used in open-tank systems. Supporters of New Jersey’s ban say flavors are especially popular with teenagers, and that any reduction in access to flavored nicotine will slowly drive down usage. Inhaling heated chemicals — most vaping liquids blend nicotine with propylene glycol — poses health risks for adults as well, many supporters noted. “Vaping is a health issue — not just for young people,” said Karen Blumenfeld, director of Global Advisors on Smokefree Policy, an advocacy group based in Summit, N.J. “Getting flavored vaping products off the market will protect our youth,” Assemblyman Herb Conaway, a physician who was among those who sponsored the legislation, said in a statement. “If we don’t, we will have another generation of young people addicted to nicotine.” Vape shop owners argue that limiting sales in stores where customers already must be 21 years old will not significantly curb teenage vaping, especially since flavored products remain readily available online. The law, they say, penalizes adults who turned to vaping as a way to quit smoking tobacco, which each year causes diseases that kill seven million people worldwide, including about 480,000 people in the United States. A study by the New England Journal of Medicine released last year found that e-cigarettes were nearly twice as effective as other nicotine replacement products, like patches and gum, for quitting smoking. “Every smoker who does not quit because of a lack of availability of flavors is a public health failure for the state of New Jersey,” said Gregory Conley, president of the American Vaping Association, a pro-vaping advocacy group. Mike Moran, the owner of two Firehouse E-Cigs and Vapors shops in southwest New Jersey, said he was planning to close both his stores and move out of state. Vape shops, he said, are being unfairly blamed for a public health scare over an illness that is believed to be primarily linked to vaping THC. “When there’s tainted romaine lettuce, the government doesn’t say stop eating leafy vegetables,” Mr. Moran said. “They say stop eating romaine.” The American Heart Association had argued that the legislation did not go far enough, and should have included a complete ban on all vaping flavors and tobacco and menthol cigarettes. An effort to end the sale of menthol cigarettes in New Jersey stalled in the Legislature. Disposable e-cigarettes also are still allowed under the federal guidelines, a loophole that teenagers have begun to exploit by switching from refillable e-cigarettes like Juul to disposable varieties like Puff Bars, which come packaged with nicotine cartridges and cannot be reloaded. New Jersey’s law makes disposable e-cigarettes illegal to sell. Gov. Philip D. Murphy, in a memo, called the new law “a necessary step to address the vaping epidemic among our state’s youth.” But the Democratic governor vetoed a related bill that would have raised the fines for selling vaping or tobacco products to people younger than 21, required age verification scanners at stores and capped the legal concentration of nicotine in vaping liquids sold in New Jersey at 2 percent. The nicotine requirement would have effectively pushed reusable Juul e-cigarettes out of the New Jersey market unless the company created a product with lower levels of nicotine, a highly addictive drug. Juul Labs, a Silicon Valley start-up that has dominated the youth vaping market, is partially owned by Altria, one of the world’s biggest tobacco companies, which sells Marlboro and other cigarette brands. Assemblyman John J. Burzichelli, a Democrat, opposed the flavor ban legislation, saying it would hurt small businesses without making a significant dent in what he agreed was a crisis in teenage vaping. “Nothing we did prevents people from finding the product — either on the black market or the internet,” Mr. Burzichelli said. “We’ve lost the ability to tax it. We’ve lost the ability to regulate it. We’re going to send them elsewhere to obtain it.” He also said he was disappointed that Mr. Murphy vetoed the nicotine-cap legislation. The governor’s veto memo called it “a piecemeal approach,” and aides cited complications with the bill’s requirements for taxing and tracking tobacco sales. Zack Lloyd, 21, said he started smoking cigarettes when he was 13. About three years ago, desperate to quit, he began using tobacco-flavored Juul e-cigarettes because they were closest in taste to what he had been smoking. But after getting hooked on flavored products, Mr. Lloyd, who lives in the state’s northernmost county, Sussex, said he would never return to tobacco cigarettes — or tobacco-flavored vapes. “No way,” he said on a recent afternoon while buying a pack of pink-lemonade flavored Mylé mini disposable e-cigarettes, a product he said he will try to buy online after the ban takes effect. “It is going to be annoying not to get it at a store.”",The New York Times
2020,Variety: Acrostic,"SUNDAY VARIETY COLUMN Every other Sunday, we complete a full orbit around Emily Cox and Henry Rathvon. ACROSTIC — Today’s excerpt is by Rachel Carson, the 20th-century nature writer whose brilliant “Silent Spring” greatly contributed to the modern environmental movement. Her work also foreshadowed many of the predicaments we find ourselves in today on our beautiful and fragile planet. The passage is from a different work, “(The) Sense of Wonder,” which was originally a 1950s magazine article presented as a way for adults to foster a sensitivity to nature in children. The passage concerns the rhythms of life, events that we can depend upon to occur in certain orders: the tides and the sunrise are two examples, as are seasons and the flight patterns of birds. Decades on, it seems designed to soothe a worried mind watching bizarre and unheard-of climate events occur daily, as well as to remind us all that we’re creatures of habit too, reliant on the mechanics of nature to tell us what to do. We just have to listen. Speaking of listening, I felt that Team Cox/Rathvon was sending signals in its cluing today, but I couldn’t really piece them together. This was a pretty slow solve for me — I got NANETTE, RAMIS, CATNAP, CHER and AEGEAN right off the bat, but couldn’t really scrape together any other entries without some lengthy mulling. I think that WEATHER, ORBIT, REBIRTH, EAST WIND and ETERNITY all worked nicely with the passage, and there were some other nods to natural forces. I had “oddball” for OFFBEAT, my only misdirect, and really loved the clue for EMERGENT. I will say that this puzzle had me pining for spring, although it’s just now February. That might be the toughest part of the solve today! If you’re interested in a macroscopic view of bird migration in the New World, this is a one-year look at these movements (based on a decade’s worth of data from a number of tagged birds). What did you think?",The New York Times
2020,Variety: Acrostic,"SUNDAY VARIETY COLUMN Emily Cox and Henry Rathvon remind us that getting older beats the alternative. ACROSTIC — Today’s passage is from a novel called “The Story of a Marriage,” by Andrew Sean Greer, a contemporary writer who won the 2018 Pulitzer Prize for fiction for a book called “Less.” Today’s book (which is not the basis for the 2019 film called “Marriage Story”) takes place in post-World War II San Francisco. It sounds fantastic from its reviews, a story about an unusual marriage that gets disrupted by mysterious revelations, with overtones of race and war throughout. The passage concerns a sort of love — maybe Team Cox/Rathvon were thinking a bit wryly of Valentine’s Day, maybe it’s just coincidence. There are some romantic overtures in the entries, like INFATUATE and ELOPED, but then there’s GET OUT and the ingeniously clued ENEMY SPY. Oh, also, my favorite deadpan joke of 2020 so far, the clue for SLINKY. SLINKY over TWISTY was great, but TWISTY next to EYE SOCKET was a tiny bit revolting. This wasn’t really a brain buster, I thought, as far as acrostics go. I expected something racier for OIL FIELD, the way it was clued; I also had “airstrike” for AVALANCHE and “reveille” for ASSEMBLE. What did you think?",The New York Times
2020,Variety: Acrostic,"SUNDAY VARIETY COLUMN Emily Cox and Henry Rathvon can hear a pin drop. ACROSTIC — We obviously never get a bad acrostic puzzle, but this is one of the ones that I think of as perfect, the kind that I would gladly push on someone new to the game. The passage is lovely, from a book by Steven Halpern called “Sound Healing: The Music and Sounds That Make Us Whole.” The clues are packed with sly references to the topic at hand, many of them rapturously sneaky. As far as the actual solve goes, the most important thing, it is also an acrostics clinic. The interplay between the clues/entries and the words in the grid is like a chess match; every time I entered a few letters, they suggested just enough for me to put together another entry or two. On top of that, one of the last entries I solved turned out to be a band I absolutely loved once, so I got a great blast of nostalgia. All in all, every enjoyable aspect of solving an acrostic is well represented. That last entry of mine was one of the musical references, which included the conductor Seiji OZAWA, ETTA JAMES, the genre of NOISE ROCK, Marvin HAMLISCH, PIANOFORTE and my old favorite, the EURYTHMICS. Given the content of the passage, these melodious ingredients were completely appropriate. However, Team Cox/Rathvon also included many entries of the cacophonous variety: a NEWBORN, an ARCADE, a TURBOFAN on a jet engine, the terrible SONAR that’s driving all the whales mad. These are also subtly relevant to the passage, which is a fond description of a city that somehow managed not to be earsplittingly noisy, even in the 20th century.

2020,Variety: Puns and Anagrams,"SUNDAY VARIETY COLUMN Andrew J. Ries has a few new experiments, and we are his subjects. VARIETY PUZZLE — I’m declaring 2020 the year of cryptic puzzles, all sorts, especially for those of you with a full year or more of standard crossword grids under your belts. They are witty and interesting, what you would get if you pulled all of the pun clues out of several standard puzzles and combined them. Solving Puns and Anagrams puzzles, or PandAs, is a great way to make the transition to cryptic puzzles from standard crosswords because they contain elements of both. They are also a total blast in their own right — once you get into them, you’ll never skip them again. Andrew J. Ries is a constructor of standard crosswords as well as PandAs and has provided us with a run of stellar themeless weekend puzzles (as well as a Sunday or two). I imagine that the thought process behind themeless grids also marries well with PandAs: a focus on an assemblage of bon mots rather than an overarching gimmick to tie the puzzle together. And now, on to actually solving this thing! As you can gather from the name, there are two distinct groups of clues: “Straight” anagrams, where you really just need to figure out what elements in the clue have letters to jumble into the entry word or term, and puns. The puns get really fun and freewheeling; the anagrams help with crosses and hints; and by the end, you’ve honed your skills in recognizing and manipulating both letters and meanings galore. For the sake of the explanation to follow, if you don’t see a clue, it’s fair to assume that it is an anagram that requires no steps other than mixing up letters in a word or words in the clue. For example, 33A: “Do well with ‘E.R.’ props.” You need to find a synonym for “Do well” using the letters from “E.R. props” — PROSPER. For this most self-explanatory anagram clue, your challenge is determining which elements in the clue are the definition and which are the anagram. If you’re beginning with these, try counting the number of letters in the entry and using that as a hint. Look at 8D, say, “I do art that’s skillful.” There are six letters in that entry, which correspond perfectly to the somewhat gawky “I do art” — this awkward phrase rearranges to something graceful, artful, skillful: ADROIT. For anyone who would now like to beef up their grid a little with similar clues, they can be found at 15A (think golf) and 17A (think Woodstock. I know! So weird). There are more at 26A (think U.S. space exploration), 32A (a term for remnant), 36A (synonym for syllabuses), 45A (competed), 47A (also a hospital). Toward the bottom of the puzzle, there’s 49A (think uncomfortably warm, or pressured), 51A (possess), 54A (gleeful), 57A (an award finalist), 58A (methods) and 59A (Pearly Gates). At the downs, anagrams await at 1, 5, 7, 13, 14, 24, 26, 29 and 42. There are a few two-step anagrams today: for example 20A, “100 snooty barons.” In many (but not all) cases, a number should be translated into whatever letters make up its Roman numeral equivalent. So here 100 is C. Mix that up with “snooty” and get TYCOONS, or barons. Think along these lines for 12D, where 151 becomes the beginning of a very relevant word. Another type of extrapolation occurs at 37A, where it could have been Roman numerals, but isn’t. “Excel” is XL; add those two letters to “free,” and scramble for a word for movement — REFLEX. Another example is tricky! At 47D, say “Empty” out loud to get the letters M and T. At 38A, a very simple reordering of “Bogart,” minus the “T,” gets you Greta GARBO. AT 33D, make “public relations” PR and rearrange “videos.” Please don’t be frustrated if you can’t tell pun clue from anagram yet! Constructors exploit that vulnerability all the time. After a few (dozen, maybe hundred) of these puzzles you won’t fall for as many misdirects. You will also hone your perception of pun types. Mr. Ries includes a panoply today (if you’re looking for a reference guide, I refer to this one when I determine what’s what). Full disclosure: I misunderstand clues and entries regularly and have no ego about it anymore, so if you see me blithely mis-explain something feel free to correct me in the comments. The first clue in the puzzle, in fact, went a little over my head. “Bits of advice on teasing” is a charade, or two-part clue: “Teasing” is RIB; add “Bits of advice,” or TIPS, to get RIBTIPS. I knew not of these delectable morsels, but I have heard of “burnt ends.” Are they the same thing? People have fought duels over this question, online at least. You might have seen letters from “Bits” in this entry as it filled in and suspected an anagram, but no. 8A: This is a homophone. One tip-off to that is the inclusion of “say,” which implies that the way something sounds out loud will matter. “Charges” can be fiscal or aggressive; “a levy” is also “a tax,” which sounds like ATTACKS when you say the phrase, right? 16A: One of a handful of visual puns with letters physically arranged, rather than anagrammed. This is the type of clue that my brain cops to once it’s pretty much solved — I had almost every letter on the crosses before I got DROPLET. Basically, the clue is the letters L, then E beneath it, then T beneath that, vertically dropping. Not like our confidence! Try 6D (think “on” as the missing link here), and 32D (“or”). 18A: This is a double definition, I think. A steeple is a SPIRE; to “put on a new” one is to RESPIRE (as a challenge, the prefix “re” appears elsewhere in the entries, with a different meaning — regarding, or “concerning,” at 34D). I thought it was interesting to find a few informal paired clues. This is one; I put RESPIRE with INHALE at 2D, a pun for people who “trusted IN [Nathan] HALE.” 19A: A perfect example of a tiny three-letter stumper, a mouse that roared. This is a “reversal,” indicated by “Returning” in the clue; the word that returns is “tar,” and the entry is RAT, who is someone who wisely deserts a sinking ship. 22A: Another little one and a favorite of mine today. A synonym for “cut,” that looks the same “upside down or right side up,” is MOW. Rotate your screen 180 degrees and you’ll see what Mr. Ries means. 23A: This is one your brain might have pondered in the past, because the drug in question has a storied history and a funny name, quaalude, LUDE for short. Try to come up with a term that means “avoid” using that nickname and “Electronic” and you’ll come up with ELUDE. 25A: Homophone. A sock or a sweater is a KNIT, rhymes with “nit,” as in “pick.” 27A: This is a container, meaning the answer is right there in front of you — just hiding. Look “in firepower” for a synonym for “Takeback,” and you’ll find REPO. Look to 9D for another example. 28A: Well, if it’s “Not an ‘if’ or an ‘and’”… we’re probably looking for ABUT. 29A: Here’s one of those Homer Simpson entries that sneaks up on you and makes you go “D’oh.” If you “leave mine out” of “Determine” you’re just left with DETER. 30A: This is explicitly paired with 38D, which is a double definition clue. That one is a word for “Women” that also means “measurements, in brief” — GALS, short for gallons. If that’s 38D, and you’re a bit of a goofball, then you’ll see that “festive occasions” for GALS must be GALAS. 39A: This is a delightfully morbid example of miscellany. A “hit man” does what you would think, he offs people — he’s an OFFER, one could say. 40A: The use of “in” here might get you thinking container; I searched for a minute for a four-letter segment, myself. Instead, take the initials of the four words “Massachussetts (sic! I just realized there’s a typo in this grid) and New York” and you get MANY. And an extra “S” in Massachusetts; if anyone can explain to me why that might be intentional I will crack up. 41A: This is a cousin to 19A — notice “back,” another way to say reversal or returning. This one is similarly inscrutable to me, where do “naps” come in? The answer is SPAN, though, which means “cross.” 46A: This one is a bit like 28A. “Up to the letter before U” would have to do with T, one letter back — (un)TIL T, in fact. I needed plenty of fill to get this one, as simple as it seems in retrospect. 48A: See above! Simply extend “ovation” by three letters for your answer here, although I can’t imagine doing this blind. After the fact, INN “ovation” is fine. There’s a similar thought process at 11D, another vowel — double consonant combo that makes _ _ _ EAR a word. 52A: I tripped myself up with “bite” for “venom,” seeing the last few letters here from down entries. “Venom” is also SPITE — thus, “de venom” becomes DESPITE. 56A: Someone “reads” an eye chart; the E in eye makes the entry EREADER. To the downs! For the sake of brevity (too late, I know!) I’m just going to pick out the toughies here. If you get stuck on another down, ask in the comments, especially if you’re a few boxes away from completion. 3D: Solved on crosses, over here. “Ursa Major” is a constellation, overhead — a BEAR UP, I guess. Actually, I don’t guess — I don’t think I would ever have guessed this on my own. 4D: This is a flavor of wordplay unique to PandAs, I believe; it’s a fill-in-the-blanks thing. You need to find letters that make sense in two ways. First, they need to fill in “Con _ a_ _ er” so you get a word; then, those three letters together become a synonym for that word. How about a TIN, as in a “container” of tea? There’s another example of this at 10D, and one at the very end of the downs. You’ll get them. 28D: “Generic beer” is ALEX here, as in “brand X.” 31D: “One each” is APER — I would have thought “a pop,” but APER is its own word, so there you go. 35D: I have never seen a number clue quite like this before, and it’s awfully clever. 14,589,687 is One Four Five Eight Nine Six Eight Seven — OFFENSES, or “Violations.” 36D: A mordant entry: “Juvenile detention centers” are places that CAN TEENS. 40D: Both sides to this double definition are tricky: “Joints” in woodworking are MITERS; “Cambridge collegians” might go to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which would make them M.I.T.-ERS as well. 46D: “You ‘n’ I” are pretty informal; when we have to carry things, we TOTEM. 50D: I think this is the only clue today that asks us to pick odds or evens. Here, take the second, fourth, sixth and eighth letters in “sailboats” to get a word meaning “Loads of.” 53D: This little one works both ways, either a PAT or a TAP — it’s a touch going down as well as a “touch up.” Phew! I hope you’re looking at a finished grid. What did you think?",The New York Times
2020,Variety: Spiral,"SUNDAY VARIETY COLUMN Will Shortz takes a spin in the constructor’s seat. SPIRAL — We get the occasional spiral, always from Will Shortz, who once confessed to borrowing this style of puzzle from one called “La Doppia Rotazione” from Piccola Enigmistica, a puzzle magazine once published in Florence, Italy. It is a beautiful, stylish presentation. You’re given two sets of clues, “Inward” and “Outward,” and one lovely, coiling, 100-character-long stream of boxes to fill. One letter goes in each box, and that letter is used twice — once in a word going in, one in a word going out. Each clue is given with the numbers where you place it in the spiral, from 1 to 100, which is critical for figuring this whole thing out. Anything you can deduce from word length and clue, in other words, you can place in its designated boxes; you know the direction and the spot. Look for any low-hanging fruit that you can fill in with confidence and keep a close eye on whether you’re filling in clockwise, which is “Outward,” or counterclockwise, “Inward.” Try to keep those two directions straight and you’ve won at least a quarter of the battle, but the clues Mr. Shortz presents are tough nuts to crack. For this particular puzzle, I had sound guesses for the ends of the string. I figured that “Person’s total assets minus liabilities,” the first “Outward” clue, had to be NET WORTH, and that turned out to be correct at the very tightest inner part of the spiral. Its counterpart at the end of the “Inward” clues is ROW TEN. For the other end, the very outside boxes 1-5 (and 4-1, if you get me), I went with BILGE running inward, which gave me GLIB running outward (for “Smooth-tongued”). There were huge swaths of empty space on the inside for a while. The next stab I took was GODDESSES for “Venus and others;” I usually shy away from guessing longer words without a little hint on either end, but that seemed like a sure bet as “planets” wasn’t long enough. That led to OBSESSED running the other direction (for “Completely unwilling to give something up”). I did enter “clone” for 62-58, “Exact copy,” instead of XEROX. Fixing that helped me get LUXOR and EXTRACTS. Otherwise I think I avoided misdirection. One place where I could see people getting caught was in the outermost ring, where Mr. Shortz must have enjoyed running DOGLEG outward, for “Turn on a golf course,” just about where he clued “Hit with a club,” running inward. I’m sure that some people wanted “putted” there, another golf term, but it’s CUDGEL — the GEL being the same three letters as LEG in DOGLEG. This is a great puzzle for the spot where you take your espresso break, or tea, if you have that civilized habit. You definitely need to adjust your viewfinder from squares in a grid to this linear two-way twist, but it’s the type of challenge that you can walk away from and re-acclimate yourself to pretty easily. I got stuck on something to do with “cuffs” for the clue for 78-71, “Like some shirts and perps;” uncuffed? cuff-free? Stumped, I put this down for a while, less than an hour — COLLARED popped right into my head. A very apt entry today is CANNOLIS, which greatly resemble the Spiral puzzle, and they’re both Italian. In bocca al lupo, solvers! What did you think?",The New York Times
2020,Venezuela solo tiene un camino: convocar elecciones presidenciales libres y justas,"Comentario Será necesario coordinar las estrategias nacional, regional e internacional si se pretende ponerle fin a la crisis del país en las urnas. La autora es subcomisionada presidencial para las relaciones exteriores del gobierno interino de Venezuela. PARÍS — Los ciudadanos venezolanos sufren, mueren y abandonan el país en un promedio de 5000 personas por día. La crisis ha reverberado más allá de nuestras fronteras. Cada vez se hace más evidente que la estabilidad del hemisferio depende de lo que los venezolanos y sus aliados globales estén dispuestos a hacer para lograr avances. La celebración de elecciones presidenciales libres y justas será un paso vital para restaurar las libertades ciudadanas y el Estado de derecho y volver a gozar de prosperidad y estabilidad. Sobre todo, las elecciones presidenciales garantizarán que no se pierda una generación más en manos del régimen corrupto e ilegítimo de Nicolás Maduro. Este fue el mensaje que dio Juan Guaidó —a quien Estados Unidos y varias decenas de países reconocen como presidente encargado de Venezuela—, a jefes de Estado y dignatarios extranjeros en el transcurso de estas últimas semanas, tras desafiar con valentía una prohibición de viajar impuesta por Maduro sin fundamento legal. En mi carácter de subcomisionada presidencial para las relaciones exteriores del gobierno interino, tuve el privilegio de acompañar al presidente Guaidó durante sus reuniones por Europa y América del Norte. Nuestro objetivo fue transmitir la escala de los horrores que ha infligido Maduro a la inocente población venezolana y urgir a nuestros aliados a que se unan para respaldar una estrategia global coordinada. En cada reunión, Guaidó comunicó con tono de urgencia a sus homólogos que la escala de esta crisis crece de manera exponencial cada día que pasa. La hiperinflación no ha parado. Más del 80 por ciento de la población no tiene acceso a alimentos básicos y medicamentos y el sistema de salud del país se ha desmoronado. Por lo menos cuatro millones de venezolanos han salido del país hasta ahora, y se espera que todavía lo hagan otros millones más. El mundo comienza a percatarse de que Maduro encabeza una organización delictiva implicada en crímenes de lesa humanidad y que opera un Estado paralelo basado en una lógica criminal desestabilizante para la región. Ha evadido sanciones y explotado vacíos en la legislación financiera gracias al respaldo y apoyo financiero de Rusia, China, Turquía y Cuba. Emplea oro (extraído en condiciones ilegales y criminales para canalizar dinero al régimen de Maduro) para destruir la selva venezolana, deforestar miles de acres de reservas naturales, envenenar nuestros ríos con mercurio, desarraigar y amenazar a comunidades indígenas y traficar con grupos terroristas irregulares. Nuestros vecinos también tienen problemas para lidiar con el mayor éxodo migratorio en la historia del hemisferio. El apoyo de Maduro a los grupos de guerrillas colombianas, incluida la disidencia de las Farc y el Ejército de Liberación Nacional, además de grupos terroristas internacionales como Hezbolá y escuadrones paramilitares de la muerte, ha provocado que escalen la violencia y la inestabilidad, no solo en Venezuela, sino en toda la región. Aunque varios países han reaccionado con alarma ante estas condiciones desastrosas, las estrategias para acotar la crisis, desde sanciones y ayuda humanitaria hasta mediación, han tenido resultados diversos. Si bien todos estos enfoques son importantes, el problema es que, en general, se han aplicado de forma aislada e, incluso, de manera muy desigual. Por lo tanto, es fundamental que las próximas medidas a seguir sincronicen los enfoques regionales con los de la coalición de alrededor de sesenta países que reconocen la labor de Guaidó en defensa de la democracia y la libertad de Venezuela. Las acciones encabezadas por la comunidad internacional, con el apoyo del Grupo de Lima, los dirigentes de Estados Unidos y el apoyo de Europa, deben coordinarse en una iniciativa global que coadyuve a garantizar las condiciones necesarias para realizar elecciones en algunos meses. Los venezolanos tenemos derecho a decidir nuestro propio futuro. Esta iniciativa global debe construirse a partir de incentivos y presiones multilaterales estratégicas. Algunos países, empezando por Estados Unidos y Canadá, ya han impuesto sanciones severas en contra de Maduro y sus aliados por violaciones de los derechos humanos en Venezuela; los demás países deben alinearse con esas sanciones y acabar con los vacíos en la legislación financiera, en particular en Europa, donde han permitido que sus facilitadores laven ilícitamente millones. Al interior de Venezuela, debemos garantizar que todos los partidos tengan la libertad de participar en las elecciones sin temores ni obstáculos. Conforme al mandato constitucional, la Asamblea Nacional debe contar con condiciones para elegir un nuevo Consejo Nacional Electoral independiente, así como constituir de nuevo un Tribunal Supremo independiente. Así mismo, debe garantizarse que observadores electorales independientes, tanto nacionales como internacionales, tengan acceso al proceso sin restricciones. Si queremos lograr avances significativos hacia una solución real, ahora es tiempo de exigir un proceso electoral conveniente, justo y libre. No podemos seguir permitiendo que el régimen de Maduro dicte nuestro futuro. Debemos dejarle muy claro a Maduro y sus secuaces que el statu quo, tal como lo conoce, se ha terminado.

2020,"Venezuela’s Socialists Embrace Business, Making Partner of a ‘Parasite’","Decades of socialist-style control devastated the economy. Now, capitalism is back, helping keep the country afloat — and Nicolás Maduro in power. One deal was the cornerstone of that transformation. Sign up for El Times, a newsletter with our best stories in Spanish, con eñes y acentos. CARACAS, Venezuela — As Venezuela tumbled deeper into economic crisis in 2017 and its people searched for a way out, one name kept coming up: Lorenzo Mendoza. The family name is universally known in Venezuela. Empresas Polar, the food conglomerate started by Mr. Mendoza’s grandfather, had grown into the country’s largest private company. Its corn meal, used to make the national dish, was in every pantry, and its beer a welcome part of social gatherings. As President Nicolás Maduro’s disastrous economic policies set off food shortages and a refugee crisis, Mr. Mendoza emerged as an outspoken critic of his administration and its persecution of the private sector. Polished and eloquent, Mr. Mendoza also offered a stark contrast to the gruff president. His popularity was such that pollsters measured him against Mr. Maduro in mock presidential matchups. Then, suddenly, Mr. Mendoza disappeared from public view, and Mr. Maduro stopped calling him a “thief,” a “parasite” and a “traitor.” The government quit harassing Polar with disruptive raids and began, in time, to adopt the economic changes Mr. Mendoza had proposed, like ending crippling price controls. The story behind Mr. Mendoza and Mr. Maduro’s truce, sealed in a previously unreported meeting in mid-2018, describes the rapprochement between Venezuela’s self-styled revolutionary government and the business class it waged war against for nearly two decades. The unlikely thaw has been the cornerstone of Venezuela’s recent transformation from a country where the government closely controlled the economy — and derived its legitimacy from the benefits it was able to offer its people — to a place ruled by an autocrat willing to allow de facto capitalism in order to stave off collapse and assure his continued grip on power. The surprising turn has hardly solved Venezuela’s economic troubles. But it has reignited sectors of the economy, encouraged some investment and allowed Mr. Maduro to withstand American sanctions and international isolation. And for the businessmen, the changes have meant getting back to business. “It’s very difficult to explain that we’re in a very bad economic situation, but that there’s optimism,” said Ricardo Cusanno, head of Venezuela’s biggest industry group, Fedecamaras. “Serious people, traditional people are deciding to continue investing.” As Venezuela’s once-mighty state firms grind to a halt, Mr. Maduro’s ministries have quietly handed back to private operators dozens of companies, including iconic hotels and sugar mills, that they had expropriated, according to a government adviser who helped draft the program. Tracts of land expropriated by Mr. Maduro’s firebrand predecessor and mentor, Hugo Chávez, from the landowning elites in the name of the country’s “Bolivarian Revolution” are being leased to anyone willing to work them. Raids on private companies have given way to cordial meetings between ministers and business leaders. The stringent labor laws that had barred companies from firing anyone without government approval are now disregarded as the administration turns a blind eye to dismissals and dismantles unions. Byzantine trade restrictions were replaced with tax holidays and export incentives. Mr. Maduro’s biggest concession was ending the rigid currency controls that had hung over every economic transaction. Suddenly allowed to use dollars, Venezuelan businesspeople imported supplies and paid better wages, partly offsetting a collapse in state production. To be sure, after six years of unremitting contraction, Venezuela is a shadow of its former self, a bare-bones extractive economy kept afloat by shrinking oil exports, illegal gold trade and small-scale private initiative. Under Mr. Maduro, the country has lost almost three-quarters of its gross domestic product, with almost nine of 10 Venezuelans struggling to meet basic needs. Almost five million of the country’s 30 million people have fled, depriving companies of clients and workers. And local officials continue extorting businesses. But the recent economic liberalization has created opportunities for companies able to adjust to serving the one in 10 Venezuelans with dollars to spare. The economy is much reduced, said Mr. Cusanno, of the industry group, but “the fact that it’s still half alive is thanks to the private sector.” The working relationship reached by the government and big business is a startling turnaround from decades of tension. In 2002, the president of the business group then led a failed coup against Mr. Chávez. Later, the country’s biggest companies, including Polar, joined a 90-day national strike against him. But Mr. Maduro’s ability to crush the opposition and withstand international pressure left Venezuelan business leaders with a stark choice: adapt or leave. For its part, the government realized it needed private capital to survive. Mr. Mendoza’s Polar has come to represent this accommodation. The Mendoza family, who built Polar from a small brewery in the 1940s into a ubiquitous food conglomerate, has epitomized the traditional elites that Mr. Chávez promised to sweep away on taking power in 1999. Before the economic crisis, the company employed 34,000 people and claimed to produce 3.3 percent of the country’s gross domestic product outside of oil. As Mr. Chávez showered Venezuelans with the proceeds of the oil boom to build what he called “21st century socialism,” Polar’s old-fashioned corporatism offered an alternative. The company’s generous benefits, including everything from summer camps to school uniforms, had earned it the fierce loyalty of its workers and the admiration of most Venezuelans. The charismatic Mr. Mendoza, 54, skillfully combined egalitarianism on the shop floor with a detached elitism in his own social milieu. The billionaire Mendozas had become Venezuela’s social royalty, gathering together the country’s elite at parties that drew up to 1,500 people to the family mansion. To their supporters, the Mendozas represented the opposite of the principles espoused by Mr. Maduro: They stood for professionalism over improvisation, tradition over revolution. The long-running tensions between the company and the government spilled into open conflict when the economy went into recession in 2014. As revenues dried up, Mr. Maduro began to accuse Mr. Mendoza, without proof, of hoarding products and worsening shortages. The threats were accompanied by escalating harassment. Tax inspectors constantly raided Polar’s facilities, pro-government unions instigated labor unrest, and security forces hijacked its food trucks and detained its managers. By 2017, Polar was nearing bankruptcy. Its food division was hemorrhaging money because price controls forced it to sell products for a few cents. The beer division reeled from the loss of subsidized barley. Under family pressure, Mr. Mendoza sought contact with Mr. Maduro’s economic czar, Tareck El Aissami, a savvy business operator charged by the United States with drug trafficking, according to two people familiar with the talks. Mr. El Aissami, who has denied the drug charges, had long argued that the government had to abandon its Marxist dogma to ensure its survival. In him, Mr. Mendoza had found a sympathetic ear. Mr. Mendoza’s entreaties culminated in a 2018 meeting with Venezuela’s powerful first lady, Cilia Flores, according to five people familiar with the meeting. The encounter yielded an informal pact that has held to date: Mr. Mendoza would exit the public stage, and the government would stop harassing the company. “The government was hitting them very hard,” said Jhonny Magdaleno, a veteran union leader and retired Polar worker. “Then, it suddenly stopped.” Polar did not respond to detailed questions for this article. As Mr. El Aissami’s economic overhaul accelerated over the past year, so did the thaw between Polar and the government. The raids on its facilities ceased. And Mr. Maduro stopped talking about Polar and its peers, finding a new scapegoat in the United States. The government stopped coercing Polar into handing over its products at reduced prices. Today, the government provides major private producers with raw materials and negotiates food purchases on market terms, according to industry sources. Shops are full again, even if products are out of reach for most Venezuelans. Market conditions remain difficult for Polar. Many of its plants are shuttered or operate at a fraction of capacity, and the company has shed about 15,000 workers. The changes, however, have allowed it to reinvent itself as a smaller, nimbler operator focusing on Venezuela’s wealthier customers and balancing domestic decline with foreign expansion. The biggest changes have occurred in Polar’s relationship with staff. Gone are the legendary benefits that supported workers and their families from childhood into old age, even bankrolling their funerals. The company has suspended thousands of workers, with the government’s acquiescence. “They ignore the complaints, they fire the troublemakers,” said Mr. Magdaleno, the union leader. “They didn’t used to do that before.” A union activist at Polar, Miguel Pirona, said he was suspended last March from his job in the industrial city of Valencia for protesting benefit cuts. Mr. Pirona said that when he gathered a group of workers outside the plant to protest, they were dispersed by soldiers. “Before, they would come to help,” Mr. Pirona said of the government. “Now they come to threaten.” Despite the cuts, many workers remain committed to the company, which they say still offers the best blue-collar jobs in the crisis-stricken economy. A worker at the flagship corn meal plant earns about $50 a month, the equivalent of 20 times the minimum wage. But maintaining that loyalty also means letting go of the idea of what the company was. Darwin Carmona, 35, worked his entire adult life at Polar’s beer plant in Caracas. He was suspended without pay in 2016, along with thousands of others, because the company said it had run out of raw materials. After a court ruled in their favor, Mr. Carmona said the company reinstated him last February, only to suspend him again months later. When his newborn daughter fractured an elbow in December, he found Polar’s health insurance no longer covered her. “When Chávez was alive, the laws were respected,” Mr. Carmona said about Polar. Now, “the government lets them do whatever they want.” Mariana Martínez and Isayen Herrera contributed reporting from Caracas, and Tibisay Romero from Valencia, Venezuela.",The New York Times
2020,"Opinion | Vengeance Is Mine, Saith the President","Acquitted of impeachment charges, Trump goes after those who defied him. Ms. Cottle is a member of the editorial board. John Bolton, Joe Manchin, Adam Schiff, Hunter Biden, Doug Jones, Gordon Sondland, Alexander Vindman, Yevgeny Vindman, Mitt Romney, Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, Jerry Nadler, Debbie Dingell, New York air travelers, federal prosecutors, the F.B.I. It’s been a mere week since Senate Republicans acquitted President Trump in his impeachment trial — assuring him once and for all that he needn’t fret about congressional accountability — but he has already made significant progress on his enemies list. Members of Congress, administration officials, law enforcement officials, residents of blue states — anyone who has ever displeased Mr. Trump is a potential target. Heads may not wind up on literal pikes, but the president is already neck-deep into his reprisal tour. The president’s targets can be sorted into multiple different categories, some better equipped than others to endure his wrath. Democratic senators such as Mr. Jones of Alabama and Mr. Manchin of West Virginia, both of whom have drawn Trumpian ire for their votes to convict the president, understand that politics is a blood sport. Ditto House members like Ms. Dingell, whom Mr. Trump randomly attacked again over the weekend, and Mr. Schiff, who was the point person on impeachment. These professionals know how to brush off — or brush back — the taunts. After a particularly childish screed, in which Mr. Trump called Mr. Manchin “Joe Munchkin,” the West Virginia lawmaker returned fire Monday on CNN: “I guess he’s confused on that, because I am a little bigger than him. He’s got me about 30 pounds on weight. But I am a little taller than him.” And the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, can certainly hold her own against a presidential tantrum. Mr. Romney, the lone Republican to vote to convict Mr. Trump of abuse of power, is more exposed. It’s not just the president mocking him and denigrating his religious faith. The White House also blasted out nasty talking points for surrogates to disseminate. Title: “Romney (Once Again) Ditches Principles to Seek Far Left’s Adulation.” That said, Mr. Romney is a former presidential combatant. He knows how to take a punch. He also isn’t up for re-election until 2024, plenty of time for all this to pass. In the meantime, he’ll enjoy some brand burnishing in non-Trump circles for having followed his conscience. Mr. Trump is also grumpy with Mr. Bolton, the former national security adviser who, The Times reported, wrote in his forthcoming memoir that the president told him that there was a link between Ukraine aid and the announcement of investigations of Joe Biden and his son. In addition to calling Mr. Bolton a liar, Mr. Trump has sought to block the release of his book, and there is talk of stripping him of his security clearance. But Mr. Bolton, too, is nobody’s victim. He is a seasoned Washington knife-fighter who played his own coy game with impeachment investigators. It’s also hard to feel too sorry for Gordon Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union whom Mr. Trump fired last week. Mr. Sondland essentially bought his diplomatic post with fat donations to Mr. Trump’s inauguration. He changed his testimony mid-impeachment, rendering him a less than exemplary witness. He is, above all, a cautionary tale for those willing to sell their souls for power and prestige. Far more troubling is the assault on not-so-political public servants, such as Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a key impeachment witness. On Friday, Colonel Vindman was ousted from his post on the National Security Council. Creepier still, the president also fired Colonel Vindman’s twin brother, Yevgeny, a lawyer at the National Security Council who was not an impeachment witness. Such gratuitous score-settling carries a whiff of the Cosa Nostra, in which talking to the feds results in one’s family being targeted — in part to send a message to other potential rats. Mr. Trump is making perfectly clear the high cost of questioning his questionable behavior or cooperating with Congress. Also this week, federal prosecutors are back in the president’s cross hairs. On Monday, prosecutors recommended sentencing Roger Stone, Mr. Trump’s longtime political fixer who was convicted in November on charges stemming from Robert Mueller’s investigation of Russian influence, to seven to nine years behind bars. This did not sit well with the president, who was up in the wee hours on Tuesday tweeting his displeasure. “Disgraceful!” he erupted shortly before 1 a.m. Not quite an hour later, he elaborated: “This is a horrible and very unfair situation. The real crimes were on the other side, as nothing happens to them. Cannot allow this miscarriage of justice!” By Tuesday afternoon, the Justice Department had dutifully announced it would revisit the “grossly disproportionate” sentencing recommendation. All four prosecutors handling the case promptly withdrew. Far from denying Operation Vengeance, the White House has been justifying it. In the run-up to the president’s acquittal address last Thursday, the White House press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, assured Fox News viewers that he would be talking about “just how horribly he was treated and, you know, that maybe people should pay for that.” Mr. Trump is now hard at work making that happen.

2020,"Veronica Escobar to Focus on Health Care, Guns in Spanish-Language Response to Trump","The first-term congresswoman from Texas had a visceral response to President Trump’s State of the Union address last year. Now she has the chance to rebut him directly. WASHINGTON — When President Trump delivered his State of the Union address in 2019, he pointed to El Paso as a sign of the success of his immigration policies, claiming it had been transformed from “one of our nation’s most dangerous cities” to “one of the safest cities in our country” by the construction of a border wall. In the audience, Representative Veronica Escobar, the Democrat who represents the majority of the predominantly Hispanic city bordering Mexico, was visibly furious at the president’s reference to her community, crossing her arms from her seat on the House floor and mouthing “oh my God, oh my God.” “He’s lying about what happened before the wall,” she said afterward. “El Paso has been a safe community for decades. We were long before a wall was ever constructed.” A year later, Ms. Escobar will have the chance to respond directly to Mr. Trump, not just for her community but for the Democratic Party, when she delivers the Spanish-language rebuttal from El Paso to Mr. Trump’s State of the Union address on Tuesday night. Speaking at a community clinic along the southwestern border, Ms. Escobar plans to focus in part on health care — a priority for voters, particularly those concerned about protections for pre-existing conditions — and what Democrats have accomplished in their first year in control of the House of Representatives, including passing legislation out of that chamber expanding background checks on gun purchases. “The speech will not and cannot be about El Paso, because this is the Democratic response,” Ms. Escobar said. But, she added, “It was important to deliver the speech from El Paso, because El Paso has been at the center of the administration’s policies.” Along with Governor Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, who will deliver a response in English from East Lansing High School, Ms. Escobar will be tasked with framing the Democrats’ official answer to Mr. Trump’s prime-time speech to a joint session of Congress, with each woman receiving about 10 minutes to speak after the president concludes. The selection of Ms. Escobar, a freshman, to give the speech on Tuesday night reflected her rising profile within the Democratic caucus. Her community of El Paso has become the epicenter of some of the most politically fraught debates of Mr. Trump tenure, over his administration’s treatment of immigrants and the president’s own ugly rhetoric about them. “Cosmic justice” is how her friend, Representative Sylvia Garcia, a fellow freshman Democrat from Texas, put it, Ms. Escobar recalled, when she learned that Ms. Escobar had been chosen to respond to Mr. Trump. (Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, informed Ms. Escobar of the decision last month, waking the Texas congresswoman with an early-morning phone call as Ms. Pelosi was about to board a plane for a congressional trip to mark the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz.) In an interview on Tuesday, Ms. Escobar said it was fitting for her be delivering the Democratic rebuttal from her district. “Through every challenge that has been presented to us as a community, El Paso has risen to the challenge in the most beautiful way,” she said. “We represent the best of America. We represent what America can be in the face of challenges.” Among the first two Latina women to represent Texas in the House along with Ms. Garcia, Ms. Escobar was first elevated as a voice of authority by Democratic leadership over the summer during a fraught debate over sending supplementary aid to the southwestern border. Months later, she was chosen by her congressional peers to become a representative for the freshman class in Ms. Pelosi’s leadership circle. A member of the House Judiciary Committee, Ms. Escobar has publicly clashed with the president, particularly after a gunman, warning of a “Hispanic invasion,” killed 22 people at a superstore in El Paso in August. When the White House invited Ms. Escobar, a third-generation resident of El Paso, to join the president in a visit to the city after the shooting, she instead asked for a phone call to tell Mr. Trump that the language he has often used to describe Latinos is dehumanizing. The president, she said, was “too busy” to talk, and Ms. Escobar declined to accompany him on the trip. “The president uses hyperbole, and is often flat-out dishonest in what he tells the American public,” Ms. Escobar said. “We cannot confront out challenges if we’re not honest about what they are.” After graduating from New York University with a master’s degree in English literature, Ms. Escobar returned to Texas and volunteered with an immigration group and political campaigns. She then ran for office herself, winning a seat on El Paso County’s governing body before seeking the House seat vacated by Beto O’Rourke, who in 2018 unsuccessfully ran against Senator Ted Cruz. Ms. Escobar said she first wrote her speech in English, her first language, before translating it to Spanish, in part to help facilitate the translation of words like “background check” that she does not normally use in Spanish. Her husband timed her delivery, as she whittled down the speech from 15 minutes to 10 minutes and finalized it Monday morning. “It was challenging to think of what to focus on and what to let go of,” she said.",The New York Times
2020,"Veterans Affairs, a Trump Signature Issue, Is Facing Turmoil Again","The mysterious firing of the department’s deputy secretary was the latest incident to shake the agency as it embarks on ambitious changes to health care. WASHINGTON — As President Trump enters his re-election year, his administration’s focus on the nation’s veterans has emerged as a centerpiece of the campaign. But the agency tasked with caring for more than nine million former service members, a department he claims to have transformed, is showing signs of disarray. The mysterious firing last week of the deputy secretary of veterans affairs was only the latest in a string of incidents that have shaken the second-largest cabinet agency in the government as it embarks on ambitious changes to veterans health care. The department’s secretary, Robert L. Wilkie, got into an unusual public confrontation last month with a senior House policy adviser on female veterans issues who said she was sexually assaulted at the Department of Veterans Affairs hospital in Washington. After receiving a complaint that Mr. Wilkie had tried to dig up dirt on the woman, a reserve Navy intelligence officer, the House Veterans Affairs Committee filed a formal complaint with the department’s inspector general. Last fall, that same inspector general reported that a new office formed to protect whistle-blowers often retaliated against them instead. A health program that is central to the Trump administration’s aggressive expansion of care outside the department’s health facilities, known as the Mission Act, has hit snags right out of the gate. Congressional officials were told that millions of dollars more would probably be needed to meet the plan’s coverage goals. Department officials admitted to lawmakers that they had no clue how much the outside care was costing or how many were seeking it. Finally, a $16 billion overhaul of the veterans medical records system has been delayed amid technical and training glitches. Several people who work inside or closely with the department attributed some of the issues to Mr. Wilkie’s inattention to the herculean tasks he was supposed to carry out at the long-troubled department as he is seen to be lobbying for other jobs in the administration, most notably secretary of defense, or ponders an eventual career in politics. The perpetual turmoil has agitated members of veterans’ service organizations, which have sparred with Mr. Wilkie as their influence has waned. “There is a leadership challenge going on over there,” said Randy Reese, the executive director of Disabled American Veterans. “The fault of not changing the culture rests on his desk.” More ominous for Mr. Wilkie is the increasing impatience at Concerned Veterans for America, a conservative organization with substantial backing from the billionaire Charles G. Koch that has had enormous influence on the Trump administration’s veterans policies. That influence is especially evident in the new program allowing veterans to seek health care outside the department’s traditional medical centers. Leaders of Concerned Veterans for America, like many current and former veterans department officials, fear the problems could presage the return to a dark era when inattention to veterans’ health care led to scandals and tragedies. “We are going to be really watching over the next six months,” said Dan Caldwell, the group’s senior adviser and former executive director. The organization was instrumental in ousting the last secretary, David J. Shulkin, who was dismissed in 2018 by presidential tweet. “We were supportive of Secretary Wilkie assuming the position of V.A. secretary and are pleased with a lot of things he has done,” Mr. Caldwell said. “Everybody needs to be focused on getting these new programs right and not scoring political points. If the Mission Act doesn’t work, if female veterans don’t feel comfortable getting care at the V.A., then that is doing harm to the brave people who served our country.” Mr. Trump has long made veterans central to his political platform and considers them a key part of his base. The White House last week proposed a 10 percent increase to the Department of Veterans Affairs budget, to $243 billion, even as it seeks to scale back most other nonmilitary spending. Congress, ever mindful of the politics of veterans care, is almost certain to comply, in spite of the recent troubles. While the department is second only to the Defense Department in size and budget, it operates with far less oversight of its spending and activities. And while the mission of the Pentagon is higher in profile, lawmakers are loath to cut services for veterans or lose facilities in their districts, and they rarely suggest cuts to the department, regardless of its inefficiencies or problems. The department has suffered decades of scandals, and in 2014 investigators found patients waiting an average of 115 days for appointments at the Phoenix medical center, where workers fraudulently reported far shorter waits. The department has subsequently endured a variety of intrigue and political infighting and has had four secretaries over five years. Last fall, Andrea Goldstein, a Navy veteran and the senior policy adviser for the Women Veterans Task Force on the House Veterans Affairs Committee, told The New York Times that she was assaulted while buying a snack at the medical center’s cafeteria in Washington. After investigating, the veterans department’s Office of Inspector General declined to bring charges. Mr. Wilkie, against the advice of his staff, three people said, then sent a letter to Representative Mark Takano of California, the committee’s chairman, denouncing the claim as “unsubstantiated” and chastising Mr. Takano for bringing it to the fore. In an unusual rebuke, Michael J. Missal, the inspector general, wrote to Mr. Wilkie to say that characterizing Ms. Goldstein’s allegation as unsubstantiated was incorrect. Four people with direct knowledge said that Mr. Wilkie and his senior aides also embarked on a campaign to discredit Ms. Goldstein’s claims by suggesting that she had made similar accusations many times before. Mr. Takano received complaints about those efforts and referred the matter to the inspector general. Senior aides to Mr. Wilkie flatly denied that he had orchestrated any effort to discredit Ms. Goldstein. “The secretary is the most ethical, decent, honorable man I have ever known,” said Pam Powers, Mr. Wilkie’s chief of staff. “At no time did the secretary ever direct, discuss or insinuate that somebody should investigate Ms. Goldstein’s background.” The dispute has surfaced as the department is aggressively seeking to increase the number of women, who are a growing percentage of veterans overall, using its medical centers. It also comes amid reports from female patients and staff members — in at least one case a medical director — of harassment and assault by male veterans at the centers. “The general sense is outrage,” said Kristen L. Rouse, the founder of the NYC Veterans Alliance, who like many female veterans has received an outpouring of emails and calls from other female veterans who said they had experiences similar to Ms. Goldstein’s. Christina Mandreucci, a spokeswoman for the department, said that “Secretary Wilkie acknowledges that describing the allegations as ‘unsubstantiated’ was a poor choice of words, and he withdraws that word.” At the same time, the department is focused on the rollout of a broad expansion of health care from private physicians, many of whom are reluctant to do business with the agency because of its history of slow payments. Health care provider networks are scrambling to build capacity without really knowing how many patients they will need to serve in the 36 states where the program will begin in May. “I’ve heard from a number of South Dakota providers, who contract with the V.A. to deliver health care services to veterans, who are owed millions of dollars in overdue claims,” Senator Mike Rounds, Republican of South Dakota, said at a recent hearing. “Because of this, they are now in the terrible position of possibly having to turn away veterans seeking care.” A week ago, the deputy veterans affairs secretary, James Byrne, was asked to remain behind after a morning meeting. Mr. Wilkie then told Mr. Byrne that he had “lost confidence” in his No. 2 and that he needed to resign. “For two and a half years I had the privilege of working with dedicated professionals at the V.A. providing care benefits and services to deserving veterans,” Mr. Byrne said. No further explanation has been publicly offered by department officials for his dismissal. “The second-highest person in the second-biggest agency in the federal government got fired, and no one knows why,” said Kristofer Goldsmith, the chief investigator for Vietnam Veterans of America. “It is mind-blowing.” Those with an interest in the department saw this as another distressing sign of turmoil. “The bottom line is that the current V.A. has a lot to be proud of,” said Mr. Caldwell of Concerned Veterans for America. “But there is a lot of work to do and if they don’t do it well, the V.A. could turn from a success story into a horror story for the administration.”",The New York Times
2020,Victoria’s Secret Expected to Go Private,"Leslie H. Wexner’s close ties with Jeffrey Epstein put him and his company under a microscope. Leslie H. Wexner is expected to step down as the chief executive of L Brands, the retail empire he built with his purchase of Victoria’s Secret in 1982, and the lingerie brand plans to go private in a sale to Sycamore Partners that could be announced as early as Thursday, according to three people with knowledge of the deal. [Update: L Brands announced the sale of a majority stake in Victoria’s Secret on Thursday.] Mr. Wexner, 82, is the longest-serving chief executive in the S&P 500. He turned Victoria’s Secret into the world’s most recognizable lingerie brand before facing serious questions about his leadership based on the company’s internal culture and his relationship with the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. The publicity-shy Mr. Wexner has come under intense scrutiny in the past year for his deep ties to Mr. Epstein and the flailing performance of Victoria’s Secret. L Brands, formerly known as Limited Brands, owns Victoria’s Secret and Bath & Body Works. Sycamore will buy 55 percent of Victoria’s Secret, which was valued at $1.1 billion, according to one of the people with knowledge of the deal who spoke on condition of anonymity because it had not been announced. Mr. Wexner will remain on the L Brands board and retain stakes in both Victoria’s Secret and Bath & Body Works, the person said. Bath & Body Works will remain public. News of the expected sale was first reported by The Wall Street Journal. Mr. Wexner’s business savvy and sharp eye for the tastes of American consumers made him a billionaire and a retail industry icon. Over the years, he has been described as “one of the great merchant princes of the late 20th century,” a “rag-trade revolutionary” and the “Merlin of the mall.” But the executive’s legacy has been tainted by his connection to Mr. Epstein, who died in a Manhattan jail cell in August while facing federal sex-trafficking charges. Mr. Wexner has sought to distance himself from the financier and emphasized that he had no knowledge of Mr. Epstein’s suspected activities. Mr. Wexner employed Mr. Epstein as a personal adviser for years, handing him sweeping powers over his finances, philanthropy and private life. Mr. Epstein was empowered to borrow money on behalf of Mr. Wexner and sign Mr. Wexner’s tax returns, as well as hire people and make acquisitions. Over the years, Mr. Epstein obtained a mansion in Manhattan, a luxury estate in Ohio and a private plane — possessions worth roughly $100 million today — that had previously been owned by Mr. Wexner or his companies. Details of the relationship added to the challenges of L Brands, where Victoria’s Secret has been struggling to keep up with changing notions of female beauty and representation in advertising. Victoria’s Secret is the company’s crown jewel. It is the world’s dominant specialty retailer for lingerie, with billions of dollars in revenue every year, and a pop-culture phenomenon. The supermodels selected to represent the brand — known as “Angels” — had long helped shape the ideals of beauty and sexiness for many Americans. But it canceled its famous annual fashion show last year after a nearly two-decade run on broadcast television and conducted layoffs. The largely male management of L Brands has come under fierce criticism, especially as Victoria’s Secret has struggled. The New York Times reported this month that Victoria’s Secret has for years had an entrenched culture of misogyny, bullying and harassment, based on interviews with more than 30 current and former executives, employees, contractors and models, as well as court filings and other documents. The culture was presided over by Mr. Wexner and Edward Razek, the chief marketing officer of L Brands who was the subject of numerous complaints that went unheeded. (Mr. Razek said the allegations against him were “categorically untrue.”) In response to questions from The Times, Tammy Roberts Myers, a spokeswoman for L Brands, provided a statement at the time on behalf of the board’s independent directors. She said the company “is intensely focused” on corporate governance, workplace and compliance practices and that it had “made significant strides.” “We regret any instance where we did not achieve this objective and are fully committed to continuous improvement and complete accountability,” she said.",The New York Times
2020,Victoria’s Secret Sale Caps End of Wexner’s Retail Empire,"Leslie Wexner, who built L Brands into a retailing force, had come under scrutiny for his ties to the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. For decades Leslie H. Wexner helped shape the modern shopping mall, his brands populating the space between department stores — Victoria’s Secret, Abercrombie & Fitch, Express, Bath & Body Works and more. But as the standards of beauty changed in the fashion industry and the internet spawned new competitors to mall chains, Mr. Wexner, the chairman and chief executive of the retailing empire L Brands, struggled to keep up. At the helm of a company that catered to women but was run largely by men, Mr. Wexner lost touch with what women wanted. On Thursday, he said he would step down from the top job at L Brands and sell a controlling stake in Victoria’s Secret, its crown jewel. Mr. Wexner’s departure ends an era in retailing and caps a troubled year in which his close ties to the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein and revelations about an entrenched culture of misogyny at Victoria’s Secret were thrust into the spotlight. On Thursday, L Brands said it would sell 55 percent of Victoria’s Secret to Sycamore Partners, a private equity firm that has been snapping up struggling retailers. The longest-serving chief executive in the S&P 500, Mr. Wexner will become chairman emeritus of L Brands when the $525 million purchase is completed, helping oversee just one of what was once a large stable of brands: Bath & Body Works. It is a muted exit for an 82-year-old billionaire who was once called the “Merlin of the mall.” With his keen eye for the evolving tastes of American consumers, Mr. Wexner expanded L Brands into a behemoth from a single clothing store, the Limited, which he started in 1963 in Columbus, Ohio. He helped turn that city into a retail capital, and exerted vast influence in the state, doling out big donations to arts organizations, hospitals, universities and politicians. He made his most important acquisition in 1982 when he bought Victoria’s Secret, a company that has helped define female sexiness for millions of men and women. For models, becoming one of the brand’s “Angels” all but guaranteed international fame. “There’s no question that, professionally, he has been critical in creating retail as we know it today,” said Simeon Siegel, a managing director at BMO Capital Markets who covers retail and e-commerce. “The amount of companies that owe their existence to his expertise and ability to know what the consumer wanted — or even to tell the consumer what they wanted — cannot be contested.” But in recent years, the approach that helped establish Mr. Wexner’s success began to seem out of touch. Under his leadership, Victoria’s Secret failed to keep pace with evolving beauty ideals and refused to embrace a broader range of body types and gender identities. Sales have been falling in recent years, and the company has been forced to close stores. Investors and analysts have also criticized Victoria’s Secret for having few women in its top management. A string of female executives who pushed to reposition the brand left or were forced out, according to interviews with dozens of former and current employees. Last year, Victoria’s Secret canceled its famous annual fashion show after a nearly two-decade run on broadcast television, and cut its headquarters staff by 15 percent. Then last summer Mr. Epstein was accused of sex trafficking. The charges put a spotlight on Mr. Wexner’s long relationship with Mr. Epstein, who died in a Manhattan jail cell in August. Mr. Wexner has sought to distance himself from the financier, saying he had no knowledge of Mr. Epstein’s crimes. The two men were unusually close. Mr. Wexner employed Mr. Epstein as a personal adviser for years, handing him sweeping powers over his finances, philanthropy and private life. Mr. Epstein obtained a mansion in Manhattan, a luxury estate in Ohio and a private plane — possessions worth roughly $100 million today — that were previously owned by Mr. Wexner or his companies. Three L Brands executives said Mr. Wexner was alerted in the mid-1990s that Mr. Epstein was posing as a recruiter of young women for Victoria’s Secret, but did not appear to act on the complaints. After Mr. Epstein’s arrest, L Brands said its board had hired the law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell to investigate the matter. A spokeswoman for L Brands, Tammy Roberts Myers, declined on Thursday to answer questions about the investigation. The New York Times reported this month that the brand has for years had an entrenched culture of misogyny, bullying and harassment. The report was based on interviews with more than 30 current and former executives, employees, contractors and models, as well as court filings and other documents. In a statement issued at the time, the independent directors on the L Brands board said that the company was focused on corporate governance, workplace and compliance practices and that it had made significant strides. Mr. Wexner’s retailing empire grew out of a modest store he started after a disagreement with his father, who ran a clothing store named Leslie’s. His father carried a wide variety of merchandise, but Mr. Wexner argued that women really wanted to buy “sportswear” — a term at the time for skirts, sweaters and shirts. At the age of 26, he opened the Limited in a Columbus mall with the help of a $5,000 loan from his aunt. Early on, he developed a reputation for working with his buyers to identify potential hits and moving quickly to offer them to customers. Lee Peterson, an executive vice president at WD Partners, a strategy, design and architecture firm, who worked for the Limited in the 1980s, said Mr. Wexner would quiz employees about what items were selling at Monday evening meetings. “We would hold up merchandise and talk about what sold and didn’t sell, and he would only be interested in certain things,” Mr. Peterson said. “His first question was always, ‘What’d you pay for that?’ Then: ‘What’d you sell it for? How many did you sell? What would it take for you to sell 10,000 of those?’” Mr. Peterson added: “If you didn’t know all the answers, he’d get super angry, but for Les, the thing was everything was so simple and so clear and easy for him. It was part of his DNA.” The Limited, which was part of a wave of specialty chains like Gap and Banana Republic, opened its 100th store in 1976. But Mr. Wexner’s ambitions were bigger than a single label. By 1990, he had also purchased Henri Bendel, Abercrombie & Fitch and Lane Bryant and opened the Limited Too and Bath & Body Works. But unlike some other retail moguls, Mr. Wexner, who has four children with his wife, Abigail, has long been a relatively private person. He did not appear in ads or write books about his business philosophy. He expressed an almost slavish devotion to L Brands. “If you want to torture me,” Mr. Wexner told The Times in 1986, “take my work away.” While Mr. Wexner built a name by buying up chains, he also earned a reputation for spinning them off at just the right moment, taking Abercrombie public and selling Lane Bryant and New York & Company. He was not sentimental about these transactions: While L Brands spent much of its existence as Limited Inc. and Limited Brands, the company sold its last remaining stake in the Limited chain to a private equity firm in 2010. The timing was right as shopping habits changed and fast-fashion chains like H&M began expanding aggressively. L Brands has mainly focused on lingerie and home products in recent years. Despite its challenges, the company is still a major force. Sales totaled $13.2 billion in 2018, according to its most recent annual report, though its profit fell about 34 percent to $644 million. Bath & Body Works, which will remain public, has fared better than Victoria’s Secret. In selling control of Victoria’s Secret to Sycamore, Mr. Wexner has turned his prized asset over to a financial firm that has struck deal after deal to acquire struggling brands. The firm, led by Stefan Kaluzny, has bought Hot Topic, Talbots and Staples and acquired assets from bankrupt retailers like Coldwater Creek. One of Sycamore’s first acquisitions was a 51 percent stake in Mast Global Fashions, now known as MGF Sourcing, L Brands’ sourcing business. Some analysts and people who have done business with Sycamore have criticized it for excessively cutting costs and engaging in risky financial maneuvers. Sycamore surprised Wall Street last year by refinancing the debt of Staples in a transaction that helped pay for a $1 billion dividend to the private equity firm. Sycamore has said little about its plans for Victoria’s Secret, and it is unclear how it might go about turning around the business. Through the L Brands board, Mr. Wexner could continue to influence the successful Bath & Body Works chain, but he will not have any direct involvement with Victoria’s Secret. The L Brands board, which has been criticized for being too close to Mr. Wexner, will also replace three longtime directors, further reducing his influence. When describing the last year of Mr. Wexner’s career, Mr. Peterson, his former employee, called it “30 years of brilliance crashing to a halt.” He added, “What a tragic ending to a really brilliant story.”",The New York Times
2020,"Victors in Iowa, Sanders and Buttigieg Are Targets in Democratic Debate","In the most contentious debate so far, Joseph R. Biden Jr. challenged Bernie Sanders over gun regulation, and Amy Klobuchar accused Pete Buttigieg of presenting himself as a “cool newcomer.” MANCHESTER, N.H. — The two victors in the Iowa caucuses, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., came under sharp and sustained criticism in a Democratic presidential debate on Friday, as their rivals tried to stop their momentum by assailing Mr. Sanders for his left-wing ideas and past opposition to gun control while targeting Mr. Buttigieg over his thin résumé and ties to big donors. In the most contentious debate so far, taking place four days before the New Hampshire primary, the runners-up in Iowa charged at Mr. Sanders and Mr. Buttigieg, who appeared in the best position among the top candidates to win New Hampshire and perhaps take command of the race. But their opponents, several of whom have significant advantages of their own, showed that they would not give way without a fight: Mr. Buttigieg especially came in for bruising treatment, drawing tough challenges from every other candidate onstage, including over his criminal-justice record as mayor and his failure so far to appeal to black and Latino voters. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., seeking to recover from his limp finish in Iowa, raised the issue of Mr. Buttigieg’s lack of support among minorities in the opening moments of the debate, saying Mr. Buttigieg had not shown he could “get a broad scope of support.” He repeatedly alluded throughout the evening to his own base among African-Americans, especially in South Carolina, whose primary is this month and is considered a political firewall if his flagging campaign does not recover before then. But Mr. Buttigieg was not Mr. Biden’s only target: He also warned that nominating Mr. Sanders would taint down-ballot Democratic candidates with the label of socialism, and, in his most blunt attack so far on Mr. Sanders, Mr. Biden rebuked him for having opposed gun control legislation in the 1990s. Mr. Sanders, who has long since disavowed that stance, called it a function of representing “a very, very rural state.” The gun issue was a major point of vulnerability for Mr. Sanders in his 2016 bid for the Democratic nomination, but until now had not been a significant part of the 2020 campaign. transcript “It is easy to go after Washington, because that’s a popular thing to do. It makes you look like a cool newcomer. I just, I don’t think that’s what people want right now. We have a newcomer in the White House. And look where it got us.” “Bernie’s labeled himself, not me — a democratic socialist. I think that’s the label that the president’s going to lay on everyone running with Bernie if he’s the nominee.” “When our nominee is dividing people with a politics that says if you don’t go all the way to the edge it doesn’t count, a politics that says it’s my way or the highway —” “Are you talking about Senator Sanders?” “Yes.” “Pete, Pete, fundamentally, you are missing the lesson of Donald Trump’s victory. Donald Trump is not the cause of all of our problems. And we are making a mistake when we act like he is.” “I busted my neck getting Obamacare passed, getting every Democratic vote. I know how hard it is. Bernie’s plan costs double.” “For a start, but the studies show if we do what Joe wants, we’ll be spending some $50 trillion on health care over the next 10 years. That’s the status quo, Joe.” “The Affordable Care Act is now nearly 10 points more popular than the president of the United States. So why would we talk about blowing it up?” “The question is, who can go toe to toe with Mr. Trump? Who can take down Mr. Trump? Because he’s the real threat to the country. We need people with experience. That’s why I’m worried about Mayor Pete.” “Is anyone else on the stage concerned about having a democratic socialist at the top of the Democratic ticket?” “We are not going to be able to out-divide the divider in chief. And I think we need someone to head up this ticket that actually brings people with her instead of shutting them out.” “While I was pushing the Brady background bill, background checks, Bernie voted five times against it when he was in the House.” “It is time to have a national law to protect the right of a woman’s choice.” “We adopted a strategy that said that drug enforcement would be targeted in cases where there was a connection to the most violent group or gang connected to a murder.” “Senator Warren, is that a substantial answer from Mayor Buttigieg?” “No. It’s important to own up to the facts about how race has totally permeated our criminal justice system.” “You cannot go around saying, ‘You’re a bad guy, we’re going to assassinate you.’ And then you’re going to have — if that happens, you’re opening the door to international anarchy.” “Colonel Vindman got thrown out of the White House today. He should have been pinning a medal on Vindman and not on Rush Limbaugh. Stand up and clap for Vindman! Get your — get up there! [cheers] Who we are — that’s who we are. We are not what Trump is.” More than a year after the first candidates entered the race, the main divide in the party, whether to enact incremental policy steps or pursue transformational change, was on vivid display throughout the night, and the question of which approach would be more appealing to general election voters was just as divisive. For Mr. Biden, and two other major candidates, Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, the debate was a crucial, and perhaps final, opportunity to reassert themselves in the race and to prevent Mr. Buttigieg and Mr. Sanders from establishing a tight grip on their respective wings of the party — Mr. Sanders on the left, and Mr. Buttigieg closer to the political center. Yet despite the high stakes there were no standout moments of the sort that have transformed past primaries here, and the most aggressive of the seven candidates on the stage, Ms. Klobuchar, was polling well behind the New Hampshire front-runners. Just as he benefited in Iowa from his moderate challengers’ slicing up the same share of voters, Mr. Sanders enjoyed the most speaking time on Friday. He used much of it to reprise his well-honed progressive argument while his center-left rivals often assailed one another and Ms. Warren declined multiple opportunities to attack him. Mr. Sanders, however, has taken heat before in presidential debates. For Mr. Buttigieg — apparently the joint winner, with Mr. Sanders, of the split-decision Iowa caucuses — the debate on Friday was by far his most strenuous test of the campaign. Ms. Klobuchar, reprising a familiar role as Mr. Buttigieg’s sternest critic, said he was presenting himself as a “cool newcomer” by dismissing the value of government experience. “It’s easy to go after Washington, because that’s a popular thing to do,” she said. “It is much harder to lead and much harder to take those difficult positions.” Ms. Klobuchar added, “We got a newcomer in the White House and look where it got us.” But she was not the only candidate to go after Mr. Buttigieg. When the former mayor repeatedly deflected a moderator’s question about racial disparities in drug arrests by the South Bend police, Ms. Warren said flatly that Mr. Buttigieg had not given a substantial answer. “You have to own up to the facts,” she said. Mr. Sanders, too, took on Mr. Buttigieg, despite having largely ignored him in previous debates. When Mr. Buttigieg attacked his rival’s signature health care proposal, known as “Medicare for all,” Mr. Sanders swiped at Mr. Buttigieg’s close ties to “big money interests.” “Unlike some of the campaigns up here,” Mr. Sanders said, “I don’t have 40 billionaires, Pete, contributing to my campaign.” Even Andrew Yang, the former tech entrepreneur who has rarely used his debate appearances to target his rivals, saw an opportunity to take on Mr. Buttigieg. “Pete, fundamentally, you are missing the lesson of Donald Trump’s victory,” Mr. Yang said after Mr. Buttigieg denounced the Trump presidency. “Donald Trump is not the cause of all of our problems. And we are making a mistake when we act like he is.” But like Mr. Sanders himself, in the moments when he was under attack, Mr. Buttigieg gave no ground, arguing determinedly for his own distinctive approach to the 2020 race. He batted away skepticism of his lack of service in the highest levels of government and rejected Mr. Sanders’s demand for purity in political fund-raising. The Trump campaign would be coming at the eventual Democratic nominee with an immense war chest, Mr. Buttigieg said, arguing that “we need to go into that fight with everything that we’ve got.” And in a sign of his confidence in his positioning as a Washington outsider, Mr. Buttigieg conceded the point on his lack of traditional qualifications for the presidency, seeming to imply that voters who were looking for a candidate with that profile already had an option in Mr. Biden. “I freely admit that if you’re looking for the person with the most years of Washington establishment experience under their belt,” Mr. Buttigieg said, “then you’ve got your candidate and of course it’s not me.” He countered criticism from Mr. Biden and Ms. Klobuchar, who accused him of minimizing his party’s work in Washington, by respectfully relegating those accomplishments to the past. “Those achievements were phenomenally important because they met the moment,” Mr. Buttigieg said. “But now we have to meet this moment, and this moment is different.” The flurry of attacks and reprisals was unsurprising so close to the primary here, and with polls showing the two top-performing Iowa candidates also leading in New Hampshire. What was striking, though, was that, after finishing in a distant third in Iowa, Ms. Warren recited her familiar attacks on corruption and largely shied away from confronting her rivals. Even when given the chance to take on Mr. Sanders and Mr. Buttigieg, she offered only the most glancing critiques before returning to her broader message. The debate came at a moment of tumult and anxiety for Democrats, whose leadoff contest in Iowa on Monday turned into a fiasco of technical breakdowns, stalled and fumbled vote-counting and accusations of electoral illegitimacy from multiple presidential campaigns. On Friday afternoon, Mr. Buttigieg and Mr. Sanders both claimed victory in Iowa on different grounds, with Mr. Sanders brandishing his lead in the popular vote and Mr. Buttigieg staking his claim on a hairbreadth lead over Mr. Sanders in state delegates, the traditional metric for judging a winner in the caucuses there. In his first answer of the night, Mr. Biden conceded that the political currents were against him in the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday, and tried to set high expectations for Mr. Sanders, who captured the state easily in 2016. “I took a hit in Iowa and I’ll probably take a hit here,” Mr. Biden said, adding, “Bernie won by 20 points last time.” The discussion of electability was not confined to Mr. Sanders and Mr. Buttigieg: Ms. Warren, hammering at a theme that has come to define her campaign, argued that Democrats could unite their party and win crossover support in the general election by campaigning against corruption. “We can bring in independents and Republicans on that,” Ms. Warren said. “They hate the corruption as well.” Tom Steyer, the wealthy investor, said the party’s nominee had to be able to win support from minority voters, a feat he noted that Mr. Buttigieg had not yet managed. By contrast, Mr. Steyer added, in an awkwardly clinical turn of phrase, that a recent poll showed that he had “24 percent of blacks in South Carolina” supporting him. One of the most searing exchanges involved Mr. Sanders’s record on gun regulation. Defending himself against Mr. Biden’s criticism, Mr. Sanders noted his poor ratings from the National Rifle Association, and said his votes in the past owed in part to his representing a state with a gun-owning tradition. “I represented that perspective,” he said. “The world has changed.” Sensing an opening, Mr. Biden noted he had represented gun owners in Delaware but still pushed through gun control legislation as a senator. “While I was pushing the Brady background checks, Bernie voted five times against them when he was in the House,” Mr. Biden said. And the former vice president went even further, alluding to the wave of gun violence in the 1990s. “Bernie, while you were representing your constituency, a lot of people came around,” he said, citing those who were “getting killed by the thousands during that same period.” While the candidates attacked and counterattacked one another with gusto, they saved their most searing critiques for President Trump. Mr. Biden played to the Democratic-leaning live audience on the campus of St. Anselm College by urging everyone to stand and applaud for Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman, the decorated Iraq war veteran on the National Security Council who testified in the impeachment hearings and was marched out of the White House on Friday. “Stand up and clap for Vindman,” Mr. Biden said. “That’s who we are. We are not who Trump is.” In a series of exchanges on foreign policy, the candidates expressed an overlapping skepticism about the continuing American military involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan. Ms. Warren, departing from her usual focus on domestic policy, said she believed it was “time to stop this endless war in Afghanistan,” noting without naming names that there were candidates willing to leave troops there for years to come. “We cannot wait five more years or 10 more years,” she said, “or until we turn the corner 10 more times.” Mr. Biden, who has faced criticism a number of times, including from Mr. Buttigieg on Friday night, for having supported the 2003 invasion of Iraq, said for the first time in a debate that he had disagreed with the Obama administration’s approach to Afghanistan. “I was totally opposed to the whole notion of nation-building in Afghanistan,” Mr. Biden said, adding that he still believed it was possible to stop “attacks from the region” targeting the United States. The most sweeping expression of skepticism about military engagement overseas came from Mr. Sanders, who stood by his criticism of the American strike last month that killed Qassim Suleimani, the Iranian military commander, which the senator characterized as an assassination. “You cannot go around saying, ‘You’re a bad guy, we’re going to assassinate you,” Mr. Sanders said, predicting that would lead to “international anarchy.” Updated Feb. 29, 2020",The New York Times
2020,Video Chats and Ordering In: Coronavirus Quarantine With a Smartphone,"This is not your grandmother’s quarantine. People are confined and afraid, but their virtual lives have been largely uninterrupted. Get an informed guide to the global outbreak with our daily Coronavirus
 newsletter.
 Yardley Wong, captive on the Japanese cruise ship grappling with the coronavirus, captured in a single image the essence of life under quarantine. From inside her tiny cabin, Ms. Wong took a picture of the closed doorway. She posted it to Twitter last week. “So much wondering through this door,” she wrote. From the Black Plague to the flu pandemic of 1918 to more recent outbreaks, the history of quarantine and medical isolation shows common emotional threads of those on both sides of such doors — uncertainty, terror, loneliness, separation. But this time, the raw physical barrier is showing cracks, thanks to the smartphone. “After some emotional breakdown, I find my peace from you all,” Ms. Wong tweeted several days after her post brought messages of support from people around the world. “Thank you for the kindness. Your tweets give me strength.” While newspapers, radio and television have softened the ordeal of past sequestrations, the coronavirus quarantines of 2020 are unlike any other in human history owing to almost universal digital connection. Laptops, tablets and smartphones are allowing people in quarantine to work at their jobs remotely, order food, shop on Amazon, chat face-to-face with friends and loved ones, keep up with social media feeds, download movies and music — in short, to stay engaged in the world and fulfill many activities of their regular lives. Karey Maniscalco, an American real estate agent who was quarantined with her husband, Roger, on the same cruise ship, found isolation surprisingly busy. “The last couple of days, we’ve been just catching up on work online, and doing a lot of Facebooking,” she said in an interview last week, before the U.S. government evacuated most American passengers from the ship and flew them back to the United States, where they will continue to be quarantined. “Our inboxes are constantly full. Keeping up on social media is surprisingly very time consuming.” She started posting TikTok videos to stave off what she said could be “overwhelming” emotion. “I woke up realizing that I’m still here and just started crying.” Engaging on social media, she said, “keeps me too busy to sit and dwell, I guess.” Updated Feb. 26, 2020 In China, Isabel Dahm, 22, has been able to see her cats and dog back home in Minnesota through chats with her father, Bob Dahm, using an app, WeChat. She is in Zhejiang province, where she’s been teaching English since November and is now largely relegated to her apartment under semi-quarantine. “I think if this was happening in the Middle Ages, I would’ve actually gone insane weeks ago,” Ms. Dahm said by email. She is allowed out of her apartment only every other day, so she is teaching her class online from her computer in her small efficiency apartment. “I have a VPN, a virtual private network, so I’m able to access all of the things I could back in the States, like Netflix, Hulu and YouTube that are normally blocked in China,” she said. She also orders food delivery but the delivery people are not allowed upstairs. “She’s learned the phrase in Chinese for ‘I’ll meet you at the gate,’” her father said. More substantively, those under quarantine have had unprecedented access to information about the virus itself. For example, in Shenzhen, in the Guangdong province, which has the highest infection rate outside of Wuhan, Krista Lang Blackwood, a teacher from Kansas City, follows virus updates from the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Sometimes, she and her family look out their fifth-floor window and wonder if the quiet streets are telling them infection is spreading. Then they check the phone to find out. In earlier times, Ms. Lang Blackwood noted in an email, people probably would have fretted over how close the nearest case of illness was. “In the 21st century, don’t worry! There’s an app for that!” she wrote. “You can literally look at your neighborhood and see where each reported case is on a map. We have no idea who runs that app, since it’s all in Chinese, but, on the app, there is no red exclamation point at the apartment complex down the street.” “It’s an odd combination,” she added, “of glut of information combined with isolation.” This widespread connectivity appears to be changing the nature of isolation according to experts in two disparate fields — those who study the sociology of technology use and those who study quarantine. In 1918, during the flu pandemic, parts of the United States embraced a strategy called “social distancing” that was explicitly intended to limit interpersonal exposure. Only one-third of households had phones and people were afraid to touch newspapers, fearing the spread of germs. Research, going back decades, shows specific instances in which new media helped limit isolation. Journal articles from the early days of radio show how radio transmissions lifted the spirits of people in isolation at hospitals. An experiment in the late 1950s in Omaha found that a closed-circuit television signal helped the mood of patients at a mental hospital when they could see and respond to their relatives. In 1832, when a cholera outbreak struck North America, newspapers carried news of the infection as it spread. “There is a long history of new media in transforming these moments over time,” said Dr. Jeremy Green, director of the history of medicine department at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. The current media seems to combine all that which has come before — letter writing, video, radio and television, and all instantly and everywhere. Referring to the swine flu pandemic of 2009, he said, “Even with H1N1, we didn’t see this particular outcropping of social networking.” Dr. Jeremy Nobel, an adjunct instructor at the department of global health and social medicine at Harvard Medical School, warned that the widespread ability to communicate comes with the equally powerful ability to manipulate, distort and censor information. As a result, he said, people under quarantine may be left to ponder if governments are telling the truth, creating tension between the comfort of interpersonal communications and discomfort of official ones. “In an era of fake news,” he said, “people might ask: What is fact, and what is truth?” A Chinese doctor who blew the whistle in late December on the spread of the virus wrote to a chat group in his initial message, “quarantined in the emergency room.” The doctor, Li Wenliang, later died from the infection. Shirley Lin, an advertising entrepreneur in Silicon Valley, was communicating regularly through a WeChat group with friends and colleagues in China who have family and friends in Wuhan, the epicenter of the virus. Ms. Lin said that when someone posted a video that included criticism of the Chinese government, it often disappeared before it could be seen by everyone in the group. The surveillance became so worrisome that the group recently abandoned WeChat, which is owned by a Chinese company, in favor of an encrypted mobile phone service, like Telegram or WhatsApp. She said she preferred not to name the precise one to keep it below the government radar. A small but growing body of scholarship backs up the idea that social interactions can stimulate reward centers of the brain and, in turn, dampen a stress response, and enhance resilience and even physical health. David Creswell, an associate professor of psychology at Carnegie Mellon University who works on that research, said that it stood to reason that smartphones, to the extent they are used to make welcome social connection, could diminish the stress of isolation. James Katz, a professor of emerging media at Boston University, said: “Without contact, it’s solitary confinement, which is seen as a cruel and unusual punishment. Being socially cut off is a form of death, but a reversible form of death. Having the communication allows people to make the mental adjustment to reality.” Eimi Yamamitsu in Tokyo contributed reporting.",The New York Times
2020,Video Game Makers Want to Get Players Off the Couch,"Developers are offering a physical twist to keep traditional fans interested and draw new ones who are bored with their workouts. Tiffany Ruiz had tried various gyms, apps, workout routines and diets, all in an effort to get fit and lose some weight. “None of them worked because none of them kept my interest,” she said. Now, Ms. Ruiz is working out at least four times a week, thanks to a video game. In her bedroom, she sprints, squats, stretches and performs other exercises like knee lifts and shoulder presses, all while battling a musclebound dragon and its toadies in Ring Fit Adventure, a new game from Nintendo, the Japanese consumer tech giant. “I am so focused on beating the high score or conquering an enemy that before I know it, 30 minutes have passed,” said Ms. Ruiz, 26, who is studying to become a nursing assistant in Bakersfield, Calif. Ring Fit Adventure, created for the Nintendo Switch console, is the latest effort by the video game industry to try to entice consumers to get up off the couch and become more active. Developers are folding fitness into games as part of a dual-pronged strategy: to retain players by offering a physical twist on traditional gameplay and to draw in new ones like Ms. Ruiz who are looking to break up the monotony of working out. The campaign appeals to parents and other caregivers worried about the amount of time children spend glued to screens. And the games help counter the stereotype of the sedentary player, sitting in a chair for hours on end. “Developers are trying to reach people who want fun and fitness at the same time,” said Rik Eberhardt, a program manager at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Game Lab. “They know fitness is good for them, but it can feel like a chore in their busy lives.” Fitness games make up just 1 percent of the market, but the overall industry is steadily growing. Sales of games across all platforms generated $35.4 billion in the United States last year, up 2 percent from 2018, according to NPD Group, a market research firm. “Our latest data shows 73 percent of U.S. consumers play video games of one sort or another,” said Mat Piscatella, an industry analyst for NPD. “Given the wide range of the players, the industry does have great opportunity to provide more gaming experience variety.” “Exergaming,” a portmanteau of exercise and gaming, has been around since the late 1980s, when Bandai introduced Power Pad, a gray mat with pressure sensors, for the Nintendo Entertainment System. Games now use motion sensors, smartwatches and even virtual reality to track a player’s movement. The gameplay has changed, too. Some games disguise fitness routines in the form of role-playing, dancing or other activities like running from zombies. Others are fitness and health apps that lead users through workouts with gamelike features such as scoreboards, real-time feedback and multiplayer options. Nintendo’s Wii game console brought exergaming into the mainstream in 2006. Its Wii Fit game incorporated a balance board so players burned calories through calisthenics and yoga. “The Wii had the fastest adoption rate in the U.S. of any console in the first three years,” Mr. Piscatella said. Wii Fit remains one of the best-selling games in the United States, according to NPD. Nintendo’s two main competitors, Microsoft and Sony, followed its lead, adding motion-detecting cameras to their consoles. Games like Just Dance and Zumba Fitness: Join the Party, which were available on Nintendo, Microsoft and Sony consoles, were “breakout successes” in the motion era, Mr. Piscatella said. Since then, the industry has been overturned by the rise of mobile devices, which allow games to be played on the go. “Consumer expectations have changed dramatically,” Mr. Piscatella said. “People are no longer just playing on their TVs in their living room. They now want to be able to play games whenever and wherever.” Zombies, Run! coaches runners to complete hundreds of missions, including one with the author Margaret Atwood, in order to escape the zombie apocalypse while running a 5K. In Pokemon Go, players capture creatures in real-world locations using augmented reality and GPS on their phones. Hoping to build on that trend, Nintendo in 2017 introduced the Switch, which functions both as a traditional console and a hand-held device. The Switch was the fastest-selling console in the United States that year and has sold more than 52 million units. “Part of the Switch is an acknowledgment that Nintendo’s main competition is no longer just Microsoft and Sony but Apple and Google, too,” said Philip Tan, creative director of the M.I.T. Game Lab. He added that Nintendo was drawing on its strength in creating games that bridge the digital and physical world. “Instead of trying to compete with other console makers with better cinematography, they have created an innovative new console,” Mr. Tan said. The company has focused on games, like Ring Fit Adventure, that use consoles in new ways, said Bill Trinen, a senior director of product marketing at Nintendo. “Nintendo wants to create games that encourage people to get active and motivate them to stay active,” Mr. Trinen said. He added that the company hoped the role-playing adventure format would encourage people to play longer. Part of Ring Fit’s popularity stems from its unique controller, a flexible resistance hoop that Nintendo calls a Ring Con. When players squeeze it, pull it or hold it above their head, their movements are tracked in the game. Other games incorporate new hardware, too. Beat Saber, a music game from Beat Games, relies on virtual reality goggles; it sold more than one million copies in nine months after being introduced in 2018. But Ring Fit is attracting a growing number of fans to the gameplay. “I love it because it is this fun, goofy story that is way more intense than Wii Fit. It hides the workout, and you can’t cheat,” said Tristan Scatliffe, a 33-year-old product manager who lives in Brooklyn. “The first time I played it, I was dripping with sweat.” The late-night talk show host Jimmy Fallon posted, on Twitter, a video of himself playing one of the Ring Fit mini-games, Spinal Erectors Challenge. Many exergames promote movement, but whether they increase physical fitness is up for debate. Critics have said they found the exercise routines underwhelming, and a study at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston found that Wii games did not help children meet daily exercise requirements. Some researchers are creating their own exergames. Eefje Battel, a project manager at the Sports Innovation Campus at the Howest University of Applied Sciences in Bruges, Belgium, uses Makey Makey in several of the center’s exergame projects for children. Developed by JoyLabz, Makey Makey is an “invention kit” that allows users to connect everyday objects to the internet via alligator clips and a simple keyboard. Ms. Battel created a version of Tetris, the ’80s puzzle game in which falling blocks are manipulated to fit them in a straight line. In her version, conductors are attached to bananas and other fruit, and children have to run from fruit to fruit to move the tiles in the game. Regardless of the fun factor, exergames are not without risks, Ms. Battel said. One element that is missing in Ring Fit, she said, is a coach to ensure that players are performing exercises correctly and safely. “If you are squatting, the system will measure movement up and down, but it won’t track posture,” she said. Nintendo is hoping Ring Fit becomes a top-selling game as Wii Fit did in its heyday. Game analysts like Mr. Piscatella have not yet decided. “What makes Nintendo unique is their willingness to push boundaries, and when Nintendo is really weird, they are at their best,” he said. “Ring Fit Adventure could be the biggest thing or not. It’s still hard to predict.”",The New York Times
2020,Vine Changed the Internet Forever. How Much Does the Internet Miss It?,"Short videos are everywhere now. The founder of Byte hopes people are nostalgic for the original six-second video app. Vine, the short-form video app introduced in 2012, died as it lived: confusing people who didn’t use it, even as evidence of its influence surrounded them. It turned everyday people into stars on other platforms and beyond. Its musical whims warped the music industry. It cultivated memes that might have been dismissed as inside jokes if not for their tendency to flourish outside the app. It was imitated by much larger competitors and, in death, served as a template for a new, similarly puzzling and even more powerful generation of short-form video apps. Its end, announced in 2016, was a muddled one: Was Vine mismanaged by Twitter, its parent company? Did it fail to support its most popular users? Did its novelty wear off? All of the above? Twitter euthanized Vine before other services had time to kill it, leaving Viners, and their fans, to disperse. As much as apps like TikTok owe to Vine, none provided anything like continuity, leaving some Vine users with the feeling that something was still missing from the internet. “The idea was to bring back what people remember about Vine, even if it isn’t necessarily the way that Vine was,” said Dom Hofmann, a founder of Vine, in a phone interview. His new app, Byte, was released in January. Beyond the six-second looping videos, Byte’s design refers heavily to Vine, with a familiar search and discovery page and even the same prompt for commenters: “Say something nice.” Like our phones, the videos have gotten taller; like our phones’ cameras, they’re sharper and more realistic, too. “If you were to bring back Vine as it was when it shut down, today, it would feel pretty dated,” Mr. Hofmann, 33, said. Instead, Byte feels almost like a tribute. With stripped-down creation tools, no filters, no music integration and a user base that includes some returning Viners, the videos, in subject and style, tend to lean on what worked on Vine: short comedy clips and formal experiments with looping. As telling are the ways it doesn’t feel like newer video apps, in particular TikTok, the undisputed short-video app of the moment and, at least in the popular imagination, Vine’s de facto replacement. TikTok supports longer videos and is less reliant on a simple follower model, instead employing assertive and opaque recommendations. It is loaded with a constantly changing set of creation tools, encouraging users to record to songs, riff on other users’ content and engage with challenges, hashtags and trends. TikTok’s interface is busy, and feedback is constant. It’s all but openly spammy, and its engagement-pumping tactics can read as cynical, though it also shares in the wealth of attention that it helps generate; TikTok, more than anywhere else, is the platform where creators understand that they can gain traction fast, at least for now. (It is also backed by the Chinese internet giant ByteDance, which plowed hundreds of millions of dollars into advertising on rival platforms.) Byte has no ByteDance; Mr. Hofmann, who is also one of the app’s main coders, describes the team, and operation, as “fairly small.” The week it became publicly available, Byte was briefly the most downloaded app in the App Store, crossing a million downloads. TikTok users who decided to give Byte a try may have found it sleepy, stripped down and even a bit out of date. For former Vine users, the message was clearer: Stay awhile and see what people come up with. As downloads surged, spammers took notice, flooding comment sections on videos. Creators, confronted with a large and largely disoriented audience, began trying to figure out what to do in a space that, despite its rigid limitations, feels, in 2020, like an intimidatingly blank canvas. A core group of early users got to work, posting frequently, trying new things and figuring out what worked, or could work. Eric Dunn was among them. He joined Vine when he was in college; within four months of his first post, he had a million followers. He became one the platform’s early stars, producing hundreds of comedy videos and establishing a foundation for a career in entertainment. After Vine went out of business, some of its most notable alumni went to YouTube; Mr. Dunn, instead, has spread his influence across Instagram, sports media and modeling. He’s interested in TikTok, where he has a modest following, but he’s not totally sure how to approach it. (For one, said Mr. Dunn, who is now 27, “everyone is in high school.”) He was happy to hear about Byte. “All the things I’m doing today are a direct result of Vine,” he said. “I’ve been waiting for this app to come out.” In Byte’s early-user group, he noticed a number of former Viners. Some listed Instagram, TikTok and YouTube in their bios. Others were back for Byte alone. “I don’t think anything has changed that much,” Mr. Dunn said. His Byte videos wouldn’t be far out of place on his old Vine feed. “I think I’m picking up where I left off.” If Byte succeeds, it will take time. Vine, after an early explosion of interest, needed about a year to figure itself out, and another year to really hit its stride. Since Vine died, users’ phones have only gotten more crowded, and their attention more divided. What may matter more, however, is how new video creators see the platform. Vine spent its final years in conflict with some of its biggest stars, and never figured out how to help them make money. “People just forgot about Vine and moved to TikTok,” said Messiah D. Agurs, who was a child (7 years old) when he joined Vine and is now 13. Byte, in contrast, has pitched itself directly to the people it hopes will stock it with things for people to watch. The company plans to open a partnership program, which in its early days will pass 100 percent of advertising revenue to participants. (“I guarantee when Byte starts to pay creators everyone will instantly move to the app,” Messiah said.) Byte has been soliciting user feedback on a public forum for months, explaining even minor changes to the platform. These forums are where the material changes of the last half-decade are most evident. If Vine struggled to figure out what to do with a nascent class of content creators, Byte has arrived in a world in which “creator” is an established job title and where those professionals have a long list of demands. Right away, Byte users began trading tips about maximizing engagement and sharing advice about when and what to post. They noticed others engaging in low-stakes influence trading, with informal “engagement groups” and reposting agreements, and asked the company to step in. An account popped up to call out Byte users who it said were mimicking popular content on TikTok, gaining an unfair edge. Users worried about their metrics, which fell off but stabilized after an early flood of interest. Mr. Hofmann has found this feedback helpful, mostly. “Of course it’s surprising,” he said. There doesn’t yet exist a popular, scalable system for paying short-form video creators, he noted, and knowing what creators are anxious about now, as opposed to half a decade ago, is obviously valuable. The creators showing the most early promise aren’t too caught up in metrics and growth tactics, he said, although of course they care about that stuff too. To most of us, Byte is an app that we’ll either enjoy or ignore. To a few — the creators it needs — it’s a strange new kind of bet on a job that may be great or may not exist, in an office that’s still being built.",The New York Times
2020,"Violence Must Stop Before Afghanistan Peace Agreement, Pompeo Says","“What we are demanding now is demonstrable evidence of their will and capacity to reduce violence,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said of the latest negotiations. TASHKENT, Uzbekistan — Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Monday that the Trump administration was moving ahead with peace talks with the Taliban to end the war in Afghanistan. But to reach a deal, he said, the Taliban must first give “demonstrable evidence of their will and capacity to reduce violence.” Mr. Pompeo made his remarks in Tashkent, the capital of Uzbekistan, where he met with Uzbek leaders who have helped to seek peace in Afghanistan, a bordering nation, and with foreign ministers from four other Central Asian countries. His comments underscored the difficulty that American officials have faced in trying to reach a reduction in conflict in Afghanistan that would allow President Trump to withdraw some or most of the roughly 13,000 troops there. Mr. Trump called off peace talks with the Taliban last September, but negotiations have restarted since then. Zalmay Khalilzad, the special representative for Afghanistan, arrived in Kabul, the country’s capital, on Saturday to talk with leaders there. He told President Ashraf Ghani that there has been no significant progress in peace talks, according to a statement issued by Mr. Ghani’s office. On Monday, at a news conference following a meeting between Mr. Pompeo and Abdulaziz Kamilov, the foreign minister of Uzbekistan, Mr. Pompeo was asked whether peace was possible, given Mr. Khalilzad’s remarks to Mr. Ghani on a lack of progress. Mr. Pompeo said the work on the plan amounted to “putting the commas in the right place, getting the sentences right,” though he did not go into details. “We got close once before to having an agreement, a piece of paper that we mutually executed, and the Taliban weren’t able to demonstrate either their will or their capacity, or both, to deliver on a reduction in violence,” he said. “And so what we are demanding now is demonstrable evidence of their will and capacity to reduce violence, to take down the threat.” The power-sharing talks and other negotiations that the United States wants the Afghan government and Taliban to hold with each other as a next step should take place in “a less violent context,” he said. The Taliban have intensified attacks, presumably with the idea that it would give them an advantage in the current talks. In early September, the Taliban took credit for a suicide bombing in traffic in Kabul that killed Sgt. First Class Elis A. Barreto Ortiz, who was part of a driving team for covert special operations officers. But that killing prompted Mr. Trump to set aside an emerging agreement and call off secret talks he had planned to have with the Taliban at Camp David, the presidential retreat. Right before then, Mr. Khalilzad had told an Afghan news channel that the United States had reached an agreement with the Taliban “in principle.” He reportedly told Afghan leaders that the United States was ready to agree to pulling 5,400 troops from the country within 135 days of signing the deal, provided the Taliban met certain conditions. Mr. Trump has denounced what he calls the endless wars that the United States started after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Yet he has failed to conclude the talks with the Taliban and has actually increased significant forms of military action in Afghanistan. The United States carried out airstrikes there at a greater pace in the last two years than during any other years of the war, which began in 2001. Mr. Pompeo said Monday that Washington, as part of the negotiations, still aimed “to deliver a counterterrorism profile that not only protects America but nations in this region as well.” He also stressed that commercial ties between Afghanistan and Uzbekistan would help with the goal of peace. He said the United States had agreed to give Uzbekistan $1 million to increase trade and other links between Afghanistan and Uzbekistan. Mr. Kamilov said the peace process would take “a very long time,” but there was “no other alternative.” “We do not have some illusions that it will be possible to solve the Afghan problem with one push just by signing an agreement,” he said. In another meeting, Mr. Pompeo also thanked President Shavkat Mirziyoyev of Uzbekistan for “forging a closer, strategic partnership” with Washington in trying to advance the Afghanistan peace talks. Mr. Pompeo flew out of Tashkent on Monday night. His stop in Uzbekistan was the final one of a five-nation tour in which a common theme was getting nations to support American policy aimed at counterbalancing Russia and China. Some senior Trump administration officials view the two powers as the most prominent challengers to American global influence and military and economic might. In London last Thursday, Mr. Pompeo said the Chinese Communist Party was the “central threat of our times.” On Friday, Mr. Pompeo met in Kyiv, Ukraine, with President Volodymyr Zelensky, where he said the United States was committed to supporting Ukraine in its defense against aggression by Russia. It was the first meeting between a Trump cabinet official and Mr. Zelensky since the impeachment inquiry began in September, centering on charges that Mr. Trump pressured the Ukrainian leader for personal favors by delaying military aid.",The New York Times
2020,Violence Surges in Wake of Trump’s Mideast Plan,"Clashes, shootings and a vehicle attack erupt in the West Bank and Jerusalem, killing Palestinians and wounding Israeli soldiers. JERUSALEM — At least three Palestinians were killed during clashes with Israeli security forces in the West Bank on Wednesday and Thursday, and an Israeli soldier was seriously wounded in a car ramming in Jerusalem overnight, in a surge of violence following the release of the long-awaited — and highly contentious — American plan for Middle East peace. Among the three Palestinians were a Palestinian Authority police officer, whom Israeli forces said they shot by mistake, and a police cadet. A fourth man armed with a pistol opened fire before noon Thursday on Israeli border police officers outside the Aqsa Mosque compound in the Old City of Jerusalem, wounding one in the arm. The attacker, who was shot dead by the police, was an Arab resident of Haifa, in northern Israel. According to Israeli news media reports, he had recently converted to Islam. As one attack appeared to trigger the next, an Israeli soldier was lightly wounded on Thursday afternoon by Palestinian sniper fire north of Ramallah in the occupied West Bank. On Wednesday, Muhammad al-Haddad, 17, was killed by a shot in the chest, doctors said, as youths clashed with Israeli forces in the volatile Palestinian city of Hebron in the southern West Bank. The Israeli military said that confrontation came after days of clashes in Hebron, with Palestinians throwing stones and firebombs at forces near the Jewish settlement in the heart of the city. The military said its soldiers had fired at an unidentified Palestinian who was seen hurling a firebomb. In the early hours of Thursday, a Palestinian rammed a car into a group of soldiers on a sidewalk near a popular entertainment district in West Jerusalem, seriously wounding one and inflicting mild injuries on a dozen more, before fleeing the scene. The soldiers, recent recruits, had been on their way to a swearing-in ceremony in the Old City. The car was later found abandoned near Bethlehem. A suspect was later captured near Bethlehem by a police SWAT team and special forces. The police cadet, Yazan Abu Tabikh, 19, was killed in clashes before dawn in Jenin, in the northern West Bank, after Israeli troops arrived to demolish the family home of a Palestinian accused of being involved in the fatal drive-by shooting of a rabbi, Raziel Shevach, near his West Bank settlement outpost two years ago. The military said Mr. Abu Tabikh had been shooting at soldiers. The Palestinian police officer, Tareq Badwan, 24, was shot and mortally wounded as he stood at the entrance of his police station in Jenin. A spokesman for the Israeli military, Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, acknowledged that the officer had been shot by Israeli forces. He said Palestinians had been shooting at Israeli forces in Jenin at the time, including in the area where the officer was killed. He added that the army was investigating the exact circumstances of his death. Tensions also remained high at the Gaza border, with Palestinians launching sporadic rocket and mortar fire and sending incendiary balloons into southern Israel. In response to mortar fire on Wednesday evening, the Israeli military said, its warplanes struck targets throughout the Gaza Strip overnight, including military infrastructure belonging to Hamas, the Islamic militant group that controls the Palestinian coastal territory. Nabil Abu Rudeineh, a spokesman for President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority, blamed the escalation on the Trump administration’s Middle East plan, saying in a statement that it had created tension “by trying to impose false facts on the ground that we have repeatedly warned against.” Mr. Abu Rudeineh added that the Palestinian people and leadership would stand firm against the plan, and would work to foil it “regardless of the sacrifices.” The plan, which analysts say is heavily weighted toward Israel, would allow Israel to annex about 30 percent of the West Bank, including all the parts it deems important for security or as part of its biblical birthright. In return, the plan makes the Palestinians a conditional offer of a truncated state made up of a disarmed Gaza Strip and chunks of the West Bank linked by roads and surrounded by Israeli territory. That arrangement would cast aside longstanding Palestinian hopes for a full-fledged independent state incorporating the vast majority of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as its capital. On Thursday, Hamas praised the attacker who rammed the car into the soldiers, but did not claim responsibility. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had vowed that Israel would track down the driver of the car, adding in a statement, “Terrorism will not defeat us; we will win!” Mohammed Najib contributed reporting from Ramallah, West Bank.",The New York Times
2020,Violin Lessons During the Coronavirus Outbreak. A Pupil’s Progress.,"INSIDE THE OUTBREAK When Kevin Tang’s American teacher found out he was stuck at home because of coronavirus, she decided to use music to improve his mood. transcript So tune the whole thing. It was pretty good. But only, like, 55 percent — it needed to be way more solid.

 newsletter.
 Thirty minutes into the violin lesson, Anthea Kreston knew that something was wrong. Ms. Kreston, an acclaimed American violinist, was at home in Corvallis, Oregon. Her student, Yunhe Tang, a talented 14-year-old who prefers the name Kevin, was at his home in Chengdu, in southwest China. She had been giving Kevin violin lessons via Skype once a week since last August, but today something was different. Kevin seemed lethargic, like he hadn’t practiced, and Kevin always practiced. “He said, ‘Well, I’m not having lessons here, and I’m not going to school,” Ms. Kreston said. “And then he went, ‘Everyone’s sick.’” It did not take long for Ms. Kreston to realize Kevin’s life had been affected by the coronavirus, even though he lived over 700 miles from Wuhan, the city at the center of the outbreak. Chengdu is one of dozens of Chinese cities that are effectively on lockdown because of the virus. Schools are closed for the rest of the month and most businesses are struggling to reopen after being closed for weeks. Sichuan, the province of which Chengdu is the capital, had 436 confirmed cases of the virus as of Wednesday. Kevin’s family remains healthy, but Kevin has mostly been stuck inside. Ms. Kreston said she couldn’t stop thinking about Kevin shut up in the apartment, and decided to try and help take his mind off the virus. The day after the lesson earlier this month, she messaged Kevin and his family and asked if they would like to temporarily step up Kevin’s lessons at no extra cost. As long as he was shut indoors, she wanted to have daily contact with him, and run a kind of violinist’s boot camp during the coronavirus outbreak. The family agreed. Kevin’s challenge would be to learn a new concerto — Lalo’s “Symphonie Espagnole” — in a few weeks, something she said would normally take 100 days. Ms. Kreston would also give him daily technical exercises to practice. She asked Kevin to record two videos a night to show he was doing the work, and send them to her. “When you go out of that door, I want you to have something to show to everybody,” Ms. Kreston recalled telling Kevin. “This is such a gift to you,” — she added, trying to put a positive spin on having more time to practice. “You can come out the strongest player ever,” she added. Kevin was scared when he first heard about the virus, he said in a Skype interview on Wednesday. “I just wanted to wear my mask wherever I go, even when eating,” he said with a laugh. He realized how serious the situation was at the end of January when the family’s Lunar New Year vacation to Chongqing, a city in the middle of China, was canceled. Kevin had been looking forward to playing his violin loudly outside every day. Instead, he had stayed home, watched news reports about the virus, and became nervous. Kevin said the nerves passed quickly. His mother, who works at a hospital in Chengdu in its supplies department, told him as long as everyone’s careful, they won’t catch the virus. Two weeks into the boot camp with Ms. Kreston, he is feeling much better, but longs for the outdoors. He is able to go into his apartment’s yard to play basketball, but he misses swimming and playing water polo and board games with friends. “I feel bored!” he said while jumping from foot to foot as if filled with energy to burn. Although he is “still very worried about Wuhan,” Kevin said is not so concerned about his own city. He doesn’t even worry about his mother, who has spent a lot of time recently buying masks and protective clothes for the hospital. “We’re often joking she’s the most dangerous person in our home and we should keep her in the bathroom,” he joked. Kevin’s improved mood has a lot to do with the daily violin lessons with Ms. Kreston, he said. The two of them don’t just share videos back and forth, but also emoji messages about his violin playing. Kevin now practices four hours every day, and he said his technique has improved and his sound has become more beautiful. Ms. Kreston said she gave Kevin the Lalo concerto because it was passionate at points and sad at others. Kevin could use it to tap into his feelings, even complicated ones about death and loss. “The virus is terrible,” Kevin said, “but music gives us the confidence to overcome.”",The New York Times
2020,Virginia Legislature Turns Down Ban on Military-Style Weapons,"A Virginia State Senate committee rejected a proposal to ban assault-style rifles, showing the limits of Democratic efforts to impose restrictive gun-control laws. A bill that would have banned military-style rifles in Virginia was defeated in the State Senate on Monday, a sign of the limited power of the state’s new Democratic majority in enacting the most restrictive elements of its gun-control agenda and a blow to Gov. Ralph Northam’s efforts to restrict gun possession. The prohibition on military-style rifles was the most contentious of a series of gun-control bills making their way through the State Legislature this year and the centerpiece of Democrats’ attempts to restrict firearms after a gunman fatally shot 12 people in Virginia Beach last May. The state is at the heart of a long-simmering debate related to the nation’s uneasy accommodation regarding gun laws, with Democrats in the state’s urban areas and suburbs supporting gun-control measures, while many rural residents have mounted large gun-rights protests in response. The assault-weapons bill rejected Monday would have prohibited the sale, purchase, manufacture and most transfers of military-style weapons, as well as large-capacity magazines holding more than 12 rounds. It would have also banned trigger activators, including bump stocks, designed to make weapons simulate automatic machine gun fire. Four Democrats on the 15-member Senate Judiciary Committee joined six Republicans in voting to send the proposal to a state commission for further study. The measure is likely to be debated again next year, lawmakers said. The Democrats represent both suburban and urban areas, and each of the lawmakers had supported other gun-control measures this session. But one of the Democrats, R. Creigh Deeds, said there was discomfort in enacting an outright ban because lawmakers had failed to arrive at a consensus definition of what constitutes an assault weapon despite weeks of negotiations. Mr. Deeds said there remained “a lot of questions” about the definition. The initial version of the measure would have prohibited all assault-style weapons in the state, which would have required owners to turn them in. But that version was recently overhauled to allow owners to keep their weapons. However, it banned new sales and transfers of assault-style weapons. On Monday, Philip Van Cleave, president of the Virginia Citizens Defense League, the group that organized a massive gun-rights rally at the Virginia State Capitol last month, praised the vote on Twitter. Mr. Van Cleave wrote that the rally, as well as the declaration by more than 100 counties and municipalities across the state as “Second Amendment sanctuaries” had sent a stern political warning to legislators about enacting severe gun restrictions. “VICTORY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!” Mr. Van Cleave tweeted. He added in another tweet: “Everybody’s hard work, Lobby Day, and sanctuary movement paid off!” Despite the defeat of the assault-rifle ban, however, both the State Senate and the House of Delegates are poised to give final approval later this month to at least five other gun-control bills. Those measures include limiting handgun purchases to one each month, requiring background checks for all firearms sales and transfers, and imposing a “red flag” law, which allows the confiscation of guns from people deemed by courts to be dangerous to themselves or others. Mr. Northam, a Democrat, has said he intends to sign the measures into law. Mr. Northam’s spokeswoman, Alena Yarmosky, said in a statement Monday that the governor was “disappointed” by the failure of the assault-rifle ban, but added: ”We will be back next year.” Republicans had refused to consider gun-control proposals when they controlled the State Legislature last year, and the issue became one of the central themes for Democratic candidates, who in November won control of both chambers for the first time in 25 years. During the committee hearing Monday, which was filled with gun-rights supporters, a Marine Corps combat veteran told lawmakers that the M16 assault rifle — a military assault-style rifle — was a critical tool of war, but that such firearms had no place among civilians. “I had to use this weapon to save my life on multiple occasions on the battlefield — but when I see civilians carrying them on the streets of our cities, I am brought back to those days of combat, and the unrelenting knowledge of just how lethal they are,” said Kyleanne Hunter, who was an AH-1W “Super Cobra” helicopter attack pilot during tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. But opponents of the prohibition say they fear a ban on assault-style rifles would be a prelude to the government confiscating weapons from law-abiding citizens. The National Rifle Association cheered the bill’s demise, saying that while people who owned assault-style rifles would not have had to surrender their weapons to state authorities, those who possessed high-capacity magazines might have had to turn them in. “There was no option for citizens to keep their lawfully acquired magazines with capacities greater than 12 rounds, forcing millions of Virginians to dispose of their property, become a criminal, or surrender them to the government,” the National Rifle Association said in a statement Monday.",The New York Times
2020,"Virus Disrupts China’s Shipping, and World Ports Feel the Impact","Even where factories are back in operation, getting freight to docks has been impeded by roadblocks and quarantines. Get an informed guide to the global outbreak with our daily Coronavirus
 newsletter.
 SHANGHAI — Some docks in China are clogged with arriving shipping containers or iron ore. Warehouses overflow with goods that cannot be exported for lack of trucks. And many factories are idle because components are not reaching them. As Beijing tries to jump-start an economy hobbled by its coronavirus epidemic, one of the biggest obstacles lies in the country’s half-paralyzed logistics industry. China has some of the world’s biggest and newest seaports and airports, but using them has become a lot harder because of roadblocks, quarantines and factory closings. Global shipping has been one of the biggest casualties. More tonnage of container ships is idled around the world now than during the global financial crisis, according to Alphaliner, a shipping data service. Daily charter rates for tankers and bulk freighters have plummeted more than 70 percent since early January as China buys less oil, iron ore and coal, said Tim Huxley, the chief executive of Mandarin Shipping, a Hong Kong-based freighter shipping line. Ports and their customs offices are operating fairly smoothly, said several freight forwarders, who are essentially travel agents for cargo shipments. The difficulties lie in getting goods to and from the docks. The slowdown in China is already being felt in the United States. In January, container volume dropped 2.7 percent at American ports, according to Panjiva, a research unit of S&P Global Market Intelligence. And officials say they expect much bigger declines as the crisis goes on. Updated Feb. 26, 2020 “The overall economic impact of these types of emergencies is often in the tens of billions of dollars,” said Cary Davis, an official with the American Association of Port Authorities. “Due to the coronavirus outbreak, cargo volumes at U.S. ports might be down by 20 percent or more on a year-on-year basis compared to 2019.” Chinese government agencies have announced a series of measures in the last few days aimed at getting the country’s trucking fleet and ports humming again. But no one can say how quickly activity will return to normal. Places like Jiangxi Province and the metropolis of Chongqing this week ordered the removal of most of the countless roadblocks and checkpoints erected by towns and cities to keep infected travelers out. Shanghai agreed on Tuesday to let trucks enter and leave the city with few health checks, even as people arriving in cars and buses remain subject to lengthy scrutiny and, in some cases, 14-day quarantines. Some factories still have goods that they produced and never shipped in January, before the Lunar New Year holiday that turned into a monthlong nationwide shutdown. “There is a backlog of factory production to be shipped once factories reopen, and there is insufficient trucking capacity,” said Brian Wu, the chairman of the Hong Kong Association of Freight Forwarding and Logistics. Seaport cranes and other equipment seem to be operating normally in China, although a shortage of trucks has made it hard for some ports to distribute goods once they have been unloaded. “We don’t see any abnormal situation in the ports — most of the ports and for that matter the customs, are working at full capacity,” Mr. Wu said. About three-fifths of China’s trucking capacity is working again, A.P. Moller-Maersk Group of Denmark, the world’s largest shipping line, said in a statement Thursday. The company said three of China’s biggest coastal ports — Shanghai, Ningbo and Xingang — were clogged with refrigerated containers full of imported vegetables, fruit and frozen meat. Maersk has responded with a $1,000-per-container fee for electricity to prevent spoilage before trucks can be found to ship the food inland. With many factories operating at a fraction of capacity, and with trucks not delivering a lot of finished goods, container-shipping lines have been canceling many sailings. “If there’s nothing coming to the dock, there’s no reason for the ships to come,” said Simon Heaney, senior manager for container shipping at Drewry, a maritime research firm in London. The disruption is evident across the Pacific. The Port of Los Angeles, which handles more containers in a year than any other in the Western Hemisphere, expects in the first three months of the year its biggest decline in volume since the financial crisis, according to its executive director, Gene Seroka. Ship operators have canceled about 40 sailings to the port from Feb. 11 to April 1, a drop of about 25 percent from the typical volume after the Lunar New Year, Mr. Seroka said. Overall container volume at the port is expected to be down 15 percent in the first quarter compared with the same period last year. At the same time, exports and empty containers are piling up, he said. And even though an eventual recovery should lead to a rebound in imports from China, it will not restore all of the shipments that have been canceled. “Once a ship sails or is cut, it doesn’t come back again,” Mr. Seroka said. Shipping lines have also had trouble replacing crews globally after long voyages. About one-seventh of the sailors aboard the world’s commercial vessels have Chinese passports. “It’s a nightmare to get people from one part of the world to another to join ships,” said Arthur Bowring, a Hong Kong shipping consultant. Air cargo operations have been differently affected. The cancellation of flights in and out of China has been so extensive that freight forwarders have had a very hard time finding any space at all on planes for their shipments. “The airline says, ‘I am sorry, I can’t pick it up,’” said Lin Zhenglong, the chief executive of the Nippon K&H Logistics Company in Tokyo. Keith Bradsher reported from Shanghai, and Niraj Chokshi from New York.",The New York Times
2020,Virus Exposes Cracks in Carmakers’ Chinese Supply Chains,"Hyundai will idle plants in South Korea, pointing to a shortage of components due to the coronavirus outbreak and hinting at trouble for other manufacturers. Get an informed guide to the global outbreak with our daily Coronavirus
 newsletter.
 The coronavirus is providing a lesson in how much the world’s car factories revolve around China. Hyundai, the world’s fifth-largest automaker, said Tuesday that it was temporarily stopping production lines at its factories in South Korea because of shortages of Chinese parts. The Hyundai shutdowns — the first factory lines to be idled outside China — could portend much more serious disruptions in the complex networks that supply automakers with essential components and materials. Hyundai “decided to suspend its production lines from operating at its plants in Korea,” the company said in a statement. “The decision is due to disruptions in the supply of parts resulting from the coronavirus outbreak in China.” President Trump’s trade war notwithstanding, the global economy remains highly interconnected and interdependent. Supply chains are finely tuned to deliver parts just as they are needed, so companies don’t need to waste money on big warehouses. The systems are efficient, but also vulnerable. The coronavirus is testing these supply chains in ways they have never been tested before. Automakers are especially susceptible to interruptions in the flow of goods because the industry is global, and cars are complex products with many precision parts. The scope of the damage is impossible to measure, because no one knows how long the coronavirus emergency will last and how bad it will get. So far, factory closings have not affected the production of autos and parts in North America, where almost all vehicles include at least some Chinese components. Updated Feb. 26, 2020 Many manufacturers have inventories of parts to use or expect new shipments that left China before the outbreak, said Dan Hearsch, a managing director in the automotive and industrial practice at AlixPartners. “Everybody planned to be down for a week, but nobody planned to be down for a month,” he said. “The manufacturers are concerned about depleting their inventory of parts, but the question is how long is it going to go on? If it becomes six weeks, eight weeks, 10 weeks, that’s a real problem.” In China, many auto plants have already shut down because of the virus, including factories run by Hyundai, Tesla, Ford and Nissan. Companies like Volkswagen, Daimler and Continental, a German supplier of electronics and other components, said they planned to reopen their factories in China next week if they received government authorization. “The supply chain is on track to be fully functional in time for start of production, and planned deliveries to customers remain unchanged,” Volkswagen said in a statement. Ford, which has two joint ventures in China, plans to resume production there early next week, a spokesman said. But in the meantime, companies are paying workers to stay home and maintaining idle factories. The closings could last beyond next week if the virus spreads further and the death toll rises. “It’s simply too early to comment on the impact,” Ford’s chief executive, Jim Hackett, told analysts on an earnings call on Tuesday. “It will take weeks to understand the implications of the outbreak.” The extra costs and lost sales hit the auto industry at an especially bad time. Sales in the United States, Europe and China slumped last year because of trade tensions, and the industry is in the midst of a costly shift to electric cars with autonomous driving technology. Daimler issued a profit warning last month, citing legal costs in the United States and other jurisdictions where the authorities are investigating possible emissions cheating. The virus has also demonstrated how much automakers have come to depend on China for sales and growth. China has become the biggest car market by far and until recently the most dynamic. But even before the virus hit, an economic slowdown in China had depressed sales. German carmakers are particularly sensitive to what happens in China. Volkswagen sells more cars there than anywhere else, and it is also a critical market for BMW and Daimler, the maker of Mercedes-Benz cars. “The biggest problem in Wuhan is that nobody is buying a car,” said Ferdinand Dudenhöffer, a professor at the University of Duisburg-Essen who follows the auto industry. “The Germans have the biggest risk portfolio in China.” European automakers and suppliers surveyed Tuesday said they were not experiencing disruptions to factories outside China, but acknowledged that the situation could change. “We are watching closely, but at the moment there are no effects,” said Saskia Essbauer, a spokeswoman for BMW. “Currently supplies are assured.” A spokeswoman for the French carmaker Renault, Rié Yamane, said in an email: “At this stage we have no impact but the supply chain teams are closely studying the subject.” And Hyundai “is reviewing various measures to minimize the disruption of its operations, including seeking alternative suppliers in other regions,” a spokesman said via email. The company said suspension schedules would vary by assembly line. Hyundai and its affiliated automaker, Kia, produced 7.2 million cars last year. Hyundai has a worldwide network of factories, including plants in Russia, Turkey, the Czech Republic and Montgomery, Ala., which can probably make up for lost production in South Korea. But the longer that Chinese factories remain shut, the greater the risk that shortages will affect other manufacturers. Auto parts frequently imported from China include wheels, suspension systems including shock absorbers, and electronic components. A handful of vehicles are produced in China and exported to the United States. They include the Buick Envision from General Motors, a sport utility vehicle. The Ford ExoSport, which is made in India with about 15 percent of its parts coming from China, is also sold in the American market.",The New York Times
2020,Vitamin D During Pregnancy May Benefit Children’s Bones,"Women who took high doses of vitamin D during pregnancy had children with stronger bones. Most experts recommend that pregnant women take a daily supplement of 400 units of vitamin D. Now a randomized clinical trial suggests that a much larger dose may be beneficial for children’s bone health. The study, in JAMA Pediatrics, randomized 517 women to take either a 2,400-unit vitamin D supplement or a placebo from 24 weeks of pregnancy until one week after birth. In addition, all the women were advised to take a 400-unit vitamin D supplement, in line with Danish health recommendations. The researchers followed the offspring with periodic bone scans through age 6, recording bone density and evidence of fractures. Over all, children whose mothers took 2,800 units had significantly higher bone density at age 6 than children in the placebo group. The effects were particularly robust in women who were initially deficient in vitamin D and in those who gave birth during the winter, when sunlight levels are lower and vitamin D blood levels tend to drop. About 7 percent of children whose mothers took the high dose suffered bone fractures through age 6, compared with 11 percent in the placebo group. High doses had no effect on birth weight, or on the height or weight of the 6-year-old children. “There is no concern about safety, and no risk of side effects” at the doses given, said the senior author, Dr. Hans Bisgaard, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Copenhagen. “We have the data suggesting it’s useful, so let’s use it. Health begins early in life. That’s where we can make a difference.”",The New York Times
2020,Opinion | Vitamin K for Newborns Is a No-Brainer. Why Are So Many Parents Worried?,"Parents are increasingly questioning, and declining, vitamin K, which protects newborns from serious bleeding. Dr. Danziger is a pediatrician and writer. Accounts of healthy babies developing serious, even fatal bleeding in the days and weeks following birth can be found going back centuries. Hemorrhagic disease of the newborn was a widely recognized but poorly understood phenomenon until the mid-20th century, when doctors demonstrated that such bleeding — now termed vitamin K deficiency bleeding — could be prevented by giving newborns a single dose of vitamin K. Since the early 1960s, it has been standard-of-care for newborns to receive an intramuscular injection of vitamin K shortly after delivery. Nearly six decades’ worth of data demonstrate that this intervention virtually eliminates vitamin K deficiency bleeding and carries no compelling risk of serious side effects. In recent years, however, an increasing number of parents seem to be questioning, and declining, vitamin K for their infants. Case reports of vitamin K deficiency bleeding being diagnosed in previously healthy infants, which not long ago seemed banished to the annals of history, have begun to surface in medical journals. Pediatricians like me fear that more American infants are at risk of developing life-threatening bleeding than at any other time in recent history. Last year, the American Academy of Pediatrics included education about vitamin K administration at birth as one of its top 10 priorities. As a pediatrician, I encounter hesitancy about vaccines, vitamin K and other routine preventive measures on a daily basis. As research has shown, many of the reasons my patients’ parents decline vitamin K are similar to the reasons they decline vaccines: They worry about interventions they perceive as “unnatural” or unnecessary, about whether the doses and ingredients are “toxic” and whether there may be serious complications that doctors are not aware of or that are even being purposefully obscured by doctors, public health officials and pharmaceutical companies. Parents continue to ask me whether vitamin K might cause childhood cancer, though this suggested association has been debunked. Many families have told me they believe that vitamin K deficiency must serve a beneficial purpose during infancy, so they don’t want to intervene. Others simply prefer to spare their newborn the pain of an injection and worry that the shot will disrupt bonding and breastfeeding. Is there any evidence to substantiate these concerns? So far, the answer is no. The known risks of intramuscular vitamin K prophylaxis are limited to pain at the injection site, subsequent soreness or discomfort and the theoretical risk of infection or injury to adjacent structures inherent to any injection. According to the warning label for vitamin K, intravenous and intramuscular (the route used for newborns) administration has been associated with anaphylaxis (serious allergic reaction) and death, but the warnings are based on the use of intravenous vitamin K in older patients receiving it at different doses and for different reasons. Anaphylaxis in newborns is extremely rare, and a review of the medical literature turns up a single case report of an infant who developed symptoms consistent with a severe allergic reaction after receiving intramuscular vitamin K in Turkey. The risks of high-dose intravenous vitamin K used to reverse life-threatening vitamin K deficiency bleeding in an infant are exponentially higher than the minor risks of a single intramuscular dose. What can and should be done to address this issue? We need better numbers, and we need to move ahead with clearheaded and evidence-based strategies. It’s hard to pin down precise numbers when it comes to vitamin K deficiency bleeding. The best estimates we have suggest that in the absence of supplemental vitamin K, up to 1.7 percent of infants can be expected to develop the classic form of bleeding, which occurs within the first week of life, while a smaller number, between four and seven out of every 100,000 babies, may develop the late, more severe bleeding. This may not sound alarming, but with approximately four million babies born each year in the United States, if no vitamin K were administered, more than 70,000 infants would most likely be affected. A majority of parents do accept vitamin K administration for their newborns. Refusal rates among in-hospital births appear to be in the single digits, while those in non-hospital settings, such as home births and birthing centers, is much higher — over 30 percent in some studies. With an increasing number of parents opting to deliver in non-hospital settings — a trend driven by many of the same factors driving vitamin K refusal, such as the desire for a “natural,” personalized and low-intervention birth experience — vitamin K hesitancy and refusal are likely to grow. Some parents opposed to intramuscular vitamin K are willing to administer it orally instead, but this form of prevention is less effective, requires multiple doses and is not licensed for use in the United States. To counter vitamin K refusal, we need to develop a robust system for tracking refusal rates and cases of vitamin K deficiency bleeding. One way to do this is through legislation. A current bill in Michigan proposes to address neonatal vitamin K administration in the state’s public health code and includes a clause stipulating that all cases of suspected or confirmed vitamin K deficiency bleeding in infants be reported to the state’s public health department (full disclosure: I provided expert advice during the drafting of this bill). A handful of other states have also recently adopted laws pertaining to vitamin K, but the ethics — not to mention the politics and practicalities — of this approach are complex. Parents are generally given broad latitude to make decisions on behalf of their children; but society also has an interest in protecting minors from serious (and potentially costly) harm. What we’ve learned from the anti-vaccination movement is that strategies based on the idea that vaccine hesitancy and refusal are primarily a result of a “knowledge deficit” have been not only unsuccessful but at times even counterproductive. Policy-based solutions, on the other hand — such as mandates and reducing or eliminating nonmedical exemptions — have shown much more promising results. In my own practice, I’ve learned a lot from asking parents a simple question: “How do you think you might feel if you decline vitamin K and your baby develops serious bleeding?” While the question gives some parents pause, I’ve been struck by the number of families who reply firmly but clearly that while they do not wish to see their baby suffer, they would not regret their decision to forgo vitamin K. The seeds of mistrust — along with skepticism of science and intellectualism, the allure of the “natural” and the development of social-media-fueled communities founded on these values — run deep, and they’re threatening the health of our youngest and most vulnerable. In addition to tackling vitamin K hesitancy and refusal head-on, we must pay heed to the upstream factors that make phenomena like vitamin K and vaccine refusal not only possible but popular. Intramuscular vitamin K for newborns is a no-brainer: No baby should have to experience serious, life-threatening bleeding because of identity politics and ideology, when we have an unequivocally safe and effective way to prevent it.

2020,Vivian Gornick Can’t Stop Rereading,"Nonfiction When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. UNFINISHED BUSINESS Notes of a Chronic Re-ReaderBy Vivian Gornick Of all the things that haunt me about my drafty, tired old house, it is the books, sitting boxed up in the basement without sufficient shelving to hold them, that give me the most distress. It’s not that I need them, exactly. If asked to name the titles, I could list perhaps half. But within those I’ve read but not revisited while they’ve moldered in their cardboard prisons are untold insights. At least, this is my suspicion after reading Vivian Gornick’s new book, “Unfinished Business: Notes of a Chronic Re-Reader.” What misconception, or plain old error, calcified when I first encountered the books I’ve loved enough to tote from home to home? And what kind of revelations would emerge once I had time to reread them? Time to reread! What a farce! And is there value, with dozens upon dozens of new books published every week, in returning to the piles that have already been consumed? Gornick’s new book is part memoiristic collage, part literary criticism, yet it is also an urgent argument that rereading offers the opportunity not just to correct and adjust one’s recollection of a book but to correct and adjust one’s perception of oneself. “The effort required to attain some semblance of an integrated self was going to be the task of a lifetime,” Gornick writes, and rereading, as she has it, is an essential part of that task. Bid your therapist goodbye, and dig out your college syllabus. If there’s something both simplistic and almost academic-seeming in that prescription for greater enlightenment, Gornick’s lively, personable book is evidence of the pleasure that can result from the endeavor. “Unfinished Business” is sneakily poignant, revealing slivers of Gornick’s biography — a childhood in the Bronx, complicated relations with her mother (famously documented in Gornick’s memoir “Fierce Attachments”), early days covering the “women’s libbers” for The Village Voice, and her dawning realization that “the central dilemma of a woman’s existence” is “the inability to see oneself primarily as a working person.” But the book moves beyond these elegantly rendered but somewhat superficial dimensions of her life to traverse her greatest disappointments. Among the most affecting rereadings that Gornick chronicles is of Elizabeth Bowen. She describes gulping down three of Bowen’s novels at a young age, thrilling to the mystery and melodrama of her stories but only just sensing that “something profound was being alluded to” in the Anglo-Irish novelist’s prose. (It was an unnerving experience, reading about Gornick’s earliest understanding of Bowen’s “The House in Paris,” to realize that my own impression of that book matched Gornick’s juvenile one. I read it as a teenager and took it to be a story about children.) Years later, Gornick returns to Bowen and discovers the essence of that nebulous profundity she had originally sensed: “That fear of feeling makes us inflict on one another the little murders of the soul that anesthetize the spirit and shrivel the heart.” Threaded throughout her revised assessment of Bowen is the story of a man who inflicted such little murders on Gornick herself, deceiving and embarrassing her again and again. “Yet, repeatedly, I was seduced anew,” she writes, “the combined power of his life-giving conversation coupled with the pitiable vacancy at his center holding me fast.” Bowen’s characters deceive and betray themselves; only by returning to her novels can Gornick begin to understand how a similar fallacy ruled her life as well. It is one of the great ironies of consuming literature that as much as we read to expand our minds, we often take in only whatever it is that we are primed to absorb at a particular moment. Do not, Gornick says in this brief, incisive book, let that be the end of it.",The New York Times
2020,Vivianne Miedema Lets Her Goals Do the Talking,"The record-setting Arsenal and Netherlands striker is only 23. Next on her to-do list? Another English title, a second European title and maybe a rematch with the United States at this summer’s Olympics. Credit...Suzie Howell for The New York Times LONDON — Before Vivianne Miedema’s brother could walk, she said, she would place him in front of a soccer net and fire shots at the goal for practice. “He would just stand there; he couldn’t really do anything,” Miedema said with a mischievous smile, shrugging her shoulders. “I was using him, kind of.” Years later, Miedema is still scoring with ease. Thirty-nine goals in a Dutch league season when she was 18. Six in a single game for the English club Arsenal. And 61 for her country — a record for Dutch men and women. She has won league titles in Germany and England, and a European one with the Netherlands. In July, she will rejoin her national team when it plays in the Tokyo Olympics. And Miedema is still only 23. “So far,” she said of her career, “it’s been working quite well.” In a few short years, in fact, Miedema has developed into an unparalleled international talent, a forward capable of swift turns and powerful strikes, a sea of tranquility amid 22 shifting bodies on the field. If the ball lands in the back of the net in one of Miedema’s matches, it’s quite likely she was the player who put it there. “She’s one of a kind,” said Netherlands Coach Sarina Wiegman, who first saw Miedema play when she was 16, and last summer coached her and the Netherlands to the Women’s World Cup final. By most standards, including her own, Miedema has already exceeded expectations. After beginning her career at Heerenveen at 14 and making her national team debut at 17, she moved to Germany, where she won two Bundesliga titles for Bayern Munich. At Arsenal, she has padded her list of honors: a single-season record for goals in England’s Women’s Super League, with 22 last season (she leads the league again this season); player of the year honors from the Professional Footballers’ Association; and a place on the short list for the Ballon d’Or as world player of the year. That does not, however, mean any of it has come easy. At 17, Miedema said, she cried for the first three months after moving to Bayern Munich because she was unable to speak either German or English. In retrospect, she admits now, it was the right time to leave the Netherlands — “the league just got too easy” — but Bayern Munich’s long-ball style eventually bored her. “I wanted to have something else,” she said. “I wanted to go back to the way I played football.” Those who have played against her say Miedema has an intelligence for the game beyond her years. “I think she’s a little more clever,” said the veteran Swedish defender Nilla Fischer, who faced Miedema in Bundesliga and marked her at the World Cup last summer. “She really tries to go on your blind spot and then make a move when you’re not ready.” Miedema, who already had a reputation as one of the top players in the world when she joined Arsenal, is something of an enigma. She strays from the narcissistic triumph of a typical striker. She doesn’t usually celebrate after scoring, nor is she dazzled by fame and accolades. Obviously, Miedema says, being a top goal scorer is something to aspire to. “But I was 22 and I kind of took over that,” she said offhandedly of her goal-scoring record with the national team. “I’ve probably won more than I ever thought I was going to win,” she added. “I would really like to be one of those people that can bring women’s football up to a higher platform.” But Arsenal is not the Netherlands, where the stadiums are sold out for national team games within 24 hours, and where fans turn even the walk to a game into a dance party. That is the kind of following that Arsenal, despites decades of women’s soccer success, has yet to claim. When the team played Chelsea last month, it endured a 4-1 defeat in front of a capacity crowd, arguably drawn by Chelsea’s latest signing, Sam Kerr. When the teams meet again on Saturday, in the annual W.S.L. Cup final, the site will be the City Ground in Nottingham, not a grand stage like London’s Wembley Stadium. “It’s a one-off situation and we need to be consistent,” Arsenal’s manager, Joe Montemurro, said of the big crowd against Chelsea in January. Fulfilling dreams that the team might one day play in the Emirates Stadium, the home of Arsenal’s men’s team, will take work. “We need it to be a weekly scenario.” Miedema sees that, and other gains for the women’s game, as a challenge for players like her. “I think with the national team we are breaking barriers,” Miedema said. (The Dutch soccer federation recently announced the team would receive pay equivalent to the men’s squad starting in 2023). “I think it’s too easy to say right now every single country or club deserves equal pay, because we’re not there yet.” But she was adamant that they do deserve better — some of her Dutch teammates, Miedema said, have struggled to pay their rent in the past — and that continued investments in women in the club and in international games would help close the gap. When the Netherlands and the United States faced off in the World Cup final last July, the 2-0 loss immediately became her least favorite moment of the tournament. The Dutch players, she said, were fatigued coming off an overtime match in the semifinals and playing on one less day of rest. “At that moment,” Miedema said, “they deserved to win that final.” Now Miedema is forging ahead. “I am still quite young,” she said. “I’d like to think I’ve still got my best years ahead of me.” A league title with Arsenal is her first goal, then a strong performance at the Olympics. She also hopes to win a European championship next year with the Netherlands to match its first, claimed in 2017. “Not just once,” she said of the team’s goals for the championships, “but keep winning it.” If personal rewards and recognition come with that, so be it. “I’m not going on the pitch on a Sunday to have in the back of my mind, ‘Oh, I want to win an award this year,’” Miedema said. “That’s not the way you work as a footballer. I’m going on the pitch to try and win the game.”",The New York Times
2020,Highlights From the South Carolina Primary and Joe Biden’s Big Win,"It is a big night for Joseph R.

2020,Voting on Your Phone: New Elections App Ignites Security Debate,"For more than a decade, it has been an elusive dream for election officials: a smartphone app that would let swaths of voters cast their ballots from their living rooms. It has also been a nightmare for cyberexperts, who argue that no technology is secure enough to trust with the very basis of American democracy. The debate, long a sideshow at academic conferences and state election offices, is now taking on new urgency. A start-up called Voatz says it has developed an app that would allow users to vote securely from anywhere in the world — the electoral version of a moonshot. Thousands are set to use the app in this year’s elections, a small but growing experiment that could pave the way for a wider acceptance of mobile voting. But where optimists see a more engaged electorate, critics are warning that the move is dangerously irresponsible. In a new report shared with The New York Times ahead of its publication on Thursday, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology say the app is so riddled with security issues that no one should be using it. In response to the report, the Department of Homeland Security organized a series of briefings in recent weeks for state and local officials who are planning to use Voatz’s technology. “The choice here is not about turnout,” the report says, “but about an adversary controlling the election result and a loss of voter privacy.” With security already a dominant theme of the 2020 elections, last week’s debacle at the Democratic caucuses in Iowa — an app used to report results failed to, well, report results — has raised new questions about the role technology should play in American elections and prompted calls for it to be scaled back. While a return to the analog days of punch cards and hanging chads is unlikely, there is growing unease about how far state and local governments should go in modernizing election infrastructure — from registration databases and electronic poll books to the voting machines themselves. At the far edge of that debate are systems that let users cast their ballots over the internet, including the platform built by Voatz, the only voting app on the market. An initial experiment with wide-scale online voting took place in Washington a decade ago. It was called off after researchers hacked into the system, electing HAL 9000 — the computer from “2001: A Space Odyssey” — as mayor and making the University of Michigan fight song play every time a ballot was cast. Since then, some states have allowed online voting through web portals, emails or digital faxes, despite the security risks. But they have restricted it to groups of people who cannot make it to the polls, mostly overseas military personnel. Voatz says its technology has overcome the security problems through biometrics and other measures built into newer smartphones, as well as a back-end system that records and stores votes on a blockchain, the technology underpinning Bitcoin. It also says its platform creates a paper trail for election officials and the voters using the app. Since its debut in 2018, Voatz has run several pilot projects aimed largely at deployed service members, tallying about 600 votes across federal elections in Denver, West Virginia and five counties in Oregon, Utah and Washington State. Now, it is poised to expand its reach in the presidential election as a number of additional states consider whether to use it for some categories of absentee voters. West Virginia, for instance, is planning to use the app to meet new requirements that it find a way to make sure the disabled and infirm can participate, a move that is likely to add thousands of voters this year. Until now, security experts have focused criticism on what they described as Voatz’s opaque systems, which make it impossible to verify its security claims. Beneath that criticism, there is also some very real animus — many in the tightly knit cybersecurity community blame Voatz for helping spur an F.B.I. investigation of a University of Michigan graduate student who tried to breach the company’s systems in 2018. The student says he was conducting research. In the new paper, the M.I.T. researchers, Michael A. Specter, James Koppel and Daniel J. Weitzner, go beyond speculation and detail how they found serious security issues by reverse-engineering Voatz’s app and recreating what they could of the company’s server from publicly available information. Flaws in the app, the report says, would let attackers monitor votes being cast — and might even allow them to change ballots or block them without users’ knowledge. Perhaps the biggest risk, according to the researchers, is that the attacks could create a tainted paper trail, making a reliable audit impossible. They pointed to the problems in Iowa caucuses as an instructive example. Though those problems were caused by technical faults, not a security breach, officials in Iowa have had to tally votes through paper backups, some of which are not complete. More than a week later, a definitive result has yet to emerge. “Imagine that on a national scale,” Mr. Specter said in an interview. The researchers took their findings to the Department of Homeland Security in January, setting off a process through which Voatz was made aware of the research and election officials who use the platform were briefed. In a statement, Homeland Security said that while no one was known to have exploited the flaws found by the researchers, “we will continue to work with our partners to deepen understanding of the risk.” Voatz, which has reviewed the report, strenuously objected to the researchers’ claims, saying in a statement that the researchers acted in bad faith, used an outdated version of the app and “fabricated an imagined version” of the servers. The company said that its nine previous elections had gone off without incident, and argued that its pilot projects had pushed “innovation forward in a responsible, transparent way.” The company’s work is backed by Bradley Tusk, a venture capitalist whose philanthropy has provided financial support to help governments use Voatz. In an interview last year with Harvard Business Review, he also brushed aside security concerns. “It’s not that cybersecurity people are bad people per se,” he said. “It’s that they are solving for one situation, and I am solving for another.” Caught in the back-and-forth between Voatz and the researchers are election officials who must soon make a decision on whether to use the app this year. At least one Voatz client, Mason County, Wash., has already pulled out, citing fear of media blowback. Others say they are pressing ahead with plans to use Voatz. The app “is not perfect — nothing is — and security is always a concern for us,” said Donald Kersey, a senior election official in West Virginia. “But this is about using new technologies that give us a way to make sure people who maybe can’t always vote have that opportunity.” Updated Feb. 29, 2020",The New York Times
2020,W.H.O. Fights a Pandemic Besides Coronavirus: an ‘Infodemic’,"Working with the big tech companies, the U.N. health agency has made strides in combating rumors and falsehoods on the internet about the new infection. Get an informed guide to the global outbreak with our daily Coronavirus
 newsletter.
 SAN FRANCISCO — With the threat of the coronavirus growing, Aleksandra Kuzmanovic sat at her computer in Geneva on Monday and sent out an important public health email. She works for the World Health Organization and her aim was to assess and stop a global spread — not of the dangerous virus but of hazardous false information. She wanted to halt what her colleagues at the health agency are calling an “infodemic.” She emailed a contact at Pinterest, the image-sharing social media giant based here in San Francisco, to ask if the site could help the W.H.O. combat the blazing spread of misinformation, lies and rumors about the new virus. Offer accepted. Starting Thursday afternoon, when Pinterest users search for coronavirus, they get a link to a page of coronavirus “mythbusters” from the W.H.O. Since the virus hit, Ms. Kuzmanovic said she and her colleagues have been in regular contact with the world’s biggest and most powerful disseminators of information — including Facebook, Twitter and Google, as well as social media influencers around the globe. Next week, Andrew Pattison, manager of digital solutions at the W.H.O., will travel to Menlo Park, Calif., to visit the headquarters of Facebook, which has arranged for him to make a pitch for further assistance to a gathering of 20 big tech companies, including Uber and Airbnb. “I’d love to see Airbnb give advice to people traveling about coronavirus,” he said. He also plans to meet with Amazon in Seattle in hopes of having the e-commerce titan provide accurate health information when people buy such things as protective masks or respirators, or even books already popping up about the crisis that could contain misinformation. The efforts of the W.H.O., the health arm of the United Nations, represent a new, far-reaching effort to reinvent what has largely been a failed fight against misinformation. Over the last two weeks, tech companies working with the W.H.O. have been prominently posting links to W.H.O. content, making falsehoods harder to find in searches or on news streams, and sometimes removing content altogether. The companies, including Google, Facebook and Twitter, would not provide interviews for this article but did confirm that the work they are doing with the W.H.O. was among their efforts to combat coronavirus misinformation. The companies also are doing work independently of the W.H.O. relationship to help eradicate coronavirus misinformation. They are facing an array of wildly untrue claims, such as that the coronavirus was created as a bioweapon or was funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to further vaccine sales, or that it can be cured by eating garlic or drinking a bleach concoction (which can itself cause liver failure). These ideas, like a virus itself, can be easily transmitted from person to person, carried by both the unwitting and the devious and spreading almost invisibly through a vast virtual world. Updated Feb. 26, 2020 The reality is that the coronavirus is a rapidly spreading respiratory infection that originated in Wuhan, China. Most of the cases, and nearly all of the deaths, have so far been in China, though the germ has reached dozens of other countries in recent weeks. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] Medical misinformation on the virus has been driven by ideologues who distrust science and proven measures like vaccines, and by profiteers who scare up internet traffic with zany tales and try to capitalize on that traffic by selling “cures” or other health and wellness products. “There are self-appointed experts, people working from anecdote, or making up wild claims to get traffic or notoriety,” said Mr. Pattison of the W.H.O. The groundwork for the coordination around the coronavirus was laid two years ago, when Mr. Pattison went to the W.H.O. general director, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, and suggested a full-blown effort to connect with social media titans to combat health misinformation. Now about a half-dozen W.H.O. staffers in Geneva are working on the issue, building relationships with digital and social media sites. Over time, the cooperative efforts have grown. For instance, last August, Pinterest teamed up with the W.H.O. to link to accurate information about vaccines when people search the service for that topic. Ifeoma Ozoma, public policy and social impact manager at Pinterest, said the company “has been working with the World Health Organization over the last year,” with an aim to “make sure people can find authoritative information when it really counts.” The W.H.O. seeks no money, nor pays any, in these relationships, Mr. Pattison said. Rather, he explained, it is lending its credibility and hoping to use “their reach.” The relationship has borne concrete results. Google launched what it calls an “SOS Alert,” which directs people who search for “coronavirus” to news and other information from the W.H.O., including to the organization’s Twitter account; that was expanded Thursday to include information in not just English but also French, Spanish, Chinese, Arabic and Russian. The W.H.O. has also worked with the major Chinese-owned social media site WeChat to add a news feed featuring correct information, translated into Chinese by the W.H.O. The health agency has worked especially closely with Facebook. The company has used human fact checkers to flag misinformation, which can come to their attention through computer programs that identify suspicious keywords and trends. Such posts can then be moved down in news feeds, or, in rare cases, removed altogether. For example, several weeks ago, Facebook removed a W.H.O. infographic that had been modified to claim people should avoid having sex with animals to prevent coronavirus. Facebook also is providing people who search for information on coronavirus on Facebook and Instagram with links to credible sources of information, including from the W.H.O. and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Some of the tech companies have issued public statements of support for the W.H.O. Kang Xing Jin, Facebook’s head of health, said the social platform is providing “relevant and up-to-date information” and “working to limit the spread of misinformation and harmful content” and is doing so “based on guidance from the W.H.O.” Despite the efforts, hundreds of thousands of people have consumed dozens of documented falsehoods about the coronavirus on these platforms and others, including Reddit and the Chinese-owned social media platform TikTok, as well as numerous smaller websites. On TikTok, there are several videos featuring the Gates conspiracy that had been viewed over 160,000 times and have since been taken down. (The New York Times is not linking to this content to limit the spread of misinformation.) The ground for such medical misinformation is fertile, experts said. Sarah E. Kreps, a professor of government at Cornell University, considers the people deliberately spreading distortions to be practitioners of “algorithmic capitalism,” in which people scare up traffic and sell against it. Examples abound. Infowars, the far right website that purveys conspiracy theories and fake news, and others are now banned on several leading social media sites but are still advertising pseudoscientific remedies directly through their own shops. An early distortion of the coronavirus news appeared in an Infowars video on Jan. 22 — claiming that the virus could be part of some man-made plot to thin the population. “The globalists and the deep state have declared war on humanity,” a host on the video said. “They hate human life. This is why they kill babies.” Next to the box in which the video appears is an advertisement for an immune gargle product that, the ad claims, “is designed to support your immune system like no other,” and that is “scientifically proven.” However, the Mayo Clinic reports that the ingredient mentioned in the product, colloidal silver, has not been proved safe or effective in treating disease. And even the Infowars shop where the product is listed reads at the bottom: “This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease.” Renée DiResta, the research manager at the Stanford Internet Observatory, where she studies the spread of false narratives online, described the coronavirus distortion effort as a product of a “conspiratorial ecosystem” that draws on “die-hard anti-vaxxers or conspiracy theorists and people who have alternative health modalities to push and an economic incentive.” “They liken big pharma to drug pushers,” she continued, “and then tell you how their mushroom or oil is their approach to healing.” Experts said the cooperation between the W.H.O. and major websites is a significant change in efforts to stop misinformation. Major internet companies have been pilloried for their role as sources of disinformation and for turning a blind eye to the spread of political lies. The effort led by the W.H.O. “is very new,” said Danny Rogers, who teaches about disinformation and narrative warfare at the New York University Center for Global Affairs and is also the chief technology officer of the Global Disinformation Index, which tracks misinformation activity online. Mr. Rogers said dealing with the coronavirus may be easier to address than political disinformation because it doesn’t have partisan or clear ideological strains. “The coronavirus is not a voting or paying constituency,” Mr. Rogers said. “We’re all united against people getting sick. It’s much easier for platforms to pioneer this coordinated effort around public health crisis.” At the same time, he said, the coordination around coronavirus underscores the reality that social media does have the power to take on falsehoods. “It proves that when platforms do choose to act they can be very influential,” he said. “It undercuts the throw up your hands and say we have no power or ability to control information.” Ben Decker contributed reporting.",The New York Times

2020,"Waiting Years for This Night, Then Hours for an Iowa Winner","NEWS ANALYSIS How a day that was supposed to bring clarity to the 2020 race turned into a cliffhanger caucus. DES MOINES — Maybe the technology failed. Maybe just the humans in charge of it. Whatever the culprit, the results pages — reloaded obsessively by campaigns and their supporters through the night — remained farcically bare as Monday slid into Tuesday. And with no hard numbers to reckon with, no cold math to disprove the dream, no fewer than five candidates marched onstage to deliver something resembling a victory speech. “Iowa,” Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., declared, “you have shocked the nation.” No argument there. Every four years since the 1970s, the political gods have smiled upon Iowa, endowing its residents with uncommon power to set the course of national politics as the first nominating contest. For that privilege, Iowa has found itself — more this year than ever — in the position of defending its perch. Why should a state so disproportionately white take such a leading role, especially for a Democratic Party that prides itself on its diversity? Why is a hodgepodge of gatherings in school gymnasiums the pinnacle of American democracy? On Monday evening, as the byzantine system left results unreported well after state Democrats had predicted being able to lend some clarity, Iowa’s precarious standing appeared to take another hit. “The integrity of the results is paramount,” Mandy McClure, a spokeswoman for the Iowa Democratic Party, said in an initial statement as the wait persisted. “We have experienced a delay in the results due to quality checks and the fact that the I.D.P. is reporting out three data sets for the first time.” Later, she added that the party had “found inconsistencies” in the reporting of results. “This is not a hack or an intrusion,” Ms. McClure said. “The underlying data and paper trail is sound and will simply take time to further report the results.” For a party that had worked for three years and three months to begin the process of trying to defeat President Trump, the caucus stumble seemed to register as another reason for angst in a season with many — another surreal turn in a political moment defined by them. All year, Iowa Democrats had grown consumed with identifying the candidate best positioned to counter Mr. Trump. They filled creaky school auditoriums and union halls and overstuffed coffee shops to weigh and measure a roster of contenders that exceeded 20 at its peak. Progressive or moderate? Veteran statesman or relative newcomer? Options abounded. Early Tuesday morning, at least, the state’s verdict remained sealed. transcript From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” Today: The kickoff to the 2020 campaign was undercut on Monday night by major delays in the reporting of the results from the Iowa caucuses. The story of the day. It’s Tuesday, February 4. Here comes Alex. I’ll just grab a water. Yeah, yeah. (WHISPERS) That was Alex Burns. Hi. Hi. Happy caucus day. Happy caucus day. Is that a thing people say out here? I don’t know. It’s something we say out here. Exactly. So let’s just set the scene a little bit. It’s 4 p.m. We’re in Des Moines. In about 2.5 Iowans are going to start heading to these caucus locations around the state. We’re going to do the same. And I want to talk with you about how this is going to work. So can you just give me a quick primer on this very particular tool of American democracy, the caucus? Well, calling it a tool of democracy is generous in the view of some people. It is not a secret ballot. This is not something where people take 10 minutes in the middle of their workday, go vote and then return to their desk. This is an in-person, out in the open exercise of demonstrating your public support for a candidate. The way this works — literally, physically, in practice — is there are hundreds of predesignated caucus locations around the state. And around 7 p.m. local, people show up at these locations, and they’re asked to gather themselves into groups according to which candidate they’re supporting. They do that. There is an assessment made about which candidate has 15 percent of the support in the room and which candidates do not hit that threshold of support. So when people refer to the threshold, that’s what they’re talking about — 15 percent support at the caucus site. Of everybody in the room — 15 percent of everybody who has showed up. That’s right. If you haven’t hit that 15 percent threshold, your candidate does not qualify to get delegates. And then the voting goes to a second round, where you get to reallocate yourselves to candidates who did hit the 15 percent threshold. So if you go in there expecting to caucus for Alex Burns, and Alex Burns in the first round only has 9 percent of the people in the room supporting him — Highly possible. Entirely possible. He’s not super popular in Iowa. You can reallocate your support to somebody else in the room, perhaps Michael Barbaro, who just barely cleared the threshold at 16.5 percent. So what might be the impact of this process on the field of 2020 Democratic candidates and what we know about those dynamics? I’m thinking about Bernie Sanders, for example, who has been polling in the lead and who we understand has benefited from more moderate Iowans splitting their support among the other leading candidates in the race. Well what the Sanders campaign believes will certainly be good for him, or almost certainly be good for him, is having that first-round popular vote ultimately released to the public. They believe that however the reallocation process ultimately sorts itself out, that he is very, very likely to have the most support on that first round of caucusing. So that even if he ends up slipping behind somebody else, they will be able to brandish that as a symbolic victory. Which is another way of saying he predicts he might lose some support through the process as it goes along. Exactly. And for the more moderate candidates, those candidates have been competing for a lot of the same indecisive voters who are trying to sort out which of these candidates is the best bet against Trump, but I’m not for Bernie Sanders. Right? So if you are a moderate woman in the suburbs of Des Moines and you are tempted by three or four of these candidates, you may very well have the chance to vote for one and then change your mind in the second round. And it’s really anyone’s guess right now as to whether you are going to see more moderates moving towards Joe Biden on the second round, or women moving towards Elizabeth Warren on the second round, or perhaps Pete Buttigieg supporters scattering across the field. It is wildly unpredictable. And because of the way that 15 percent threshold works, it is hugely important whether somebody in the first round is at 16 percent or at 14 percent. Not only because whether they hit the threshold for themselves, but because it will determine whose supporters are actually deciding what happens on the second round. And in a caucus site where Elizabeth Warren is at 16 percent, her people are locked in. In a site where she’s at 14 percent, that’s a place where suddenly Bernie Sanders is in a position to pick up all the support from liberals who preferred Elizabeth Warren but might consider him on the second round. Right. Right. But if Elizabeth Warren’s at 16 percent, Bernie Sanders can’t go after any of her supporters because they’re locked in. Right. So if you are Pete Buttigieg or Joe Biden, you are looking at the other guy and really hoping he doesn’t clear 15 percent in a lot of places. Because you’re betting that most of those voters are moderates and are likelier to go to me — by a lot — than they are to go to Bernie. But if both Biden and Buttigieg mostly end up at 16 or 17 percent, then they could find themselves sort of persistently stuck behind Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren. So what should we be most on the lookout for as we head out to these caucuses? A lot of voters here are not necessarily going to make up their mind based on the ideological factors that we perceive as the national media looking at these candidates from afar. There can be a real sort of oversimplification for the way we see the lanes in this race that we think that somebody who is an Elizabeth Warren supporter is more likely to go to Bernie Sanders than to Joe Biden, as I just said. But it may be that somebody is an Elizabeth Warren supporter, not because they are left populist ideologically, but because they like her experience and they saw her in television ads with Barack Obama and they liked that. So they could easily go to Pete Buttigieg, not Bernie Sanders. Right, or to Joe Biden or anybody else, right? That if you’re a Klobuchar voter, I think we in the national media tend to think of her as a centrist candidate, and by and large she is. She’s also the only other woman with a real shot at clearing the 15 percent threshold in this process. And if you’re for Amy Klobuchar, not just because she’s a centrist, but because you feel like it’s important to elect a woman president, you might end up moving to the ideological left on a second round just because Elizabeth Warren is the option available to you. Got it. So you’re saying don’t make assumptions. I’m saying that anybody who is gaming this out in advance, with ideology as the sole or defining characteristic of how these voters make up their minds, is really risking missing the way real people are going to experience this. Thank you, Alex. Thank you. So we will talk to you four hours — five hours? Hopefully four. O.K. Good luck. You too. Here we go. Prepare yourself for some extremely unpleasantly cold weather. O.K. I don’t know — oh actually that’s Reid. Yeah. Hello! Hi! Hi, Reid. Hi, how are you? Thank you for being our chauffeur. I feel like my dad’s taking us all to the soccer game. It’s really wild. What are you listening to, Reid? I have “Les Mis” on. I told you. Are you a big “Les Mis” guy? No, but this is like the last day, so this is the song that — Last day of Iowa? The last day of Iowa. So this is the idea of the song, is like one day more. One day more. Can we crank it? We can crank it. Hold on. “One day more. Watch them run amuck. Catch them as they fall. Never know your luck when there’s a free for all. We’ll be ready for these school boys. Tomorrow we’ll be far away. Tomorrow is the judgement day.” (SINGING ALONG) “Tomorrow we’ll discover what our God in heaven has in store. One day more!” Can you pull the lyrics up on your phone? (SINGING ALONG) “One more day! One day more!” Continue on Second Avenue for four miles. So we’re pulling into Johnston Middle School, and the parking lot is getting pretty — There’s a lot of cars here. — pretty full. I’d say there’s a couple — maybe 150 cars here. We’re asking you to stay right in this area here. O.K. And then when — Press? Press. Right over here on the left. I’ll take it. I’ll just go over here. T’s over there and see if you’re on the — O.K. It’s 6 o’clock and the doors have just opened. Precinct One is on this side. Precinct Two on this side. We are now in a very crowded main hallway of the school, and I think they’re going to go register. You’re not on here either. Yes I am. Oh good. Thank heavens. That’s my husband — Checking IDs. Thank you. Hi. How are you? You know each other? Do a lot of people know each other? Yeah, neighbors. Two houses down. Yeah. And then they head into the caucus room. Which is a gym. Which is, I believe, a gymnasium. I’m just — I’m having flashbacks to high school. So now we’re in the gymnasium. There’s a huge set of bleachers in the back, and that is where the candidate alignment is going to begin. There are signs for Bernie, and people are sitting on those bleachers. There are signs for Pete, people are sitting on those bleachers. Warren, Klobuchar, Yang. The sign-in is practically done and it’s 7 o’clock. So how about that? [APPLAUSE] (WHISPERING) It’s Tom Leffler. He’s the precinct chairman. He’s running the caucus. — in the vicinity. Testing, testing. (WHISPERING) Amy Klobuchar is outside. Is she allowed in? Yeah. All right. Amy Klobuchar has just walked into the room. Dramatic entrance. It is so great to see all of you here. So my story, just so you know, I am from Minnesota. I am a granddaughter of an iron ore miner. I’m the daughter — (WHISPERING) Why is Klobuchar here, and why is she allowed to be here? Any candidate who shows up can speak. (WHISPERING) And what’s the point of her showing up at the last minute right before the caucus? Because this is really the time when she has to convince undecided caucus goers to come for her. And more important, people who their candidates might not be viable on the second alignment, to get them to come to her on a realignment. Iowans love people to show up, and she’s literally shown up at the caucus. Yeah, it’s a really dramatic gesture. — what unites all of you in your separate groups is bigger than what divides us. I would love to have your support, but I also want us to win big in the general election. Let’s do it. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. [APPLAUSE] Do you know what’s happening right now? Excuse me? Do you know what’s happening right now? Is now the time you vote? Yeah see what we’re doing is — I don’t think we have to. — they told us we had a total of 358 people here to caucus, registered voters. We have to have 15 percent to be viable. Well, that figures out to 54 is a count that you have to have to be viable. So I was going to ask, does it look like anyone’s in, at this moment, in danger of not being viable, and who isn’t? Well the Yang group is probably not going to be viable. Doesn’t look they have 54 people over there. Biden — it doesn’t look like Biden is going to be viable here. So Biden and Yang may not make 15 percent — May not make — — may not have 54 people. Right. (WHISPERING) Are you surprised that Biden doesn’t seem viable at the moment? Very surprised. Are you upset? Well, what happens happens, but I think that’s a mistake. I can’t understand the lack of support. Of course, my wife’s supporting somebody else. Who is your wife supporting? Warren. O.K. Yeah. So if you don’t become viable, where do you think you’re going to go next? Warren. O.K. Yeah. We’ll see you over there. Yeah. (WHISPERING) Are you guys the Yang gang? (WHISPERING) Yes we are. How are you guys doing? We’re from “The Daily” with The New York Times. How’s your vote count? We’re about 20 short to viability. We’re also looking at a very small Biden crowd and hoping we can pop over there. I don’t know how — And then maybe negotiate? We’re hoping. That’s my hope. So you want to convert them to Yang? You think — My hunch is the Yang is probably more of a group of true believers, versus hoping just for the most electable candidate. So we’ll find out. The Yang people are now heading over to the Biden people to do some business. Do you want to — Over here, we’d be willing to tell you why he’s a good candidate. For me, I really like Yang. I really want to see him in the government. He needs to be in the government. I don’t see him as president quite yet. He’s still young. He’s got a lot to do, but we need him in the government now. And I think that — I would agree, cabinet member at least. Cabinet member or something, and so he will be there. Let me tell you why I think Joe, and we would love to have Joe — No, we’re not going to go Joe because he caucused when I was 24 — his first election. 1988. He is solid as a rock. No he’s not. He just almost got impeached, or caused our whole country to fall apart with the impeachment. And his son — he got his son that job for $50,000 a year. That’s crooked. 100 percent. And that’s going to come up during the election. If you don’t think that’s not going to come up when he runs against Trump — Have you fact checked that? Yes, I have. Yes. Have you fact checked the whole thing — Yes, I have. — and about the legitimacy of it? His son — yes, his son — his son has not done anything for that money. His son has not done anything for that money. So this is your overture to the Biden people? Yeah I’m sorry. I know, it didn’t work very well, did it? It fell flat on its face, so I’ll go back. God, these people scare me. That amazes me. I’m so sorry about that. You didn’t seem swayed. What? You didn’t seem swayed. I’m not swayed. Are you angry? No I’m not angry. I’m disappointed. Your face is a little red. O.K.? Well yeah, because I’m hot. But not that kind of hot. Did that feel like a winning argument from the Yang people to you? No, not to me. Do you know where you might go? Biden. No, but are you going to go somewhere else if he’s not viable? If he is not viable, Amy would be my second choice. Will you try to convince your group to go to Amy? I don’t know what I’ll do. I’ll have to think about that. I have to think about that because I — but Amy would be my second choice. Final results are being read now for the first allocation. Biden has 37. 37 will not be viable. You can come over here. O.K., this is Pete. Pete Buttigieg has 70. Viable. [APPLAUSE] Viable. Warren has 59. Viable. [APPLAUSE] Klobuchar has 75. [APPLAUSE] Viable. So at 8 o’clock, here is the count from the first round, the first allocation as it’s called: Sanders has 76. Klobuchar has 75. Buttigieg has 70. Warren has 59. Biden has 37, is not viable. Yang has 33, is not viable. Steyer has four, not viable. Gabbard has three, not viable. And there are now 77 votes among the nonviable candidates that will be redistributed in the coming minutes, and that could obviously — given the spread between the top candidates — completely change everything. Of course, some voters may just walk out because dinner’s at home getting cold or because they don’t believe in any of the other candidates. If you want your voice to be heard, join us. Join team Bernie. I think we’re going to go — I’m going to go with Amy. Amy Klobuchar. So we have some — we have some Biden voters who don’t have a home, heading over to Klobuchar. What’s your name if I could ask you? Kathleen Finkenhour. Kathleen, I can see from reading your lips that you are about to go home and not cast a vote because Joe Biden is not viable. Can you explain that decision? I just — he’s just my candidate. There are other ones that are good. I don’t want to go to Bernie. Why not? I just, I just, uh, I don’t. He’s too — he’s too far one way. He’s just — Too far to the left. For me. For me. I’m 82 years old, so I like Amy. I really like her. But you’re not going to go there either? No, I’m not going to go there either. I’m just kind of old and tired, and I’m going home. I guess I just don’t have the feeling other than I want Joe, and I guess I don’t have the fire I used to have. [LAUGHS] Oops a daisy. Have a safe trip home. I don’t have a sane reason for any of this. Oh God. If I can get down without breaking my neck — So it’s about 8:15, and it feels like realignment has more or less finished. People have switched sides, switched seats, switched camps. And it feels like a final count is upon us. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Warren has apparently added nine or 10 new caucusgoers in this latest round. Who were you with? Steyer. Steyler? Steyer. Yang. You had another Biden there. Biden. Have you counted the new ones? Yeah, 10. The new Warren votes in round two have pretty much come from everywhere. They’ve come from Yang, Biden, Steyer and uncommitted. Klobuchar has picked up a lot of new votes too. It looks like she might win this precinct. Highly possible. 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29. Let’s do it again. Klobuchar picking up nearly 30 votes, and it looks like that’s going to be enough. Oh wait, we’ve got one more. Sorry, I was behind you. Wonderful. What’s the count? 31 and 75 is 106. O.K. Now collect them. O.K. Collecting cards. O.K. I cheated and I looked at that spreadsheet, and it looks like Amy Klobuchar has won this precinct. O.K. Bernie had seven more. The new total for Bernie is 83. Warren — [APPLAUSE] Warren had 10 more. The new total is 69. Klobuchar had 31 more. The new total is 106. [APPLAUSE] And Pete had 11 more. The new total is 81. So at 8:24, here are the results. Amy Klobuchar wins this precinct — just one — but she wins it. And Sanders in second place. So what we saw happen, which Reid predicted could happen, Sanders won round one by a hair and lost round two. Klobuchar won round two. I mean, the big thing was Klobuchar got almost all of Biden’s people. And so she won this precinct. Thank you, Reid. So I got to run to Pete’s headquarters. For the Pete-a-Palooza. I understand that you’re literally leaving us carless? Is that what you’re saying? I’m leaving you carless. You’re going to walk back from Johnston. Reid, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. It was so nice to meet you. You also. And have yourself a water. Thank you so much for your help. It was really fun. Nice to meet you. You too. I wonder what happened in this other precinct. Are you guys from the other precinct? Yeah. What was the result there? Oh, Pete won, I guess. Pete won? And what was the — who’s second, third, and fourth? So Pete won, and then there was a tie between Warren, Biden, Sanders, Klobuchar. Was there a big shift in the realignment? A lot of people went over to Amy. Amy wasn’t viable before the realignment, and then she ended up with two delegates afterwards. So she doubled her people. Yeah. That’s O.K. buddy. Yeah I know you want down, but you’re just going to run backwards. And we don’t want that, so — Well thanks again. Have a good night. We’ll be right back. We’re going to connect with our colleagues in New York. Right now, it’s 11:22 Iowa time, 12:22 New York time. And we’re getting the sense that we won’t have the results by 6 a.m. when this episode needs to go up. So we’re figuring it out. Hi. Hi. Hi. You’re on speaker here. How do you like that? So we just have been so deep in the tape that we have no idea what the news actually is. So what’s going on? So there’s just a huge delay in reporting from all the precincts that, for all we know, could extend late into the evening or even the morning. Uh huh. So does just nobody know what’s actually happening? Put this into perspective for us — how seismic of a shock is what has happened here at the Iowa caucuses in 2020? You mean what hasn’t happened, the results — Right. — the outcome — Yes, that one. — the thing we’ve all been waiting for? Yes. Do you think we’ll get results tonight or tomorrow morning, tomorrow afternoon, before the debate on Friday? It’s unclear. Sean Sebastian is joining us right now from Story County. He’s a precinct secretary out there. What can you tell us about this delay in getting any results, Sean? Well Wolf, I have been on hold for over an hour with the Iowa Democratic Party. The guy in the White House is chuckling all night here, showing the Democrats can’t even get a three-car funeral organized or whatever you want to call it. [INAUDIBLE] Can I help you? So this is a real coincidence, Wolf. I just got off hold just now. Hello? So I’ve got to get off the phone to report the results. All right, go ahead. Report the results. Hello? Can we listen in as you report them, Sean? Yep. All right, let’s listen. O.K. Hi. Hello? They hung up on me. This has not been a success. So Alex, it’s 12 — Jesus, it’s 1 o’clock in the morning. You seem a little frustrated. I’m a little frustrated, Michael. Why? Because we have no results from the Iowa caucuses. We have seen sort of anecdotal data dribbling out all evening, but the Iowa Democratic Party has not posted any complete results from any of the caucuses online. There’s just been a massive failure of data collection and transmission and verification. And so we don’t really know a whole lot more about who won the Iowa caucuses now than we did three or four hours ago. And do you understand exactly what happened, why we don’t have the results, where the breakdown happened? We don’t know in all the kinds of forensic detail that I think we probably will soon enough. But what seems to have happened is that this time, the Iowa Democratic Party created an app that was intended to make it super easy for the volunteer leaders at these 1,600-plus caucuses to send in the results to a central hub and that that app did not get the job done. Whether that’s because of user error or bad Wi-Fi, bad cell service, we don’t really know in full. We know that the backup system was supposed to be that these precinct volunteer leaders were supposed to be able to call in the results, and that then the phone lines got totally overloaded. And so the state party is trying to collect and verify three different sets of data to report out exactly what happened in these caucuses, and we have access to exactly none of them. So how are we seeing the candidates handling this absence of information? We’re trying to see each of them fill this void with their own message, as uncertain as that message might be at this time. They have access, because of their own sophisticated campaign machinery, to at least some detailed data about what probably went on on Monday night. Right. Their precinct captains, of course, have their tallies for every precinct. That’s right. The campaigns aren’t flying completely blind the way we sort of are as reporters. We don’t have hundreds of people around the state feeding us information like that. So when you see one of the leading candidates come out and strike a certain tone in a speech, or not strike a certain tone in a speech, they’re not completely guessing. They’re at least making a pretty educated guess about what kind of final results they might experience. Like what? Well the Biden campaign, for instance, has been extraordinarily aggressive at going after the integrity of the Iowa caucus process. If you’re a campaign that doesn’t think that you’re going to finish so great here, and you want to put a permanent asterisk on the results and just point the attention of Democrat voters later in the process, this is how you’d do it. You heard Biden in his speech to supporters sort of raise an eyebrow at what was going on with the caucuses, as I think most Democrats can relate to — Well, the Iowa Democratic Party is working to get these results — get them straight, and I want to make sure they’re very careful in their deliberations. — and then point towards states where he thinks he is going to do better than he probably did here based on the information that his campaign has. So it’s on to New Hampshire, Nevada, South Carolina, well beyond. We’re in this for the long haul. You heard a similar, not quite as baleful approach from the Elizabeth Warren campaign. Because this race started right here in Iowa, but from tomorrow it will run from ocean to ocean. She came out and gave a speech pointing to the long haul ahead of them in the Democratic primary, sort of an upbeat speech that she felt good about what would happen here in Iowa — Tonight showed that our path to victory is to fight hard. — but it wasn’t a sort of attempt to declare victory. And you did hear her campaign manager, Roger Lau, go out and say that every second that the Iowa results are not known, it undermines the process. That is notably a tone that you’re not hearing from the Sanders and Buttigieg campaigns, which, among the competitors here in Iowa, probably feel the most optimistic about their odds of coming out on top. Let me begin by stating that I imagine — have a strong feeling that at some point the results will be announced. [APPLAUSE] And when those results are announced, I have a good feeling we’re going to be doing very, very well here in Iowa. [APPLAUSE] So we don’t know all the results. But we know by the time it’s all said and done, Iowa, you have shocked the nation. [APPLAUSE] Mayor Buttigieg basically gave a victory speech as though the race had been called for him even though we’re not nearly there yet. Because by all indications, we are going on to New Hampshire victorious. [APPLAUSE] That is a very, very forward-leaning posture in a situation of great uncertainty. Right. That’s known as leaning into a vacuum. But it’s a hell of a vacuum right now, right? That there’s just no information for ordinary people. And his campaign, I think genuinely, from my own conversations with them, feels very good about their odds of ultimately winning or coming close in this state. Right. And then you have Senator Amy Klobuchar who certainly believes that she did a little bit better than anticipated. We know there’s delays, but we know one thing. We are punching above our weight. [APPLAUSE] And whose campaign manager went out on Twitter and said, according to their internal data, she is running even or ahead of Vice President Biden in a lot of places. Again, we have no way to verify on our own whether that’s true at this point, but it is the position that a number of the campaigns are taking. I have heard it from advisers to Klobuchar, to Warren and to Buttigieg that Joe Biden had a weak finish. That’s certainly what they’re hammering away at. Well actually, at the precinct where we went in suburban Des Moines — a town called Johnston — the thing that, Alex, you had predicted would happen actually did happen. Sanders ended up as the front-runner in the first count, and then when the realignment happened, the more moderate candidates ended up benefiting. And that ended up working out in Klobuchar’s favor. She won the final tally by about 20, 25 votes, and that might have been aided by the fact that she showed up. But what do you make of that? I think most of us who were following this campaign, and a lot of the strategists who were active participants in this campaign, believed that that dynamic would favor Joe Biden at the expense of Amy Klobuchar. That if there was a moderate candidate who was persistently not quite hitting that 15 percent threshold, it would be her, and that her supporters would mostly go to Joe Biden. If something like the opposite happened, that could give us a really fascinating result when we actually get the numbers we’re waiting for. This will be thrown into much sharper relief. Any moment now. Any moment. Any moment. Do you think that tonight’s kind of meltdown of this process is going to lessen the ultimate significance of the results in Iowa? Because the usual significance we give it, as the first in the nation, is that it’s the kickoff of the whole thing. I think it’s extremely likely, both because of the meltdown tonight and because of just how much else is going on in the news this week between impeachment, the State of the Union, a global pandemic, the Super Bowl on the eve of the Iowa caucuses. I don’t know how much the ultimate victor is going to be able to break through now that they’ve been denied their own evening to spike the football, as it were. And I think it’s possible that a candidate who gets really embarrassed here will suffer badly for it. But I think the likelihood that somebody gets some enormous surge of momentum based on the results of Iowa is much more questionable now than it would have been if the Iowa Democratic Party had run this process in a more competent fashion. Alex, thank you. Thank you. And good morning. Good morning. The state party changed its rules for this year to accommodate concerns that the caucus process was not transparent. Instead of reporting just one number at the end of the night, it would report, on a rolling basis, three numbers per precinct — a delegate count and the amount of support in both the first and second rounds. But instead of making things clearer, the new process seemed only to muddle matters, leaving a procession of candidates to hustle onstage before any official outcome could alter the mood. Senator Bernie Sanders predicted that he would “be doing very, very well” whenever Iowa’s tale was told. Senator Elizabeth Warren vowed that her campaign was “built for the long haul.” Senator Amy Klobuchar claimed to “punching above our weight.” “We’re going to walk out of here with our share of delegates,” former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. told supporters, as rival campaigns suggested that their data showed the long-assumed front-runner underperforming. “We feel good about where we are.” But Mr. Buttigieg was almost certainly boldest, inching toward an outright declaration of victory: “By all indications,” he said, “we are going on to New Hampshire victorious.” At the time, none of those indications were public. The caucuses, like so much else these last three years, were proceeding in the outsize shadow of executive chaos in Washington — an impeachment trial that at once consumed valuable news media oxygen ordinarily afforded to the presidential election and temporarily removed several candidates from the campaign trail altogether. The coming days, which are expected to include a State of the Union address and an acquittal for Mr. Trump in the Senate, should only be of a piece. Yet despite the recent competition for attention, perhaps no one has felt the burden of the primary calendar more than the Iowa caucusgoer, charged with setting Democrats on a path toward victory in November against a president viewed by the party as a singular threat. For some Iowans, the pressure proved paralyzing, freezing them in indecision. In interviews for months leading up to the caucuses, many struggled to reconcile the candidate they liked with the candidate they thought others would like — neighbors, family members, friends in other states.

Submitting the results + – × ÷ Via mobile phone app Via phone hotline By Keith Collins and Lazaro Gamio Many were also cognizant that a murky result would weaken Iowa’s claim that it acts as a springboard to the nomination. And now, with Monday evening unfolding unevenly, they know it is likely the rest of the country could inherit their anxiety, too. If Iowa did not supply answers on the timeline it usually does, the pre-primary campaign of the past year had already set the direction of the 2020 contest in lasting ways. After a midterm triumph premised often on the success of female and nonwhite candidates, the remaining roster of top contenders is older, whiter and more male-dominated than many Democrats had initially hoped. “Voters are just so terrified of Donald Trump being re-elected that they are bending over backwards to avoid anything that looks or feels like 2016,” said Meredith Kelly, a top aide to the failed 2020 presidential campaign of Senator Kirsten Gillibrand. “And one very obvious factor was that a woman ultimately lost to Donald Trump.” If nothing else, Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders have often succeeded in focusing the primary on the merits of progressive policy. With Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg, emphasizing a more consensus-minded pragmatism, the senators have argued for vast economic upheaval and turned a debate over a “Medicare for all” health-care system into the campaign’s most substantive running dialogue. Warren supporters chant the tagline of her wealth tax (“two cents!”). Sanders fans nod with purpose through his signature swipes at the billionaire class — particularly with two of its members, Michael R. Bloomberg and Tom Steyer, competing in the race. Before the evening of chaos, the campaign of Mr. Bloomberg, the former New York mayor who is not contesting the early states, spent the day merrily sending out news releases about states voting in March or later. Data mishaps notwithstanding, perhaps the greatest present concern for Democrats is uniting in time to turn back Mr. Trump in the fall. The final days before Iowa included some incessant rehashing of 2016 primary slights, with supporters of Mr. Sanders and Hillary Clinton — who recently insisted that “nobody likes” the man she bested four years ago — squabbling anew. Last week, a top Sanders surrogate, Representative Rashida Tlaib, joined a crowd of Iowans in booing at the mention of Mrs. Clinton, who remains to many Sanders supporters an avatar of corporate centrism. “The haters,” Ms. Tlaib vowed, “will shut up on Monday when we win.” Ms. Tlaib apologized afterward for the booing — an episode that reminded Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ms. Tlaib’s congressional ally, about a regret of her own. “If I could have one wish,” Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said in an interview before caucus day, “I should have asked Santa to never have us relitigate 2016 ever again.” And while she is at it, does he have any Iowa precinct results?

2020,Opinion | Wall Street Gets Worried About the Coronavirus,"If the past is any guide, the hit to the global economy and markets should be relatively brief — but that’s a big if. Contributing Opinion Writer The big surprise was not that global markets fell sharply this week on fears of the coronavirus, but that it took so long for them to wake up to the threat. Before Monday, Wall Street was full of instant experts in epidemiology predicting — on the basis of widely circulated charts showing that the number of new cases had peaked in China — that “it’s over.” This sanguine state was symptomatic of a bull market that is now 11 years old, the longest in history, and also one of the calmest. In the past decade, stock prices approached a full 20 percent “correction” only twice, and suffered even minor dips much less frequently than in most previous bull markets. Even insignificant market tremors were met with new offerings of easy money from the Federal Reserve, so every dip was greeted as reason to buy, and no global crisis seriously rattled the market. Until last week, Wall Street was unusually blasé about the coronavirus too, and had reacted with far less alarm than it did during any of the eight global contagions since World War II. Not only had market players been lulled into complacency by easy money and the long calm of the bull market, but they also began this year in a state of unbridled optimism. The buzzword on Wall Street was “melt-up,” suggesting stocks could rise as fast in 2020 as they normally fall in a meltdown. After all, the global economy was in an upswing when the coronavirus first appeared in December. The tariff war between the United States and China appeared to be ebbing. The threat to Wall Street implied by the growing popularity of a socialist candidate for the White House was simply dismissed by investors who, surveys show, give President Trump an 80 to 90 percent chance of re-election. By noon Monday that all changed. Amid reports that the coronavirus had spread well beyond China and that Beijing might lower its guard and ease its quarantines, the American market suffered its worst day in two years and ended down by nearly 5 percent from its peak last week. That drop is now right in line with the average at this stage of the eight postwar contagions, which go back to the Asian flu of 1957. Markets are worried — but as the doctors would say, within normal limits. By Tuesday morning, a semblance of stability was returning to global markets. What happens next depends in part on the impact to the global economy. The latest estimates suggest that the hit from the coronavirus could make the first three months of 2020 the slowest quarter for global growth since the crisis year of 2008. If the past is any guide, however, the growth scare should be relatively brief. Recent global contagions going back to the SARS virus in 2003 have seen a sharp slowdown lasting about a quarter, followed by a sharp recovery over the next quarter. That’s why the consensus on Wall Street is that there will be no global recession, and within six months the whole scare will be over. Still, the quarantine of 16 cities in China has had a visible impact on economic activity, reducing traffic on roads, railways and at airports, emptying out theaters and other public spaces. Analysts skeptical of official Chinese data have started to track alternative sources, from satellite images of road congestion in urban areas to the density of smog over Hong Kong and traffic on Chinese search engines. All those unofficial trackers also point to a hard hit. Beyond China, however, the economic impact will vary from nation to nation, depending on how much stimulus a country can afford. Already Beijing has been cutting interest rates and encouraging banks to increase lending. Investors are confident the authorities will do whatever it takes to keep the economy moving. That is one reason, despite the fact that China is ground zero of the epidemic, that markets have held up better there than in other developing countries. The same is true of the United States, where investors still seem to trust the Federal Reserve to keep growth alive, come what may. The American stock market has also fallen less than the global average. The hardest hit countries will be those with less wherewithal or inclination to spend more money. High in the at-risk category: Japan and Italy. Japan is now battling to prevent the coronavirus from disrupting the summer Olympic Games in Tokyo — even if it means locking down an economy that is already technically in recession. Whatever course the coronavirus takes, it is already accelerating de-globalization, which began when countries turned inward after the global financial crisis of 2008 and cross-border flows of people, goods and money slowed. Fear of contagion is likely to deepen the conviction of populist politicians who want to erect barriers to block imports, immigrants and cultural influences at the border anyway. The trend toward localization — companies looking to produce more locally, and consumers looking to buy from local brands — was getting underway and is likely to pick up speed. Perhaps most clearly, the roster of manufacturers who are moving factories out of China, in search of lower wages and a more friendly business environment, is likely to grow after this episode. The longer the virus lasts and the farther it spreads, the bigger these impacts will be. Hopefully, the consensus view among investors is right and this epidemic peaks and passes quickly. But one thing coronavirus has already shown is that Wall Street’s medical opinions always need to be read with caution.

2020,Wall Street Is (Finally) Waking Up to the Damage Coronavirus Could Do,"The financial world is realizing how different this is from a trade war or other recent economic hiccups. Get an informed guide to the global outbreak with our daily Coronavirus
 newsletter.
 For weeks, there has been a strange divergence among those trying to predict what coronavirus might mean for financial markets and the world economy. People in the trenches of global commerce — supply chain managers, travel industry experts, employers large and small — warned of substantial disruptions to their businesses. And public health authorities feared that the disease could spread far beyond Wuhan in China. Yet financial markets and most economic forecasters projected the virus outbreak wouldn’t do much harm to the economy and corporate profits — at the least, nothing that an interest-rate cut or two from the Federal Reserve couldn’t fix. The S&P 500 hit a new high last Wednesday. Something had to give, and this week it has. After reports of people infected with the virus in the major economies of South Korea and Italy, the more pessimistic view began to prevail across major world markets Monday and Tuesday. Since that high last Wednesday, the S&P is down more than 7 percent. And on Tuesday, yields on 10-year United States Treasury bonds fell to their lowest levels on record, suggesting investors expect significant economic damage and accompanying Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts. Updated Feb. 26, 2020 There remains huge uncertainty about how widely the virus will spread and how much damage it will do. But the financial world is realizing just how much is at stake — and how different this is from other recent hiccups in the global economy, notably last year’s trade war between the United States and China. “It’s one thing if Wuhan is on lockdown, another if all of China is on lockdown, another if all of Asia is on lockdown, and another if the whole world is on lockdown,” said Patrick Chovanec, an adviser for Silvercrest Asset Management and an expert on the Chinese economy. “That’s why sentiment has shifted — because it’s very different to have one country on lockdown for a couple of weeks versus rolling lockdowns throughout the global economy.” Since the end of the global financial crisis more than a decade ago, investors who have been the most alarmist about various risks have had a tendency to lose money. Global asset prices have been on a steady march upward despite the eurozone crisis, the end of the Federal Reserve’s quantitative easing, the trade war and every other problem that has occupied financial headlines. So it is understandable if investors were quick to assume that coronavirus would follow a similar pattern — a temporary blip that reduced China’s growth for a quarter or two but had little lasting impact. “The portfolio managers thought this would be temporary,” said Megan Greene, a senior fellow at Harvard Kennedy School. “They figured this is a flash-in-the-pan virus, that it will finish as soon as the winter does, and that even if that assumption isn’t right, that central bankers will step in and fix this mess.” Markets accustomed to optimism may be all the more vulnerable if the virus becomes a global pandemic that causes meaningful pullback of commerce across major economies. Even after the sell-off this week, financial markets remain richly valued by historical standards. The trade war, in which the United States and China placed tariffs on specific imported goods, caused a significant slump in manufacturing last year. But the coronavirus is hurting service industries as well. If the authorities in major world economies start shutting down any facility where large numbers of people congregate — a list that includes factories, shopping malls and airports — the damage could prove broad and lasting. When a hotel or airplane sits empty for weeks because people are afraid to travel, that is a loss that cannot be recovered once business returns. That’s particularly relevant for the United States, where service industries account for the majority of economic activity. This means that even companies that made it through the trade wars unscathed might be exposed to lost revenue or business shutdowns because of the virus outbreak. Moreover, while tariffs might put sand in the gears of global commerce, that has different implications than gears that stop entirely. Companies had many options for dealing with the trade war, whether sourcing goods from elsewhere or simply paying more for them. The longer the shutdowns of Chinese production, and the more widely other countries are forced to take similar measures, the more the spread of the virus could affect the ability of global companies to do business. Moreover, while the Fed and other central banks may well take action to try to insulate the world economy from those shocks, their tools are ill suited to the task in many ways. The economic effects of coronavirus would act as a “supply shock,” reducing the productive potential of affected nations for reasons unrelated to the forces that more traditionally shape economic results like monetary policy or fiscal policy. Put differently: Lower interest rates won’t make a sick person well, or give public health authorities confidence that businesses can reopen. All they can do is lower borrowing costs and help encourage businesses and consumers to spend and push financial market prices higher. “We would rather have a vaccine than a rate cut and fully recognize that monetary policy is not optimized for addressing this type of shock,” said Krishna Guha with Evercore ISI, in a research note. “But it does not follow from this that the appropriate path of policy under the shock is unchanged.” Neither economists nor portfolio managers make particularly good epidemiologists. But what has become more clear in the last few days is that it is the science of epidemics — and the policy choices that nations make to try to address it — that will shape the economy for the near future, and maybe quite some time to come.",The New York Times
2020,Walmart Says It’s Not Lowering Forecast Because of Coronavirus,"The world’s largest retailer said it would continue to monitor the outbreak but was not adjusting its outlook for the year, a day after Apple warned of a slowdown. Get an informed guide to the global outbreak with our daily Coronavirus
 newsletter.
 Walmart said on Tuesday that while it continued to monitor the coronavirus outbreak in China and around the world, the company was not lowering its sales forecast for this year. The world’s largest retailer released the announcement with its fourth-quarter earnings, one day after Apple warned of a slowdown. Apple had said its supply of iPhones was hampered because the factories in China where they are made were not resuming production as quickly as expected. Apple also said demand for its smartphones in China had been hurt because the virus outbreak had forced the company to close all 42 of its stores. At an investor conference on Tuesday morning in New York, Walmart executives said sales at the company’s 430 stores in China had not faltered, even during the quarantine, as customers turned to the retailer to buy food and necessities. Walmart is also invested in a grocery delivery venture in China that has continued to make home deliveries during the outbreak. Still, the company’s chief financial officer, Brett Biggs, cautioned that the coronavirus situation was still too “fluid” to make any definitive pronouncements about how it could play out for Walmart. Mr. Biggs said it was possible that the fallout from the virus could have a “couple of cents negative impact” on earnings per share in the coming quarters. The virus’s impact on Walmart’s supply chain is also uncertain, but the retailer’s executives suggested that the effect could be more muted than at other companies. If the coronavirus continues to idle factories over the next few months, Walmart said there could be some “impact on shipping.” But Walmart also stressed that two-thirds of the products it sells — which now consist primarily of food — are sourced from the United States. The other third comes from countries like China, other parts of Asia and Mexico. Walmart declined to specify how many of its goods were made in China, but Wells Fargo analysts recently estimated that 15 percent of its merchandise came from that country. Other retailers, like Target and Best Buy, have much higher exposure to Chinese manufacturing. Walmart was one of the first American companies to source its merchandise in China. But as the Chinese economy has evolved, the cost of manufacturing there has increased, prompting companies like Walmart to source their goods in less costly countries. China’s importance is its consumers. Walmart opened its first store there in 1996. Although its network of stores in China is not as large as its footprint in other markets, Walmart has made big investments in online shopping in the country. Walmart owns a minority stake in JD.com, one of China’s leading e-commerce players. The two companies recently invested together in a grocery delivery start-up. Walmart said on Tuesday that its assumptions of the value of its equity stake in JD had not changed. Analysts who gathered for Walmart’s investors’ day in New York seemed to shrug off concerns about China, focusing instead on the company’s lackluster results in the fourth quarter. Walmart said its holiday sales were “a little softer than expected,” leading to a rare miss of its revenue and sales targets in its most recent quarter. The retailer said its same-store sales in the United States grew 1.9 percent during the quarter, which ended Jan. 31. That was lower than the 2.3 percent that Wall Street analysts had expected. The company’s adjusted earnings per share of $1.38 were less than the $1.43 it had forecast, while revenue was $141.7 billion, slightly less than Wall Street’s expectation of $142.5 billion. The company blamed its disappointing results on political turmoil in Chile, as well as “softness” in a few general merchandise categories in its United States stores. “Sales leading up to Christmas in our U.S. stores were a little softer than expected,” Doug McMillon, chief executive of Walmart, said in a statement. The one bright spot in the quarter was record sales growth in e-commerce of 35 percent. The company’s shares were up 1.5 percent at the close of trading on Tuesday.",The New York Times
2020,Warmest January Ever Puts 2020 on Track to Be One of Top 10 Hottest Years,"It may only be February, but 2020 is already “virtually certain” to be among the 10 warmest years on record, and has nearly a 50 percent chance of being the warmest ever, scientists with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said Thursday. The predictions follow a January that was the warmest ever in 141 years of record keeping, Karin Gleason, a climatologist with the National Centers for Environmental Information, said in a conference call. Global average temperatures last month were 2.05 degrees Fahrenheit (1.14 degrees Celsius) above average, slightly higher than in January 2016, the previous record-holder. In comparing this year with previous years, Ms. Gleason said, one way to look at it is “we completed the first lap in a 12-lap race, and we are in the lead.” “According to our probability statistics, it’s virtually certain that 2020 will rank among the top 10 years on record,” she said. Their analysis also showed a 49 percent chance of this year being the warmest ever, and a greater than 98 percent likelihood it will rank in the top five. The forecasts are in keeping with a long-term trend of global warming that is occurring as a result of human-caused emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases that trap heat in the atmosphere. All of the 10 current warmest years on record have occurred since 2004, and the past five years have been the hottest five. Last year was only slightly cooler than 2016, the hottest year ever. The record warmth in January was all the more remarkable because it occurred when the world was no longer in the midst of an El Niño event. An El Niño, which is linked to warmer than average sea-surface temperatures in the equatorial Pacific Ocean, can affect weather patterns worldwide and also lead to generally warmer temperatures. A strong El Niño during the first half of 2016, for example, contributed to the record temperatures that year. But the latest El Niño ended last year, and ocean temperatures in the Pacific have returned to much closer to normal. “We’re in sort of new territory here with a record in a non-El Niño month,” Ms. Gleason said. January temperatures were much warmer than average across most regions of the world, with Eastern Europe and Russia having the greatest departures from normal. Australia and Eastern China were also much warmer than usual. Central India was one of the few regions with cooler than average temperatures. Temperatures last month were also warmer than average across the contiguous United States and much of Canada. Alaska was cooler than average, but NOAA forecasts for the next few months call for a return to the above-average warmth that has been the norm in Alaska in recent years and that has led to a large decline in sea ice, particularly off the state’s west coast. NOAA is forecasting warmer-than-average temperatures into May across most of the country, from the West through the Southwest, Southeast, Midwest and into the Northeast. There is also a likelihood of a wet spring across most of the eastern half of the country. California and the Southwest are expected to be dry, likely leading to the return of drought to California and intensification of drought in the Four Corners of the Southwest, NOAA said.

2020,Warren Buffett Has a Problem With ‘Independent’ Directors,"Andrew is on The Daily today discussing recent sustainability efforts by the likes of Jeff Bezos, Microsoft and Delta. Are the carbon-reduction programs genuine or simply marketing? Take a listen. (Want this in your inbox each morning? Sign up here.) Berkshire Hathaway hasn’t done a big deal in years, as Warren Buffett explains in his latest annual letter to shareholders. Even so, he’s happy with his track record. Likening mergers to marriages, the legendary investor writes, “I would say that our marital record remains largely acceptable, with all parties happy with the decisions they made long ago.” He thinks others could do better. There is the ever-present risk of succumbing to “Wall Streeters bearing fees,” as he describes deal-hungry investment bankers. “At many companies, these super-salesmen might win,” he notes. “I do not, however, expect that to happen at Berkshire.” “Independent” directors, in particular, aren’t serving companies well, he says. • When it comes to acquisitions that C.E.O.s want to make, independent directors are supposed to check their impulses. But corporate chiefs rarely bring in outside advisers who provide dissenting opinions, so the deals usually happen. “When seeking directors, C.E.O.s don’t look for pit bulls,” Mr. Buffett writes. “It’s the cocker spaniel that gets taken home.” • Too many directors covet the pay that comes with serving on a corporate board, playing nice with a C.E.O. to keep their jobs and get a good reference for more directorships. If a director pushes back on a C.E.O.’s deal proposal, “his or her candidacy will silently die.” • Directors with stakes in the company they serve, paid for with their own money and not as compensation for their role, are better incentivized to give good advice, Mr. Buffett says, even though they are often not considered independent for corporate-governance purposes. He proposed a way for boards to get better advice when weighing a deal: It would be an interesting exercise for a company to hire two “expert” acquisition advisers, one pro and one con, to deliver his or her views on a proposed deal to the board — with the winning adviser to receive, say, 10 times a token sum paid to the loser. To which we say: Good luck with that. The owner of TurboTax could announce as soon as today a deal to buy Credit Karma, the start-up that made free credit-score checks popular, for about $7 billion. The reason, Nathaniel Popper and Michael write in the NYT: There’s gold to be mined in the average American’s financial data: There is a potentially significant business opportunity for Intuit if it completes a deal. For example, Intuit could try to match all the tax data its TurboTax customers provide with the credit-scoring data that Credit Karma holds. That could let Intuit serve up better customer prospects to credit card issuers — and eventually let Intuit charge lenders more for access to its hoard of data. Sheel Mohnot, a venture capitalist who focuses on fintech start-ups, suggested that the combined company could become a sort of Facebook for financial services. “They would have all of this rich information, and they would basically be an ad network,” he said. “You’re almost forced to advertise with them.” Such a grip over Americans’ financial data could give regulators reason to scrutinize the deal, however. Having retired as C.E.O. of Goldman Sachs, Lloyd Blankfein can speak more freely than his counterparts who are still running big financial firms. A few of his recent comments about Bernie Sanders may be a window into what others on Wall Street think about the favorite to win the Democratic presidential nomination. “I think I might find it harder to vote for Bernie than for Trump,” Mr. Blankfein said at a recent lunch with the FT. Mr. Blankfein finds Mr. Sanders’ attacks on the rich, including a potential wealth tax, offensive: “I find that just as subversive of the American character as someone like Trump who denigrates groups of people who he has never met. At least Trump cares about the economy.” Trading nasty tweets with Mr. Sanders in recent days, Mr. Blankfein first said the Vermont Senator would “ruin our economy and doesn’t care about our military.” Mr. Sanders shot back, “I welcome the hatred of the crooks who destroyed our economy.” Mr. Blankfein then disputed his “hate” for Mr. Sanders, suggesting that the senator “wants to feel hated because HE hates.” Follow the NYT’s live briefing on the outbreak for all the latest developments. Here are five recent articles of note: • The economic impact is bad. Really, really bad. • An outbreak in Italy is raising fears about the spread outside Asia. • UBS’s chairman says markets are underestimating the risk. • The White House is expected to ask for emergency funds to fight the virus. Will it be enough? • What will happen to the Tokyo Olympics? The torch relay begins next month. The U.S. central bank is in the middle of reviewing its recession-fighting plans. On Friday, one of its governors, Lael Brainard, proposed an array of unconventional tools that policymakers may need to deploy during the next economic downturn. Get to know “yield curve control,” in which the Fed sets a target for longer-term government bond yields and commits to buy as much debt as it takes to achieve that target. (The Brookings Institution published a helpful analysis of how it works.) It wasn’t the first time Ms. Brainard has mentioned it, nor was she the only past or present Fed official to suggest it. But a groundswell of support implies that it could happen eventually. It would be a “bond trader’s nightmare,” as Brian Chappatta of Bloomberg Opinion put it. The U.S. last tried it in the 1940s. Japan is currently giving it a go, with mixed results. A new paper presented at the conference where Ms. Brainard spoke, written by high-profile economists including from JPMorgan and Citigroup, named yield curve control as one of the new tools that may be useful in fighting a downturn in a low-rate, low-inflation world. But the economists conclude that policymakers “should be humble about their likely effectiveness.” 😬 If the trade fight between the U.S. and China threw the world off balance, a battle between America and Europe over how to tax internet companies could completely upend global relations, finance ministers at the G20 summit warned over the weekend. “The trade tensions of today would look like they are not so serious compared to the consequences of something like this,” Angel Gurría, the secretary-general of the O.E.C.D., told Alan Rapeport of the NYT. Efforts by the O.E.C.D. to broker an agreement on internet taxes have been slow going. European countries like France and Britain want to be able to tax the services of digital companies, even those without a physical presence within the countries’ borders. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin says that’s discriminatory and has threatened economic war if those levies come to pass. It often felt like the G19 versus the U.S. “This needs leadership in certain countries,” Olaf Scholz, Germany’s finance minister, said — while looking directly at Mr. Mnuchin, who was sitting next to him, Reuters reports. Mr. Mnuchin floated a vague compromise on a “safe harbor” provision, in which some companies could agree to pay more in taxes in exchange for financial certainty. European officials fear this would make the taxes optional for the mostly American internet giants.

2020,"Warren Buffett Praises Performance, but Offers No Surprises in Annual Letter","The Berkshire Hathaway chief noted the steady money making of the conglomerate, but gave no insight into succession or other hot topics. At Berkshire Hathaway, 2019 was another good year — and an opportunity for its leader, Warren Buffett, to prepare his company for life without him. In his latest letter to investors, published on Saturday morning, the billionaire largely praised the performance of his $566 billion conglomerate, whose portfolio includes the insurer Geico, the chemical maker Lubrizol, Fruit of the Loom underwear and more. “Our unrivaled mountain of capital, abundance of cash and a huge and diverse stream of non-insurance earnings allow us far more investment flexibility than is generally available to other companies in the industry,” he wrote. The annual report was accompanied by the latest assessment of Berkshire’s financial health: The company reported $29 billion in net income for the fourth quarter of 2019, and $81.4 billion for last year overall. Operating earnings, Mr. Buffett’s preferred measure of financial performance, declined slightly last year from 2018, to $24 billion. In a further show of belief in his company’s value, Mr. Buffett said that Berkshire spent $5 billion buying back its own stock last year. But investors have hoped that the company would spend more on stock repurchases, since loosening its policy on such moves in 2018. Much of Saturday’s letter served up a sort of greatest hits for the fans of Mr. Buffett — investors around the world who hang onto his pronouncements as America’s favorite capitalist uncle. There were quips, like one comparing corporate acquisitions to marriages that start with “a joyful wedding — but then reality tends to diverge from prenuptial expectations.” There was the complaint that Berkshire, with a $128 billion cash hoard that Mr. Buffett wants to spend on big acquisitions, did not have great opportunities to do so. (Missing from action this year was his favorite description of that cash pile, “elephant gun.”) Instead, Mr. Buffett wrote, “The fickle stock market serves up opportunities for us to buy large, but non-controlling, positions in publicly-traded companies that meet our standards.” That currently includes a $73 billion stake in Apple, $33 billion in Bank of America stock and $22 billion in Coca-Cola shares. Mr. Buffett also noted that Berkshire valued its roughly 27 percent stake in Kraft Heinz, the packaged foods company that was one of its biggest recent deals — and one of its most prominent investing flops in recent years — at about $13.8 billion. By contrast, Mr. Buffett’s annual letter in 2018 valued its Kraft Heinz stake at $17.6 billion. The billionaire also took time to complain about the poor state of many corporate boards: Too few women serve on them. Directors are often captive to the management teams they are meant to supervise, particularly when it comes to acquisitions that chief executives want to make. “Don’t ask the barber whether you need a haircut,” he wrote. Too many directors go along with management teams in hopes of getting a good reference so they can be added to a second corporate board and earn more paychecks. “When seeking directors, C.E.O.s don’t look for pit bulls,” Mr. Buffett wrote. “It’s the cocker spaniel that gets taken home.” Yet as in many years past, this year’s letter did not dwell on the topic Berkshire shareholders want most desperately to know: who will succeed Mr. Buffett, now 89, as the conglomerate’s chief executive. Time and again, Mr. Buffett has said only that he has someone in mind, and in the meantime has no plans to retire anytime soon. In Saturday’s letter, Mr. Buffett reiterated that Berkshire was “100 percent prepared” for the day that he and his longtime business partner, Charles T. Munger, 96, leave the scene. The reasons: Berkshire’s investments are strong and prudent, the company’s businesses are overseen by able managers and its remaining directors are trusted to stay the course. The letter reflected one more sign that Mr. Buffett was willing to share the limelight with his lieutenants, Ajit Jain and Greg Abel, both of whom have been widely speculated as potential successors. Mr. Buffett said that he would allow attendees of Berkshire’s annual shareholder meeting in May to direct questions — part of a longstanding tradition where he and Mr. Munger answer queries on any topic — to either of those men. Also left unaddressed in the letter was Mr. Buffett’s most recent deal, the sale of Berkshire’s newspaper holdings, in a sign that he was giving up on the news business.",The New York Times
2020,"Warren Leads an Onslaught of Attacks, Zeroing In on Bloomberg","The sharp exchanges in the Nevada debate reflected the urgency of the moment as Michael Bloomberg, in his first presidential debate, was repeatedly criticized in personal terms. transcript “I’m a New Yorker. I know how to take on an arrogant con man like Donald Trump.” “I’d like to talk about who we’re running against: a billionaire who calls women fat broads and horse-faced lesbians. And no, I’m not talking about Donald Trump. I’m talking about Mayor Bloomberg.” “You should also ask how Mayor Bloomberg in 2004 supported George W. Bush for president.” “The mayor says that he has a great record, that he’s done these wonderful things. Well, the fact — the fact of the matter is, he has not managed his city very, very well when he was there.” “Senator Klobuchar, my colleague specifically asked you if you could name the president of Mexico —” “Yes —” “— and your response was no.” “You’re literally in part of the committee that’s overseeing these things.” “Are you trying to say that I’m dumb?

And, and when you — and when you say they signed them, and they wanted them, if they wish now to speak out and tell their side of the story about what it is they allege, that’s now OK with you? You’re releasing them on television tonight?” “Senator, no.” “Is that right?” LAS VEGAS — The Democratic presidential candidates turned on one another in scorching and personal terms in a debate on Wednesday night, with two of the leading candidates, Senator Bernie Sanders and Michael R. Bloomberg, forced onto the defensive repeatedly throughout the evening. In his first appearance in a presidential debate, Mr. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City, struggled from the start to address his past support for stop-and-frisk policing and the allegations he has faced over the years of crude and disrespectful behavior toward women. Time and again, Mr. Bloomberg had obvious difficulty countering criticism that could threaten him in a Democratic Party that counts women and African-Americans among its most important constituencies. Two candidates who have shied away from direct conflict in past debates, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., mounted something of a tag-team onslaught against Mr. Bloomberg, several times leaving him visibly irked and straining to respond. From the first seconds, when Mr. Sanders used the initial question to attack what he called Mr. Bloomberg’s “outrageous” policing record, it was clear that this debate would be far more heated than any of the previous forums. The unrelenting attacks reflected the urgency of the moment, as Mr. Sanders gains strength and those hoping to slow his candidacy are increasingly crowded out by Mr. Bloomberg and his unprecedented spending spree. Ms. Warren landed the most stinging blows against Mr. Bloomberg throughout the debate, starting with an opening broadside that likened him to the figure most reviled among Democrats: President Trump. “I’d like to talk about who we’re running against: a billionaire who calls women fat broads and horse-faced lesbians,” Ms. Warren said. “And no, I’m not talking about Donald Trump. I’m talking about Mayor Bloomberg.” transcript There are still so many questions about what happened in Iowa. You can see that Pete Buttigieg is presently leading the state delegate count with 27%; Bernie Sanders with 25%. Candidates are already looking toward New Hampshire. Let me take this opportunity — To thank the people of New Hampshire for a great victory tonight. Moderate candidates, Pete Buttigieg and Senator Amy Klobuchar trailed Sanders to round up — Breaking news from the Democratic presidential race, where a national poll out this morning shows the former New York mayor is now in second place with 19% support behind Bernie Sanders. Michael Bloomberg, whose rise in the polls is fueled by more than $300 million in ad spending. Mayor Bloomberg has not appeared on a single debate stage or a single ballot, but that will change tonight. It’s Alex Burns in Las Vegas, where Wednesday night’s Democratic debate was held ahead of the Nevada caucuses this weekend. From NBC news, the Democratic Presidential Debate, live from Las Vegas, Nevada. This was a debate we were all really waiting for because it was first time Mayor Bloomberg has appeared on the stage. And really, it’s the first time he has engaged with other Democratic candidates at all since entering the race. Polls released over the last few days have shown Bloomberg overtaking Joe Biden, nationally, as the moderate runner-up to Bernie Sanders, the front runner, thanks to hundreds of millions of dollars that Bloomberg has poured into advertising. But for most Americans, this was the first time that they have really been introduced to the man himself. So going in, we knew that all the other candidates were going to try to make that a rough introduction to scuff up the glossy image of himself that Bloomberg puts in TV ads. And right away, they did. I think we need something different than Donald Trump. I don’t think you look at Donald Trump and say, we need someone richer in the White House. Thank you. Mayor Bloomberg — Democrats are not going to win if we have a nominee who has a history of hiding his tax returns, of harassing women, and of supporting racist policies like redlining and stop-and-frisk. Stop-and-frisk. Stop-and-frisk, which went after African-American and Latino people in an outrageous way. Throwing close to five million young black men up against the wall. That is not a way you’re going to grow voter turnout. They, of course, went after stop-and-frisk, his invasive policing policy as mayor of New York. Mayor Bloomberg, at the beginning of this debate, you took some incoming fire on this next topic, so let’s get into it. At 2015, this is how you described your policing policy as mayor. Quote, “We put all the cops in the minority neighborhoods.” And you explain that is, quote, “because that’s where all the crime is.” And early on, NBC moderator, Lester Holt, asked Bloomberg to address it. You went on to say, “And the way you should get the guns out of the kids’ hands is to throw them against the wall and frisk them.” You’ve apologized for that policy. But what does that kind of language say about how you view people of color or people in minority neighborhoods? Well, if I go back and look at my time in office, the one thing that I’m really worried about, embarrassed about was how it turned out with stop-and-frisk. And we started a — we adopted a policy, which had been in place, the policy that all big police departments use — of stop-and-frisk. What happened, however, was it got out of control. From the beginning, he struggled with his responses. And we have to keep the lid on crime. But we cannot go out and stop people — All right, mayor. — indiscriminately. Mayor, thank you. Let me go to — This was the number one question that Bloomberg would have known was coming. More than any other policy issue, this is the one his campaign has worried about from the start of the race. But — I’ve sat. I’ve apologized. I’ve asked for forgiveness. But the problem — Bloomberg is a man known for his political agility, or his comfort expressing contrition, or for his thick skin. And it showed. And if we took off everybody that was wrong off this panel, everybody that was wrong on criminal justice at some time in their careers, there’d be nobody else up here. And the attacks were just sort of unrelenting. Up until this point, Elizabeth Warren has mostly avoided direct confrontation in debates with other candidates. She has been calling herself, “the unity candidate.” But she took a totally different approach, a far more aggressive approach. And Mike Bloomberg was her favorite target. I’d like to talk about who we’re running against. She landed some of the most stinging blows in the debate, drawing a connection between Bloomberg and public enemy number one for the Democrats. A billionaire who calls women, “fat broads” and “horse-faced lesbians.” And no, I’m not talking about Donald Trump; I’m talking about Mayor Bloomberg. Democrats are not going to win — Perhaps, the most contentious exchange of the night, and the toughest one for Bloomberg, was a lengthy back and forth between him and both Warren and Joe Biden about a number of women who have signed nondisclosure agreements with Bloomberg and his company. He has gotten some number of women — dozens? who knows — to sign nondisclosure agreements both for sexual harassment and for gender discrimination in the workplace. So Mr. Mayor, are you willing to release all of those women from those nondisclosure agreements so we can hear their side of the story? [APPLAUSE] We have a very few nondisclosure agreements. How many is that? Let me finish. How many is that? None of them accused me of doing anything other than — maybe they didn’t like the joke I told. And let me just point — [CROWD MURMURING] — and let me point — those would be agreements between two parties that wanted to keep it quiet. And that’s up to them. They signed those agreements, and we’ll live with it. Warren challenged him over and over to release those women from the NDAs and let them speak openly about their experiences. And when you say they signed them, and they wanted them. If they wish now to speak out and tell their side of the story about what it is they allege, that’s now OK with you? You’re releasing them on television tonight? Senator, no. Is that right? Bloomberg said he would not do it. Tonight? Senator, the company and somebody else, in this case — the man or a woman, or could be more than that, they decided when they made an agreement, that they wanted to keep it quiet for everybody’s interest. No. Come on. They signed the agreements. And that’s what we’re going to live with. I’m sorry. No. The question is — I heard your question. — are the women bound by — But the latest is what these attacks reflect about the state of the Democratic race and the urgency that the candidates are feeling in this moment. Bernie Sanders’s lead is looking increasingly strong heading into the Nevada caucuses. And as we’ve talked about many times, part of that has to do with the fact that the more moderate candidates are dividing the votes amongst themselves, making it harder for any one of them to emerge as a clear alternative to Sanders. Now, in comes Michael Bloomberg with all of his money and his power and name recognition. But so far, he has done more to slow down fellow moderates than to thwart Bernie Sanders. Senator, when you say that you disowned these attacks, and you didn’t personally direct them, I believe you. Well, thank you. But at a certain point, you got to ask yourself, why did this pattern arise? Why is it especially the case among your support? I don’t think it is especially the case, by the way. That’s just not true. Look — Well, people know — And so that meant it wasn’t just Bloomberg on the defensive. The other Democrats also had to take on Sanders, himself. What a wonderful country we have. The best-known socialist in the country happens to be a millionaire with three houses. What’d I miss here? [CROWD MURMURING] Well, you’ll miss that I work in Washington, house one. That’s the first problem. Live in Burlington, house two. And they had to take on each other. Of the country to ourself. Are you trying to say that I’m dumb? Or are you mocking me here, Pete? I’m saying that you shouldn’t trivialize — I said I made — There was more open hostility, more personal bitterness in this two-hour debate than in perhaps all the other debates combined. And that’s because the stakes for the candidates are higher now. And for many of them, really for almost all of them, time may be close to running out. So that’s the latest. It was not only Mr. Sanders and Mr. Bloomberg who were subjected to withering criticism: Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., also engaged in a bitter and lengthy colloquy about foreign policy and their qualifications for the presidency, culminating in a sharp exchange in which Ms. Klobuchar asked Mr. Buttigieg if he was calling her “dumb.” There was little in the debate to suggest that Mr. Sanders, the national front-runner and the favorite to win Nevada’s caucuses on Saturday, had been knocked off balance, and the pile-on against Mr. Bloomberg had the potential to work in Mr. Sanders’s favor by keeping the focus of hostilities elsewhere. But Mr. Sanders, too, was pressed to address some of the persistent questions about his candidacy, including whether he would release a fuller version of his medical records and why his candidacy appears to inspire uniquely vitriolic behavior by some of his supporters on the internet. Mr. Sanders, Vermont’s junior senator, insisted that nearly all of his online fans were good and decent people, but said he would “disown those people” who behave in deplorable ways. Nobody acted with more urgency than Ms. Warren, who finished a distant fourth in New Hampshire after doing little to stand out in the debate there. She repeatedly inserted herself into main currents of the conversation. The challenge for her, though, is that her newfound vigor came after tens of thousands of Nevadans had already cast their ballots in early voting. It was Ms. Warren who initiated the exchange that may have damaged Mr. Bloomberg the most when she repeatedly demanded to know whether he would be willing to release some of the former female employees at his news media organization from the nondisclosure agreements they had signed. He declined to do so, calling the agreements “consensual,” and minimized the underlying complaints by suggesting that the women merely “didn’t like a joke I told.” After pressing Mr. Bloomberg and leaving him flustered, but unable to coax him into releasing the women she said he had “muzzled,” Ms. Warren then broadened her attack. “We are not going to beat Donald Trump with a man who has who-knows-how-many nondisclosure agreements and the drip, drip, drip of stories of women saying they have been harassed and discriminated against,” she said. Before Mr. Bloomberg could even try to defend himself, Mr. Biden, who has seen the former New York mayor claim some of his support, gladly stepped in. “All the mayor has to say is, You are released from the N.D.A., period,” Mr. Biden said, his voice rising. In what became, for both of them, their most energetic debate in months, Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren teamed up to confront Mr. Bloomberg about his record on policing, challenging his expressions of contrition about his years of strong support for invasive searches that disproportionately targeted black and Hispanic men. The unlikely duo wielded the same combination of indignation and inquisition that framed their argument about sexual harassment. “It’s not whether he apologized or not, it’s the policy,” Mr. Biden said, accusing Mr. Bloomberg of discounting concerns raised by the Obama administration. As in most of the tough exchanges of the night, Mr. Bloomberg defended himself only up to a point: He explained that he was focused on protecting New Yorkers’ “right to live,” and in the process embraced a policing strategy he later came to regret. Looking back on his time as mayor, Mr. Bloomberg said, “the one thing I’m really worried about, embarrassed about, was how it turned out with stop and frisk.” Ms. Warren jumped in to dissect that answer. “This isn’t about how it turned out,” she said. “This is about what it was designed to do, to begin with. It targeted communities of color.” Mr. Bloomberg has risen in the polls thanks to spending more than $400 million in advertising, nearly all of it on next month’s Super Tuesday contests, but he had largely avoided engaging with voters, let alone his Democratic rivals. His decision to participate in the debate before those March 3 states was a gamble — and one his own campaign all but conceded they didn’t win. They acknowledged his lackluster performance, at least in the first hour of the two-hour forum, even as they boasted about how all of the attacks on him demonstrated the threat he poses. “It took him just 45 minutes in his first debate in 10 years to get his legs on the stage,” Kevin Sheekey, Mr. Bloomberg’s campaign manager, said in a statement after the debate. If Mr. Sanders appeared relatively unbruised Wednesday night, it was not clear that he did anything to put to rest the persistent reservations in the party about his prospects in a contest against Mr. Trump. He dismissed a moderator’s question about polling that found Americans deeply wary of socialism as a political label, noting that the same polling found him leading Mr. Trump in a general election. Mr. Buttigieg and Mr. Bloomberg picked away at Mr. Sanders, with Mr. Bloomberg declaring that he would be a surefire loser in the general election and Mr. Buttigieg warning that it would be dangerous to nominate someone who “wants to burn the house down.” After intraparty politesse prevailed in the first eight debates, when the harshest remarks onstage were usually reserved for Mr. Trump, the evident contempt some of these six candidates have for one another rang out like a jackpot in a slot machine on Wednesday. At no time was that more clear than when Ms. Klobuchar, who split the support of many moderate voters in New Hampshire with Mr. Buttigieg, was reminded by the former South Bend mayor that in a recent interview she had been unable to name the president of Mexico. “You’re staking your candidacy on Washington experience,” Mr. Buttigieg said, pointing out that all of the committees she serves on involve Mexico. “Are you trying to say I’m dumb — are you mocking me, Pete?” Ms. Klobuchar shot back, clearly stung. She then noted she had won all of her campaigns, while he had lost his sole statewide bid “by over 20 points.” Later, Ms. Klobuchar said Mr. Buttigieg had simply “memorized a bunch of talking points” and had never been “in the arena.” Both flashed sharp irritation, as Mr. Buttigieg criticized Ms. Klobuchar’s support for certain Trump appointees and Ms. Klobuchar described his political accomplishments as minimal. “You don’t have to be in Washington to matter,” Mr. Buttigieg said, pointing to his tenure in the struggling city he sought to revive. At one point, Ms. Klobuchar answered Mr. Buttigieg with blunt sarcasm: “I wish everyone was as perfect as you, Pete,” she said. Yet the debate underscored the challenge facing candidates like Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Klobuchar, who are hoping to ride a sense of momentum from Iowa and New Hampshire into stronger finishes elsewhere. But the two rivals spent much of the evening arguing with each other, and both were repeatedly upstaged by clashes involving the candidates better known at the national level. Both were at risk of emerging from the debate weaker than they entered it, and at the end of the evening they had not clearly strengthened their claims to leadership of moderate forces in the Democratic coalition. Just as contentious were the exchanges between Mr. Bloomberg, the proud billionaire, and Mr. Sanders, the democratic socialist who has said billionaires should not exist. Mr. Sanders, who had a heart attack in the fall, answered a question about his personal health records by noting that Mr. Bloomberg has “two stents as well,” prompting Mr. Bloomberg to say that his had been inserted two decades ago. And after Mr. Bloomberg said he made no apologies for his wealth because he had worked hard for his money, Mr. Sanders interjected: “Maybe your workers played some role in that as well.” Mr. Bloomberg eventually confronted Mr. Sanders, saying it was “ridiculous” to suggest the country would “throw out capitalism.” Turning even more personal, Mr. Bloomberg said, “What a wonderful country we have — the best known socialist in the country happens to be a millionaire with three houses.” After listing his residences, Mr. Sanders turned back to Mr. Bloomberg and asked: “Which tax haven do you call home?” The sparring was hardly unanticipated. The rivalry between Mr. Sanders and Mr. Bloomberg has turned harshly personal this week, as their campaigns escalated a feud that both see as serving their political interests. On the morning of the debate, aides to Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Sanders were trading slashing criticism about the health of the two men, who are both 78 years old, and transparency about their medical histories. And in the days leading up to the debate, a number of the candidates denounced the personal attacks that Sanders supporters aimed at the female leaders of the influential union of Las Vegas’s casino employees, the culinary workers’ union, criticism that arose again at Wednesday’s debate. If the other contenders are not able to slow Mr. Sanders in Nevada, he may gain enough momentum going into the Super Tuesday contests on March 3, when 15 states and territories will vote, to eventually claim the nomination. But if he falters here, it could throw the race open and create an opportunity for one or more of his rivals to assert themselves. Mr. Sanders’s prominence in the race even drew a broadside from Ms. Warren, who has largely avoided tangling with him since entering the race. “His campaign relentlessly attacks everyone,” she said, alluding to his supporters’ scorn for those who do not support “Medicare for all.” And then Ms. Warren made a reference to recent comments by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, who said that Mr. Sanders might not be able to initially pass single-payer insurance. “His own advisers say, ‘Eh, probably won’t happen, anyways,’” she said. Mr. Sanders, though, did not return fire. And at the end of the evening, it was clear he had a larger goal in mind: claiming the Democratic nomination, even if he has accrued a plurality, but not a majority of delegates, by the end of the primary season. “I think that the will of the people should prevail, yes,” he said. “The person who has the most votes should become the nominee.” Updated Feb. 29, 2020",The New York Times
2020,"Warren Says Bloomberg Shouldn’t Be Nominee, Citing Redlining Remarks","Her comments about Michael Bloomberg, who has faced criticism over a statement he made 12 years ago about a discriminatory housing practice, came as she tries to reignite enthusiasm for her campaign. ARLINGTON, Va. — Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said Thursday that Michael R. Bloomberg should not be the Democratic presidential nominee because of newly surfaced comments he made 12 years ago in which he said the end of a discriminatory housing practice had helped contribute to the 2008 financial crisis. Ms. Warren’s comments, made at an event here in Northern Virginia, were a strikingly direct broadside against a rival as she tries to reignite enthusiasm for her campaign after her fourth-place finish in New Hampshire this week. “A video just came out yesterday in which Michael Bloomberg is saying, in effect, that the 2008 financial crash was caused because the banks weren’t permitted to discriminate against black and brown people,” Ms. Warren told a crowd of supporters packed into a high school gymnasium. “That crisis would not have been averted if the banks had been able to be bigger racists. And anyone who thinks that should not be the leader of our party.” The comments were a strategic shift for the Massachusetts senator, who has typically tried to stay above the attacks and counterattacks traded by many of her rivals. On Tuesday evening in New Hampshire, she had criticized the aggression shown by some of the other candidates, urging them to forgo “harsh tactics.” Two days later, after speculation over how long she could remain in the race, she slammed Mr. Bloomberg, the self-funding billionaire and former mayor of New York City, whose record on racial issues has increasingly been called into question. He faced criticism on Thursday after his comments about the housing practice, which is known as redlining and discriminates against people of color, were reported by The Associated Press a day earlier. The Massachusetts senator also resurfaced her evergreen critique of Mr. Bloomberg on Thursday in Virginia, one of 15 states and territories that hold presidential nominating contests as part of Super Tuesday on March 3. “This has been some presidential primary already,” she said. “We’ve been going at this for about a year. Some people got in a little later than others. Michael Bloomberg came in on the billionaire plan — just buy yourself the nomination.” Ms. Warren’s campaign said on Thursday that it had raised $1 million since issuing a plea on Wednesday night to raise $7 million before the Nevada caucuses. Her sizable fund-raising goal raises questions about whether her campaign has enough money to sustain her operations past Super Tuesday. Ms. Warren hired more quickly than many of her opponents, leaving her to foot the bill for a large operation earlier in the race. Unlike for some of her rivals, Ms. Warren’s finish in New Hampshire did not lead to a cash infusion. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota raised $5 million on Wednesday alone, hosting a fund-raiser in New York City the day after she beat expectations with a third-place finish in New Hampshire and thrust the term “Klomentum” so far into the mainstream that it now has its own Wikipedia entry. Ms. Warren has canceled $252,000 worth of television advertising planned for South Carolina — everything she had reserved in the state after Sunday. Her campaign will spend nearly $320,000 in TV time for the final two weeks of the Nevada contest, less than half of what Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont or Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., have invested on the state’s airwaves in that time, according to data from Advertising Analytics. The attacks on Mr. Bloomberg seemed designed to generate excitement among Ms. Warren’s supporters and Democrats who are wary of giving a billionaire the nomination. Earlier on Thursday, Ms. Warren released a video on Twitter, ostensibly about her plan to address housing, with the caption: “Here’s a history lesson on the racist legacy of redlining, if any presidential candidate needs a refresher.” Ms. Warren has often performed best in the 2020 campaign when calling out Democratic boogeymen. Following an early slump, she first began rising in the polls after she called for President Trump’s impeachment in April. Her proposed wealth tax on fortunes greater than $50 million has become the campaign’s signature, with some supporters attending events dressed as two pennies to signify how much on the dollar the wealth tax would collect. But her criticisms of Democratic rivals have largely been limited to their high-dollar fund-raising or coziness with corporations. She blasted Mr. Buttigieg for hobnobbing with donors at a California wine cave and said that “Joe Biden was on the side of the credit card companies.” Mr. Bloomberg presents a special case. He is the archetype of the plutocrat she has criticized for years. She has focused particularly on his status as a self-funding candidate and his opposition to her proposed wealth tax. Her campaign’s website features a wealth tax calculator to show how much billionaires who have publicly complained about her proposal would have to pay. Mr. Bloomberg’s tab would be $3.16 billion next year. Ms. Warren has sufficient funds to get through Nevada, South Carolina’s Feb. 29 primary and Super Tuesday, but with campaign staff deployed to 31 states, her campaign will require a healthy flow of new contributions to remain afloat. In a memo sent to supporters and reporters hours before the New Hampshire polls closed, Ms. Warren’s campaign manager, Roger Lau, framed the Super Tuesday states as a three-way contest between Ms. Warren, Mr. Sanders and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. No one else, Mr. Lau wrote, is above the 15 percent threshold to collect delegates in more than a quarter of the 165 congressional districts at stake on Super Tuesday. But that optimism, based on unspecific internal projections, discounts the momentum and invaluable news coverage that come from delivering strong finishes in the early states — something Mr. Buttigieg and Mr. Sanders have done. “I need to level with you,” Ms. Warren said in a video and recorded phone call her campaign texted to supporters on Wednesday night. “Our movement needs critical funds so I can remain competitive in this race through Super Tuesday. A third of delegates don’t get decided until Super Tuesday, so what we do now matters more than ever.” Updated Feb. 29, 2020",The New York Times
2020,D.N.C. Leader Now Calls for ‘Surgical’ Recanvass in Iowa,"Less than 10 hours after announcing that he was “calling on the Iowa Democratic Party to immediately begin a recanvass,” Tom Perez, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said he had actually been calling only for isolated recanvassing of areas where irregularities had been reported in the caucus results. In an interview with Rachel Maddow on MSNBC late Thursday, Mr. Perez pointed to “questions raised” about the tabulations in specific precincts, such as one in Black Hawk County where some state delegate equivalents were mistakenly awarded to Deval Patrick. “We have a shared interest in making sure we had accuracy, so what we did today is asking to make sure that if people need a recanvass in this precinct or that precinct, that it’s done,” he said. In response to a follow-up question from Ms. Maddow, he confirmed that he was not calling for a full, statewide recanvass. “Assuming no candidate files a request, it will be surgical, surgical,” Mr. Perez said. “Because we want to make sure if somebody raises a question, we have an opportunity to answer that question.”",The New York Times
2020,Highlights From the Final Day Before Voting,"MANCHESTER — Amy Klobuchar, sounding only slightly hoarse at her fifth rally of the day, at a bar in downtown Manchester, told voters she was in the process of firing up her campaign operation in the coming Nevada caucuses — “and beyond,” she added. More than any other major candidate, Ms. Klobuchar will have to expand her organization in Nevada in a tightly compressed time frame before the Feb. 22 caucuses. She has focused overwhelmingly so far on Iowa and New Hampshire, and for most of the race has faced significant financial constraints. But a Klobuchar aide said on Monday that the campaign was shifting staff members out of Iowa and into Nevada, and Ms. Klobuchar appears to be in a stronger financial position after a post-debate infusion of online cash. “We’re so excited about tomorrow night and then to Nevada, where we’re building a big operation,” Ms. Klobuchar said. She went on to repeat a plea she has offered over the last few days, telling New Hampshire voters “this is a big deal for me here” and crediting the state with having vaulted relatively unknown or underfunded candidates into national contention in the past. Without strong finishes in both New Hampshire and Nevada — and perhaps even with them — it could be exceedingly difficult for Ms. Klobuchar to compete across the enormous Super Tuesday map in early March. But the mere fact that Ms. Klobuchar is confidently turning her attention west represents a real shift from just last week, when her fifth-place finish in Iowa seemed unlikely, on its own, to change the trajectory of her campaign. Without the intervening debate, Ms. Klobuchar could well have been headed for another likely fifth-place finish, leaving her future as a candidate in serious doubt.",The New York Times

2020,Highlights From South Carolina: CNN Town Halls and Clyburn’s Endorsement,"Elizabeth Warren reiterated on Tuesday that she would be open to staying in the presidential primary even if someone else had amassed an insurmountable plurality — but not a majority — of pledged delegates. That was the position of every other Democrat on the debate stage in Las Vegas last week besides Senator Bernie Sanders — who, as the current front-runner, appears to be the most likely candidate to wind up in the lead in such a situation. “You do know that that was Bernie’s position in 2016?” Ms. Warren said, pushing back on a Sanders supporter in the audience at a CNN town hall who had asked about the issue. She said Mr. Sanders’s “last play” in that race was to win over the party’s so-called superdelegates. She said she would stick to the rules outlined by the Democratic National Committee. “Bernie had a big role in writing the rules.

Mr. Sanders, who congratulated Mr. Biden on his victory at a rally in Virginia, saying, “you can’t win them all,” had jumped to an early delegate lead in the primary race after a close victory in New Hampshire and a big win in Nevada. Tom Steyer, the self-funding billionaire candidate who spent lavishly on his effort nationally and in South Carolina, had not yet earned a delegate, with nearly 90 percent of the results in.

2020,Highlights From the Campaign Trail One Day Before S.C. Primary,"COLUMBIA, S.C. — Pete Buttigieg will have a Sunday morning visit with former President Jimmy Carter the day after the South Carolina primary, the former South Bend, Ind., mayor’s campaign announced Friday night. Mr. Buttigieg will have breakfast with Mr. Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, on Sunday in their hometown Plains, Ga. The 39th president teaches a Sunday school class that has become a regular stop for presidential candidates and political tourists alike. Mr. Buttigieg has already visited Mr. Carter, so has Senator Amy Klobuchar, Senator Cory Booker, Senator Bernie Sanders and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. In recent elections, Mr. Carter has not endorsed in Democratic primaries until after Georgia’s primary, which will take place on March 24 this year. Mr. Carter’s views of the 2020 race are known in part. In September he said he didn’t think he could perform the duties of the president if he was in his late 70s, the age of Mr. Sanders, Mr. Biden and Michael R. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York. But in May 2016, Mr. Carter revealed that he voted for Mr. Sanders over Hillary Clinton in that year’s primary contest.",The New York Times

2020,Democrats’ Attacks Get Personal Ahead of New Hampshire Primary,"MANCHESTER — Bernie Sanders’s campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, said on Sunday that the campaign would call for a recanvass of specific precincts in Iowa, extending the Iowa caucus catastrophe to a second week. In an interview with CNN, Mr. Shakir said: “You can expect us to be asking the Iowa Democratic Party for a recanvass of the discrepancies that we have identified and found for them. We will be searching for and identifying even more.” He added that the process had been “handled incompetently from our perspective.” Also Sunday, the Iowa Democratic Party announced that it had updated data from 55 problematic precincts, about 3 percent of the total, and determined that Pete Buttigieg had won 14 national delegates from the caucuses and Mr. Sanders 12. But reports have shown that many precincts had inconsistencies in their results, and internal party emails showed that the party would not correct errors that had occurred on handwritten worksheets from the precincts — only discrepancies between what was reported on those worksheets and results that were released publicly. The Sanders campaign had announced last week that it had found discrepancies in delegate calculations in 14 precincts. The Iowa Democratic Party has extended its deadline to Monday for campaigns to seek a recanvass of caucus results. Mr. Shakir expressed confidence that Mr. Sanders would have the same number of national delegates as Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., “after it’s all said and done.” A Sanders aide confirmed that the campaign would be seeking a partial recanvass of results. Asked on Thursday on CNN if he would call for such a recanvass, Mr. Sanders responded, “We’ve got enough of Iowa,” and said it was time to “move on to New Hampshire.”",The New York Times

2020,Highlights From the Nevada Caucuses: Bernie Sanders Is Declared the Winner,"Officials with the Nevada Democratic Party and the Democratic National Committee stressed all week that they had gone to school on lessons learned from the bungled Iowa caucuses, when a smartphone app for reporting results crashed and phone lines to report results were jammed for hours. But by 11:00 p.m. Eastern time — more than seven hours after Nevada’s caucuses began, and four hours after most of them closed — Nevada Democrats still have only reported results from about 23 percent of the state’s precincts. The tardiness stems from new caucus rules mandated by the D.N.C. that require the state party to collect more than 100 data points from each of Nevada’s 2,097 precincts. The state party also installed a duplicative reporting system to try to prevent Iowa-style mishaps that led to a litany of mathematical errors that had to be corrected later.

2020,Highlights From a Day of Campaigning in South Carolina and Super Tuesday States,"Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina went on the Sunday talk show circuit to emphasize that the primaries are young and to caution against prematurely crowning Bernie Sanders as the Democratic nominee. “South Carolina has a demographic that lends itself well to Democratic voters especially, so I think that if you can win South Carolina decisively, I think you can set the stage for Super Tuesday and you will become the odds-on favorite,” Mr. Clyburn said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “I remember John McCain coming into South Carolina the odds-on favorite. He left South Carolina in bad shape,” he continued, arguing that his state had a history of changing the trajectory of presidential races. “We had Barack Obama win South Carolina and be launched all the way to the presidency. Hillary Clinton won South Carolina and became the odds-on favorite, and she won the nomination.” It’s true that black voters are the core of the Democratic base and that South Carolina is the first opportunity for them to participate in significant numbers, which means it absolutely has the potential to be a game-changer. But none of the examples Mr. Clyburn cited resemble the current situation, in which one candidate (Mr. Sanders) dominated the first three primaries and the candidates counting most on South Carolina (Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Tom Steyer) came nowhere near winning any of them. In 2016, a blowout victory in South Carolina gave Mrs. Clinton a big boost going into Super Tuesday, especially after Bernie Sanders won New Hampshire — but Mrs. Clinton had already won Iowa (albeit narrowly) and Nevada, and was already the favorite. In 2008, South Carolina did cement Mr. Obama as the front-runner, but he had already won an upset in Iowa and earned the most delegates in Nevada. As for John McCain, he ran in both 2000 and 2008. While Mr. Clyburn did not specify what year he was referring to, we can safely assume it wasn’t 2008, given that Mr. McCain didn’t leave South Carolina “in bad shape” that year; he won it. But in 2000, while Mr. McCain won New Hampshire, George W. Bush won the other early contests.",The New York Times

2020,Saturday in New Hampshire: Democrats Start Unloading on One Another,"MANCHESTER — Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders spoke back to back to New Hampshire Democrats at a party dinner tonight, grounding their appeals in two very different themes — both of which have a history of success here. Ms. Warren, speaking first, embraced the role of the underdog. Having come in a distant third in Iowa to Mr. Sanders and former Mayor Pete Buttigieg, and with polls indicating she could face the same fate in New Hampshire, she boasted: “I’ve been winning unwinnable fights pretty much all my life.” Ms. Warren recalled how she confronted executives from her perch in Congress. “Yes, I’m looking at you, C.E.O. of Wells Fargo who got fired,” she said, before invoking her 2012 Senate triumph: “Bye-bye, Scott Brown.” The message was hard to miss: I’ve been counted out before and overcame the odds. If Ms. Warren’s pitch recalled the turnaround of Hillary Clinton, who in 2008 won New Hampshire after being trounced in Iowa, Mr. Sanders evoked memories of past Iowa winners who came into this state with a head of steam, such as John Kerry in 2004. His supporters erupted when he recalled his 6,000-vote margin in the raw vote in Iowa and roared again when Mr. Sanders said he was “confident we’re going to win here in New Hampshire, as well.” The message was hard to miss: Keep up the momentum and they can’t stop us.",The New York Times

2020,"Warren, Bloomberg and Rivals Agree: Trump Is ‘Not Ready’ for Coronavirus","Elizabeth Warren called for redirecting funds from President Trump’s border wall to fight possible outbreaks, and many candidates voiced skepticism of the administration’s leadership. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts called Wednesday for the federal government to redirect money from the construction of President Trump’s border wall and put it toward the containment of the fast-spreading coronavirus. “I’m going to be introducing a plan tomorrow to take every dime that the president is now taking to spend on his racist wall at the southern border and divert it to the coronavirus,” Ms. Warren said on a CNN town hall program from Charleston, S.C., joining her opponents in the Democratic presidential primary in excoriating the Trump administration’s response to the threat. The criticism came just after Mr. Trump held a news conference about the virus, and as American health authorities braced for an outbreak in the United States, with a new case confirmed in California with no apparent links to travel abroad. Three days before the South Carolina Democratic primary, the candidates seemed to unite, momentarily, around a message while selling their own public-health savvy. “The president is not ready for this kind of thing,” Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor, said at his own CNN town hall while Mr. Trump was still speaking in the White House briefing room. “He has left us very exposed.” Two other candidates who were also appearing on CNN took similar aim at the president, insisting that they would do a better job in containing the virus. While Mr. Bloomberg brandished his experience leading New York City through the swine flu outbreak in 2009, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. invoked his time in the Obama administration as it worked to contain the Ebola virus in 2014. “Were I president now,” Mr. Biden said of the coronavirus, “I’d insist that China allow our scientists in to make a hard determination of how it started, where it’s from, how far along it is. Because that is not happening now.” Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota questioned Mr. Trump’s decision to put Vice President Mike Pence in charge of the administration’s response to the outbreak, which has disrupted supply chains and prompted a stock sell-off. “I would think usually you might put a medical professional in charge,” Ms. Klobuchar said, though she acknowledged that the vice president’s involvement might help to elevate the effort. (President Barack Obama named Ron Klain, a Democratic operative, to coordinate the government’s response to the Ebola virus.) While calling out the president’s proposed cuts to funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Ms. Klobuchar also delivered faint praise of Mr. Trump’s choice to invite the agency’s principal deputy director to address the nation alongside him. “He did do it with the C.D.C.,” she said. “I think that’s important, because I believe in science.” Ms. Warren in recent days has pointed to a plan she released weeks ago focused on combating infectious disease outbreaks. On Wednesday she escalated her proposal, with the specific suggestion of redirecting the border-wall money to address the outbreak. “We know that with any virus that develops, the most vulnerable will be our children, seniors, people with compromised immune systems,” she said. “This one is tough.” Mr. Bloomberg, too, planned to step up his message on Thursday, when his campaign will begin airing a new television ad nationally that is focused on the virus. “Health experts warn the U.S. is underprepared,” the ad begins. “Managing a crisis is what Mike Bloomberg does.” Announcing the commercial Wednesday, Mr. Bloomberg’s campaign tore into the president. “Trump is putting American lives at risk every day, ignoring science, claiming the virus will ‘miraculously’ disappear by April and relying on ‘warm weather’ to end the spread of the virus,” the campaign said in a news release. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump issued a message on Twitter criticizing the news media for “doing everything possible to make the Caronavirus look as bad as possible, including panicking markets, if possible.” He added, “Likewise their incompetent Do Nothing Democrat comrades are all talk, no action.” Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the front-runner in the Democratic race, was not among the candidates participating in the CNN town halls on Wednesday, but he has also called Mr. Trump ill informed about the virus. “In the White House today, we have a self-described ‘great genius’ — self-described,” Mr. Sanders said at the Democratic debate on Tuesday. “This great genius has told us that this coronavirus is going to end in two months. April is the magical date that this great scientist we have in the White House has determined.” Mr. Bloomberg reacted with a similarly sarcastic tone on Wednesday. “Oh, I feel so much better,” he said. “No.” “No. 1, he fired the pandemic team two years ago,” Mr. Bloomberg added.

2020,"Opinion | Warren, Bloomberg and What Really Matters","Dems should be talking about financialization and fraud. Opinion Columnist Wednesday’s Democratic debate was far more informative than previous debates. What we learned, in particular, was that as a presidential candidate, Michael Bloomberg is a great businessman — and that Elizabeth Warren remains a force to be reckoned with. Both lessons ran very much counter to the narrative that the news media has been telling in recent weeks. On one side, there has been a palpable eagerness on the part of some news organizations and many pundits to elevate Bloomberg; on the other side, complaints by Warren supporters about her “erasure” from news coverage and polling aren’t wrong. What does all this mean for the nomination? I have no idea. But maybe the Warren-Bloomberg confrontation will help refocus discussion away from so-called Medicare for all — which isn’t going to be enacted, no matter who wins — to an issue where it matters a lot which Democrat prevails. Namely, are we going to do anything to rein in the financialization of the U.S. economy? During the U.S. economy’s greatest generation — the era of rapid, broadly shared growth that followed World War II — Wall Street was a fairly peripheral part of the picture. When people thought about business leaders, they thought about people running companies that actually made things, not people who got rich through wheeling and dealing. But that all changed in the 1980s, largely thanks to financial deregulation. Suddenly the big bucks came from buying and selling companies as opposed to running them. In many cases, these financial deals saddled companies with crippling levels of debt, often ending in bankruptcy and job destruction — a process that continues to this day. There was also an epidemic of financial fraud and racketeering, exemplified by the career of Michael Milken, the junk-bond king Donald Trump just pardoned. And the financial sector itself doubled as a share of the economy, which meant that it was pulling lots of capital and many smart people away from productive activities. For there is no evidence that Wall Street’s mega-expansion made the rest of the economy more efficient. On the contrary, growth in family incomes slowed down as finance rose — although a few people became immensely rich. And the runaway growth of finance set the stage for the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. It also made Michael Bloomberg a billionaire. Now, I wasn’t being sarcastic in calling Bloomberg a great businessman. He is. And to his credit, he himself hasn’t, as far as I know, engaged in destructive financial wheeling and dealing. Instead, he got rich by selling equipment to destructive wheeler-dealers. For those who don’t know what I’m talking about, I’m referring to the famous Bloomberg Terminal, a proprietary computer system that gives subscribers real-time access to large quantities of financial data. This access is incredibly expensive — a subscription costs around $24,000 a year. But it’s a must-have in the financial industry, because traders with Bloomberg Terminals can react to market events a few minutes faster than those without. It’s an extremely profitable business. But is it good for the economy? No. After all, does getting financial information a few minutes earlier do anything significant to improve real-world business decisions that affect jobs and productivity? Surely not. Bloomberg has, in effect, made his billions off a financial arms race that costs vast sums but leaves everyone pretty much back where they started. Which brings me to Elizabeth Warren. Warren stumbled badly, making herself a long shot for the nomination, by trying to appease supporters of Bernie Sanders. She endorsed proposals for radical health care reform that have almost no chance of becoming reality, and she was raked over the coals about paying for those proposals even though Sanders himself has offered few clues about his own plans. But before all that, Warren had made a name for herself as a crusader against financial industry fraud and excess. It wasn’t just talk. One key piece of the reforms instituted after the 2008 financial crisis, the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, was Warren’s brainchild. Furthermore, by all accounts the bureau was wildly successful, saving ordinary families billions, until the Trump administration set about eviscerating it. And here’s the thing: Financial reform, unlike health care, is an area in which it might make a big difference which Democrat becomes president. It’s true that other candidates — including Bloomberg! — have endorsed Warren-type reforms. But it is, I think, fair to ask how committed they would be in practice, and also whether they would squander their political capital on unwinnable fights, which is my big concern about Sanders. Again, aside from the clear damage to Bloomberg, I have no idea how or if Wednesday’s debate will affect the Democratic race. But it may have helped remind Democrats that corruption, fraud and the excesses of Wall Street in particular can be potent political issues — especially against a president who is both personally corrupt and so obviously a friend to fraudsters.

2020,Highlights From a Day of Campaigning in South Carolina and Super Tuesday States,"Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina went on the Sunday talk show circuit to emphasize that the primaries are young and to caution against prematurely crowning Bernie Sanders as the Democratic nominee. “South Carolina has a demographic that lends itself well to Democratic voters especially, so I think that if you can win South Carolina decisively, I think you can set the stage for Super Tuesday and you will become the odds-on favorite,” Mr. Clyburn said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “I remember John McCain coming into South Carolina the odds-on favorite. He left South Carolina in bad shape,” he continued, arguing that his state had a history of changing the trajectory of presidential races. “We had Barack Obama win South Carolina and be launched all the way to the presidency. Hillary Clinton won South Carolina and became the odds-on favorite, and she won the nomination.” It’s true that black voters are the core of the Democratic base and that South Carolina is the first opportunity for them to participate in significant numbers, which means it absolutely has the potential to be a game-changer. But none of the examples Mr. Clyburn cited resemble the current situation, in which one candidate (Mr. Sanders) dominated the first three primaries and the candidates counting most on South Carolina (Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Tom Steyer) came nowhere near winning any of them. In 2016, a blowout victory in South Carolina gave Mrs. Clinton a big boost going into Super Tuesday, especially after Bernie Sanders won New Hampshire — but Mrs. Clinton had already won Iowa (albeit narrowly) and Nevada, and was already the favorite. In 2008, South Carolina did cement Mr. Obama as the front-runner, but he had already won an upset in Iowa and earned the most delegates in Nevada. As for John McCain, he ran in both 2000 and 2008. While Mr. Clyburn did not specify what year he was referring to, we can safely assume it wasn’t 2008, given that Mr. McCain didn’t leave South Carolina “in bad shape” that year; he won it. But in 2000, while Mr. McCain won New Hampshire, George W. Bush won the other early contests.",The New York Times
2020,Democrats’ Attacks Get Personal Ahead of New Hampshire Primary,"MANCHESTER — Bernie Sanders’s campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, said on Sunday that the campaign would call for a recanvass of specific precincts in Iowa, extending the Iowa caucus catastrophe to a second week. In an interview with CNN, Mr. Shakir said: “You can expect us to be asking the Iowa Democratic Party for a recanvass of the discrepancies that we have identified and found for them. We will be searching for and identifying even more.” He added that the process had been “handled incompetently from our perspective.” Also Sunday, the Iowa Democratic Party announced that it had updated data from 55 problematic precincts, about 3 percent of the total, and determined that Pete Buttigieg had won 14 national delegates from the caucuses and Mr. Sanders 12. But reports have shown that many precincts had inconsistencies in their results, and internal party emails showed that the party would not correct errors that had occurred on handwritten worksheets from the precincts — only discrepancies between what was reported on those worksheets and results that were released publicly. The Sanders campaign had announced last week that it had found discrepancies in delegate calculations in 14 precincts. The Iowa Democratic Party has extended its deadline to Monday for campaigns to seek a recanvass of caucus results. Mr. Shakir expressed confidence that Mr. Sanders would have the same number of national delegates as Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., “after it’s all said and done.” A Sanders aide confirmed that the campaign would be seeking a partial recanvass of results. Asked on Thursday on CNN if he would call for such a recanvass, Mr. Sanders responded, “We’ve got enough of Iowa,” and said it was time to “move on to New Hampshire.”",The New York Times
2020,Was Instagram the Steal of the Century?,"President Trump boasted of an economic boom in his State of the Union address last night. Here’s the NYT fact check of his claims. (Want this in your inbox each morning? Sign up here.) In the same week that Alphabet drew back a curtain on YouTube’s money machine, we also now have a better sense of how big Facebook’s Instagram subsidiary is — and it’s even larger. Instagram collected about $20 billion in ad revenue last year, Sarah Frier and Nico Grant of Bloomberg report, citing unnamed sources. That’s more than a quarter of all of Facebook’s sales last year — and a sea change from 2012, the year that Facebook bought Instagram, when the service had no ads. YouTube’s reported ad revenue was $15.2 billion last year. And that’s a “gross revenue” figure including money meant to be shared with the service’s content creators. (Those video stars also now want a bigger cut from YouTube.) And Instagram doesn’t share any revenue with users, as our colleague Shira Ovide points out. The revelation underscores why Facebook is fighting critics who want the company broken up. The tech giant is under investigation from the antitrust authorities, and lawmakers like Senator Elizabeth Warren have said it shouldn’t be allowed to exist in its current form. Question of the day: Which deal will be considered better 10 years from now: Facebook’s $1 billion takeover of Instagram, or Google’s $1.65 billion acquisition of YouTube? Send us your thoughts. The chaos of the Iowa Democratic caucuses came down not to hacking, but to a faulty app created by a company whose previous work was riddled with failures, the NYT reports. • The app was created by Shadow, which was founded by veterans of Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. • But the company almost went bankrupt when its previous products failed. It was bailed out by Acronym, a highly touted progressive digital advocacy group. • Shadow took on a seemingly impossible task: creating an app to tabulate caucus results within two months. The work was so rushed that the company didn’t even have time for Apple to approve the app. “Precinct leaders failed to access the app or reported being locked out as they sought to punch in numbers to report them to state party officials,” the WaPo reports. The debacle raises questions about the Democrats’ digital strategy, which the NYT notes largely revolves around “enterprises that are intended to both boost the Democrats’ digital game and turn a profit, like Shadow.” (The Trump campaign keeps its digital operations largely in-house.) The electric-car maker’s shares have been on a tear this year, prompting some to wonder whether it’s in bubble territory. Here are a few potential factors behind the company’s dizzying run. • Critics are getting squeezed. Short-sellers — investors who have borrowed Tesla shares and sold them, betting that the stock will fall when they buy back shares to cover their bets — are suffering as the stock rises. Many of them may be covering their bets by buying more shares, in what’s known as a short squeeze. • Hugely enthusiastic backers. The prominent investor Ron Baron added to the exuberant expectations for Tesla yesterday, saying that the company could have $1 trillion in total revenue over the coming decade. The bottom line: “You can explain it with math,” Peter Cecchini, the chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald, told the WSJ. “But you don’t need to explain it with math to know that it’s silly.” More: Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund sold nearly all of its shares in Tesla in the fourth quarter — before the company’s stock began its current run. Analysts and business executives have worried that the current coronavirus outbreak could affect global supply chains. That fear is increasingly becoming reality. The carmaker Hyundai said it was idling plants in South Korea because of a shortage of Chinese parts. They are the first major factory lines outside China to be temporarily shut down. “The global economy remains highly interconnected and interdependent,” write Jack Ewing, Neal Boudette and Geneva Abdul of the NYT. “Supply chains are finely tuned to deliver parts just as they are needed, so companies don’t need to waste money on big warehouses.” Many manufacturers have stockpiles of Chinese parts — but “nobody planned to be down for a month,” Dan Hearsch of the consultancy AlixPartners told the NYT. “If it becomes six weeks, eight weeks, 10 weeks, that’s a real problem.” More: The S.E.C. is warning investors about fraudulent claims tied to coronavirus treatments. And critics of Beijing are mocking the government’s response as a game of “tossing the wok.” When the German lender began a business relationship with Donald Trump, it took on a borrower whom few on Wall Street were willing to work with. That has since put Deutsche Bank under a spotlight — and made it privy to Mr. Trump’s true finances, David Enrich writes in the NYT magazine. From the article, which is based on Mr. Enrich’s new book, “Dark Towers: Deutsche Bank, Donald Trump, and an Epic Trail of Destruction”: Executives told me that the bank has, or at one point had, portions of Trump’s personal federal income tax returns going back to around 2011. (Deutsche Bank lawyers told a federal court last year that the bank does not have those returns; it is unclear what happened to them. The Trump Organization did not respond to multiple requests for comment.) The bank has documents detailing the finances and operations of his businesses. And it has records about internal deliberations over whether and how to do business with Trump — a paper trail that most likely reflects some bank employees’ concerns about potentially suspicious transactions that they detected in the family’s accounts. Mr. Enrich’s takeaway: “Deutsche Bank’s relationship with Trump, rather than being an odd outlier, is a kind of object lesson in how the bank lost its way.” Bonus: Mr. Enrich has obtained the talking points that Deutsche Bank gave employees before his book’s publication. Walt Disney’s earnings report yesterday may have been a mixed bag, but Wall Street mainly cared about one figure: the number of subscribers to its Disney Plus streaming service, writes Brooks Barnes of the NYT. Disney Plus reported 28.6 million subscribers as of Monday. That’s impressive for a service that’s less than three months old and isn’t available in most countries. Bob Iger, Disney’s C.E.O., told analysts that it “exceeded even our greatest expectations.” That number is expected to grow this spring as Disney Plus enters new markets beyond the U.S., Canada and three other countries. Mr. Iger has bet Disney’s future in part on streaming, and the subscriber number puts the service in a strong position to compete with the likes of Netflix (167 million subscribers worldwide) and Amazon Prime (150 million subscribers worldwide). Now for the bad news: • Disney expects to lose over $300 million from the temporary closing of its Shanghai and Hong Kong theme parks because of the coronavirus outbreak. • Profit declined sharply at ESPN, long Disney’s biggest moneymaker.

2020,Was U.S. Wrong About Attack That Nearly Started a War With Iran?,"Iraqi military and intelligence officials have raised doubts about who fired the rockets that started a dangerous spiral of events. NEPTIS, Iraq — The white Kia pickup turned off the desert road and rumbled onto a dirt track, stopping near a marsh. Soon there was a flash and a ripping sound as the first of the rockets fired from the truck soared toward Iraq’s K-1 military base. The rockets wounded six people and killed an American contractor, setting off a chain of events that brought the United States and Iran to the brink of war. The United States blamed an Iraqi militia with close ties to Iran and bombed five of the group’s bases. Angry Iraqis then stormed the American Embassy. The United States then killed Iran’s top general. Iran then fired missiles at American forces and mistakenly shot down a passenger jet, killing 176 people. But Iraqi military and intelligence officials have raised doubts about who fired the rockets that started the spiral of events, saying they believe it is unlikely that the militia the United States blamed for the attack, Khataib Hezbollah, carried it out. Iraqi officials acknowledge that they have no direct evidence tying the Dec. 27 rocket attack to one group or another. And elements of Iraq’s security forces have close ties to Iran, which might make them reluctant to blame an Iranian-linked force. American officials insist that they have solid evidence that Khataib Hezbollah carried out the attack, though they have not made it public. Iraqi officials say their doubts are based on circumstantial evidence and long experience in the area where the attack took place. The rockets were launched from a Sunni Muslim part of Kirkuk Province notorious for attacks by the Islamic State, a Sunni terrorist group, which would have made the area hostile territory for a Shiite militia like Khataib Hezbollah. Khataib Hezbollah has not had a presence in Kirkuk Province since 2014. The Islamic State, however, had carried out three attacks relatively close to the base in the 10 days before the attack on K-1. Iraqi intelligence officials sent reports to the Americans in November and December warning that ISIS intended to target K-1, an Iraqi air base in Kirkuk Province that is also used by American forces. And the abandoned Kia pickup was found was less than 1,000 feet from the site of an ISIS execution in September of five Shiite buffalo herders. These facts all point to the Islamic State, Iraqi officials say. “All the indications are that it was Daesh,” said Brig. General Ahmed Adnan, the Iraqi chief of intelligence for the federal police at K-1, using the Arabic acronym for the Islamic State. “I told you about the three incidents in the days just before in the area — we know Daesh’s movements. “We as Iraqi forces cannot even come to this area unless we have a large force because it is not secure. How could it be that someone who doesn’t know the area could come here and find that firing position and launch an attack?” Khataib Hezbollah has denied responsibility for the attack, and no group has claimed it. American officials, however, said they had multiple strands of intelligence indicating that Khataib Hezbollah carried it out. American investigators examined the Kia pickup, which yielded evidence that helped attribute the attack to Khataib Hezbollah, two American officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters. They did not say what about the truck connected it to the group. One American official said they also had intercepted communications showing the group’s involvement. The American officials said that there had been 11 rocket attacks in November and December against Iraqi bases used by American or coalition forces. One official said that for more than half of those attacks, including the Dec. 27 attack, the United States had high confidence that Khataib Hezbollah was responsible. The United States has not presented any of its intelligence publicly. Nor has it shared the intelligence with Iraq. “We have requested the American side to share with us any information, any evidence, but they have not sent us any information,” Lt. Gen. Muhammad al-Bayati, the chief of staff for former Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi, said in an interview. The director general of Iraqi Intelligence and Counterterrorism, Abu Ali al-Basri, said the United States did not consult Iraq before carrying out the Dec. 29 counterattacks on Khataib Hezbollah. “They did not ask for my analysis of what happened in Kirkuk and neither did they share any of their information,” he said. “Usually, they would do both.” Despite the fact that American and Iraqi forces work side by side on counterterrorism, American intelligence and defense officials said that the United States does not always share sensitive intelligence with Iraq because Iranian operatives have penetrated the Baghdad government and will feed intelligence to Tehran. Iraqi intelligence officials said it was difficult to assess the American assertions without seeing the American intelligence. They said they saw nothing unusual about the truck or the rockets used in the Dec. 27 attack that would have connected them to Khataib Hezbollah. The truck was a standard Kia pickup, except that its bed had been fitted with rocket launchers, they said. The rockets — 107 mm katyushas — are used by all sides in Iraq. General Adnan said he delivered the truck to the Americans, and that American investigators removed any rocket fragments and one unexploded rocket from the Iraqi side of the base, so it would be difficult for the Iraqis to conduct a deeper forensic investigation of their own. One discrepancy in the intelligence concerns the number of rockets fired. The Americans said that 31 rockets were fired. Iraqi witnesses, including General Adnan, who was the first to reach the truck, counted 11. Several Iraqi officers on the K-1 base thought there might have been as many as 16 but definitely not 31. Ali Farhan, a farmer and the mayor of Neptis, a tiny village about four miles from K-1 and barely a mile from the launch site, said he happened to be outside talking to his brother about the next morning’s plowing when he saw a truck coming from the southwest — territory friendly to the Islamic State. The truck veered onto a dirt track, went another half mile or so, stopped and turned off its lights. About 35 minutes later, at 7:20 p.m., he saw the first rocket arc into the sky. So did General Adnan, whom the mayor had called for help and who was driving as fast as he could on the dirt road toward the truck to stop it. “I immediately called headquarters and warned them that rockets had begun to launch toward our base,” General Adnan recalled. When he reached the truck, he found that the attack could have been worse. There were three racks of 12 launchers, but fewer than half appeared to have had rockets in them and of those four had failed to launch. That would mean a maximum of 14 rockets were fired. The attack was hardly unanticipated. On Nov. 6, Iraq’s National Security Council sent a report to the Americans noting that since last October, “ISIS terrorists have endeavored to target K-1 base in Kirkuk district by indirect fire (Katyusha rockets).” An intelligence brief sent to United States officials on Dec. 25 said that Islamic State fighters were trying to gain ground northwest of K-1. General Adnan said he had warned the Americans about the possibility of a rocket attack on K-1 as recently as lunch the day of the attack when the Iraqis had invited the American commanders at the base for security talks over chicken tikka, rice and kebabs. One Iraqi Federal Police commander, Col. Talib Madhloum al-Tamimi, said he had beseeched the Americans to keep their reconnaissance balloon in the air to help prevent an attack, but the balloon was down that day for maintenance, he said. General Adnan said three rockets fell on the Iraqi side of the K-1 base, one on the perimeter fence and about seven on the American side. At least one hit a munitions store on the American side, causing a large secondary explosion. Unlike most of the attacks against Iraqi and American targets, this one had casualties. Four American soldiers and two Iraqi federal police officers were wounded. The civilian contractor who was killed, an Iraqi-born American named Nawres Waleed Hamid, was working as an interpreter for the Americans. For the chief of staff of the Iraqi side of the base, Brig. Gen. Amer Isa Hassan, the logical conclusion was that the Islamic State was responsible. “The villages near here are Turkmen and Arab,” he said. “There is sympathy with Daesh there. Why do we resort to blaming Hezbollah or others?” The Islamic State has been increasingly active in this part of Kirkuk Province in the past year, carrying out near daily attacks with roadside bombs and ambushes using small arms. Six days after the attack on the base, Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper told reporters, “As you know, last Friday, U.S. forces were attacked by Khataib Hezbollah in — at a base near Kirkuk.” When American officials informed the Iraqi prime minister they were about to bomb Khataib Hezbollah bases in retaliation, the Iraqis were startled. Iraqi officials said the group had not had a presence in Kirkuk Province in years. The only time it was active there, they said, was in 2014 during the early days of the fight against the Islamic State. Muhammad Muhi, the spokesman for Khataib Hezbollah, denied that the militia was responsible for the attack on K-1. The group was only in Kirkuk Province for 80 days in 2014, he said in an interview. If the Americans had proof that Khataib Hezbollah carried out the attack, he said, they should “share it.” American officials said that the group has operated throughout Iraq, and has routinely conducted attacks in Sunni territory. The American attacks on Khataib Hezbollah on Jan. 2 and the drone attack that killed the Iranian and Iraqi military leaders at the Baghdad airport the next day led to widespread anger against the American presence in Iraq and a vote in Iraq’s Parliament to expel all American forces. The United States has about 5,000 troops in Iraq, whose primary mission is fighting the Islamic State and training the Iraqi military. The Iraqi government has not yet formally asked the Americans to leave but officials on both sides report that relations have been strained. Iraqi officials say many unanswered questions remain about who was responsible for the K-1 attack. “The identity still has not been confirmed,” said Abdul Hussain al-Hunain, an aide to Mr. Abdul Mahdi who served as prime minister until Saturday. “There are certain suspicions and I do not claim to know everything, but it be could ISIS or the Baath Party,” he said, referring to disgruntled remnants of the Sunni establishment that held sway over Iraq before the American invasion of 2003. “The situation is complicated in Iraq.” Julian E. Barnes and Eric Schmitt contributed reporting from Washington, and Falih Hassan from Baghdad.",The New York Times
2020,Watch Brands Fear Coronavirus Will Slash Top-Market Sales,"One analyst’s report: “Our understanding is that luxury consumption in China has ground to a sudden stop.” Get an informed guide to the global outbreak with our daily Coronavirus
 newsletter.
 After a record-breaking 2019, in which exports rose 2.4 percent to reach $22.2 billion, the Swiss watch industry is now facing fears that the spread of the new coronavirus will eliminate growth in 2020. Watchmakers are extremely dependent on Chinese consumer demand — “to the tune of close to 50 percent of their revenues,” Luca Solca, an analyst with Bernstein, said in an email. “A continuing spread of the novel coronavirus epidemic would hit them particularly hard.” That is especially true in Hong Kong, Switzerland’s No. 1 destination for watch exports, which is trying to contain any spread of the virus while still suffering the effects of antigovernment demonstrations that began in June. The semiautonomous city, a special administrative region of China, confirmed in mid-November that it had entered its first recession since 2009. Watch exports to the city fell by 11.4 percent in 2019 compared with the previous year, and the downward trend shows no signs of improving, said Thierry Huron, founder of The Mercury Project, a Swiss watch and jewelry consultancy. Exports to mainland China, however, jumped by 49 percent in December over the previous year’s December total, in anticipation of the Lunar New Year that began Jan. 25, traditionally a popular time for shopping and gift giving. But anecdotal reports suggest that sales in January were broadly affected by the viral outbreak in the central Chinese city of Wuhan and the subsequent travel restrictions imposed on tens of millions of people in the region to contain the disease. As of Feb. 13, at least 1,491 people were reported to have died, all but three in mainland China. The toll has surpassed that of the SARS epidemic of 2002-3. “Our understanding is that luxury consumption in China has ground to a sudden stop,” Mr. Solca wrote in a report to investors dated Feb. 5. Jean-Daniel Pasche, president of the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry, said in an email that the effect of the epidemic “will depend on the length and the extent.” The Swatch Group is not taking any chances. On Feb. 3, the company — which owns seven prestige watchmakers, including Blancpain, Breguet and Omega — announced that it had canceled a global press event scheduled March 4 to 6 in Zurich because of “the uncertainty related to the 2019-nCoV Coronavirus outbreak.” If the virus is not contained by the end of March, said Alexander Linz, a watch journalist for WatchAdvisor.com based in Vienna, “things might change dramatically.” He was referring to the Swiss watch industry’s two most important annual events, Watches & Wonders, a luxury watch fair slated for April 25 to 29 in Geneva, and the Baselworld trade show, scheduled for April 30 to May 5 in Basel, Switzerland. Representatives of both fairs said that, as of now, their shows would go on, though they were monitoring the public health situation closely. So are some participants. On Feb. 11, Bulgari, the Roman jewelry house owned by LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, announced it was withdrawing from the Baselworld fair. Jean-Christophe Babin, its chief executive, said in a statement that the decision had been made “having in mind the SARS impact on the watch fairs years ago as well as acknowledging that the pandemic is still expanding.” Watchmakers are left to draw imperfect comparisons to the SARS epidemic, when the start of the Iraq War and a sharp appreciation of the euro against the dollar contributed to a 4.4 percent drop in exports. “If the media craze surrounding coronavirus does not abide quickly, it may very well cause much more economic damage than 17 years ago,” Maximilian Büsser, founder and creative director of the Geneva-based brand MB&F, said in an email. “Probably the only winners will be e-commerce platforms — as consumers in some parts of the world dare not to venture out of their homes.”",The New York Times
2020,Watch Elisabeth Moss Fight ‘The Invisible Man’,"anatomy of a scene The writer and director Leigh Whannell narrates a sequence from his thriller. transcript Hi, I’m Leigh Whannell. I’m the writer and director of the film, “The Invisible Man.” A lot of the film deals with paranoia and whether or not Elisabeth Moss’s character is really seeing something. And this is a scene where she’s actually dealing with physical presence and a physical threat. We don’t get to meet our antagonist, Adrian. You don’t have to learn a lot about him as the film goes on. And so I wanted the threat to suddenly become very real. And I thought it would be an interesting way to shoot a scene like this where two people are fighting, but you can only see one of the participants. [RUNNING WATER] And I could see that in my mind’s eye. I could see what that would look like if we pulled it off well. Turns out it was quite hard to achieve. It took a while to get there, to get the thing on screen that I could see in my head when I was writing. But we got here, eventually. [LOUD NOISE] There’s obviously moments in this scene that Elisabeth Moss could not perform. She’s not a trained stunt performer. She cannot be thrown across a table. So then the question becomes, how do we shoot Elisabeth Moss and then cut to somebody else? So in the middle of the shot, we have to match frame a stunt person in. And then, so she’ll do the actual throw and she’ll get thrown, and then she’ll land, and we have to freeze her and then match frame Elisabeth back in. And it was very technically difficult when she was interacting with the stunt performer in a green suit and when she wasn’t. Because as we found out when we did visual effects, it’s kind of easier to add something to a frame with CGI. It’s hard to remove something, especially a human body in a bright green suit. Like if this person is moving and blocking the other actor, and what are we going to do with that moment where the stunt performer’s arm is blocking Elisabeth’s face. But I know that the visual effects guys, a company called Cutting Edge, in Sydney, had a lot of sleepless nights to get it looking amazing. [BREAKING DISH] In “Anatomy of a Scene,” we ask directors to reveal the secrets that go into making key scenes in their movies. See new episodes in the series each Friday. You can also watch our collection of more than 150 videos on YouTube and subscribe to our YouTube channel. This is not your typical domestic fight. In “The Invisible Man,” the writer and director Leigh Whannell wanted a visceral way to represent the physical yet invisible threat to the film’s lead, Cecilia, played by Elisabeth Moss. It all comes together in this kitchen scene, where Cecilia is lifted into the air by her unseen tormentor, then flung around the room. It took a team of stunt performers, visual effects artists and a committed star to make it happen. Moss, who has dance training, did some of the physical work in the scene, with her stunt double taking on the most intense elements. Moss was assisted by wires, while also tussling with a stunt performer in a green body suit who would later be erased by visual effects. To get the elements of the shot right, Whannell said the team used a motion-control camera, a robotic rig that is capable of executing the same move from take to take with expert precision. They first shot the scene without performers, then shot it again with the actors in place. Because much of the action is meant to look as if it’s been captured in one continuous shot, the filmmakers had to figure out a way to cut to Moss’s stunt double for a moment she gets thrown across a table. Because of the motion control, they could match up the frames in different takes and stitch them together. The Sydney company Cutting Edge worked to bring the invisibility effects to life.

2020,Watch Mars Disappear Behind the Moon in the Early Morning Sky,"In what is known as an occultation, Mars will briefly be blocked by the moon on Tuesday morning. Want to see a cosmic magic trick? Look to the sky early on Tuesday, and the crescent moon will make Mars disappear. Then about an hour later, the red planet will return, as if nothing ever happened. This celestial event is known as a Moon-Mars occultation, and it occurs from some vantage point on Earth about twice a year, according to NASA. Skywatchers from much of North and Central America will have a front-row seat to Tuesday’s occultation, and those along part of the West Coast will have an especially good view, with a chance to watch the entire show before sunrise. This pre-dawn meetup is a useful preview of how Mars will be central to space exploration this year. Three robotic rover missions are expected to launch to the red planet this summer — one built by NASA, a second by China and a third produced by a European-Russian collaboration. The United Arab Emirates will also launch a Mars mission, an uncrewed orbiter called Hope. Each space program is taking advantage of Mars and Earth getting closer in their orbits around the sun, which happens about every 26 months. The spacecraft are scheduled to arrive at Mars early next year. Astronomically speaking, an occultation is when one object moves in front of another object in the sky from our point of view. The most famous example is a solar eclipse, when the moon momentarily slides in front of the sun. The moon also occasionally occults planets. That happens because the moon and the planets in our solar system all generally move along the same plane around the sun. “It looks awesome because you’re watching celestial bodies appear to interact with each other,” said Jackie Faherty, an astrophysicist at the American Museum of Natural History. Occultations can occur between the moon and planets, with pairs of planets and also when planets or the moon cross paths with far away stars. Although from our perspective you might imagine two or more heavenly bodies colliding, such objects are millions of miles apart from each other (or even separated by light years). With the right telescope equipment, the results can be jaw-dropping, like this lunar occultation of Saturn in 2019. “It’s a really cool example and reminder of the three-dimensional world we live in,” said Dr. Faherty. The time of the event varies depending on what time zone and city you live in. Below are some general times for cities across the continental United States, according to EarthSky. For people in New York, the Moon-Mars occultation will start around 7:36 a.m. Eastern, according to EarthSky, and will end around 9:05 a.m. Because the event will happen after sunrise, viewers on the East Coast will have a tough time watching it and will need a telescope. Those watching from Omaha, for example, will see Mars disappear around 5:52 a.m. local time and reappear just after sunrise around 7:18 a.m. Skygazers in Denver, for instance, will see the occultation begin at 4:41 a.m. and end at 6:02 a.m. In and around the Rocky Mountains, you will not need a telescope as the event will happen before sunrise and be visible with your naked eye. Dr. Faherty suggests bringing binoculars if you want to add to the experience. Skygazers up and down the West Coast will get to see the show, but those in Southern California will be especially lucky as Mars’s disappearance and reappearance will be timed after moonrise and before sunrise. In Los Angeles, for instance, the occultation will begin at 3:38 a.m. and end at 4:29 a.m. Unfortunately for viewers in San Francisco and the Pacific Northwest, the moon will not be above the horizon before the beginning of the occultation. These viewers will miss the disappearance of Mars, but will be able to see its reappearance. People in San Francisco, for example, can see Mars hop out from behind the moon at 4:20 a.m. There will be four more Moon-Mars occultations this year, although this is the only one that will be visible from North America. For lovers of the dark skies, Dr. Faherty said that even after the occultation ends, “the action keeps going,” because the crescent moon will swing near Jupiter on Wednesday before dawn and then mosey up to Saturn on Thursday. And in October this year, Earth and Mars will be at their closest approach in two years, NASA says, which could offer strong views of the red planet to the naked eye. Never miss an eclipse, a meteor shower, a rocket launch or any other astronomical and space event that's out of this world.",The New York Times
2020,Watch an Artist Make a One-Minute Sculpture With a Sweater,"In the latest episode of “Make T Something,” Erwin Wurm demonstrates an alternative use for a pullover. In the hands of the Austrian artist Erwin Wurm, everyday objects become sculptural phenomena. Wurm, who lives and works between Vienna and Limberg, is best known for his extensive, ongoing “One Minute Sculpture” series, which interrogates the boundaries between visual and performance art, audience and actor, and proposes a new definition for sculpture entirely. To create the works, the 65-year-old artist provides written or illustrated instructions for viewers, inviting them to pose with wooden furniture, plastic buckets or ballpoint pens in unusual, sometimes physically strenuous, positions. The resulting contortions, which Wurm records in photographs, are at once humorous and discomforting: One sculpture comprises a performer pressing their forehead against a stack of three oranges; in another, a spectator is asked to plank their body atop a set of midcentury stools. “Every object I’m surrounded with is a possible part of an art piece,” Wurm says, and that attitude often extends to clothing. So it was not entirely surprising that for our Make T Something series — for which participants must create something in under one hour using only some basic craft supplies, a copy of The New York Times and one item of their choosing — he selected a sweater as his wild-card pick. In the video above, the artist reprises “Psycho I” (1996), a One Minute Sculpture that was first performed for “do it,” an exhibition series of instructional artworks organized by the Swiss curator Hans-Ulrich Obrist that debuted in Klagenfurt, Austria, in 1994. To achieve the work, the artist makes creative use of both The Times and his oversize crew-neck knit. Wurm, who is concerned with the mutability of form, thinks of clothing as “a second skin” through which identity is constructed, and he likens this process to the shaping of a cast bronze sculpture: “It’s a very thin layer of bronze skin which defines the form. The inside is empty.” While these One Minute Sculptures, which were the focus of Wurm’s presentation at the 2017 Venice Biennial, are ephemeral by nature, the artist has also reimagined them as static, physical objects. In a newer series, “One Minute Forever,” the artist swaps active participants for concrete and acrylic renderings of the human body, evoking ancient Greek busts. One piece, currently on view in the exhibition “Yes Biological” at Lehmann Maupin gallery in New York, shows oranges held by a disembodied, bone-white hand. “It’s a paradox,” Wurm says of this attempt to make a singular moment eternal. “And I like paradoxes.”",The New York Times
2020,Watchdog Says Buttigieg Campaign Exploited Super PAC Loophole,"On Politics Media Watch Campaigns and super PACs aren’t supposed to work together, but social media is blurring the lines. Hi. Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I’m Nick Corasaniti, your host on Tuesdays for our coverage of all things media and messaging, writing to you from Las Vegas, where the leading Democratic presidential candidates are set to debate tomorrow night. Sign up here to get On Politics in your inbox every weekday. To most supporters of Pete Buttigieg, the tweet probably seemed innocuous: A senior adviser to Mr. Buttigieg, Michael Halle, simply noted that the candidate’s military record would be an asset in Nevada. But critics say Mr. Halle’s tweet also served as a Bat Signal to VoteVets, the super PAC supporting Mr. Buttigieg’s candidacy, with an unmistakable directive: Run ads in Nevada on this issue. “Pete’s military experience and closing message from Iowa work everywhere especially in Nevada where it’s critical they see this on the air through the caucus,” Mr. Halle wrote on Feb. 5. The Federal Election Commission prohibits political campaigns from coordinating activities with outside groups — the super PACs, political nonprofits and dark-money groups that can collect unlimited contributions. But campaigns have been exploiting a loophole for years by using public digital communications, largely on social media platforms, to get around the regulations. The argument is that if a campaign says or posts something in public, for everyone to see, and a super PAC just happens to also see it and take action, then it’s fair game. Whether or not VoteVets acted on Mr. Halle’s message, it certainly carried out his wishes: The group cut an ad highlighting Mr. Buttigieg’s military service within about a week of the tweet and has spent roughly $300,000 to keep it on the air in Nevada over the past week. But a campaign finance watchdog group filed a complaint on Tuesday, alleging that Mr. Halle’s tweet ran afoul of federal regulations. Though the F.E.C. allows super PACs to use “publicly available” information to create ads, the complaint said the agency did not allow ads to be created and distributed at the “request or suggestion” of a candidate or his agent. “It was the Buttigieg campaign’s obvious and detailed request for super PAC support here that crossed the legal line,” said Brendan Fischer, the director of the federal reform program at the Campaign Legal Center, the watchdog group that filed the complaint. VoteVets has said it does not coordinate advertising with the Buttigieg campaign, and the Buttigieg campaign did not respond to requests for comment on Tuesday. But Chris Meagher, a campaign spokesman, issued a statement on the same day Mr. Halle sent his tweet that acknowledged that the campaign welcomed VoteVets advertising on the issue. “Pete is the only candidate who isn’t a millionaire or billionaire,” Mr. Meagher said at the time. “And if the largest progressive veterans group wants to help spread the word about his service, we welcome it.” Mr. Fischer said the Buttigieg campaign had erased plausible deniability. “They also effectively acknowledged that the request and suggestion was directly tied to VoteVets,” Mr. Fischer said. “I think that’s what sets this apart.” The dust-up is yet another example of the written-on-the-fly rules that govern digital campaigning, particularly when it comes to the actions of outside groups. Most of this kind of public coordination has involved the expensive task of television advertising. Campaigns have increasingly been dumping extensive footage of campaign rallies or old biographical videos on their YouTube pages. Super PACs or other groups can then download the footage, cut their own ads and use their own money to put them on the air, saving campaigns millions of dollars. This has occasionally led to some humorous viewing. In 2014, the campaign of Senator Mitch McConnell dropped nearly two and a half minutes of footage of the senator signing papers, sitting on a couch with his wife, and giving awkward smirks at the camera (which spawned a meme known as #McConnelling). In 2016, the presidential campaign of Senator Ted Cruz posted nearly 15 hours of footage to YouTube, including outtakes and off-camera coaching from the candidate to his mother. Viewed in a vacuum, it appeared to be largely worthless bloopers. To a super PAC, it was endless footage. Some campaigns have taken public coordination with their super PACs to the extremes. Carly Fiorina, a Republican candidate for president in 2016, relied on her super PAC to stage events, provide signage and staff the sign-up table, on top of advertising. Under F.E.C. rules, Ms. Fiorina’s super PAC could not call the campaign headquarters for a future schedule. So Ms. Fiorina’s campaign created a public Google calendar, which it updated weeks into the future, showing the events she had planned. Even the super PAC’s name, Carly for America, was itself an evasion of an F.E.C. regulation that prohibits super PACs from using a candidate’s name as part of their own. But the group claimed “Carly” was merely an acronym for Conservative, Authentic, Responsive Leadership for You. The F.E.C. hasn’t shown an eagerness to enforce many campaign finance laws for the past decade, and it has lacked a quorum of commissioners since September. The Campaign Legal Center’s complaint is unlikely to be resolved for at least two to three years, Mr. Fischer said. So, with less than five days to go before caucus day, the $290,000 in additional ad reservations that VoteVets has in Nevada is likely to remain unchanged. Drop us a line! We want to hear from our readers. Have a question? We’ll try to answer it. Have a comment? We’re all ears. Email us at onpolitics@nytimes.com. Also, for any of our readers who have a super PAC: My culinary experience and closing appetite from Iowa work everywhere, especially in Nevada, where it’s critical I eat at Tacos El Gordo repeatedly through the caucus. We often consider something an ad only if it has money behind it. But sometimes a campaign-generated video can carry the weight of a political ad with no money behind it at all. Michael R. Bloomberg has already spent more money on a presidential campaign than anyone else in history, plowing $338.7 million into traditional media, according to Advertising Analytics, a tracking firm. (Former President Barack Obama spent $338.3 million in the 2012 campaign, the firm said.) And yet, this week his team found particular success with a video it posted for free online. The video, which catalogs vitriolic messages sent by some of Bernie Sanders’s online supporters, has been viewed more than four million times on Twitter and generated a news cycle’s worth of earned media coverage about the growing spat between the two candidates. The message: The Democratic candidates for president are rarely aggressive in their social media attacks on one another. Their supporters, however, can be a different story, and a subset of Mr. Sanders’s online supporters has become notoriously known as “Bernie Bros.” Mr. Bloomberg’s campaign decided to attack them head-on in its first wholly negative assault on a Democratic rival for president. It ran a rapidly accelerating highlight reel of some of the threats and abusive comments doled out by a selection of Sanders supporters, and framed the Vermont senator as responsible for their actions. After a clip showing Mr. Sanders calling for “civil discourse” at Liberty University in 2015, the ad goes black, with just text on the screen, flipping from “Really?” to “Really.” (Mr. Sanders has said that “anybody making personal attacks against anybody else in my name is not part of our movement.”) The takeaway: Though the online trolls supporting Mr. Sanders have been making waves for years, Mr. Bloomberg’s video was posted to Twitter in the wake of reports that leaders of a powerful Nevada labor union were inundated with online abuse and harassment after they chose not to endorse a candidate in the caucuses there. Other candidates, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, soon weighed in, saying Mr. Sanders had to do more to rein in his online army. Mr. Sanders shot back at Mr. Bloomberg, saying at a rally in Nevada that Mr. Bloomberg was no different than President Trump when it came to using their personal fortunes to advance a “corrupt political system.” But the topic of “Bernie Bros” was trending online and spiking in Google searches. Covering digital campaigning for years now, we’ve seen our fair share of creative fund-raising pitches. There are the sky-is-falling desperation emails, perhaps most egregiously used by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in 2014 (spawning the “emails from the D.C.C.C.” meme). The heartfelt, downtrodden plea, like Joe Biden’s text message that simply starts with “Please?” The blunt email with nothing but a donate button, like this one from Cory Booker. And now, thanks to Tom Winter, we have the mock dating-profile pitch. Mr. Winter, who is a candidate for Montana’s lone congressional seat, sent out an email with pictures from a supposed Tinder profile, featuring the candidate clutching two dogs and appearing shirtless. His interests included “health care” and “talking policy,” and he favored “big mountains” over “big corporations.” The email, sent out on Valentine’s Day, quickly garnered some viral attention. The campaign played coy on Tuesday, however, over how many supporters swiped right to donate. Mr. Winter’s team would not say how much he had raised, but did note that the campaign saw a 300 percent spike in donations after the email was sent out. Thanks for reading.

2020,Water Mains Are Bursting All Over New York. Can They Be Fixed?,"The city spends $400 million a year to repair water mains that have been underground for decades and are increasingly brittle. New York City has nearly 7,000 miles of water mains, enough to send water to Seattle and back. The city also has 97,607 miles of underground electric lines, 4,416 miles of gas mains, 104 miles of steam pipes and thousands of miles of telephone and cable-televison lines. And then there is a labyrinth of train tunnels and other assorted equipment, all jammed together beneath the streets. But much of New York’s underground infrastructure, once visionary and widely imitated, has become old and fragile. The average age of water mains is 66 years, making them as old as boomers born when Dwight D. Eisenhower was president. A reminder of the brittle condition of the city’s infrastructure has played out in several water main breaks in the last month. Two water mains on the Upper West Side broke within days of each other, sending water gushing into the streets, making them impassable. The incidents also underscored how close together the underground systems are, because both of those breaks paralyzed multiple subway lines for hours. On Monday, a water main gave way on the Lower East Side, closing streets and gushing water for hours. “The number of components under the street and out of view is beyond comprehension,” said Jonathan Bowles, the executive director of the Center for an Urban Future, which has done research on infrastructure. “But what’s there is getting older every year and in various states of disrepair. If it’s not tended to, upgraded and replaced, we’re going to see a lot more water main breaks, gas explosions and other breakdowns that have a huge effect not just underground but above ground.” With the health of New York’s underground infrastructure becoming an increasing concern, the city has mounted an ambitious campaign to replace old water mains, perhaps the most vulnerable part of the system. The de Blasio administration plans to spend $800 million over the next two years on new water mains and related infrastructure. The city recorded 459 water main breaks in the last fiscal year, about 1.2 per day, though few were big enough to attract widespread attention. Officials defend the city’s infrastructure maintenance, in part by measuring water main breaks another way. Vincent Sapienza, the commissioner of the Department of Environmental Protection, said there were 6.6 water main breaks for every 100 miles of mains last year, the second lowest rate among large cities (Boston’s rate was lower, at 4.1 per 100 miles of mains.) The national average is 25 breaks a year for every 100 miles of water mains, he said. A group that keeps a national tally of figures from local governments has set a target of 15 breaks a year for every 100 miles of mains. In New York, there were 62 fewer breaks in the 2019 fiscal year before Monday’s incident — from July 1, 2018, to June 30 last year — than in the comparable period the year before, according to agency figures. The agency says there were 166 breaks from last July 1 through the end of January, down from 185 in the same period a year earlier. The city has been spending about $400 million a year, Mr. Sapienza said, to replace water mains in the last five years. The city also does preventive maintenance on existing mains, sending out crews every day to listen for leaks. The crews also work on “modulating pressure” and something they call “exercising valves,” which sounds like Pilates for pipes. It involves opening valves — slowly, and not necessarily all the way — just to keep them somewhat limber. “Modulating pressure” refers to opening or closing valves at different times of the day to keep pressure in mains from building as demand rises and falls. High pressure can weaken pipes, making leaks more likely. Crews also have equipment that can pick up the telltale sign of a leaky pipe: a distinctive whooshing sound. But most of all, they have their own experienced ears. “It could be a couple hundred feet away, but you’re going to hear it,” said Anastasios Georgelis, the deputy commissioner for water and sewer operations. “If they hear anything, and they know the sound, they give it in,” sending information on the location to the agency’s headquarters in Flushing, Queens. The agency then sends another crew out to do more detective work, sometimes with electronic transducers that can pinpoint the location of a leak. The crews are busy this time of year because this is the season for water main breaks. The city says 44 percent of water main breaks happen in December, January and February, when temperatures chill pipes at night and warm them by day. Valves and joints expand and contract. The motion can contribute to leaks and breaks. “The freeze-thaw cycle certainly plays a part in causing breaks,” said Mr. Sapienza, the environmental protection commissioner. “Winter is always tough, and not necessarily if it’s cold for a long period of time. If you have 20 degrees one day and 45 degrees the next day, that presents a challenge.” The environmental protection department has recorded more than 400 water main breaks a year nearly every year since 1998. But despite the number of breaks and how tightly packed things are under the streets, it is relatively rare for the subway to be upended when something does go wrong. Aside from the two water main breaks in January that caused major delays, only twice in all of last year and once in 2018 was service affected by a ruptured pipe, according to figures from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the state-controlled agency that runs the subways. One of the breaks last month sent waves crashing into the steps of Lincoln Center and disrupted subway service along a stretch of the Nos. 1, 2 and 3 lines. The other flooded the station at 103rd Street and Central Park West, interfering with the A, C and D lines. The two water mains that ruptured had both been inspected just last year, officials said, and a laboratory is testing them to determine what went wrong. Officials said the mains that ruptured were laid around 1912. After the break on Central Park West last month, some transit officials grumbled that the city took too long to close the ruptured pipe, making the situation worse than it should have been. Sally Librera, senior vice president of subways for New York City Transit, complained that riders were “denied service for too lengthy a period.” The second break, she added, should “spur quicker shut-off response times by the city and a review of its aging system in hopes of avoiding similar situations.” A spokesman for the transit authority, Tim Minton, later struck a more conciliatory note, saying that there was “great collaboration and good cooperation” with the environmental protection department, a city agency. “We all wish the infrastructure is not aging as it is, that there were not as many incidents,” he said. The city says that it replaces roughly one mile of water mains every week. Some of the pipes that are replaced are old, but Mr. Sapienza said that age alone is not necessarily a reason for replacement. “It’s tough to say what’s the ideal age” for a water main, he said. “We look at some of those pipes from the 1800s — still in excellent shape.” Robert Adamski, who after leaving the environmental protection agency in 2013 wrote a report for the American Society of Civil Engineers, calculated that at the current rate, it would take 150 years to replace every water main — twice the life expectancy of most mains. Mr. Adamski’s report was part of a national report card on infrastructure in 2015. While in the report he said that the city had stepped up maintenance in the last several years, he gave the city’s infrastructure a C-minus over all. The drinking-water system rated a C, but the sewer system a D. Mr. Bowles, of the Center for an Urban Future, said the city needs to lower the average age of mains to about 40 or 50 years. “That may take a decade or two, but I think we’ve got to speed up the replacement cycle,” he said. But the work is complicated given the tangle underground. “We can’t just come in with a big excavator and peel away the street and the soil,” Mr. Sapienza said.",The New York Times
2020,We Are Still Obsessed With Britney Spears,"At a Los Angeles pop-up called the Zone you can live out all your childhood fantasies. LOS ANGELES — Welcome to a Britney Spears fantasy land: the Britney of the past, the Britney we want her to be. Britney Spears the Zone, a 30,000-square-foot fan-generated experiential pop-up dedicated to the career of the Princess of Pop, has been erected at a time when there’s no sign of her return to Vegas — or the stage anywhere — and she is still under personal and financial conservatorship. It includes 10 rooms that each recreate an iconic music video set, album concept or live performance, beginning with a “…Baby One More Time”-inspired high school classroom. There, a video featuring Ms. Spears’s longtime friend and erstwhile assistant, Felicia Culotta, plays from a 150-inch customized LED screen. A special film was applied to the outside to make it look like a chalkboard. “Today is all about unleashing your inner Britney,” Ms. Culotta, as the school principal once more, reminds each group. Then guests are released into Britney High, the classroom doors flung open by a Zone staff member. “I’ve literally cried every time I’ve walked into a room,” said Rachel Posteraro, 21, from Long Beach, Calif., who has been a Britney superfan since the age of 9. Will Tran, 31, a dance and gymnastics instructor from Orange County, who made himself at home on the various sets, said: “I wore my stretchy jeans for a reason.” He and a friend wore matching “Britney for President” T-shirts. “I’m doing it for the ’Gram,” said Mr. Tran, while doing an impressive split. In a jungle-y space, the music video for “I’m a Slave 4 U” was projected onto curtains made of fog, and guests were encouraged to pose with a plush stand-in for Banana, the albino Burmese python who appeared with Ms. Spears during the 2001 MTV Video Music Awards. “Pop-up museums are my favorite,” said Shannon Stone, 28, an accountant for film productions. Ms. Stone, who was dressed as a schoolgirl Britney, filmed a video for her Instagram story, as the motion-tracking eyes of a 35-foot hand-carved python watched the scene from overhead. “There’s always music playing and each room is a new backdrop, which is what every girl on Instagram dreams about,” she said. “It’s all you could want.” Ms. Stone estimated that she had taken about 500 hundred photos already that day. (It was 3:20 p.m.) In the Circus room, guests waited in line to jump into a pit containing 80,000 white plastic balls. A Zone attendant dove into the pit to fish out a toddler submerged over his head. A man dug through the balls, as if looking for something. “I lost my friend!” he yelled. Another adult surfaced from the ball pit as if on cue. For decades, this site was a thriving beacon of American excess, smack in the heart of Hollywood. An emporium of everything from Zirconia jewelry sets to Ziploc sandwich bags. Then, in November 2018, the Kmart across from the Grove closed its doors for good. For a year, the space sat vacant and forgotten. A husk of its former self, waiting for an enterprising producer to come up with its second act. A classic Hollywood cliché. “When we got the space in November, it was completely empty, with a couple abandoned registers up front and no walls,” said Jeff Delson, 36, the chief executive of the music merchandising company Black Sky Creative and the co-creator, along with Shannon Ramirez and Lee Rosen, of Britney Spears the Zone. All three said they are Britney superfans. The singer agreed to license her image and has engaged with the Zone on social media. Mr. Delson has worked with her before; during her Las Vegas residency, he handled much of the merchandising. The pop-up is scheduled to run through April 26. Tickets range from $59.50 to $64.50 at peak hours, and are sold in 15-minute blocks, so that no more than 12 to 15 people are in one activation at a time. This cuts down on crowds and allows for selfies to be taken in peace. But it also means that the Zone has a quiet, lonely feeling at times. At check-in, visitors are given RFID wristbands and instructed to download the Zone’s app. In each room, there is a panel that, when a wristband is swiped against it, routes your photo to your phone within minutes. In a dimly lit room inspired by the music video for “Stronger,” there were three metal chairs attached to the floor, upon which visitors, when there were any, were encouraged by a pink-shirted room attendant to gyrate. When the room was empty, the mirrored walls and empty chairs were an eerie sight juxtaposed with the looping music (“My loneliness ain’t killing me no more”). If the ticket price is prohibitive, the Zone lobby is welcome to all. Here you can shop for merchandise from five capsule collections, including a rainbow Pride collection, an army collection, athleisure, a Zone collection and throwback merchandise. There are also four authentic Britney costumes on display, on loan from the singer, including her blue stewardess costume from the “Toxic” video and the poofy black party dress that 10-year-old Brit wore on “Star Search” in 1992, just seven years before appearing in her underwear on the cover of Rolling Stone. “$70 is a little bit much for someone who hasn’t been relevant recently,” said Rachel Turner, 17, a TikTok star of moderate fame, who graduated from high school early to focus on her social media career. She was eating lunch across the street with her friends when she noticed the big pink Britney mural she had seen on social media. Unwilling to pay for a ticket, she didn’t enter the Zone, and was disappointed to hear that Ms. Spears herself had not yet visited, either. “I just want to take pics in the ball pit,” she said. “It’s so aesthetic.”",The New York Times
2020,We Document Life’s Milestones. How Should We Document Death?,"student opinion Is it something that should be photographed or shared on social media? What traditions and rituals does your family have around death and mourning? Find all our Student Opinion questions here. Has someone close to you ever died? Are you comfortable talking about death with your family and friends? Do you ever post, or see others post, about death on social media? In “The iPhone at the Deathbed,” Penelope Green writes about families who are trying to find meaningful ways to honor the deaths of their loved ones: A mechanic, Mr. Alexander had loved motorcycles, though his health and finances had kept him from being a regular rider. After he was properly adorned, and “looking pretty badass,” as his sister Tawnya Musser said, his siblings and their mother gathered around him, and a brother-in-law took a family photo using his smartphone. “We couldn’t think of a time when all of us had been together with Mom,” Ms. Musser, 34, said. “So we had the conversation. Did Mom want a photo with all seven of her children and was it morbid that one of them was dead?” There ended up being several photographs. They are startling and beautiful. Mr. Alexander looks peaceful and regal. The siblings have shared them among themselves, but the images don’t live on social media, as many contemporary death photos do. In a collision of technology and culture, of new habits and very old ones, we are beginning to photograph our dead again. For families like Mr. Alexander’s who are choosing home funerals and following natural death practices — D.I.Y. affairs that eschew the services of conventional funeral parlors — photography is an extension and celebration of that choice. Family members are sitting with kin in hospice, or taking them home from hospitals, and continuing to care for them after they die, often washing their bodies and then adorning them, as Mr. Alexander’s family did, with favorite clothes, flowers, cards, books and other totems. They are sending their dead off as their grandparents used to, and recording the event and its aftermath with their smartphones. Ms. Green writes that photographing death is not something new: “In one sense it’s surprising because we’ve been so disconnected from death in the last century or so,” said Bess Lovejoy, the author of “Rest in Pieces: The Curious Fates of Famous Corpses,” published in 2013, of the resurgence of home death photography. Ms. Lovejoy is also a member of the Order of the Good Death, an organization of funeral professionals, artists and scholars that prepare a culture generally in denial about death. “But we are returning to the older ways,” she went on, “a movement backward that some say began in the ’70s, with the back-to-nature movement and midwifery and natural births. The natural death movement is part of that. And these photos are unsurprising, too, because we carry our smartphones all the time, and it’s almost like if there isn’t a photo it didn’t happen. Now everyone is a photographer.” Modern photography was born in 1839, when Louis Daguerre refined a process for capturing an image on silver-plated copper. For decades, one of the most common uses of this new technology was the post-mortem photo: an artfully composed image, taken by a professional photographer, of dead family members in all manner of poses. Dead children in the laps of their parents, often with their eyes painted open; dead adults dressed in their finest clothes; even dead parents holding their living children; or entire families, wiped out by diseases like cholera, typhoid or diphtheria, nestled together in bed. The article looks at the role of social media in allowing individuals to own the narrative of their illness or death: Cancer patients and others with terminal illnesses have long used photos and videos to bear witness to their suffering and make visible that which is considered off limits — on blogs, Twitter and now TikTok — and have encouraged family members and friends to do so on their behalf when they are no longer able to, pushing visual and emotional boundaries well beyond what may be considered comfortable. As in the Victorian era, post-mortem photographs of children have a terrible urgency and mission. Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep is an organization of volunteer photographers who make “remembrance portraits” of babies, often of the child in their parent’s arms, to assist in the grieving process. Oliver Wasow, a photographer, recalled the agonizing images a friend shared last summer of her son’s death to cancer at age 8 on Instagram and Facebook, documenting her child’s devastating decline, and then her own grief. It was shattering to see — “You couldn’t ‘like’ the photos,” Mr. Wasow said — but he recognized the value it had for his friend. Some people, he noted, say the difference between analog photography and digital photography is that digital photography is a kind of activity, versus analog photographs, which are documents. “When you throw in social media, it becomes a record of a process rather than a record of a person. Yet the purpose remains the same whether it’s the 19th century or the 21st,” Mr. Wasow said. “It’s about documenting the transition from a physical body to a memory.” Students, read the article, then tell us: How do you think death should be documented? Some of us may be familiar with funerals or memorial services, but the article also discusses photographing, posting on social media, painting portraits, as well as dressing and adorning the dead. Do any of these practices resonate with your own beliefs or rituals around death? Do any of the practices make you feel uncomfortable? Why or why not? What is your reaction to the Death Positive movement? Why do you think there is mystery, fear and taboo around death? How do you think that death can be demystified? How does your family regard death and mourning? Are the people in your life comfortable thinking and talking about death? What are the traditions specific to your family related to death and mourning? Are there specific religious or spiritual practices you engage in? Or, are there secular rituals that are important for your own mourning or healing process? Do you know how your family’s traditions, celebrations or ceremonies of death have changed from generation to generation? What was your reaction to learning that people in the 1800s would photograph the dead? How do you think our relationship to death will evolve over the next 50 or 100 years? The article refers to, “ … the now common experience of seeing emoji applied to tragic events.” If you were to see photographs of death and mourning posted on social media, how would you interact with, and respond to, it? Ms. Green asks, “Do you choose the weeping smiley face or just hit ‘like’?” If a friend tells you that someone close to them has died, do you feel comfortable responding? Is it easier to respond in person or on social media? Students 13 and older are invited to comment.

2020,Opinion | We Don’t Really Know How Many People Have Coronavirus,"In an era when we get flash-flood warnings on phones, why is data on the new coronavirus so limited? Ms. Rosenthal, a journalist and physician, is a contributing opinion writer. It has been nearly three months since the first cases of a new coronavirus pneumonia appeared in Wuhan, China, and it is now a global outbreak. And yet, despite over 80,000 infections worldwide (most of them in China), the world still doesn’t have a clear picture of some of the most basic information about this outbreak. In recent weeks, a smattering of scientific papers and government statements have begun to sketch the outlines of the epidemic. The Chinese national health commission has reported that more than 1,700 medical workers in the country had contracted the virus as of Feb 14. (That’s alarming). The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that some 80 percent of those infected have a mild illness. (That’s comforting). Earlier this week, a joint W.H.O.-China mission announced that the death rate in Wuhan was 2 to 4 percent, but only .7 percent in the rest of China — a difference that makes little scientific sense. In recent days the W.H.O. has complained that China has not been sharing data on infections in health care workers. Earlier this month, the editors of the journal Nature called on researchers to “ensure that their work on this outbreak is shared rapidly and openly.” Much more could be known and, in all likelihood, some scientists out there have good, if not definitive, answers. And yet, the lack of consistent, reliable and regularly updated information on the key measures of this outbreak is startling. In an era when we get flash-flood warnings on phones and weekly influenza statistics from every state, why is data on the new coronavirus so limited? Science, politics and pride have all, in various ways, conspired to keep potentially vital, lifesaving knowledge under wraps. That is problematic at a time when more information is needed to be strategic about preparedness. It began early in the course of the epidemic. On Dec. 30, a Chinese doctor, Li Wenliang posted about a small number of people with an unusual pneumonia on social media. Though scientists in labs were already sequencing the virus, he was “warned and reprimanded” by local officials for rumor-mongering and the “illegal activity of publishing false information online.” (Dr. Li later died of the illness.) There is a tradition in China (and likely much of the world) for local authorities not to report bad news to their superiors. During the Great Leap Forward, local officials reported exaggerated harvest yields even as millions were starving. More recently, officials in Henan Province denied there was an epidemic of AIDS spread through unsanitary blood collection practices. Indeed, even when Beijing urges greater attention to scientific reality, compliance is mixed. On Feb. 13, the Communist Party secretaries of Wuhan and Hubei Province lost their jobs over their botched initial handling of the crisis. But damage had been done. As the virus was taking hold, doctors were not wearing proper protective equipment. Sick people, thinking they just had a cold, didn’t seek medical attention. And travelers continued to board cruise ships spreading a new pathogen. “Early on, management was less than optimal in Hubei and they’re paying for that now,” Dr. Ian Lipkin, a professor of epidemiology at Columbia’s Mailman School of Public Health who has been working in China and advising the Chinese government since the SARS outbreak, told me. There were, of course, some genuine barriers to understanding what exactly was happening in Wuhan: Pneumonias are not unusual in winter, and there was no way to know that there was a novel virus. (Dr. Lipkin’s group is working on building a new test that distinguishes between different cause of viral pneumonias, with a researcher headed to China next week for testing.) Lest Americans feel that it could never happen here, Dr. Lipkin points out that it took many months for health officials in the United States to acknowledge and recognize H.I.V. as a new virus, despite the fact that gay men were turning up at alarming rates with unusual pneumonias and skin cancers. Scientific competition has also slowed reaction and response, experts fear — leading to the extraordinary editors’ plea in Nature. For a young researcher, a paper in Nature or the New England Journal of Medicine is gold in career currency. Scientific prestige may encourage perfecting data for peer review, but preparedness requires rapid dissemination of information. While federal officials in the United States warn Americans to be ready for the virus, there are some important aspects of its spread about which we have little information — even though they have likely already been studied by scientists and officials, in China, in Japan and elsewhere. Scientists in various countries are presumably gathering large amounts of data day by day and the world deserves to see more of it. “Were there patterns around infections, places, procedures? Maybe that is being collected and readied for the medical literature. But it would be hugely important to know,” said Dr. Tom Inglesby, director of the Center for Health Security of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, which studies epidemics. For example: Of the more than 1,700 health workers who were infected in China, did those infections occur before they knew to wear protective equipment? Were they doing procedures that might lead to exposure? Those answers would quell fears about how the virus spreads and how to protect front line workers. Likewise, there were hundreds of people who tested positive aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship and were transferred to the hospital. But there has been little public information released about what shape they were in. How many in the cohort were really sick, how many just had minor symptoms and how many just needed isolation? Does the pattern of infection suggest a role for transmission via plumbing on the ship? Finally, the world’s public health researchers need much more transparency about how officials are monitoring this epidemic. What exactly is China’s surveillance strategy among the general population? To gauge the actual death rate of Covid-19, researchers would need to know how many people actually have it, even if they have only mild symptoms. In-country surveillance may reveal a very large pool of people with mild or no symptoms at all. Dr. Lipkin noted that because cases noted early in an epidemic are the most severe, early mortality estimates tend to be high. As more information comes out, the death rates are likely to fall. “We’re probably six months out from having a good picture and when we do I’d guess the mortality will drop dramatically,” he said. Compared with the situation in 2003, when it took about five months for the Chinese central government to publicly acknowledge a deadly crisis associated with SARS, the flow of information has clearly improved. But since then, travel and commerce between China and the rest of the world has increased manifold. The spread of information about emerging infectious diseases needs to keep up with that new reality. The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

2020,Opinion | We Knew Disease X Was Coming. It’s Here Now.,"We need to stop what drives mass epidemics rather than just respond to individual diseases. Mr. Daszak is a disease ecologist. In early 2018, during a meeting at the World Health Organization in Geneva, a group of experts I belong to (the R&D Blueprint) coined the term “Disease X”: We were referring to the next pandemic, which would be caused by an unknown, novel pathogen that hadn’t yet entered the human population. As the world stands today on the edge of the pandemic precipice, it’s worth taking a moment to consider whether Covid-19 is the disease our group was warning about. Disease X, we said back then, would likely result from a virus originating in animals and would emerge somewhere on the planet where economic development drives people and wildlife together. Disease X would probably be confused with other diseases early in the outbreak and would spread quickly and silently; exploiting networks of human travel and trade, it would reach multiple countries and thwart containment. Disease X would have a mortality rate higher than a seasonal flu but would spread as easily as the flu. It would shake financial markets even before it achieved pandemic status. In a nutshell, Covid-19 is Disease X. Even as there are signs that the epidemic’s spread might be slowing in China, multiple communities and countries have now reported sustained transmission in their midst. The number of confirmed cases has exploded in South Korea in recent days. In Italy, villages and towns are on lockdown, Fashion Week in Milan has been disrupted and festivals are being canceled while public health authorities search for patient zero to identify who else is likely infected and may spread the disease in Europe. Iran appears to have become a new hub of transmission. The looming pandemic will challenge us in new ways, as people try to evade quarantines, and misinformation campaigns and conspiracy theorists ply their trade in open democracies. But as the world struggles to respond to Covid-19, we risk missing the really big picture: Pandemics are on the rise, and we need to contain the process that drives them, not just the individual diseases. Plagues are not only part of our culture; they are caused by it. The Black Death spread into Europe in the mid-14th century with the growth of trade along the Silk Road. New strains of influenza have emerged from livestock farming. Ebola, SARS, MERS and now Covid-19 have been linked to wildlife. Pandemics usually begin as viruses in animals that jump to people when we make contact with them. These spillovers are increasing exponentially as our ecological footprint brings us closer to wildlife in remote areas and the wildlife trade brings these animals into urban centers. Unprecedented road-building, deforestation, land clearing and agricultural development, as well as globalized travel and trade, make us supremely susceptible to pathogens like coronaviruses. Yet the world’s strategy for dealing with pandemics is woefully inadequate. Across the board, from politicians to the public, we treat pandemics as a disaster-response issue: We wait for them to happen and hope a vaccine or drug can be developed quickly in their aftermath. But even as Covid-19 rages, there still is no vaccine available for the SARS virus of 2002-3, nor for HIV/AIDS or Zika or a host of emerging pathogens. The problem is that between outbreaks, the will to spend money on prevention wanes, and the market for vaccines and drugs against sporadic viral diseases isn’t enough to drive research and development. During its World Health Assembly in 2016, the W.H.O. set up the R&D Blueprint to bridge this gap and announced a priority list of pathogens that most threaten global health and for which no vaccines or drugs were in the pipeline. SARS made the list, as did MERS, Nipah, Ebola and other rare but serious diseases caused by epidemic viruses. The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations — a global partnership between public, private, philanthropic and civil society organizations launched at Davos in 2017 — stepped up to the plate and sourced funding to develop vaccines and therapeutics against some of these. To escape from the Age of Pandemics, we’ll need to treat them as a public health issue and start working on prevention in addition to responses. Our first goal should be to broaden our armory against potential mass epidemics. When some of us added “Disease X” to the W.H.O.’s priority list two years ago, we wanted to make the point that it’s not sufficient to develop vaccines and drugs for known agents when the next big one is likely to be a different pathogen — a virus close to SARS, say, but not close enough that the same vaccine can work against both. As Covid-19 strikes today and a spate of other pathogens are ready to emerge in the future, we continue to butt up against nature. Scientists estimate that there are 1.67 million unknown viruses of the type that have previously emerged in people. Discovering and sequencing them should be a priority — a simple case of “know your enemy.” In the aftermath of SARS, research on coronaviruses originating in bats has discovered more than 50 related viruses, some of which have the potential to infect people; this information can now be used to test for broad-action vaccines and drugs. Scaling up this effort to cover all viral families, as the Global Virome Project proposes to do, is a logical first step toward prevention. A radical shift is also needed in the way that tests, vaccines and drugs are designed so that entire groups of pathogens are targeted instead of individual pathogens that are already known. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in the United States is working on a universal flu vaccine that would cover all known strains of influenza; a universal coronavirus vaccine, an Ebola-virus vaccine and others will also be needed. With a smaller investment, we can also try to get ahead of pandemics by working with communities in hot spots of emerging diseases. Disease surveillance should be focused on farmers, rural communities and anyone who has extensive contact with wildlife, to look for unusual illnesses, test for novel pathogens and work with people to develop alternatives to high-risk activities such as the wildlife trade. Pandemics are like terrorist attacks: We know roughly where they originate and what’s responsible for them, but we don’t know exactly when the next one will happen. They need to be handled the same way — by identifying all possible sources and dismantling those before the next pandemic strikes.

2020,Opinion | We Once Fought Jihadists. Now We Battle White Supremacists.,"The truth about so-called domestic terrorism? There is nothing domestic about it. Mr. Rose is a Democratic member of Congress. Mr. Soufan is a former F.B.I. special agent. Update: A day after this article went online, the House Committee on Homeland Security unanimously approved Congressman Max Rose’s Transnational White Supremacist Extremism Review Act. The legislation will now be sent to the full House of Representatives for consideration. As a former soldier and F.B.I. agent, we both risked our lives to fight Al Qaeda. But the enemy we currently face is not a jihadist threat. It’s white supremacists — in the United States and overseas. One American group, the Base, peppered a recruitment video with footage of our faces, intercut with shots of masked men machine-gunning a spray-painted Star of David. The Scandinavia-based Nordic Resistance Movement called us out by name, referring to us in a recent statement as “the Jew Max Rose” and “Arab F.B.I. agent Ali Soufan.” Defenders of the Ukrainian Azov Battalion, which the F.B.I. calls “a paramilitary unit” notorious for its “association with neo-Nazi ideology,” accuse us of being part of a Kremlin campaign to “demonize” the group. Why the sudden attention? Because we, along with dedicated colleagues from across the political spectrum, are working to expose the truth about so-called domestic terrorism: There is nothing domestic about it. Over the past several months — at congressional hearings, in a report by the Soufan Center, and in a letter to the State Department signed by 40 members of Congress — we have documented the existence of a global network of white supremacist extremists that stretches across North America, Europe and Australia. White supremacists today are organizing in a similar fashion to jihadist terrorist organizations, like Al Qaeda, in the 1980s and 1990s. They transcend national barriers with recruitment and dissemination of propaganda. And just as jihadists exploited conflicts in Afghanistan, the Balkans and Syria, so too are white supremacists using the conflict in Ukraine as a laboratory and training ground. Yet despite these profound similarities, United States law has not caught up to the new threat we face. International white supremacist groups are still not designated as foreign terrorist organizations, which means our law enforcement and intelligence agencies cannot access the full suite of tools available to them in countering groups like ISIS and Al Qaeda. A few examples lay bare the extent of this tangled, transnational web. The Australian who in March last year murdered 51 worshipers at mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, claimed in his manifesto that he had traveled to Ukraine; during the attacks he wore a symbol used by the Azov Battalion. The F.B.I. director recently warned that American extremists, too, are traveling overseas for paramilitary training. Among those who have trained with Azov are several of the men responsible for fomenting violence at the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Va., in August 2017. James Alex Fields Jr., who murdered a protester with his car, was a member of Vanguard America, a group with ties to the British network that celebrated Thomas Mair, the far-right extremist who assassinated the British legislator Jo Cox in 2016. Mr. Mair, who is serving a life sentence, was himself closely connected with National Action, a British group that has sought to funnel fighters to Ukraine. This past June, two more British citizens were convicted of terrorism offenses for promoting, among other groups, the United States-based Atomwaffen Division, of which The Base is an offshoot. Recently, Atomwaffen has begun publishing ISIS-style recruitment videos featuring a masked man gesticulating with a hunting knife as he promises a wave of “ever-encroaching terror.” The effect of these far-reaching connections on our homeland is clear. Since 9/11, far-right terrorists have killed 110 people on American soil, while jihadists have killed 107. And the trend is worsening: 2018 was the worst year for far-right violence since Timothy McVeigh attacked Oklahoma City in 1995. Almost twice as many foreign fighters have traveled to join the civil war in Ukraine than to Afghanistan in the ’80s — a conflict which birthed Al Qaeda. The government is aware of the threat: In 2018 the Trump administration warned of violent foreign neo-Nazi groups forging ties with organizations in the United States. Yet no white supremacist group has ever been designated a foreign terrorist organization under federal law. This omission leaves American law enforcement hobbled in its efforts to combat these groups and the rising tide of violence they represent. The arrest of members of The Base in January, including a Canadian national, illustrates not only the F.B.I.’s recognition of the threat and resolve to protect Americans, but also the international connections of American groups. But law enforcement cannot utilize the most effective tools to protect the country. Designating these groups as foreign terrorist organizations would offer authorities three important advantages — ones they currently enjoy when dealing with jihadists. First, they could monitor communications between people connected to the designated groups. Second, they could share intelligence with our allies overseas, an important asset when dealing with international terrorism. And third, they could bring charges for providing material support to the designated groups, with appropriately severe penalties attached. Terrorism is terrorism, however its perpetrators justify it inside their twisted minds. If these peddlers of hate hoped to silence us by attacking us online, they have failed. They’ve only hardened our resolve. Max Rose (@MaxRose4NY), a veteran of the United States Army, represents New York’s 11th District in Congress. Ali H.

2020,We Went to the National Mall to Ask Americans About Impeachment,"Are Americans as divided and siloed as the Republicans and Democrats are in Washington? People visiting the capital shared a range of views on impeachment. WASHINGTON — The impeachment of President Trump has played out like a searing snapshot of the partisan divide, the two parties mostly inhabiting turf so different they might as well be on different planets. We asked Americans visiting the National Mall last weekend to share their thoughts on impeachment. The goal was to see if people’s statements broke down as neatly and predictably on partisan lines as the vast majority of the views expressed in Congress. One thing was clear: Almost everyone agreed that impeachment has been a fraught process that has further divided Americans and made them reconsider where we are as a nation. Alas, that may be all we agree on. Ms. Morasch is a retired social worker from Fairfax City, Va. Though she voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016, she is not registered with a party. She came to Washington to protest how the Senate was conducting the impeachment trial. The way everything gets twisted, you know, whatever your belief is, you can make that the truth. So I don’t have a lot of hope. And it’s sad. That’s the frightening thing. I’m 71 and it’s sad not to have hope at this age. You know, I was thinking about the Pledge of Allegiance and the national anthem when we go to the ballgames. And the last line, America, “The land of the free and the home of the brave.” And I thought, what happened? And I do think he’s going to be re-elected. I’m just afraid for my grandchildren. Mr. Mullis is a retired sports administration official from Houston. He is a Republican. I don’t think he did anything wrong. If you scrutinized every president and every president’s tight-knit circle, could you say something regarding something that happened? There’d be a lot of presidents that would be scrutinized under that. Ultimately, the Democrats are not going to benefit at all. I have always felt good about the country. I think sometimes politics gets in the way of everything that really needs to be done. All the representatives are supposed to represent their constituents, and they really haven’t done that, in order to get new legislation done since Trump’s been elected. Actually, the citizens of the United States are the ones who have been hurt by this. Mr. Williams is an entrepreneur who was visiting Washington from Philadelphia. He said he was “not a fan of Trump.” I just felt over all it’s kind of sketchy. It doesn’t give the American people, or people globally, confidence about where America is headed. I don’t think they’re giving the trial a chance to play out if they’re not bringing witnesses. If you’re not bringing witnesses, you have something to hide. So it’s very suspicious why they don’t want to bring witnesses. Him not bringing witnesses forward is like saying you can hit somebody with your car but get away with it at the same time. Ms. Fletcher is a sophomore at Belmont University, in Nashville, who is studying music business. She is from Tulsa, Okla., and a registered Republican who said that if the election were today, she would “vote for Trump.” I don’t think there’s enough to convict him for. If it’s a question of character, I don’t think it’s enough for impeachment. I think the Senate’s so polarized right now. I don’t think the Republicans are going to be willing to impeach him. I feel like, if anything, less hopeful, not more hopeful. It’s just upsetting that we’re at that place right now where we have to go through a trial in the first place. The fact that we have to go through this as a country isn’t a positive thing. Mr. Hadden is a veteran of the Vietnam War from North Augusta, S.C., and was in Washington for a funeral at Arlington National Cemetery. Politically, he leans Republican. He voted for Mr. Trump in 2016. Look at the economy, everything is great. I think it’s been a sham. It was a basic phone call. We give too much money to foreign countries anyway. He was right to hold it for corruption. I think he’s done the right thing. I don’t think what he did was corrupt. Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer were just wasting time. Ms. Hadden also voted for Mr. Trump and said she planned to do so again in November. I think that impeachment has hurt the country because if you can impeach him, I just think it’s wrong. We’re just glad it’s over. We’re America. We need everybody to get along. Why can’t they? Ms. Williams was visiting Washington for the weekend from Columbus, Ohio, where she works in information technology. She is an independent who voted for Mrs. Clinton in 2016. I think the G.O.P., they have a lot to lose, and they don’t really want to spend the time to invest in a new candidate. I think it will probably hurt Democrats, which is unfortunate to say. I think at this point people just feel like it’s a waste of time and a waste of money, and they feel like he’s gotten away with so much anyway. At this point I just feel like it’s created more division in the country. At this point, the Democrats just need to put their energy behind getting really strong candidates for the 2020 election. Mr. Gately is a project manager in HVAC sales in Raleigh, N.C. He said he tended to view himself as a “little bit of a moderate.” I don’t think President Trump did anything wrong. I think he was looking after the taxpayers’ dollars on the way they would be spent; he wanted to make sure to spend appropriately. He wanted to make sure it wasn’t wasted and involved in any corruption. It’s not about the American people anymore. I think the Democrats are just making it all politics. I just want to see more for the American people. Ms. Akins is from Norman, Okla., and is an account manager at a software company. She is a Democrat who was in Washington to tour the United States Capitol and witness the impeachment trial. I think that any president and actually any political appointee who uses their office to gain personal benefit and uses resources outside of the government to try to coerce and bribe a foreign government to benefit him and or his election should be removed, and actually never allowed to serve again, in any public capacity. We actually were touring the U.S. Capitol today. We were going to go into the Senate impeachment trial to watch, and I was standing in line. So where have we come to in politics? President Trump and all of the elected officials — who typically are Republicans — who support and turn a blind eye to his behavior, his character, the way that he bullies people, it’s just we’re losing our democracy based on corruption, on bullying from the highest places in office. It’s just really sad to me, and I actually was tearing up in the line. I had to leave because I didn’t want to witness it. It’s just disgusting. Mr. Riddle is an equipment company manager based in Charleston, W.Va., who identifies as a Republican. It appears it’s completely partisan, mostly hearsay. And what evidence has been available to the general public has not been convincing me at all. I believe that all of the efforts that have been spent on this could have been much better spent on a lot of other issues this country has going on right now, such as the economy, the China trade deals, things President Trump’s trying to work on. I think it’s been a distraction. I feel like if we all got together and made some compromises and quit building walls between each other, we could probably get a lot more done in this country. It seems harder to do that today than it’s ever been. And that part is troubling. Ms. Peebles is a cabinetmaker from Prineville, Ore., and identifies as a Republican. She said the impeachment against Mr. Trump — and overall partisan politics — had left her worried about the country’s future. I don’t really think there was anything to impeach him on. No crime. Politics, but no crime. I think it was purely political. And I don’t think I’m really right-wing, but I just don’t think they proved it. I do think that political favoring is wrong, but I think everybody does that. But I don’t think it raised the bar of coercion or bribery. But you’re not going to tell me every other president hasn’t said, “Hey, you do this for me,” you know, the idea? It scares me if we get, let’s say, a Democratic president, House and Senate, or something, it just scares me what could happen. I think we’re so political now. It worries me that there’s not enough reasonable people to compromise. It’s your way or the highway lately. Kitty Bennett contributed research. Updated Feb. 29, 2020",The New York Times
2020,Highlights From the Final Day Before Voting,"MANCHESTER — Amy Klobuchar, sounding only slightly hoarse at her fifth rally of the day, at a bar in downtown Manchester, told voters she was in the process of firing up her campaign operation in the coming Nevada caucuses — “and beyond,” she added. More than any other major candidate, Ms. Klobuchar will have to expand her organization in Nevada in a tightly compressed time frame before the Feb. 22 caucuses. She has focused overwhelmingly so far on Iowa and New Hampshire, and for most of the race has faced significant financial constraints. But a Klobuchar aide said on Monday that the campaign was shifting staff members out of Iowa and into Nevada, and Ms. Klobuchar appears to be in a stronger financial position after a post-debate infusion of online cash. “We’re so excited about tomorrow night and then to Nevada, where we’re building a big operation,” Ms. Klobuchar said. She went on to repeat a plea she has offered over the last few days, telling New Hampshire voters “this is a big deal for me here” and crediting the state with having vaulted relatively unknown or underfunded candidates into national contention in the past. Without strong finishes in both New Hampshire and Nevada — and perhaps even with them — it could be exceedingly difficult for Ms. Klobuchar to compete across the enormous Super Tuesday map in early March. But the mere fact that Ms. Klobuchar is confidently turning her attention west represents a real shift from just last week, when her fifth-place finish in Iowa seemed unlikely, on its own, to change the trajectory of her campaign. Without the intervening debate, Ms. Klobuchar could well have been headed for another likely fifth-place finish, leaving her future as a candidate in serious doubt.",The New York Times

2020,WeWork Names Veteran Real Estate Executive as New Chief,"Sandeep Mathrani will take over the operator of shared office space, which was on the brink of financial collapse last year. WeWork, the troubled operator of shared office space, has named Sandeep Mathrani, a senior executive at the commercial real estate company Brookfield Properties, as its new chief executive. Mr. Mathrani, whose appointment was announced on Saturday, replaces Artie Minson and Sebastian Gunningham, the co-chief executives. Mr. Minson and Mr. Gunningham took over in September from Adam Neumann, the WeWork co-founder whose growth-at-all-costs strategy brought the company to the brink of financial collapse last year. In a statement, Mr. Mathrani said WeWork had “redefined how people and companies approach work with an innovative platform, exceptionally talented team and significant potential if we stick to our shared values and maintain our members-first focus.” The appointment of Mr. Mathrani, who is set to start on Feb. 18, would be an important part of WeWork’s attempts to build a business that could sustain itself in the fast growing but highly competitive market for flexible office space. Mr. Mathrani has been chief executive of Brookfield’s retail division since August 2018, according to his LinkedIn page. The naming of an experienced real estate executive is a clear indication that WeWork is moving on from Mr. Neumann’s strategy of building a sprawling company with lofty aims that included transforming how people work and live together. He had promoted WeWork as if it were a groundbreaking technology company set on upending its industry. The firm had also branched out well beyond office space, establishing sleek dormitories for working professionals and even a private school in Manhattan. WeWork withdrew its much anticipated initial public offering in September. SoftBank, WeWork’s largest outside shareholder, agreed in October to bail out the company. Marcelo Claure, a senior SoftBank executive, became WeWork’s executive chairman and has been overseeing the company’s overhaul, which involves pulling back from certain markets, selling off noncore businesses and finding new ways to finance its operations. Mr. Claure will continue as executive chairman. Mr. Mathrani, who did not respond to a request for comment, faces some daunting challenges, not least the struggle to fill all the new locations that WeWork expects to open in 2020. The company has said that it could open 600 spaces this year, almost doubling the size of its network. Commercial real estate executives said Mr. Mathrani probably had strong relationships with large landlords, which might prove useful as WeWork goes through its restructuring. In an interview in December with The New York Times, Mr. Claure said WeWork might seek to renegotiate leases with building owners at some locations. “We’ve been very straight with landlords and said, ‘Look, this is its own independent business,’ and if things don’t work out, sure we’ll have conversations with landlords,” Mr. Claure said. “There will be some of that that’s starting soon.” Commercial real estate executives also said that Mr. Mathrani’s experience in retail could prove particularly valuable. In retail, the goal is to create locations that customers want to keep coming back to. WeWork would benefit if its customers stayed in locations for longer. A big weaknesses in the company’s model is that it leases space from landlords for far longer than its customers rent space in WeWork locations. WeWork leases office space, refurbishes it and then rents it out to individuals and companies. This type of real estate business has grown quickly because it allows customers to rent for shorter periods than would be available under traditional leases. Mr. Neumann had tried to give the business a special allure, saying it gave rise to a sense of community in the workplace that would drive creativity and bring meaning into people’s lives. SoftBank has agreed to plow over $6 billion of new money into WeWork, with the hope that the financing will give the company breathing room to build a sustainable business. WeWork needed the investment because it was spending far more money than it was taking in as it expanded rapidly. In January, WeWork said it had sold its minority stake in the Wing, a collection of work and community spaces for women, to a group of new and existing investors in the Wing. It also announced that it had sold Teem, a company that builds software for sharing office space, to iOFFICE. WeWork did not disclose the financial terms of the deals.

2020,Wearable Tech That Tells Drowsy Truckers It’s Time to Pull Over,"Wheels Biometric sensors are getting lighter, cheaper and more accurate, and could help warn drivers before they become too fatigued. Falling asleep at the wheel is a trucker’s worst nightmare. Fatigue comes with the job of driving an eighteen-wheeler, even with rules requiring rest stops and limiting driving hours. Now, new technologies are becoming available to alert drowsy drivers, sometimes even before they feel tired. Such tech has been slow to enter big rigs’ cabs, but that may be changing. “The trucking industry is more of a wait-and-see group than an early adopter when it comes to technology because they run on thin margins,” said Daniel Bongers, chief technology officer at SmartCap, an Australian company that makes a number of industrial safety products. In addition, the industry, which employs 3.5 million people in the United States, has been focused on a new law requiring the installation of electronic logging devices on most commercial trucks that is meant to help ensure drivers don’t drive more than the legally allotted hours in a day and that they take required breaks. Biometric sensors are getting lighter, cheaper and more accurate, and new software systems can connect driver and vehicle data. The feedback loops these systems create could make the roads safer for everyone. Fatigue is highly underreported as an accident cause, said Dr. Bongers, who has a Ph.D. in mechanical engineering. For example, he said, a crash might officially be attributed to roadwork, but fatigue may have slowed the driver’s reaction time and decision-making. At National Transportation Services in Kent, Wash., Juan Ochoa, an 18-year industry veteran, manages a fleet of about 80 long-haul trucks. He believes most accidents are caused by fatigue. “I’d estimate 70 percent,” he said. One of the first drowsy-driving monitoring systems to appear in the truckers’ cab was a driver-facing camera that alerted the driver when it registered eyelid and head droops. Privacy concerns kept this technology from going far. New wearable technology monitors the drivers but in a more subtle way, and comes in a variety of forms including caps, vests, wristbands and eye wear. Glasses made by Optalert measure the driver’s eye blinking with an LED light monitor. Eyelids that stay down too long might point to a sleepy driver. The real-time measurements are displayed on a dash-mounted device with alarms and notifications. A headset made by Maven Machines detects if a driver is looking forward through the windshield, up, down or sideways, and measures mirror checks, which can decrease in frequency if a driver is getting tired. The headset detects head bobs and jerks, signs the driver is falling asleep. This system also notices and can deliver notifications on “coachable” behaviors that can be improved, like hard braking, and delivers audible routing, weather and other messages as well. The software behind these devices is complex, with data from a variety of sources, said Craig Campbell, vice president for marketing at Maven Machines. His company’s headset, for example, pulls data from accelerometers embedded inside, sensors in the truck’s onboard computer and GPS data from nearby cellphone towers. The system can then discern whether a driver is driving at an unsafe speed, or perhaps just passing someone, going down a hill or crossing a highway overpass that runs above a surface street with a lower speed limit. “It’s easy to drown in a sea of data,” so driver-monitoring systems must pick out the important events to report, Mr. Campbell said. The SmartCap device is a headband that fits into trucker caps, beanies or other head gear. The band measures electronic brain waves and translates them to a measure of alertness or fatigue. It notifies the driver and a central monitoring system if the wearer appears drowsy. The alerts sent to drivers are meant to encourage them to find their own best way to get back into a more alert state, such as stopping and walking around the truck, having a snack, drinking some water or taking a nap, said Dr. Bongers. The company says its case studies have shown that over time the number of drivers’ alerts lessens, meaning they are changing schedules or learning to recognize their own drowsy warning signs. Some truck drivers do have cameras watching them from dashboard mounts. The Guardian from Seeing Machines, a black cylinder with a camera in it, is mounted on top of the dashboard. Face- and gaze-tracking algorithms monitor the driver and send audio alarms, vibrate the driver’s seat and notify the monitoring station if safety parameters are not met. Mr. Ochoa’s company uses a camera and software system connected to both the truck and the insurance company for driver safety and monitoring. The system stores 10 seconds of driver and front-facing video before and after any unusual event like harsh acceleration or braking or sharp turns. “The front camera is important because it records what is happening on the road at the time of the accident and helps determine whose fault it was,” Mr. Ochoa said. Some devices try to predict a driver’s drowsiness. Software sold by Fatigue Science analyzes sleep data from wearables, such as the quality and quantity of a driver’s sleep plus their sleep history or sleep debt, in order to project when they will feel tired. This works as a predictive tool, as well as a personal alert system, said Robert Higdon, Fatigue Science’s vice president for product and corporate development. The predictions help drivers to be more aware of fatigue risk before it happens, and companies to adjust shift schedules and provide sleep help resources based on the information provided by the software, he said. Karen Levy, a Cornell University professor who is writing a book on truckers and technology, said that while she appreciated the safety goals of wearables and cameras, they were “just a Band-Aid” for the wider problem of truck driver fatigue. Changes in the industry, including how drivers are paid and the efficiency of the system, would do more to help, she said. Drivers sometimes need to wait hours at warehouse facilities for their cargo to be loaded or unloaded, Dr. Levy said. They don’t always get paid for that waiting time, “but it does increase their fatigue.” Companies should be given incentives to get drivers in and out of loading bays more quickly, she said, and drivers should always be paid for waiting time. “It’s a complex system,” she said, noting that this was just one example of how industry operations might be better optimized to benefit both drivers and businesses. In the meantime, self-driving trucks are still years away, so “it’s a good bet” companies will continue developing monitoring technologies for drivers, Dr. Levy said. “We’re going to need an alert human for the foreseeable future.”",The New York Times
2020,Wedding Insurance 101,"Field Notes Want to protect yourself in the event of a wedding mishap, severe weather conditions or a vendor incident? Here’s what to consider before getting wedding insurance. After a year and a half of careful wedding planning, Sally Niebuhr was ready to watch her oldest daughter, Kiki LaCroix, walk down the aisle at a winery in Sonoma, Calif., last October. But Mother Nature had other plans. When the Kincade fire struck the area just a few days before the wedding was scheduled to take place, causing widespread evacuations, their dreams of a wine-country wedding were crushed. The good news? Ms. Niebuhr had bought a wedding insurance policy for $350 from Travelers Insurance that provided $7,500 of cancellation coverage. She was refunded the $6,500 deposit she paid for the venue. The money was then used to book another place in San Francisco on Oct. 26, her original wedding date and just three days after the wildfires hit Sonoma. “Luck was definitely on our side that weekend,” said Ms. Niebuhr, 58, a general contractor from Basalt, Colo. “All of our vendors — our D.J., our photographer, our florist, our caterer — were able to pivot, and provided their services in San Francisco. And the Westin St. Francis Hotel, where we held the reception, had a ballroom that was available and plenty of open rooms for our out-of-town guests.” Wedding insurance — also called event insurance — can shield people from financial loss that could result from a number of setbacks, such as severe weather, property damage and vendor problems. “In America, wedding insurance didn’t really gain steam until the 1990s,” said Robert Hunter, the director of insurance at the nonprofit Consumer Federation of America in Washington. “I used to tell people not to buy it, but it has become a much more mature product over time, and now I recommend purchasing it to many people.” Here’s what you need to know to determine if you need a policy. There are two types: liability insurance and cancellation insurance. Liability insurance covers property damage to the wedding site and bodily injuries to attendees. “If one of your guests slips and falls on the dance floor, liability insurance will cover their medical bills up to the limits specified on your policy,” said Drew Purcell, the business development leader at Progressive Insurance, which is based in Mayfield Village, Ohio. “The most common wedding insurance we sell, by far, is general liability.” Cancellation insurance provides reimbursement for the deposits made to vendors — i.e., your events space, caterer, band, photographer, florist — if you’re forced to cancel or postpone a wedding because of extreme weather, unexpected illness to the bride or groom (or an immediate family member), military deployment, or for other reasons beyond your control. “Wedding cancellation insurance can also include special provisions that will reimburse the insured up to a specified limit for loss or damage of attire, jewelry, deposits, cake or gifts, even if the wedding continues as planned,” Mr. Purcell said. What cancellation insurance doesn’t cover is a change of heart, said Todd Shasha, the managing director of personal insurance product management at Travelers Insurance, which is based in New York. “There’s no insurance for a runaway bride or runaway groom,” he said. Costs vary, depending on a number of factors, such as the venue, length of the event, location, number of guests and amount of coverage you need. As a benchmark: A liability insurance policy, providing $1 million of coverage starts at around $175 from Allstate Insurance, which is based in Northbrook, Ill. Bill Borst, a vice president of Allstate, said a cancellation policy providing $7,500 in coverage costs about $130. Customers can obtain discounts by bundling insurance plans, he added. For example, a wedding insurance plan that offers both $1 million of liability coverage and $7,500 of cancellation coverage costs as low as $275 from Allstate. If you’re planning an expensive wedding, expect to pay a higher premium for cancellation insurance. For instance, a cancellation insurance plan that provides $175,000 of coverage costs, on average, $875, according to data from financial research firm ValuePenguin. Because insurance rates vary by provider, Mr. Hunter recommends consumers shop around to find the most competitive plans. Megan Hiltbrand, a wedding and event planner in Syracuse, N.Y., advises her clients to at least buy liability coverage. “The cost is a drop in the bucket compared to your total expenditure,” she said. “I don’t see a reason not to have it.” (One caveat: If you’re having a wedding at your house, your homeowners’ insurance may provide liability coverage. It’s worth reviewing your plan before you buy a separate liability policy.) Ms. Hiltbrand is less keen on cancellation insurance. “Currently, the only time I recommend cancellation insurance is for winter weddings, since we’re in the Great White North and blizzards that knock out power and shut down roads are fairly common,” she said. Linda Walker, a 63-year-old administrative assistant from Middletown, Del., was happy she obtained a cancellation policy while planning her daughter’s wedding at the former Winery at Elk Manor, a vineyard in Maryland that overlooked the Chesapeake Bay. The wedding was supposed to take place there on Oct. 8, 2016, but the winery abruptly closed its doors two months before, after the owner pleaded guilty to federal tax fraud. Ms. Walker had purchased a policy from Allstate for $234. It provided up to $35,000 of coverage, allowing her to recoup the $23,165 she had paid in deposits for the space. According to Travelers Insurance, these were the top reasons for wedding claims it paid in 2018. 41 22 18 5 5 6 % 41 22 18 5 5 6 % By The New York Times Although the wedding day was postponed, Ms. Walker’s daughter got married Feb. 17, 2017 at Vandiver Inn in Havre de Grace, Md., without any mishaps. “I was concerned about having a wedding in February, because I thought there could be a blizzard, but it turned out to be 70 degrees and sunny, so things worked out beautifully in the end,” Ms. Walker said. [Sign up for Love Letter and always get the latest in Modern Love, weddings, and relationships in the news by email.] Noelle Ahmad-Snedegar, the owner of the Washington-based wedding and event planning company Lily & Grayson Events, said couples should review vendor contracts before buying cancellation insurance. Many vendors allow couples to postpone their wedding at no extra cost in case of injury, military duties, natural disasters, or death in the immediate family, she noted. Also, check to make sure your vendors have liability insurance. (“Whether they’re on a ladder, moving tables, stretching to get a good shot, or placing equipment in a place that could be a tripping hazard to you or your guests, it’s important to know that there is some recourse on the venue and vendor’s end,” Ms. Hiltbrand said.) Ms. Ahmad-Snedegar says couples should consider the likelihood of adverse events before buying cancellation insurance: Is the bride or groom in the military? Is your wedding taking place during hurricane season? How would you feel about postponing your wedding if one of your parents gets sick? “As with any insurance policy, it’s a cost-risk analysis,” she said. George Abdelmessih, a 36-year-old sales manager in Houston, paid $235 for both cancellation and liability coverage after consulting his insurance agent at Allstate’s Mark Francis Agency based in Houston. Mr. Abdelmessih and his wife, Elsa Olvera, were planning a wedding with 130 guests in Puerto Rico — until Hurricane Maria hit the island. “We were supposed to get married on Oct. 14, 2017, which was just a couple weeks after Maria,” he said. “We got about $18,000 back between deposits, hotel costs, and travel expenses.” “Every penny we put into our wedding in Puerto Rico we got back, and we ended up having our wedding in Dallas, where my wife is originally from,” said Mr. Abdelmessih. “We were very fortunate.” Continue following our fashion and lifestyle coverage on Facebook (Styles and Modern Love), Twitter (Styles, Fashion and Weddings) and Instagram.",The New York Times
2020,"Weinstein Accuser Called Him Her ‘Spiritual Soul Mate,’ Witness Says","A friend of Jessica Mann’s testified for the defense that Ms. Mann had a relationship with the producer and never said that he raped her. A former friend of Jessica Mann, a key accuser in the Harvey Weinstein rape trial, said on the stand that Ms. Mann had described Mr. Weinstein as her “spiritual soul mate” and that she had never said he had raped her. The friend, Talita Maia, testified on Monday as a witness for the defense in an effort to discredit Ms. Mann’s testimony that Mr. Weinstein, the famous Hollywood producer, attacked her at a hotel in Manhattan in 2013. A second woman, Claudia Salinas, also took the stand for the defense, denying allegations that in 2012 she had helped trap a model and aspiring actress, Lauren Young, in a Los Angeles hotel bathroom, where Mr. Weinstein allegedly assaulted her. Monday was the first time jurors heard from Ms. Maia and Ms. Salinas, who were mentioned numerous times during the trial when the accusers gave vivid descriptions of alleged sexual attacks, but who were not called to testify for the prosecution’s case. Instead, in what appeared to be a serious setback for prosecutors, Ms. Maia and Ms. Salinas’s statements supported the defense’s claim that the encounters with Mr. Weinstein were either consensual and transactional, or that the women had misremembered what happened. Specifically, Mr. Weinstein’s lawyers have sought to undermine the prosecution’s characterization of Ms. Mann as a young, naïve woman from a dairy farm in Washington State whom their client manipulated and tricked into sexual encounters. The lawyers have suggested that Ms. Mann was not only friendly with Mr. Weinstein after the alleged attacks, but that she continued a sexual relationship with him in an effort to advance her acting career. “She would say he is a wonderful person,” Ms. Maia said, adding that Ms. Mann had a romantic relationship with Mr. Weinstein for years. “There was flirtation between them since the first day.” Once one of the most powerful producers in Hollywood, Mr. Weinstein helped reshape the independent film business with movies like “Shakespeare in Love” and “Pulp Fiction.” His trial is largely seen as a critical moment for the #MeToo movement, the rebuke of decades-long sexual harassment and abuse by men against women in the workplace. Mr. Weinstein, 67, has pleaded not guilty in State Supreme Court in Manhattan to five felony charges, including rape, criminal sexual assault and predatory sexual assault. If convicted on the predatory assault charge, he could be sentenced to up to life in prison. Six women have testified that Mr. Weinstein attacked them, though he faces charges based on the allegations of only two of them: Ms. Mann and Miriam Haley, a former production assistant who said the producer forced oral sex on her at his home in 2006. The judge, Justice James M. Burke, allowed the other women to testify to allow prosecutors to establish a pattern of behavior, even though their allegations are too old to qualify as crimes under New York State law. The jury of seven men and five women is expected to begin deliberations next week. More than 90 women have accused Mr. Weinstein of sexual misconduct including rape, unwanted touching and harassment. The producer is also facing sexual assault charges in Los Angeles. He maintains that all the encounters he had with his accusers were consensual. Ms. Mann’s allegations support some of the most serious charges in the case. She accused Mr. Weinstein of trapping her at a Doubletree Hotel in Midtown Manhattan and raping her in March 2013, about a month after they met. Ms. Maia, 35, told the jury that she met Ms. Mann in late 2012 on a movie set. Several months later, Ms. Maia said, they met Mr. Weinstein at a party in Los Angeles. Neither of them recognized him, she said. When Mr. Weinstein explained who he was, Ms. Maia recounted joking, “That’s why everyone is being so nice to you.” Ms. Maia said Ms. Mann placed her arm around Mr. Weinstein, pinched his cheek and said, “No, it’s because he’s so cute.” Ms. Maia said Mr. Weinstein and Ms. Mann then walked off to a secluded area. Ms. Mann gave Mr. Weinstein her phone number later that night, Ms. Maia said, adding, “She seemed impressed.” Ms. Maia’s account contradicted Ms. Mann’s testimony. Ms. Mann had said that Mr. Weinstein lured her and Ms. Maia to the Montage Beverly Hills hotel, where the producer invited them to discuss their careers. Then, Ms. Mann said, he brought them to his suite, where he forced oral sex on her. Ms. Mann had testified that the more she protested, the angrier Mr. Weinstein got. But Ms. Maia said that she did not hear any commotion and that Ms. Mann had willingly walked into the bedroom with Mr. Weinstein. Ms. Maia added that her friend appeared “normal” that night, and not upset. Before that meeting, Ms. Maia said, Ms. Mann told her she had met with Mr. Weinstein at a hotel where she sang for him. “She spoke highly of him,” Ms. Maia said. “She seemed to really like him as a person. She would always compliment him.” But, Ms. Maia said, Ms. Mann had also thought Mr. Weinstein was controlling, and there was one occasion when she did not want to see him. Ms. Mann had testified that after the alleged rape, she stayed at Ms. Maia’s home and slept in her closet. Ms. Maia disputed that account and said she had slept on her sofa. Mr. Weinstein’s lawyers also sought to debunk the testimony of Ms. Young, who had told the authorities that Mr. Weinstein trapped her in a bathroom at the Montage hotel, groped one of her breasts, touched her genitals, masturbated and ejaculated onto the floor. She said Ms. Salinas shut the bathroom door on her. Ms. Salinas, a Mexican model and self-proclaimed social media influencer, denied Ms. Young’s account. “Did you ever lock Lauren Young in a bathroom with Harvey Weinstein?” Damon Cheronis, one of Mr. Weinstein’s lawyers, asked. “No,” Ms. Salinas said. But under cross-examination, the lead prosecutor, Joan Illuzzi, noted that Ms. Salinas had told investigators that she did not remember what happened. Later during her testimony, Ms. Salinas said, “It could have happened, but it doesn’t mean I was there.” Ms. Salinas added that Mr. Weinstein was flirtatious with her, but that she had told him she was not interested. She had also told prosecutors that Mr. Weinstein often wanted “to have his way” and that “he was a little bit of a bully.” Earlier in the day, Mr. Weinstein’s lawyers called to the stand Nelson Lopez, 59, a resident manager at the Gramercy Park building where Annabella Sciorra, the actress known for her role in “The Sopranos,” lived in the early 1990s. Ms. Sciorra told the jury late last month that Mr. Weinstein barged into her 17th-floor apartment after she opened the door and raped her in either late 1993 or early 1994. Mr. Weinstein’s lawyers have suggested that it is implausible that he could have gone up to Ms. Sciorra’s apartment without a doorman’s permission. Mr. Lopez testified that the building was staffed with a doorman at all times and that he had never received a complaint from Ms. Sciorra. Her encounter with Mr. Weinstein happened too long ago to lead to rape charges, but prosecutors hope her testimony will support the predatory sexual assault charge.",The New York Times
2020,"Weinstein Has the ‘Mark of a Predator,’ Prosecutor Says as Trial Nears End","Harvey Weinstein stayed in touch with women he assaulted to ensure their silence, a prosecutor said in her closing argument. A prosecutor said on Friday that the Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein was “an abusive rapist” and “a predator” who used his power to manipulate and assault several women in the movie business, then stayed in touch with them to ensure their silence and compliance. “He had a surefire insurance policy: That the witnesses were standing in line to get into his universe,” Joan Illuzzi, an assistant district attorney, told the jury during her closing arguments at Mr. Weinstein’s rape trial. “The universe is run by me,” she added, adopting Mr. Weinstein’s point of view, “therefore they don’t get to complain when they’re stepped on, spit on, demoralized and yes, raped and abused by the defendant.” Ms. Illuzzi’s summation of Mr. Weinstein’s tactic — “trick and surprise,” she called it — was a dramatic finale to the trial in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, which has emerged as a watershed moment for the #MeToo movement. In her presentation, Ms. Illuzzi returned repeatedly to the difference in power between Mr. Weinstein — “a giant” in the film industry — and his accusers, who worked as cocktail waitresses or models and were trying to break into the film industry. “It is a complete dichotomy,” she said. “Here is the defendant with everything using and abusing people who he knows has nothing.” Mr. Weinstein, 67, has pleaded not guilty to five felony charges in the case — including rape, criminal sexual assault and predatory sexual assault — which carry a maximum penalty of life in prison. Six women testified at trial that he had sexually assaulted them, though he faces charges in connection with only two of them. The others were allowed to testify to establish a pattern of behavior. On Thursday, his lawyers made their own closing pitch to the jury, claiming that he himself had been the victim of an “overzealous prosecution” and that the six women who took the stand to accuse him of assault and other crimes were not passive victims, but active participants in ongoing and often transactional relationships. Standing before the jury on Friday, Ms. Illuzzi sought to counter that narrative, arguing that Mr. Weinstein purposefully maintained ties with his victims to keep them under his control. “He made sure he had contact with the people he was worried about,” Ms. Illuzzi said, adding, “That’s the mark of a predator.” The indictment rests on the accusations of two women: Miriam Haley, a former reality television show production assistant who testified that Mr. Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on her at his TriBeCa apartment in 2006; and Jessica Mann, an aspiring actress from a small town in Washington State, who claimed he raped her in a Midtown Manhattan hotel room in 2013. Both women acknowledged during cross-examination that they not only had friendly interactions with Mr. Weinstein after their alleged attacks, but later had consensual sex with him. Four other women also testified that Mr. Weinstein attacked them in various ways — among them, the actress Annabella Sciorra, best known for her role in “The Sopranos.” She testified last month that Mr. Weinstein pushed his way into her Gramercy Park apartment in the winter months of 1993 or 1994 then violently raped her even as she kicked and punched him. Prosecutors are using her testimony to support the top charge of predatory sexual assault, which carries a possible life sentence. The accusations of Ms. Sciorra and three other accusers were barred by the statute of limitations from being charged as separate crimes. Still, the presiding judge, Justice James M. Burke allowed them to take the stand to bolster the prosecution’s contention that Mr. Weinstein engaged in a pattern of abusive behavior over decades. Ms. Illuzzi stood directly in front of the jury delivering closing remarks in a conversational style and the occasional lighthearted quips. She began her closing remarks with the prosecution’s strongest witness: Ms. Sciorra. The prosecutor acknowledged Ms. Sciorra never reported the alleged rape to the police, but she did tell her friend and fellow actress, Rosie Perez, though in veiled terms. Not reporting the assault left Ms. Sciorra, who soon began self-harming, a damaged woman and made her vulnerable to further abuse by Mr. Weinstein, the prosecutor said. “The defendant knew her now as a weak link, a weak mark he could get again,” Ms. Illuzzi said. Mr. Weinstein sought to control Ms. Sciorra again in August 2017, Ms. Illuzzi said, as rumors began to swirl that journalists were going to expose his sexual misconduct. That month, Mr. Weinstein hired an Israeli intelligence firm, Black Cube, to investigate certain “red flags” like Ms. Sciorra, whom Mr. Weinstein believed were speaking to reporters. Ms. Illuzzi focused the jury’s attention on an email dated Oct. 26, 2017. In it, Mr. Weinstein instructed a subordinate to handle questions from Ronan Farrow of The New Yorker about his relationship with Ms. Sciorra by saying, “We are going to say it was consensual or deny it.” “Truth be damned,” Ms. Illuzzi said, referring to his email. Then she told the jury, “I submit to you, that’s a confession.” In the defense’s closing arguments on Thursday, Donna Rotunno, Mr. Weinstein’s lead lawyer, said several times that the accusers in the case had chosen to engage in consensual sex with him to advance their careers, and their decisions to visit Mr. Weinstein in hotels and at his apartment supported that argument. On Friday, however, Ms. Illuzzi took direct issue with that position. “When an adult goes to another adult’s home, should they expect that they’re going to have to engage in sex?” she asked the jury. Ms. Illuzzi was talking about Ms. Haley, who testified that when she visited Mr. Weinstein at his Manhattan loft, he pulled her into a bedroom, pushed her onto a bed, held her down and forcibly performed oral sex on her. “This is a crime and a wanton disregard for other people,” Ms. Illuzzi said. She later suggested that Mr. Weinstein could have hired sex workers, but had instead targeted women who badly wanted to break into the business: “Maybe his kink,” she said, “is the fear in their eyes.” Toward the end of her statement, Ms. Illuzzi turned her attention toward Ms. Mann, the aspiring actress who earlier this month gave a complicated and emotional account of how Mr. Weinstein raped her during a long relationship that included some consensual sex. Ms. Mann’s testimony was emblematic of the difficult questions that the jury will ultimately have to wrestle with when they begin their deliberations as early as Tuesday. Did the fact that some of the women benefited professionally from their association with Mr. Weinstein suggest their relationships with him were consensual and transactional? And does the fact some of his accusers also had consensual sex with him undermine their claim that he on other occasions sexually assaulted them? Ms. Illuzzi addressed those questions head-on. “The question is not whether or not Jessica made a bad decision,” Ms. Illuzzi told the jury. “The question for you is whether or not Jessica Mann is lying about it. She’s telling you the truth. She’s the victim of rape.” “She could have been writing him love notes every single day,” Ms. Illuzzi added. “She could have been married to him. It still wouldn’t make a difference. He still would not be allowed to rape her.”",The New York Times
2020,Weinstein Is Convicted. Where Does #MeToo Go From Here?,"Three days before Harvey Weinstein was convicted of rape, Michael R. Bloomberg agreed to release three women from nondisclosure agreements so they could publicly describe complaints against him. Hours after the Weinstein jury adjourned, celebrities and fans packed a memorial for Kobe Bryant as questions lingered about the impact a 2003 rape case would have on his legacy. The next day, a $500,000 deal to settle sexual harassment allegations against the opera superstar Plácido Domingo collapsed when details of an investigation into his behavior toward over two dozen women became public. Those developments are all signs of how potent — and unresolved — #MeToo continues to be. This week, the man who ignited the movement was found guilty in New York, a victory many victims once considered unattainable. Now, the figures driving #MeToo say they are feeling a surge in momentum, but are grappling with how they can move beyond individual allegations and toward a concrete set of policy and legal goals. “The outcome of the Weinstein case should be seen as fuel to keep survivors and our allies motivated for change,” said Tarana Burke, the founder of the movement. “Moving close to the third year since the viral #MeToo moment, we have to be thinking about how we make big strategic moves that are beyond individual takedowns.” Melinda Gates, the philanthropist, recently pledged a billion dollars toward promoting gender equality, an enormous infusion. She wrote that her decision was spurred in part by #MeToo, and that she wanted to tackle issues like workplace harassment. “A window has been opened,” she said. But after more than two years of improvisation, there is growing consensus on the need for a more united front. Many of #MeToo’s leaders — including Ms. Burke, Time’s Up and the National Women’s Law Center, all backed by Ms. Gates — are considering how to form “a cohesive, common agenda,” said Fatima Goss Graves, the president of the center. They all say they want to act before the moment passes. The path ahead has been unclear in part because the movement is diffuse, a grass-roots chorus. Unlike, say, the fight for same-sex marriage, it does not have one landmark goal. Basic questions about fairness, the scope of scrutiny and accountability remain unsettled. At the same time, those trying to push #MeToo forward are brimming with priorities: Sex education in schools that emphasizes consent. Longer statutes of limitations and filing deadlines for lawsuits. A more expansive legal definition of sexual harassment, stronger federal laws to protect more workers, and other changes. The goal of Time’s Up, the organization started in Hollywood in the wake of the Weinstein accusations, is no less than “safe, dignified and respectful work for everyone,” said its president, Tina Tchen. She cited targets like equal pay and paid leave. One issue the movement continues to focus on, nondisclosure agreements, offers a look at what has and has not changed since the #MeToo era began. The restrictions — often imposed as part of settlements for sexual misconduct allegations — were rarely questioned three years ago. But then reporting on Harvey Weinstein and others showed how the agreements often silenced victims and enabled abusers. Since 2017, at least twelve states have passed laws restricting their use, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. New Jersey has gone the furthest, making them unenforceable if victims break them. Google, Microsoft, Uber and Condé Nast have also sworn them off as a tool to conceal abuse. A small but growing contingent of women have broken their NDAs or worked to be released from them, paving the way for change. McKayla Maroney sued U.S.A. Gymnastics to be released from one she had signed involving Larry Nassar. She was later told by the organization that she would not be penalized. Several women who have accused the singer R. Kelly of sexual abuse have spoken out despite confidentiality agreements. At least four Weinstein accusers have done the same. So far, none appears to have faced legal consequences. Yet many still can’t speak — Mr. Bryant’s accuser signed a settlement deal in 2005. For the majority of women, especially those whose cases don’t wind up in the news, breaching an NDA can carry extraordinary risk, including the potential for significant financial penalties. And most of the state-level changes have been modest. A new law in California restricts confidentiality agreements once a lawsuit or formal complaint has been filed, but many settlements are signed earlier in the process. “Women are being silenced every day,” said Nancy Erika Smith, a lawyer who represented Gretchen Carlson in her sexual harassment lawsuit against Roger Ailes, the founding chairman of Fox News. “It is a hammer designed to shut women up.” Mr. Bloomberg’s move to rescind the confidentiality agreements was a high-profile victory for #MeToo, but the circumstances were unique. Senator Elizabeth Warren, his competitor for the Democratic nomination, had used a presidential debate stage to pummel him on the issue. Beyond that instance, it is not clear what or who will force further change on NDAs, or more broadly, the wide array of other #MeToo-related issues. Even though the movement has been fueled in part by sexual abuse allegations against President Trump, his challengers on the left have not discussed ending sexual abuse the way they discuss reforming health care or halting climate change. Beyond Ms. Warren’s moment, there has been almost no talk about a broad, transformative #MeToo agenda at the Democratic debates. “It’s largely missing from the political conversation, especially given the cultural conversation that’s happening,” Ms. Goss Graves said. The Weinstein verdict can spur further developments, said Jeff Goodwin, a professor at New York University focusing on social movements, but only if activists and politicians can find a meaningful way to follow up on what happened at the trial. “Court cases often galvanize protest and dissent by giving people a sense that their grievances will be taken seriously,” Dr. Goodwin said. Yet “without collective action aimed at legislation on the order of the Civil Rights Act, it’s hard for me to believe that a purely legal strategy is going to bring about a fundamental change in power,” he said. Ms. Goss Graves said that she and other activists were working on a common path forward. If Weinstein had not been held accountable, “I think there would have been a real loss of hope,” she said. “And now there’s an opportunity.” But that won’t last without investment and deep examination of the causes of the problem, Ms. Gates said in an email. “The window of opportunity is open,” she said, “but there is no guarantee it’s going to stay open.”",The New York Times
2020,Weinstein Jurors Focus on ‘Project Runway’ Assistant’s Complaint,"The jury is reviewing testimony from Miriam Haley, who said Harvey Weinstein sexually assaulted her in 2006. The jury in Harvey Weinstein’s rape trial began its second day of deliberations by asking to review testimony and other evidence related to a former production assistant on “Project Runway,” who said that the producer had forced oral sex on her in 2006. The jury sent a note to the judge at 9:50 a.m. on Wednesday, requesting to hear all of the testimony from the production assistant, Miriam Haley. Ms. Haley is one of two women whose allegations form the basis of the indictment against Mr. Weinstein. Mr. Weinstein, 67, has pleaded not guilty in State Supreme Court in Manhattan to five felony counts, including rape and predatory sexual assault. The two charges of predatory sexual assault require the jury to find that Mr. Weinstein committed a serious sexual assault against at least two women. If convicted on that charge, he would face up to life in prison. By late Wednesday morning, the courtroom was again transformed into a stage for Ms. Haley’s recollections, as jurors listened intently as two court reporters read Ms. Haley’s testimony from Jan. 27. Ms. Haley, 42, had testified that she first met Mr. Weinstein at a movie premiere in London in 2004. Two years later, she said, Mr. Weinstein got her a job on the reality television show “Project Runway.” Ms. Haley testified that the producer tried to sexualize the relationship, commenting, for instance, on her legs. He also asked her to give him a massage, she said. Another time, he showed up to her apartment unannounced and invited her to go to Paris with him, which she declined to do. Later, Ms. Haley agreed to go with Mr. Weinstein to a film premiere in Los Angeles. She said she did so because she would be traveling alone and because one of her friends in California was about to give birth. On July 10, 2006, Mr. Weinstein invited Ms. Haley to visit him at his apartment in Manhattan’s TriBeCa neighborhood. After a brief conversation, she testified, he lunged at her. “I pushed him away, and he kept kissing and fondling me,” Ms. Haley told the jury. “I got up and tried to walk away, and he pulled me toward him.” She testified that Mr. Weinstein backed her into a bedroom where she fell onto the bed. She said she continued to tell him: “I don’t want this to happen. I’m on my period.” But, she said, he was not deterred. “I was telling him, ‘No, no, no, don’t do that,’” Ms. Haley said. “It was as if he didn’t believe me.” About two weeks later, Ms. Haley said, she met Mr. Weinstein at the TriBeCa Grand Hotel. When she entered his room, she said, the producer pulled her toward the bed. Though she was sobbing, Ms. Haley said, she had sex with him. Mr. Weinstein has not been charged in that encounter. Ms. Haley acknowledged on the stand that she did not “physically resist.” Ms. Haley also acknowledged on cross-examination that after her second sexual encounter with Mr. Weinstein, she did not stop seeing him. She said she tried to maintain “a professional connection” with him. She passed scripts to Mr. Weinstein from friends and had pitched him on her own idea for a project. Mr. Weinstein’s lawyers suggested that Ms. Haley and Mr. Weinstein had a consensual relationship. He gave her tickets to movie premieres and paid for her to fly to London shortly after the alleged assault. The jury also asked for a read back of Ms. Haley’s cross-examination, as well as copies of friendly emails the two had sent to each other and of correspondence that Mr. Weinstein and his company had sent to others about Ms. Haley. The emails included one from June 2008: “Hi Harvey, how are you?” Ms. Haley wrote. “Great to see you.” She signed off, “Lots of Love Miriam.” Though six women testified at the trial, the criminal charges hinge on allegations made by Ms. Haley and Jessica Mann, 34, who testified that Mr. Weinstein raped her at the Doubletree Hotel in Midtown Manhattan in 2013. In deciding the predatory sexual assault charges, however, the jury is also being asked to consider the testimony of Annabella Sciorra, the actress known for her work on “The Sopranos.” Ms. Sciorra testified that Mr. Weinstein barged into her Manhattan apartment and raped her in the early 1990s. Her rape allegation is too old to be charged as a separate crime. On Tuesday, the first day of deliberations, Justice James M. Burke instructed the jury to first consider predatory sexual assault as it relates to Ms. Haley and Ms. Sciorra. The notes that jurors sent out on Wednesday suggested they were still discussing that count, the first on the verdict sheet. On Wednesday afternoon, the jury seemed to home in on Ms. Sciorra’s account. They asked to hear the testimony of the actress Rosie Perez, who said Ms. Sciorra had told her she had been raped after the incident and who later had identified Mr. Weinstein as her attacker. The jury also requested copies of communications between Mr. Weinstein and Paul Feldsher, a writer and former talent agent who testified for the defense. Mr. Feldsher said Ms. Sciorra had characterized her encounter with Mr. Weinstein as a “crazy thing,” not an assault. “My understanding was that she fooled around with him,” he said. Ms. Sciorra, best known for her roles in “Jungle Fever” and “The Sopranos,” denied saying that to Mr. Feldsher. The jury also wanted to review emails that mentioned Ms. Sciorra, including communications with Guidepost Solutions, a private investigations firm, and Black Cube, the Israeli intelligence firm Mr. Weinstein hired to investigate certain people he believed were speaking to reporters.",The New York Times
2020,Credibility of Accuser Jessica Mann Attacked in Weinstein Trial,"Defense lawyers again portrayed her as an opportunistic manipulator who had a long romantic relationship with the producer. A day after the prosecution’s key witness in the Harvey Weinstein trial dissolved into tears on the stand, defense lawyers on Tuesday again chipped away at her allegation that he raped her — portraying her as an opportunist who had a long romantic relationship with the movie mogul. Mr. Weinstein’s lawyers relied on his accuser’s own words to attempt to discredit her account, painstakingly going over dozens of emails and other electronic communications between the witness, Jessica Mann, and Mr. Weinstein over several years. In one email, she called him “a pseudo father” who validated her. Under cross-examination for a third day, Ms. Mann acknowledged that she had reached out to Mr. Weinstein several times after the encounter in 2013 when, she said, he sexually assaulted her. Her last sexual encounter with him was in late 2016, around the time his mother died, she said. But while she acknowledged their complex on-again-off-again relationship, Ms. Mann was unwavering in testifying that he had overpowered her and raped her at a Manhattan hotel in March 2013. “I do want the jury to know that he is my rapist,” she said. Ms. Mann’s testimony presents a challenge for prosecutors, who will have to explain to the jury why she maintained a relationship with Mr. Weinstein after the alleged attack. For their part, Mr. Weinstein’s lawyers have tried to undermine the prosecution’s contention that Ms. Mann was a young, naïve woman from a dairy farm in Washington State whom Mr. Weinstein exploited. They elicited testimony suggesting she put up with his sexual demands in return for benefits she got in exchange. Ms. Mann returned to the stand after emotional testimony on Monday, when she broke down and sobbed inconsolably while reading a passage she had written in an email about being sexually abused early in life and how it had affected her relationship with Mr. Weinstein. The jury was shown photos of Mr. Weinstein’s naked body, despite his lawyer’s objections, to corroborate Ms. Mann’s earlier testimony that the producer’s genitals are abnormal. Cyrus R. Vance Jr., the Manhattan district attorney, sat in the courtroom, as he has for much of the trial, observing the cross-examination of Ms. Mann. Mr. Vance was roundly criticized for deciding not to press forcible touching charges against the producer in 2015 and was under political pressure to indict Mr. Weinstein when he finally did so in 2018. The outcome of the trial is likely to shape his legacy. Mr. Weinstein, 67, has pleaded not guilty to charges of rape, criminal sexual act and predatory sexual assault — charges that stem from the allegations of three women, including Ms. Mann. He faces a possible life sentence on the last charge. Miriam Haley, a production assistant on one of the producer’s shows, testified he forced her to let him perform oral sex during a meeting at his Manhattan apartment in 2006. Annabella Sciorra, an actress known for her work in “The Sopranos,” testified Mr. Weinstein pushed his way into her Manhattan apartment after giving her a ride home in 1993 and forcibly raped her. Though too much time has passed to charge Mr. Weinstein with rape in Ms. Sciorra’s case, her account is being used to support the predatory sexual assault charge, which requires prosecutors to show he committed a serious sexual offense against at least two people. Justice James A. Burke allowed prosecutors to call three other women to testify about similar allegations. Though Mr. Weinstein is not charged with a crime in those cases, prosecutors will use their testimony to try to establish a pattern of behavior. But Ms. Mann’s allegations support some of the most serious charges in the indictment. She accused Mr. Weinstein of trapping her in a Manhattan hotel room and raping her in 2013, about a month after they met. That morning, she said, she had asked Mr. Weinstein to have breakfast with her and two friends in the film industry. For the next four years, Ms. Mann continued to have sexual encounters with Mr. Weinstein, she said on cross-examination. Her last communication with him was in early 2017. She also turned to him for help again and again, even asking him to take her to dinner after a breakup with one of her boyfriends, her emails showed. Donna Rotunno, one of Mr. Weinstein’s lawyers, asked Ms. Mann about her request in February 2015 that Mr. Weinstein sponsor her for membership in an exclusive club. “You want the ladies and gentlemen of this jury to believe the person you wanted to sponsor you to the exclusive club was your rapist?” Ms. Rotunno asked. “I do want the jury to know he is my rapist, and I hope I can continue to explain the dynamic of why I engaged with him.,” Ms. Mann responded. “I mean, he raped me.” Ms. Rotunno also called attention to Ms. Mann’s mental health record, which includes a history of suicidal thoughts and self-harm. Mr. Weinstein’s lawyers noted that Ms. Mann continued to accept tickets to Oscars and Golden Globes parties from Mr. Weinstein, even asking him if she could bring a friend. When she testified last week, she told the jury that she did not want anyone to know about her relationship with Mr. Weinstein, but her electronic communications suggested that she had bragged about her connection to him. Ms. Rotunno suggested that Ms. Mann used her friendship with Mr. Weinstein when it helped her connect with other people in the film industry. “It is true that knowing him,” Ms. Mann said, “and people if they know you know him, it can open doors.” Then, Ms. Rotunno asked Ms. Mann when she had last had sex with Mr. Weinstein. Ms. Mann said it was when Mr. Weinstein’s mother died in November 2016. She said Mr. Weinstein or his assistant invited her to a hotel to talk with him. She was told he needed to be consoled, and he believed she understood grief. Her father had died a year before. But when she arrived at the hotel, she said, Mr. Weinstein was naked and on the bed. “All he wants to do is something sexual,” she said.",The New York Times
2020,Weinstein Was Convicted. Can D.A. Vance Now Win Over His Critics?,"One detractor called the district attorney “irreparably tarnished.” But the prosecutor’s high-profile victory might give him a political lift. For weeks, the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., sat at the front of the courtroom at Harvey Weinstein’s rape trial, right behind the prosecution’s table, hanging on the words of witnesses. He was even there waiting for the verdict during jury deliberations, a highly unusual step for a big-city district attorney. Mr. Vance had a lot at stake. He had been severely criticized for not bringing charges against Mr. Weinstein five years earlier, before the producer became a symbol of sexual harassment and the #MeToo movement. So when the jury found Mr. Weinstein guilty of two felony sex crimes, it was not just a major legal victory for Mr. Vance but a shot at redemption. “This is the new landscape for survivors of sexual assault in America,” Mr. Vance declared before a phalanx of reporters and flashing cameras. “This is a new day.” Mr. Vance, who leads one of the most storied district attorney’s offices in the country, was the first prosecutor to bring charges against Mr. Weinstein, and the verdict marked a triumphant moment in the career of a liberal who first ran as a champion on women’s issues. Yet, as much as the prosecutor wanted to turn the page, he remained embattled, still struggling to regain the support of feminists and victims’ advocates who have faulted his office’s handling of sex crimes. “This verdict is a resounding victory — I think it gives the Manhattan district attorney’s office the opportunity to hit a reset button,” said Jane Manning, an advocate for rape victims and a former New York City sex crimes prosecutor. But she said the office has to remain aggressive about prosecuting sex crimes. “As important a conviction is in the Weinstein case, we care about what happens in every case.” Elected officials and women’s rights advocates who staged protests during the trial criticized the way Mr. Vance’s sex-crimes unit dealt with other cases, including a no-jail plea deal for Dr. Robert Hadden, a prominent gynecologist who had abused his patients. Jumaane Williams, the city’s public advocate, who led one of the protests, said Mr. Vance’s name was “irreparably tarnished.” “I don’t think history is going to be kind here,” he said. That outrage crested when a dozen New York City councilwomen charged earlier this month that Mr. Vance had failed victims of sexual assault and should resign. There have been signs of turmoil inside Mr. Vance’s office as well. Martha Bashford, the longtime chief of the sex crimes division, who had declined to prosecute Mr. Weinstein five years ago, announced her retirement as the trial was winding down. In an interview, Mr. Vance expressed regret to survivors of sexual assault who have left his office “feeling disappointed or worse — not listened to.” Mr. Vance said he had asked a nonprofit that specializes in gender-based violence to evaluate how his sex crimes unit handles cases and deals with victims. Although Mr. Weinstein’s conviction — he was found guilty of rape and criminal sexual assault but not predatory sexual assault — has strengthened Mr. Vance’s political position, a growing list of challengers has signaled they will take him on in 2021 in the Democratic primary. They include two civil rights lawyers, Tahanie Aboushi and Janos Marton; a Manhattan state assemblyman, Dan Quart, and a former federal prosecutor, Alvin Bragg. George Artz, a longtime political consultant, said that if Mr. Vance decides to run again, he would still be a formidable incumbent, especially with the Weinstein verdict on his résumé. “Given the monumental victory here, I think he would win against the field that has arrived so far,” said Mr. Artz, who advised Mr. Vance in his first campaign in 2010. “There might be criticism of him, but the Weinstein case will be his legacy.” Mr. Vance, 65, who succeeded Robert M. Morgenthau, who held the job for 35 years, declined to say whether he will in fact seek re-election. His campaign coffers had only $29,000 in his last filing, far less than he spent during his 2017 race when he faced only token opposition. “When the right time comes I will make an announcement,” he said. He said he does not make decisions with his legacy in mind. He has won praise for modernizing the office’s use of data to target violent criminals, spending millions to clear a backlog of rape kits, setting up a special domestic violence unit and routinely prosecuting sex traffickers. “Ultimately, my legacy, such as it is, is to leave this office to be an office capable of handling all the variety of crimes that we have in the 21st century and to be modern about the way we investigate cases,” he said. Before the #MeToo movement, Mr. Vance’s office had a reputation for being conservative in sex-crimes prosecutions. His decision to bring the case against Mr. Weinstein was a gamble, several criminal lawyers said, because the two main accusers — Miriam Haley and Jessica Mann — had consensual sex with Mr. Weinstein after the attacks. Many prosecutors would not have taken the chance, fearing that the women’s credibility would have been shredded on cross-examination. Mr. Vance said he decided to press ahead despite the complex relationships the two women had with Mr. Weinstein. “We felt that what we had was raw, open and honest, and they were credible and believable even if they weren’t the typical witness that a courtroom expects to see,” he said. When he made the decision in May 2018, Mr. Vance was under intense public pressure. He had been hammered for declining to bring charges in 2015 when a Filipina-Italian model accused Mr. Weinstein of groping her breasts and shoving his hand up her skirt during a meeting at his office in TriBeCa. The governor had asked the attorney general to review that decision, and feminists from organizations like the National Organization for Women protested, demanding he take action against Mr. Weinstein. Mr. Vance had decided not to prosecute even though the model, Ambra Battilana Gutierrez, had recorded Mr. Weinstein the next day apologizing for touching her. One reason, prosecutors said, was a worry that Ms. Battilana Gutierrez would not be believed because she had given contradictory accounts to authorities in a sexual assault case in Italy. This week, Mr. Vance said calculations about the viability of a case like Ms. Battilana Gutierrez’s had changed in the intervening years, as thousands of women had aired their stories of sexual abuse and harassment as part of the #MeToo movement. “We were looking at that case with 2015 eyes,” Mr. Vance said. “We weren’t looking at that case with 2019 eyes.” It was not the first time Mr. Vance had drawn criticism for his handling of a sex crime case involving a prominent man. A year after taking office, he was faulted by some for dropping charges against Dominique Strauss-Kahn, a French politician accused of sexually assaulting a hotel housekeeper. That case was dropped because prosecutors learned the victim had fabricated a previous assault. Then, in 2015 it was revealed that a veteran prosecutor in Mr. Vance’s office made a highly unusual request in 2011 when she argued for Jeffrey Epstein’s sex offender status to be reduced to the lowest classification despite allegations that he had molested dozens of teenage girls. Mr. Vance’s critics also point to the case of Mr. Hadden, a gynecologist with Columbia University and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital who was accused of sexually assaulting 19 women, including Evelyn Yang, the wife of former Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang. Prosecutors said last year they had entered into a no-jail plea agreement with Mr. Hadden because they believed a defense lawyer would attack his accusers’ credibility. The backlash against Mr. Vance intensified after Ms. Yang gave a television interview in mid-January. “For every Weinstein or Epstein — or Hadden, in my case — where the authorities are forced into a public reckoning, we know there are many other predators out there who continue to get away with assault,” Ms. Yang said. Last week, Mr. Vance said his office will review new allegations against Mr. Hadden, as more women have come forward. But his critics said he was merely caving to mounting public pressure. Marissa Hoechstetter, the first woman to publicly accuse Mr. Hadden of sexual abuse, said the district attorney should not “get some special credit for doing it now.” Speaking this week, Mr. Vance and his chief assistant, Karen Friedman Agnifilo, acknowledged that the office would have taken a different approach in its handling of the Hadden case had it happened today. Ms. Friedman Agnifilo, who approved the no-jail plea deal, said she regretted the decision. Mr. Vance’s political opponents have pointed out that the defense lawyers who persuaded the district attorney’s office not to pursue charges or to agree to a lenient plea deal in some high-profile cases were also big donors to Mr. Vance’s campaigns. Mr. Vance denied his office gives special treatment to defendants with well-connected lawyers or had shied away from challenging sex crime cases. “What few people understand is that the decisions in these cases in the investigations are being run by professional prosecutors — a hundred percent of whom are women — and who are not interested in politics or campaign contributions or any of that,” he said.",The New York Times

Recuerda que los martes recibirás la edición exprés del boletín en español de The New York Times. ¿Cuentas con unos minutos? Esto es para ti. Ayer, un jurado en Manhattan halló culpable a Harvey Weinstein de violación, entre otros cargos. Las acusaciones y el caso en contra del otrora poderoso productor de Hollywood le han dado impulso mediático al movimiento mundial #MeToo (#YoTambién). Desde entonces, mujeres de todo el mundo se han organizado para denunciar y protestar contra la violencia, el abuso y la desigualdad de género. En México, organizaciones feministas han convocado el 9 de marzo a un “día sin mujeres”, un paro nacional para visibilizar la ola de violencia que cada día mata a 10 niñas y mujeres en el país. En Argentina, se espera que el fin de semana se introduzca una ley para despenalizar el aborto. En Estados Unidos se debate si los estudiantes de medicina deben hacer exámenes pélvicos en pacientes anestesiadas que no consintieron el procedimiento. En Francia, la actriz Adèle Haenel ha denunciado que fue víctima de abuso sexual y asegura en esta entrevista que a su país “se le ha ido el tren” del #MeToo. Pero más allá de las protestas callejeras, argumenta esta columna de Mónica Meltis, los gobiernos necesitan datos precisos que ayuden a diseñar estrategias para combatir las violencias hacia las mujeres. La demanda es por transformaciones tanto políticas como domésticas. Hace unos días Gabriela Wiener proponía atacar la desigualdad de género y la violencia desde la educación sentimental: “Amar puede ser un factor de transformación social si lo vivimos desde una idea radical, cuidarnos mutuamente”. — Elda Cantú Las periodistas Jodi Kantor y Megan Twohey dieron a conocer las acusaciones contra Weinstein en una serie de reportajes en 2017, un trabajo que les valió el Pulitzer y ahora es un estupendo libro.

2020,"Weinstein ‘Trapped’ and Assaulted Model in Bathroom, She Testifies","Lauren Young is the sixth and final woman to take the stand against Mr. Weinstein at his rape trial. Lauren Young was a model from New York City who wrote screenplays and wanted to break into the film business when she had a stroke of luck: She met a woman who had a direct line to the Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein. The woman, Claudia Salinas, contacted Ms. Young in February 2013 and told her to bring a script to a meeting with Mr. Weinstein at a hotel bar in Beverly Hills, Calif. She was only 22. “I was excited,” Ms. Young said as she testified at Mr. Weinstein’s rape trial on Wednesday. “I got ready and I put on my best dress. I was excited to network and pitch my ideas.” But prosecutors say the meeting was a ruse. Ms. Young has told the authorities that the producer trapped her in a bathroom of a hotel room, groped one of her breasts, masturbated and ejaculated onto the floor. Ms. Young began testifying in State Supreme Court in Manhattan in the late morning. She is the sixth woman to accuse Mr. Weinstein of sexual assault at the trial, and her testimony is expected to be one of the last pieces of evidence the Manhattan district attorney’s office presents before resting its case. Mr. Weinstein has pleaded not guilty to five felony counts, including rape, criminal sexual act and predatory sexual assault, which carries a maximum penalty of life in prison. Ms. Young is also one of two accusers in a criminal complaint filed against Mr. Weinstein by prosecutors in Los Angeles. The charges in the criminal indictment in Manhattan stem from allegations made by two women: Jessica Mann, who says the producer raped her in a Manhattan hotel in 2013, and Miriam Haley, who says he forced oral sex on her at his home in 2006. The account from a third woman, Annabella Sciorra, the actress who has accused him of raping her in 1993, is meant to support a predatory sexual assault charge. Prosecutors in New York won permission to call Ms. Young and two other women — Dawn Dunning and Tarale Wulff — to testify about the way Mr. Weinstein allegedly attacked them to establish a pattern of behavior. He was not charged with crimes in the Dunning and Wulff cases because they were too old to prosecute. The trial is one of the most closely watched proceedings in recent history, seen by many as a critical moment in the #MeToo movement, the global reckoning prompted in October 2017 after several women went public with allegations that Mr. Weinstein had sexually harassed or assaulted them. In the New York case against Mr. Weinstein, prosecutors do not have any physical or forensic evidence to support the women’s allegations. In Los Angeles, prosecutors have obtained Ms. Young’s dress, which will likely be tested for the producer’s DNA, the lawyers said in court. Ms. Young told the prosecutors that two days ago, she found the dress she wore that night. Ms. Young said she met Ms. Salinas, a Mexican model, at a dinner during Oscars season in 2012 at the Restaurant at Mr. C in Beverly Hills. The women exchanged contact information, she said. A year later, Ms. Young said Ms. Salinas reached out to set up a meeting with Mr. Weinstein. They agreed on Feb. 19, 2013, and met at a bar in the lobby of the Montage Beverly Hills, a luxury hotel. Mr. Weinstein, she said, showed up 10 minutes later. Ms. Young said she quickly started discussing her ideas and script, but Mr. Weinstein appeared distracted: He was on his phone. “He was not really paying attention to me,” she said, “and kind of kept pushing off everything I said.”Suddenly, Mr. Weinstein said he had to prepare for an event with the director Quentin Tarantino and told the women to follow him to a suite at the hotel, Ms. Young said. On the way there, she said, Mr. Weinstein asked if she was interested in appearing on “America’s Next Top Model,” but she declined, saying she preferred acting. Once they entered the room, “I kept walking, following Harvey,” Ms. Young said. “I walked in through the bedroom, and into the bathroom.” She said she did not realize she had walked into a bathroom. Ms. Young said that in a mirror, she could see Ms. Salinas shut the bathroom door, trapping her. Mr. Weinstein then blocked Ms. Young from exiting by opening a shower door, she said. Mr. Weinstein turned on the water, quickly undressed and stepped in and out of the shower. Ms. Young said she began laughing nervously. “I just couldn’t believe what was happening to me,” Ms. Young said, her voice cracking. “I was really worried and scared that they were going to hurt me or something. I started realizing: I’m trapped.” Ms. Young said Mr. Weinstein unzipped her dress, pulling it down. She said when she tried to leave, Mr. Weinstein said: “No, we are just going to have a talk here. How am I going to know if you can act?” “I said, ‘no, no, no,’ the whole time,” she said. “I was not interested.” The producer, she said, started masturbating, gripping and pinching her breast, and squinting at her as she was pushed up against the sink. At some point, she said, he tried to touch her genitals. He ejaculated into a towel, she said, and then exited the bathroom. “I stayed standing there in shock,” Ms. Young said, adding that she left as quick as she could. Prosecutors asked Ms. Young to describe the producer’s body, and her statements — that his genitals looked abnormal and scarred — echoed the testimony of Ms. Mann. The jury of seven men and five women has been shown pictures of Mr. Weinstein in the nude, and the testimony about his appearance is being used by prosecutors to corroborate the women’s accounts. Ms. Young told two friends about the alleged incident, but did not report it to the police, prosecutors said. “He has power,” she said. “I was scared.” The next day, Ms. Young kept a previously scheduled meeting with Mr. Weinstein’s assistant at the Weinstein Company office in Los Angeles. She said she intended to confront Mr. Weinstein, but he was not there. The assistant, Barbara Schneeweiss, was not interested in her script, but urged her to consider a part on “America’s Next Top Model.” After that meeting, Ms. Young said, she ignored calls from Ms. Schneeweiss and another Weinstein Company employee. “I didn’t want anything to do with any of them,” she said. One of Mr. Weinstein’s lawyers, Damon Cheronis, highlighted discrepancies between Ms. Young’s testimony and the accounts she had provided to investigators in Los Angeles and New York. He pointed out she had told investigators that Ms. Salinas pushed her in the bathroom and locked the door, but in her testimony she said neither happened. Her description of Mr. Weinstein’s body also differed slightly from what she told investigators in 2018. She also had told investigators her dress fell to the floor, but testified in court it was pulled down to her elbows, he said. Mr. Cheronis also pressed Ms. Young on why should could not recall the date of the alleged assault or whether the bathroom door was locked. “I confused it when I was telling my story,” she said. The lawyer suggested it was implausible that Mr. Weinstein could disrobe and shower without giving her a chance to escape the bathroom. “This big fat man does a ninja tear-off of his clothes, right?” Mr. Cheronis asked. Ms. Young said, “Never said ninja.”",The New York Times
2020,Weinstein’s Lawyer Says Accusers Had a Choice in Sexual Encounters,"During closing arguments, the defense said Harvey Weinstein was a victim of “overzealous prosecution.” A lawyer for Harvey Weinstein told jurors on Thursday that he was the victim of an “overzealous prosecution” and that prosecutors were acting like moviemakers, inventing an alternative world in which women are not responsible for their own behavior. During a five-hour closing argument, the lawyer, Donna Rotunno, argued that Mr. Weinstein’s accusers had chosen to engage in consensual and often transactional relationships with him to advance their own careers. Ms. Rotunno said prosecutors from the Manhattan district attorney’s office had woven “a sinister tale” during Mr. Weinstein’s rape trial, depicting him as a monster and his accusers as innocent, passive victims. But, she asserted, the prosecution lacked the evidence to prove it. “In their story, they have created a universe that strips adult women of common sense, autonomy, and responsibility,” she said. “In their universe women are not responsible for the parties they attend, the men they flirt with, the choices they make to further their own careers, the hotel room invitations, the plane tickets they accept, the jobs they ask for help to obtain.” The trial is widely seen as a watershed moment for the #MeToo movement, which gained momentum in October 2017 after Mr. Weinstein was publicly accused of assaulting and harassing numerous women. Mr. Weinstein, 67, a former powerhouse producer in Hollywood known for films like “Pulp Fiction” and “Shakespeare in Love,” has pleaded not guilty to five felony charges, including rape, criminal sexual assault and predatory sexual assault. Prosecutors will present closing remarks on Friday. The jury of seven men and five women will begin deliberating on Tuesday. Ms. Rotunno said her client had become “a target of a cause and of a movement.” She implored the jury not to give in to public pressure, but to focus on the facts in the case. “You don’t have to like Mr. Weinstein — this is not a popularity contest. But you have to remember that we are not here to criminalize morality,” Ms. Rotunno said, adding moments later: “If you had to look at the evidence alone from their perspective, they lose.” For a month, Mr. Weinstein listened as six women took the stand and testified that he had sexually assaulted them. He declined to testify himself. He faces charges based on the allegations of only two of his accusers: Jessica Mann, a former actress who testified that he raped her in a Midtown Manhattan hotel in 2013, and Miriam Haley, a former production assistant on his show “Project Runway,” who said he forced oral sex on her at his TriBeCa apartment in 2006. Both women acknowledged on cross-examination that they not only had friendly communications with Mr. Weinstein after their alleged attacks, but later had consensual sex with him. The presiding judge, Justice James M. Burke, allowed four other women to testify about their own encounters so that prosecutors can establish a pattern of behavior, even though their allegations are too old to be charged as crimes under New York State law. The actress Annabella Sciorra, for instance, took the stand under the legal theory that her testimony would support the charges of predatory sexual assault, which carry a life sentence. Ms. Sciorra testified that Mr. Weinstein pushed his way into her apartment and raped her after giving her a ride home from a dinner party in the early 1990s. The other accusers — Tarale Wulff, Dawn Dunning and Lauren Young — were all aspiring actresses who said Mr. Weinstein lured them to hotels on the pretense of helping their careers, and then sexually assaulted them. Over and over, Ms. Rotunno returned to her central theme that Mr. Weinstein’s accusers were not passive victims of assaults, but active participants in consensual acts. “Women have choices,” she said. Ms. Rotunno said that Ms. Haley’s relationship with Mr. Weinstein was something close to a romance, which began after he had gotten her the “Project Runway” job. “They have to label it as a professional relationship because if they labeled it as what it was, we wouldn’t be here,” Ms. Rotunno said. Ms. Haley had also used Mr. Weinstein to further her career, Ms. Rotunno said, and had kept in touch with him through seemingly friendly emails well after she said he had attacked them. One email asked how Mr. Weinstein was doing and was signed “lots of love.” “She was using him for jobs,” Ms. Rotunno said. Ms. Rotunno argued that what Ms. Mann had described as a rape was sex between consenting adults. She said the evidence showed that Ms. Mann went willingly to Mr. Weinstein’s hotel room, got undressed and laid down on his bed. Ms. Mann never tried to stop Mr. Weinstein, and after the encounter, the lawyer said, she went to brunch with him. “This is not rape,” Ms. Rotunno said. “This is not sexual assault. This is someone who agrees to do what had been discussed.” Ms. Rotunno highlighted dozens of friendly and sometimes flirtatious emails Ms. Mann had sent to Mr. Weinstein from 2013 to 2017. Each time Ms. Mann got a new telephone number, Ms. Rotunno noted, she made sure Mr. Weinstein had it. “Five or six times she says, ‘Oh, here’s my new number,’” Ms. Rotunno said. Ms. Sciorra, who gave some of the strongest testimony, had misremembered what happened, the defense lawyer argued. She pointed to evidence the actress had told a friend at the time that “she did something crazy” with Mr. Weinstein, but did not describe the encounter as rape. Yet when a reporter reached out to Ms. Sciorra in 2017 about Mr. Weinstein’s treatment of women, Ms. Rotunno said: “She has changed her memories, and now she was raped. Now she is the darling of a movement.” Ms. Rotunno said Ms. Young, Ms. Wulff and Ms. Dunning had also changed their stories over time, and she suggested they came forward only in the interest of fame. She urged the jurors to consider how Mr. Weinstein’s accusers behaved and what they said in communications with him. The prosecution, she said, had created a fictional world — a “story that they spun” — where “women have no free will and no choice.” “In that world, facts don’t matter,” Ms. Rotunno said. “In this world, facts matter. Evidence matters.”",The New York Times
2020,Harvey Weinstein’s Lawyer Wrote an Article Addressing Jurors. The Judge Is Unhappy.,"The film producer’s lawyer urged jurors to do “what they know is right,’’ prompting the prosecution to complain of jury tampering. Over the weekend, just days before jurors in the Harvey Weinstein case were set to begin deliberations, his lead defense lawyer, Donna Rotunno, wrote an opinion piece imploring them “to do what they know is right.” The article in Newsweek magazine infuriated the Manhattan district attorney’s office, and on Tuesday the lead prosecutor, Joan Illuzzi, called Ms. Rotunno’s behavior “inappropriate,” and tantamount to jury tampering. The judge ordered the defense team not to speak to the news media until after a verdict is reached. “Defense team you are ordered to refrain from communicating with the press until there is a verdict in the case,” Justice James M. Burke told Mr. Weinstein’s lawyers. “I would caution you about the tentacles of your public relations juggernaut.” The jurors were not in the courtroom at the time. As in many high-profile cases, jurors have been reminded every day by the judge not to follow any news media coverage of the case. The judge’s order came just before he gave the jury final instructions. The panel of seven men and five women began deliberating at 11:30 a.m. A half-hour later, the jurors sent a note to the judge asking for definitions of legal terms like consent and forcible compulsion, as well as written definitions of the charges against Mr. Weinstein and whether they could find him guilty of certain combinations of charges. Mr. Weinstein, 67, has pleaded not guilty in State Supreme Court in Manhattan to five felony charges, including rape, criminal sexual assault and predatory sexual assault. The main charges in the indictment rest on the testimony of two women: Miriam Haley, a former production assistant who said the producer forced oral sex on her at his home in 2006, and Jessica Mann, a former actress who accused him of raping her in a Midtown Manhattan hotel in 2013. But prosecutors are also using the testimony of the actress Annabella Sciorra, who said Mr. Weinstein raped her in the early 1990s, to bolster the charge that he is a sexual predator, even though the alleged attack is too old to be charged as a separate crime. In their first note, the jurors also asked for an explanation about why the statute of limitations prevented a conviction based solely on Ms. Sciorra’s account. Her testimony was pivotal because if the jury finds her credible and also finds Mr. Weinstein guilty of sexually assaulting Ms. Haley or Ms. Mann, he can be found guilty of predatory sexual assault, which carries a life sentence. To demonstrate a pattern of abuse, three other women were allowed to testify about their accusations that Mr. Weinstein sexually assaulted them. But he is not charged with crimes in those cases. Shortly after 3 p.m., the jurors sent out a second note requesting the layout of Mr. Weinstein’s Manhattan loft, suggesting they were reviewing Ms. Haley’s allegation that the producer forced her to let him perform oral sex on her there in 2006. The jury also requested three emails in which Mr. Weinstein had listed people — he called them “red flags” — he wanted an Israeli intelligence firm, Black Cube, to investigate. Ms. Sciorra was on that list. The argument in the morning was the third time the prosecution had called Ms. Rotunno’s public comments into question since the trial began with jury selection on Jan. 6. Last month, prosecutors requested a gag order after Ms. Rotunno criticized Mr. Weinstein’s accusers in interviews with reporters. They made the same complaint after she participated in a New York Times podcast, in which she said, among other things, that she had never been sexually assaulted “because I would never put myself in that position.” Prosecutors said Ms. Rotunno had also, in The Times’s podcast, called the accusers liars who were seeking fame. At the time, the judge warned the defense not to talk about the witnesses. On Sunday, Ms. Rotunno took a new approach, addressing the jury of seven men and five women directly in her 284-word opinion piece in Newsweek. “I implore the members of this jury to do what they know is right and was expected of them from the moment they were called upon to serve their civic duty in a court of law,” she wrote. “The facts are the facts. Harvey Weinstein is innocent,” she went on. “His fate hangs in the balance, and the world is watching.” Ms. Illuzzi, who read an excerpt from Ms. Rotunno’s essay, asked Justice Burke to order that Mr. Weinstein be held in custody during the jury deliberations. She suggested that the film producer was behind the decision to make a last-minute appeal to the jury through Newsweek. “It is 100 percent inappropriate behavior,” Ms. Illuzzi said. “No way Ms. Rotunno did this without the prompting and encouragement and the knowledge and the permission of this defendant. It cannot be allowed in this courtroom or any courtroom in the country.” Ms. Rotunno told the judge that she was seeking to counter the prosecution’s narrative that Mr. Weinstein is a predator. “It is one small piece of a large media attack on Mr. Weinstein every single day and for the D.A.’s office to act like they don't talk to the media just because their name isn’t in the article is ridiculous,” Ms. Rotunno said. “I did not say anything beyond the bounds of what our system should do.”",The New York Times

2020,The Final Scramble Before the Iowa Caucuses,"DES MOINES — Less than 48 hours from now, hundreds of thousands of Iowans will gather in schools and churches and libraries and gymnasiums, from the Mississippi River to the Missouri, and participate in the first nominating contest of the 2020 election. At that point, all the candidates will be able to do is wait: for the verdict and, they hope, for one of those elusive “tickets out of Iowa.” But for now, they are trying to make the most of the few hours in which their Iowa fates are still, sort of, in their hands.

2020,"Welcoming a Grandchild, Right in the Delivery Room","Generation Grandparent Many grandparents — mostly mothers and mothers-in-law — are present for the birth of a grandchild. When my granddaughter was born, my own role was very clear: Keep a packed bag handy. Head for Brooklyn as soon as my daughter, Emma, called to say she was on the way to the hospital with her husband. Move into their apartment for the duration to walk and feed Pearl, their sweet ancient Labrador. Wait by the phone. Being assigned to canine care was perfectly fine; I was glad to be useful. It never occurred to me that I could actually be in the delivery room when this baby arrived, and it didn’t occur to my daughter to invite me, or anyone else. Emma wanted a quiet, private birth with her partner and their nurse-midwife. Her own birth 30-some years earlier had been much the same. But I’m learning that many grandparents — mostly mothers and mothers-in-law, but some fathers and fathers-in-law as well — are indeed present for the big event. Carol Kerton, for example, was on hand to welcome her first grandchild in a hospital in Sacramento eight years ago. “It was an awesome experience,” said Ms. Kerton, 60, who lives in South Beach, Ore. “After that, I wanted to be there for all of them.” And she has been, for the births of all five of her grandchildren, most recently of twin boys. She has clasped her two daughters’ hands, fetched water for them, held their legs when it was time to push. She served, with permission, as the chief photographer and videographer. “It’s become a family event,” said her daughter Caitlin Schut, 31, the twins’ mother. When Lisa Peicott, 33, planned for her first baby’s birth, “I wanted my mom to be in the room,” she told me. “I was scared, and my husband was a little squeamish. But she’s been through it, so who better to walk me through it?” Thus, Deana Hendrickson, 61, was with her daughter, son-in-law, his mother and an aunt in Los Angeles in November when little Joseph was born. “A wonderful experience that I never want to repeat,” said Ms. Hendrickson, who found it difficult to see her daughter experience pain. Nonetheless, if her daughter has another child and wants her to be present, “I’ll be there again,” she said. Andrea Clay, 72, a nurse and emergency medical technician in rural Edison, Wash., deserves some sort of meritorious service award for attending not only her two grandchildren’s births, but her great-grandson’s in July. “I was really honored and grateful,” she said. “I wouldn’t have wanted to be anywhere else.” Not many generations back, most births were like this, family affairs. As recently as 1940, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports, 44 percent of American births took place outside of hospitals, generally at home. But childbirth swiftly became a medicalized phenomenon; by 1969, only 1 percent of births took place outside of hospitals. Women and their advocates have fought for years to have partners or other support people in hospital delivery rooms, to avoid unnecessary procedures and to gain more control over childbirth. Now, though there’s no data on how commonly this happens, it’s noncontroversial to have grandparents — or aunts, sisters and friends — present, said Dr. Samuel Bauer, chief of women’s and children’s clinical care at Beaumont Health in Michigan. “We tend to let everybody in,” he said. (About 18,000 babies are born in Beaumont Health hospitals annually.) Support during labor, he pointed out, has been shown to reduce anxiety and pain. So, “it’s really up to the mother. Who does she want and, sometimes, who doesn’t she want in the room? There’s no restriction on what the patient wants.” There’s a key question: Whom might a laboring mother choose to include, and might exclusions cause hurt feelings and jeopardize family ties? “If I invited my mother, did I have to invite my mother-in-law?” Ms. Schut wondered. “I realized no, this is really my decision. I can set boundaries.” Her mother agreed to accept any verdict, which eased the pressure. Personally, I think accepting any verdict about who attends the birth sets a good precedent for grandparenting in general. Get used to it: We are not in charge, and we don’t get to make demands. Ruth Zielinski, who directs the nurse-midwifery program at the University of Michigan School of Nursing and attended her own two grandsons’ births, has come up with some principles of what she calls “birth etiquette.” When grandparents and other family members enter the delivery room, “the vast majority of the time it’s a very positive experience,” she has found. (However, some hospitals still restrict the total number of participants, she added.) But she urges women to ponder: “Who do you feel comfortable with? Who do you think will be helpful?” And she cautions future grandparents to consider: “If you have the privilege of being at a birth, what should you do or not do? Why are you there, and what is your role?” Herewith, a few of Dr. Zielinski’s birth etiquette advisories: Wait for an invitation to the birth, and don’t be miffed if one doesn’t materialize. Nobody is entitled to be present. Besides, as one grandmother pointed out, “Babies don’t remember who was in the room.” If you’re included, support the mother’s choices. If she wants to labor unmedicated, fine. If she wants an epidural, ditto. If she wants to give birth in a tub, O.K. If she decides that the room is getting too crowded, leave. It’s not about you. The labor room is not the place to recount your own delivery or to joke that ha-ha, despite the mother’s saying that she will never do this again, she will. “This may not be the time to talk about that, or to talk at all,” Dr. Zielinski said. On the whole, however, “witnessing the moment of birth is transformational, for the woman and for the family,” said Elise Erickson, part of the nurse-midwifery faculty practice at Oregon Health and Science University in Portland. “I see the love and pride in the grandmother’s eyes. I see the tears.” Happily, it turned out that I did get to spend a little time with Emma before she delivered. She needed to have labor induced, on a summer day when every pregnant woman in Brooklyn seemed to have headed for the maternity floor at about the same moment. So Emma and her husband, Jay, bounced in and out of the hospital, waiting for a bed, getting sent home, being called back. Still no bed. Around 4 a.m., Emma told Jay to go home and get some sleep. I awoke a little later in their guest room — shortly to become the baby’s room — and thought of my girl alone in the hospital. I texted: Would you like some company until Jay returns? She answered, Yes, please. For a few hours, we chatted and read and did the Times crossword puzzle and snacked. (You can eat during early labor these days, I learned.) We walked slowly up and down the halls to stimulate contractions. It was a final mother-daughter moment before we became mother-daughter-granddaughter. I hope I was of some comfort. Then her husband arrived, and I went home to walk Pearl and wait for news. Paula Span writes the New Old Age column in the Science section of The New York Times.",The New York Times
2020,Wells Fargo Is Said to Be Near Settlements Over Sales Practices,"The bank would pay penalties to the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission over a fake-account scandal. Wells Fargo is preparing to settle with federal prosecutors and the Securities and Exchange Commission over the widespread abuse of customers in its banking, auto lending and mortgage businesses, according to two people familiar with the matter. The settlements could be announced as soon as Friday, according to the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the agreements were not yet public. The size of the penalties could not immediately be determined, but Wells Fargo has set aside $3.1 billion to pay legal costs related to the sales practice matters. Federal prosecutors have also been investigating people connected to the bank, but it was unclear if any criminal charges would be brought against any individuals. A Wells Fargo spokeswoman declined to comment. Representatives for the Justice Department and the S.E.C. did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The settlements would be the latest in a series of government penalties against the bank and its former leaders. Just last month, former Wells Fargo executives who presided over the abusive sales practices — including a former chief executive, John G. Stumpf — were subjected to the largest fines ever assessed by bank regulators. The scandal erupted in 2016 when Wells Fargo revealed that it had opened millions of bank accounts in customers’ names without their knowledge while charging other customers unnecessary fees for auto and home loans. It also admitted to selling some customers unwanted insurance products. While the settlements would resolve yearslong investigations by the agencies, they would not end the bank’s regulatory woes. For two years, the bank has been operating under growth restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve, which has said it will not release the bank from those constraints until its leaders can demonstrate that they have restructured its operations to prevent similar abuses. Regulators are also still seeking penalties against former employees. On Jan. 23, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency fined former top executives millions of dollars each; Mr. Stumpf agreed to pay $17.5 million. But others, including Carrie L. Tolstedt, Wells Fargo’s former head of retail banking, are fighting the cases brought by the regulator, which is seeking a $25 million fine against her. Wells Fargo, the fourth-largest bank in the United States, has been trying to turn itself around and rid itself of a toxic culture that drove employees to resort to fraud to increase their sales performance. In October, the bank hired Charles W. Scharf, a former JPMorgan Chase executive, to be its new leader. Last month, as regulators announced the multimillion-dollar settlement with the bank’s former chief, Mr. Scharf called the bank’s former sales practices “inexcusable.”",The New York Times
2020,West German Men Fill Race to Replace Chancellor Merkel,"The candidates to lead Angela Merkel’s conservative party reflect a pivot away from the chancellor’s centrist legacy. All are men from the conservative west. BERLIN — A week after Angela Merkel’s chosen successor threw her conservative party into disarray by announcing she would step down, the candidates who have emerged seem to represent the antithesis of the centrist chancellor from Germany’s east. All are men, all hail from the country’s former west, and all are pushing a new identity for the party, the conservative Christian Democratic Union. But they also offer very different visions of the future — some urging continuity with the Merkel era, others a clean break that could even shorten her tenure. Coming at a time when Europe and the world are looking to Germany for renewed leadership, the choice of the next party leader is likely to have ramifications well beyond the party. Uncertainty has enveloped the Christian Democrats since their current leader, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, Ms. Merkel’s handpicked successor, announced last week that she would step down after a local chapter broke with party policy and voted with the far-right Alternative for Germany in electing the governor of the state of Thuringia. Ms. Kramp-Karrenbauer, 57, met Wednesday with several potential candidates, though only one has declared his intention to run. Ms. Merkel, 65, has said she would not interfere with the selection. Traditionally, party delegates choose their leader, but no details or timeline have been announced and the party’s delegates are not scheduled to meet until December. The leader of the party in power is typically chancellor as well, but the Christian Democrats split the job 18 months ago, envisioning a future in which Ms. Kramp-Karrenbauer would eventually assume the chancellorship. Germans are not expected to elect a new government until October 2021, which means the new leader most likely faces the daunting prospect of uniting a fractured party in the shadow of Ms. Merkel. Alternatively, the leader could try to oust Ms. Merkel early, though she consistently ranks as the country’s most popular politician and the party’s partners in the government, the Social Democrats, have ruled out supporting a different chancellor. Whoever becomes the Christian Democrats’ ninth leader will have to carve out an identity for the party at a time when its conservative and centrist wings are deeply divided and the Alternative for Germany, or AfD, is flaunting its ability to upset the country’s democratic order. “In terms of style, there are differences between each of the candidates,” said Martin Florack, professor of political science at Duisburg-Essen University. What is clear, however, is that people want change, he said. “After the Merkel years, people are sick and tired of the moderate, presidential thing.” Viewed as the choice who would provide the greatest continuity with the Merkel era, Mr. Laschet, 59, decided against running in the 2018 race for the party leadership. Since then, Mr. Laschet, the governor of North Rhine-Westphalia and leader of the party’s largest state chapter, has been biding his time. Last weekend, he used the international platform of the Munich Security Conference to position himself as rooted in his party’s pro-European legacy. But he also focused on changes to the European Union, and criticized Ms. Merkel for taking “too long to react” to proposals from President Emmanuel Macron of France. Mr. Laschet has strongly opposed cooperating with the AfD — drawing a line that the most conservative wing of the party has called into question, at least under some circumstances. “Any cooperation, teamwork, support or coalition with the AfD is unacceptable for the Christian Democrats,” Mr. Laschet told his party on Feb. 5. Mr. Merz, 64, paints himself as an outsider, having been pushed out of the position of party whip in 2002 and leaving politics to make a personal fortune as the head of BlackRock Germany. He has since resigned from that position. That political loss still stings for Mr. Merz, making the prospect of his leading the party alongside Ms. Merkel until fall 2021 hard to imagine, although he has the backing of the country’s business leaders and has proved popular with voters. “Mr. Merz would not be able to exist alongside of the chancellor,” said Tilman Mayer, a professor of political science at Bonn University. “If he were to be elected party leader, he would try to also take the chancellery, but the Social Democrats would not go along with that.” Still, his pledge to strengthen the Christian Democrats’ conservative profile has resonated especially in the country’s east, where the party has been bleeding support to the AfD. At 39, Mr. Spahn is seen by many as too young to have a serious chance at Germany’s top job, although in neighboring Austria and France, young leaders have proved their ability to win elections and successfully steer their nations. Mr. Spahn has used his office as Ms. Merkel’s minister for health to demonstrate that he is able to enact legislation. He has stressed that Germany will need to move more aggressively into the digital sphere if it hopes to remain competitive. A practicing Roman Catholic who is married to a man, Mr. Spahn potentially appeals to a wide voter base. If Mr. Laschet and Mr. Merz, both from North Rhine-Westphalia, were to find themselves in a head-to-head struggle, Mr. Spahn could emerge as a compromise, Mr. Mayer said. In a move that surprised Berlin, Mr. Röttgen, 54, on Monday became the first candidate to declare his intention to seek the party leadership. Early polls indicated that many voters may consider Mr. Röttgen, a foreign policy expert and former environment minister, to have the best mix of conservative values, political experience and ability to work with both the chancellor and coalition partners. Surveys published on Wednesday showed Mr. Röttgen polling ahead of Mr. Merz, previously the public’s favorite. A centrist who was close to the chancellor until she fired him in 2012, Mr. Röttgen, who is chairman of the parliamentary committee on foreign affairs, has stated that Ms. Merkel should remain in office. He has also insisted that the conservatives focus on environmental issues, a signal, perhaps, that he would be willing to work with the Greens, who have been nipping at the party’s heels and could become coalition partners. Mr. Söder, the governor of Bavaria, is still considered a potential chancellor candidate in next year’s election, although he has said he would prefer to stay in his state. After swinging to the right ahead of the 2018 state election in Bavaria, which he won, Mr. Söder has since taken on more pro-environment positions in his home state. Still, many see Mr. Söder as untried and lacking the experience to take on the country’s top office. Formerly a fierce critic of Ms. Merkel, he has recently come out in support of her serving out her term. “I believe that breaking with the chancellor is not right,” he said on ARD public broadcaster on Sunday, making clear the Bavarians will have a say in who runs for the chancellery.",The New York Times
2020,"Westerdam Passengers at Low Risk of Coronavirus Infection, C.D.C. Says","The agency does not know why one passenger’s test results were positive, but said there is no risk to fellow travelers. Get an informed guide to the global outbreak with our daily Coronavirus
 newsletter.
 Passengers aboard the cruise ship Westerdam who have returned to the United States no longer need to isolate themselves and can resume normal activities, despite the fact that one passenger tested positive for the new coronavirus in Malaysia, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has advised. A spokesman for the agency said on Saturday that the passenger’s diagnosis, confirmed twice by health officials in Malaysia, was a false-positive and noted that no other infections among passengers aboard the ship had been reported. But on Sunday, the agency said that it had no direct evidence that the test result was a false-positive. Malaysian health officials announced that the passenger, an 83-year-old American woman, now tests negative for the infection, but experts say that is to be expected in a patient recovering from the illness. (The test looks for an active infection; it is not an antibody test, which can tell whether a patient has ever been infected.) “I’m thinking they must have some information from the testing laboratory in Malaysia that would give the C.D.C. confidence in saying yes, that was a false-positive result,” said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University. “Obviously, if it was a true positive, you would keep all those people in self-monitoring.” The C.D.C. had issued that advice to state and local health departments last week, telling Westerdam passengers that they should restrict public activities for 14 days because they might have been exposed to the virus. The owner of the ship, Holland America Lines, a division of Carnival Cruise Lines, celebrated the loosening of restrictions on Westerdam passengers. “While we were not surprised by these results, we were very pleased to receive this confirmation,” Holland America said in a letter to Westerdam passengers. “C.D.C. does not recommend isolation or quarantine for guests returning home from Westerdam.” On Sunday, the C.D.C. also said that Westerdam passengers would not require testing for the coronavirus. Tests of nearly 1,500 passengers, mostly conducted by Cambodian health officials, had turned up no other infections, the agency said, and therefore the passengers are at little to no risk of carrying the virus. Updated Feb. 26, 2020 The Westerdam carried about 2,000 passengers, however, and those who left Cambodia first were never tested for the coronavirus. The Cambodian government has regarded its embrace of the Westerdam as a political event and humanitarian gesture, and the country’s prime minister, Hun Sen, was incensed when Malaysian health officials said that the American passenger, who was identified as she arrived in Kuala Lumpur, was ill with the coronavirus. Following the C.D.C.’s initial statement that the test was a false-positive, Mr. Hun Sen accused Malaysia of shoddy lab work. The woman never had coronavirus at all, he asserted. “The irresponsibility of some foreigners on the health test of Westerdam passengers makes Cambodia the victim of its humanitarian work,” Mr. Hun Sen said in a Facebook post on Saturday. “If I were the Malaysian P.M., I would remove the health minister for being neglectful and irresponsible.” Testing for the coronavirus has proved problematic, said Dr. Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, and questions have been raised about the test’s sensitivity. A diagnostic test produced by the C.D.C. and sent to state health departments turned out to be flawed, and new test kits must be manufactured. “If the C.D.C., a world renowned scientific institution, is having trouble, it’s highly likely others are having trouble as well,” Dr. Nuzzo said. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] Timing is also critical: People who test negative may turn positive a few days later, depending on when during the incubation period a sample is taken. Very few Americans are being tested. The C.D.C. requires people to be symptomatic and to report having had a clear route of exposure, such as recent travel to Wuhan. “It’s important to put this one potential case in the context of thousands and thousands whom we are not testing,” Dr. Nuzzo added. “South Korea has tested more than 20,000 people. We have tested probably under 1,000.” Questions about the possible exposure of Westerdam passengers to the coronavirus have swirled since Feb. 1, when the ship picked up 768 new passengers in Hong Kong and embarked on a 14-day voyage whose itinerary included stops at ports in the Philippines, Taiwan, Japan and South Korea. But Hong Kong already had at least 10 cases of coronavirus by the end of January, and announced its first death early in February. The cruise line tweaked the Westerdam’s itinerary, but one port after another turned it away, and it remained at sea for nearly two weeks until Cambodia allowed it to dock in Sihanoukville on Feb. 13.

2020,The Final Scramble Before the Iowa Caucuses,"DES MOINES — Less than 48 hours from now, hundreds of thousands of Iowans will gather in schools and churches and libraries and gymnasiums, from the Mississippi River to the Missouri, and participate in the first nominating contest of the 2020 election. At that point, all the candidates will be able to do is wait: for the verdict and, they hope, for one of those elusive “tickets out of Iowa.” But for now, they are trying to make the most of the few hours in which their Iowa fates are still, sort of, in their hands. And so candidates here held more than 20 events today, under the ever-present shadow of the 2016 primary. After months of ideological sparring, they seemed to have just one thing left to tell caucusgoers: If you want to beat President Trump, you had better pick me. We’ll be back tomorrow with more live coverage from the campaign trail.",The New York Times
2020,Westminster Dog Show Photos: Ready for Prime Time,"A field of hundreds will be narrowed to seven by Tuesday night, but until then it is still any dog’s game. Credit...Victor Llorente for The New York Times They gave the hounds and the herders the once over at the Westminster Dog Show on Sunday. The bassets and the beagles, the collies and the corgis. Monday was showtime for the toy and nonworking groups. The Havanese and the Maltese, the Finnish Spitz and the French Bulldogs. Each one will be groomed and pampered, allowed a few snacks and even a nap or two, and then poked and prodded and allowed to preen. On Tuesday night, the judges will have culled a field of more than 2,600 to a final seven for the finale at Madison Square Garden. Only one will be left then, for best in show. For now, take a moment to celebrate them all. The feeling when you roll up to the dog show like, “I’m heeeerrrre everybody!” Just chilling. Why so serious, Irish setter? There’s nothing a fresh pedicure can’t fix. A water bowl? These dogs do not have time for water bowls. All dogs are good. Only some are fabulous. There are so many terrier breeds — 32 in all — that they get their own group. Wait for it …. Clifford, the big red dog, is a Leonberger. And no joke: His name really is Clifford. A xoloitzcuintli, one of the newest breeds at Westminster, staked out an upper-deck seat at Madison Square Garden. Terriers on parade. Sutton, a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, in for a mist and a brush. “Just take me somewhere there’s grass please.” Best in nap. “So I was thinking, maybe next year we bring the big crate?” Westminster’s guide to breeds makes the Borzoi sound like a great catch, with “a gentle temperament and striking good looks.” A poodle, left, heads toward the competition floor. ""You said this wouldn’t take long. Five, 10 minutes tops, you said.” What’s better than a Bichon Frise? Bichons Frises. It is perfectly acceptable to tease the Pomeranians. It is important to dress for the occasion, regardless of the time of day. With no firehouses or Disney villains in sight, a group of Dalmatians waits at Pier 94. A Maltese (we promise there is a dog under there) is groomed ahead of judging. Good dogs! Participants of the two-legged and four-legged variety line up to prepare for the Westminster Dog Show.",The New York Times
2020,Opinion | We’re Reading the Coronavirus Numbers Wrong,"Up-to-the-minute reports and statistics can unintentionally distort the facts. Mr. Paulos is a professor of mathematics. Numbers have a certain mystique: They seem precise, exact, sometimes even beyond doubt. But outside the field of pure mathematics, this reputation rarely is deserved. And when it comes to the coronavirus epidemic, buying into that can be downright dangerous. Naturally, everyone wants to know how deadly COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, is. The technical term for that is the case fatality rate — which is, put simply, the number of people who have died from the disease (D) divided by the total number of people who were infected with it (I), or D/I. As of Tuesday morning, at least 1,873 people were thought to have died from the disease worldwide and 72,869 people to have been infected. But those figures may not mean what you think. The number of deaths (D) seems like it should be easy enough to determine: After all, dead is dead. And yet ascribing a cause of death can be tricky. The coronavirus might be blamed for the deaths of vulnerable people, especially seniors, already suffering from other illnesses, such as diabetes and other chronic conditions. On the other hand, some deaths will be attributed to other illnesses that might more accurately be ascribed to COVID-19. Even more problematic is figuring out the total number of infected people (I) — call that the mystery of the denominator. Patients who have tested positive and are hospitalized are included in that tally, of course. But what about those who are being treated without formally having been tested? Or those who might be infected and yet display no symptoms? Another complicating factor is the remaining number of unresolved or indeterminate cases: Medical experts still aren’t sure, for example, how long the infection’s incubation period may be. And then, in addition to the uncertainty inherent in the basic numbers, there are the distortions unintentionally created by the way those numbers are reported by medical officials and presented by the media. Last week, the authorities of Hubei, the province in China at the center of the epidemic, revised their definition of what it means to be infected by the new coronavirus: On Thursday, they started including people who displayed symptoms associated with COVID-19 — coughing, a fever, difficulty breathing — even if those people hadn’t been tested or had tested negative for the virus. As a result, the number of new daily cases increased by a factor of nine overnight. But what did that spike reveal, in fact? If the daily tally of newly infected people increases, does that mean the disease actually is spreading at that moment? That it is more contagious than we had known? And if the number of deaths — or the ratio of deaths to infections — jumps from one day to the next, does that mean the disease has just gotten more lethal? Or that it actually is more lethal than we thought it was the day before? Not necessarily, though it may seem or feel that way. The shifts might be short-term adjustments or simply the effects, or artifacts, of delayed disclosures — a kind of numerical optical illusion. Yet when news outlets reported last week, after the revision in what counts as an infection, the largest jump in reported cases “in a single day and more than twice the previous record high,” readers could be forgiven for assuming that the situation had just taken a turn for the worse. Even articles that stated the broader circumstances of the increase could be misleading: Some, by announcing in their headlines a “dramatic spike” or a “surge” in the number of cases; others, by discussing the swell while stating that local officials had been sacked for it. The fact that China suddenly broadened its criteria also raised fears that its earlier numbers might have been incorrect: too low, and perhaps deliberately so. National pride and the fear of economic costs or a popular backlash might have motivated underreporting, the suspicion went. But the reasons for the shift could also be more mundane. Maybe the medical authorities in China didn’t report more infections previously because they couldn’t — because, say, they were short of reliable test kits (which they were). It’s possible that the numbers were fudged. But maybe they weren’t, or not as much as some people seem to fear. The change in criteria for what counts as an infection may indicate, not so much nefarious evidence of a cover-up now exposed, but the struggles of a local health care system overwhelmed by a sudden and colossal medical crisis. Last Thursday, the Hubei authorities also reported a leap in the new daily tally of deaths: 242, compared with 94 for Wednesday. That’s a big jump, but not nearly as big as the increase in the number of newly infected people over the same period. Which could be a cause for some measure of relief: The disease’s lethality would seem to have decreased or be lower than was previously thought. Yet that’s not the takeaway likely to have prevailed. Some of the reporting has amounted to a set of contradictory pronouncements, confusing at best. Journalists could display more critical distance and a modicum of skepticism toward the data they relay, instead of turning the media coverage into a hall of mirrors. One major problem is the doing of no one in particular. The story about the coronavirus’s spread is evolving quickly, with medical authorities in China and elsewhere disclosing figures daily (or more often), and the media reporting the information immediately to satisfy the fast-paced, staccato rhythms of publishing cycles. But up-to-the-minute, blow-by-blow accounts of hard data can create mistaken impressions about the underlying facts, even if both the data and the accounts are accurate. Last Thursday, a surge in the number of infections was reported, because of that change in official criteria. On Monday, China announced a drop in the number of new cases for the third consecutive day. Now what should we make of that? Constant on-the-nose reporting, however much it seems to serve transparency, has limitations, too. It’s a short-term, and shortsighted, approach that’s difficult to resist, especially when people are afraid and the authorities are taking draconian actions. It’s only natural to compare and contrast whatever hard facts are available. And yet it’s especially dangerous to do that precisely because people are so anxious, and fear can trick the mind. A view from a loftier perch — a month’s, or even just a week’s, perspective — would, and will, produce far more reliable information. As of Tuesday, the case fatality rate of COVID-19 appeared to be about 2.5 percent. That’s in keeping with what it was, for example, from the beginning of the outbreak up to Jan. 28. By comparison, the case fatality rate for the seasonal flu in the United States ranges between 0.10 percent and 0.18 percent. For SARS, it’s about 10 percent and for MERS, about 35 percent. For Ebola, it has varied between 25 percent and 90 percent, depending on outbreaks, averaging approximately 50 percent. And so based on what we know so far, COVID-19 seems to be much less fatal than other coronavirus infections and diseases that turned into major epidemics in recent decades. The operative words here are “based on what we know so far” — meaning, both no more and no less than that, and also that our take on the situation might need to change as more data come in. Remember, too, that even if only a small percentage of the people infected with COVID-19 die in the end, the death toll in absolute numbers could still be dreadful if the total population of infected turns out to be very large. However much we would like to know all the relevant facts about the coronavirus, we don’t know them right now, and we should accept the discomfort of that uncertainty. Which is all the more reason to abide by one of the things we do know at this point: You should wash your hands regularly.

2020,Opinion | We’re Still Living in Stalin’s World,"At the Yalta Conference 75 years ago, the Soviet leader got everything he wanted — and shaped global politics for decades. Ms. Preston is the author of “Eight Days at Yalta: How Churchill, Roosevelt, and Stalin Shaped the Post-War World.” If you polled global security experts today about the parts of the world that keep them up at night, the top three would probably be Ukraine and Crimea, the Korean Peninsula and post-Brexit Western Europe. Coincidentally, the troubles facing all three can be traced back to a short conference held 75 years ago on Tuesday. The meeting, at the Crimean resort of Yalta, brought together the three top Allied leaders, Franklin Roosevelt, Winston Churchill and Joseph Stalin. The war was winding down, and they were there to determine what came next. Among the most pressing issues were the borders and future democratic freedoms of Poland, which Roosevelt and Churchill had pledged to safeguard. By February 1945, however, the Red Army was in control of most of Eastern Europe. As Stalin was fond of saying, “Whoever occupies a territory imposes on it his own social system,” and the Soviet Union was simply too powerful to resist. Roosevelt and Churchill battled for self-determination for Poland and other Eastern European countries, but in the end secured only paper promises that the West had no way to enforce and that Stalin violated within weeks. Poland was the reason Britain had originally gone to war, a fact not lost on Churchill that month. Soon after he returned from Yalta, Churchill even asked his military commanders to assess the cost of using force to compel Stalin to give Poland a fair deal. The response was 45 Anglo-American divisions, several Polish divisions and 100,000 rearmed German troops. The commanders nicknamed the idea of going to war against the Soviet Union “Operation Unthinkable,” which, of course, it was. A year later, Churchill declared that an “iron curtain” had descended across Europe. Though the Soviet Union collapsed some 30 years ago, the division, and the flash points, remain. It’s no coincidence that the crux of the split between Russia and the West is over Crimea and parts of Ukraine, annexed by Vladimir Putin. Just as in 1945, Western leaders know they have few viable options beyond moral pressure on the occupying Russians. Stalin once said, “If you are afraid of wolves, keep out of the woods.” Entering Putin’s woods seems no less problematic. The Yalta Conference bequeathed other troubling legacies. One of Roosevelt’s key objectives at the meeting was to secure the Soviet Union’s entry into the war against Japan to save the millions of American lives he believed it would cost to invade the Japanese home islands. A timely Soviet entry might force Japan to surrender. He therefore readily accepted Stalin’s demands for territorial and other concessions at the expense of America’s ally China; Stalin also demanded future concessions from a defeated Japan. Then, just five months later, the three Allied leaders learned that the United States had tested an atomic bomb; within weeks two were dropped on Japan. The availability of a powerful new weapon earlier than many doubters, Roosevelt and Churchill included, had believed possible made Soviet intervention in the Pacific Theater unnecessary. Grasping this immediately, Stalin hastened his plans to attack Japan. On Aug. 9, 1945, three days after the bomb was dropped on Hiroshima and the day the bomb was dropped on Nagasaki, the Red Army swept into Japanese-occupied Manchuria and on into northern Korea, held by Japan since 1910, advancing rapidly to the 38th Parallel. Under terms hurriedly drafted with American military planners, Soviet forces took the surrender of all Japanese troops north of that line while American forces, after a little delay, did so to the south. Soon after, despite Stalin’s pledge to support a free and independent Korea, Soviet troops sealed the 38th Parallel. The Korean Communist leader Kim Il-sung arrived in Pyongyang in the uniform of a Red Army major and, with Soviet backing, took power in the north. The scene was set for the establishment of North and South Korea, the Korean War, continuing partition and the instabilities posed by the Kim dynasty today. Another perhaps less obvious legacy of the Yalta Conference is Britain’s often-fractious relationship with France, and by extension the European Union. Gen. Charles de Gaulle, the leader of the Free French forces, had insisted on an invitation to the conference, but Roosevelt, Churchill and Stalin decided against it. So great was the haughty de Gaulle’s resentment that during the conference he broadcast to the French people that he would not be bound by the conference’s decisions, but would pursue an independent line. De Gaulle’s exclusion from Yalta fed his growing distrust of what he saw as an emerging postwar Anglo-American hegemony. In 1963, and again in 1967, he vetoed Britain’s entry into the European Community; in 1966 he withdrew France from NATO’s active command structure. Britain eventually joined the European Union in 1973; had it done so earlier, it might have integrated better into the bloc. While it’s impossible to know for sure, 43 years later the Brexit referendum might never have been called. Many regard Yalta as a byword for compromise, even betrayal. In 2005 George W. Bush likened the outcomes to the 1938 Munich Agreement — “a sellout” to dictatorship. Yalta undoubtedly left the peoples of Eastern Europe in thrall to the Soviet Union for nearly half a century. But Western leaders had little leverage over Stalin, especially as the Soviet Union had a strong moral claim to its postwar bounty, having suffered by far the most during the war. Elsewhere, though, the Western allies met many of their objectives. Roosevelt secured agreement to his long-cherished dream of a United Nations. Though the veto arrangements agreed to at Yalta often cripple the Security Council in addressing disputes among the great powers (any of the five permanent members of the Security Council can veto an action), the organization has become an effective global peacekeeping force, and many of its agencies, like the World Health Organization and the High Commissioner for Refugees, do valuable work. Churchill attained his goal — albeit Pyrrhic, short-term and, to modern thinking, immoral — to maintain the British Empire. In one instance, retaining control over Hong Kong, he preserved a Western outpost on the coast of China for many troubled years, the consequences of which are now playing out. Transcripts of the Yalta Conference reveal as much about the personalities as the politics of Roosevelt, Churchill and Stalin. Cracks in the once close relationship between the cool, detached American president and the often emotional British prime minister are obvious. For Roosevelt, it was his last turn on the world stage; already in visible physical decline, he died two months later. Churchill made it to the next Allied conference, at Potsdam, Germany, but was replaced a few days into the meeting by the new prime minister, Clement Attlee. Only Stalin remained. Geopolitical negotiations always revolve around the personalities and strategies of the people involved; those with the most uncompromising objectives and the vision and determination to achieve them have an edge. At Yalta he showed a tight grasp of detail, rigid determination and ability to spot and exploit others’ weaknesses. A senior British official thought him “much the most impressive of the three men” and “very quiet and restrained.” Three quarters of a century later, Stalin’s quiet strength is still shaping global affairs.

2020,Democrats’ Attacks Get Personal Ahead of New Hampshire Primary,"MANCHESTER — Bernie Sanders’s campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, said on Sunday that the campaign would call for a recanvass of specific precincts in Iowa, extending the Iowa caucus catastrophe to a second week. In an interview with CNN, Mr. Shakir said: “You can expect us to be asking the Iowa Democratic Party for a recanvass of the discrepancies that we have identified and found for them. We will be searching for and identifying even more.” He added that the process had been “handled incompetently from our perspective.” Also Sunday, the Iowa Democratic Party announced that it had updated data from 55 problematic precincts, about 3 percent of the total, and determined that Pete Buttigieg had won 14 national delegates from the caucuses and Mr. Sanders 12. But reports have shown that many precincts had inconsistencies in their results, and internal party emails showed that the party would not correct errors that had occurred on handwritten worksheets from the precincts — only discrepancies between what was reported on those worksheets and results that were released publicly. The Sanders campaign had announced last week that it had found discrepancies in delegate calculations in 14 precincts. The Iowa Democratic Party has extended its deadline to Monday for campaigns to seek a recanvass of caucus results. Mr. Shakir expressed confidence that Mr. Sanders would have the same number of national delegates as Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., “after it’s all said and done.” A Sanders aide confirmed that the campaign would be seeking a partial recanvass of results. Asked on Thursday on CNN if he would call for such a recanvass, Mr. Sanders responded, “We’ve got enough of Iowa,” and said it was time to “move on to New Hampshire.”",The New York Times
2020,Highlights From the Final Day Before Voting,"MANCHESTER — Amy Klobuchar, sounding only slightly hoarse at her fifth rally of the day, at a bar in downtown Manchester, told voters she was in the process of firing up her campaign operation in the coming Nevada caucuses — “and beyond,” she added. More than any other major candidate, Ms. Klobuchar will have to expand her organization in Nevada in a tightly compressed time frame before the Feb. 22 caucuses. She has focused overwhelmingly so far on Iowa and New Hampshire, and for most of the race has faced significant financial constraints. But a Klobuchar aide said on Monday that the campaign was shifting staff members out of Iowa and into Nevada, and Ms. Klobuchar appears to be in a stronger financial position after a post-debate infusion of online cash. “We’re so excited about tomorrow night and then to Nevada, where we’re building a big operation,” Ms. Klobuchar said. She went on to repeat a plea she has offered over the last few days, telling New Hampshire voters “this is a big deal for me here” and crediting the state with having vaulted relatively unknown or underfunded candidates into national contention in the past. Without strong finishes in both New Hampshire and Nevada — and perhaps even with them — it could be exceedingly difficult for Ms. Klobuchar to compete across the enormous Super Tuesday map in early March. But the mere fact that Ms. Klobuchar is confidently turning her attention west represents a real shift from just last week, when her fifth-place finish in Iowa seemed unlikely, on its own, to change the trajectory of her campaign. Without the intervening debate, Ms. Klobuchar could well have been headed for another likely fifth-place finish, leaving her future as a candidate in serious doubt.",The New York Times
2020,We’ve Never Seen the Sun’s Top or Bottom. Solar Orbiter Will Change That.,"The NASA-European Space Agency spacecraft, which launched Sunday, will spend the next decade closely observing the sun. A rocket carrying Solar Orbiter, a probe that will take pictures of the top and bottom of the sun, launched Sunday night. The Atlas 5 rocket launched on time, just as the final Oscar statues were being handed out for the 2020 Academy Awards. It illuminated the night sky over Florida’s Atlantic coast as it headed away from Earth to place thespacecraft into an orbit around the sun. It was a successful beginning to a mission that is a collaboration between NASA and the European Space Agency. In the day ahead, Solar Orbiter will test its instruments and prepare to initiate the complex maneuvers it needs to set course for what scientists hope is a decade of solar discoveries. With Solar Orbiter, scientists will for the first time get a good view of the top and bottom of the sun. Until now, almost all of the solar-watching spacecraft have orbited in the ecliptic, or the same plane that the planets travel around the sun. That change of view could help solve mysteries about how the sun spews high-velocity charged particles that fly outward through the solar system and buffet the planets, including Earth. The magnetic fields that accelerate those particles flow into and out of the sun’s poles. The data from Solar Orbiter could help explain the sunspot cycle — Why does the cycle last 11 years? Why are some quiet and others roar violently? — and help models to predict solar storms that could disrupt Earth’s power grids and satellites in orbit. Ulysses, an earlier collaboration between NASA and the European Space Agency launched in 1990, also passed over the sun’s poles, but at much farther distances, and it did not carry a camera. The launch trajectory will take Solar Orbiter away from Earth into an orbit around the sun. A flyby of Venus on the day after Christmas will sap some of its energy and let it spiral closer toward the sun. Additional flybys — one of Earth, two more of Venus — will further adjust the orbit, which will still be in the ecliptic, the plane of the orbits. A flyby of Venus in 2025 will swing Solar Orbiter out of the ecliptic to an angle of 17 degrees. That is enough to get a good glimpse of the polar regions. Additional Venus flybys will increase the angle to 33 degrees. The mission is expected to complete 22 orbits of the sun in 10 years. The spacecraft’s 10 scientific instruments are a mix. Some measure what is happening directly around the spacecraft, like the magnetic fields and particles of the solar wind. Others take pictures of what is occurring on the sun. Remember the caution that you should not look directly at the sun? Solar Orbiter’s cameras have to do just that, and at a distance where the sunlight is 13 times as intense. Three peepholes in the heat shield will open for 10 days at a time to allow the instruments to collect data. The assorted cameras also have heat-resistant windows (think of them as scientific sunglasses) as protection. The cameras will look at a range of wavelengths of light, including ultraviolet and X-rays. Some of the cameras break the light into separate wavelengths to identify specific molecules. The coronagraph includes a disk to block out most of the light to look at what is going on in the sun’s outer atmosphere. Occasionally, the sun erupts giant amounts of particles known as coronal mass ejections. When such an eruption slams into Earth’s magnetic field, it generates surges of electrical current. Solar scientists do not have reliable ways to predict such an eruption. The largest one known to hit Earth was the Carrington event in 1859, named after one of the people who observed an intensely bright spot on the sun where the eruption occurred. The surge caused some telegraph wires to catch fire. When Nicola J. Fox, director of NASA’s heliophysics division, talks about solar science to children at schools she introduces the Carrington event and how it knocked out the telegraph system in the U.S. for four days. “The kids just kind of look at me like, ‘So what?’,” she said. “And then I say, ‘Imagine you didn’t have your iPad for four days.’ Panic ensues in the classroom.” A similar event today could potentially cause not only continentwide blackouts, but also destroy giant transformers on the electric grid — damage that might take months or years to repair. A smaller solar storm in March 1989 knocked out power in Quebec for nine hours. Just a few years ago, Earth was lucky. On July 23, 2012, NASA’s Stereo-A spacecraft was hit by a gigantic coronal mass ejection. Analysis showed that this outburst was bigger than the Carrington eruption. If Earth had been where Stereo-A was — the spacecraft travels in the same orbit as Earth, but ahead of the planet — that would have been a very interesting day. In 2018, NASA launched the Parker Solar Probe, which is making closer and closer flybys of the sun as it reaches the fastest speeds ever achieved by a human-built spacecraft. That probe is flying into the sun’s outer atmosphere, known as the corona, and eventually coming within four million miles of its surface. By comparison, Earth is 93 million miles from the sun. Mercury, the closest planet, is 29 million miles from the sun. The close distance allows the Parker Solar Probe to make direct measurements of those regions, but it has to be protected from temperatures of about 2 million degrees Fahrenheit. transcript “Set the controls for the heart of the sun.” In the summer of 2018, the Parker Solar Probe will lift off from Earth. It will spend the next seven years spiraling inward to the center of the solar system. The Parker probe will be the first spacecraft to touch our star. Or any star. It will brush through the halo of hot gases that form the sun’s outer atmosphere: the corona. The surface of the sun looks placid to our eyes, but it is pierced and roiled by strong magnetic fields. The fields trap gas blowing off the Sun and lift it into glowing arcs and streamers. Scientists don’t understand how the corona works, or why it’s hundreds of times hotter than the surface of the sun. The Parker probe will pass closer to the Sun than any mission before it. To get that close, the spacecraft will make seven flybys of Venus over seven years, gradually tightening its elliptical orbit and shifting it closer and closer to the sun. A high-tech heat shield will protect the probe from the punishing radiation and heat of the corona. Within the shield’s shadow, the spacecraft instruments will operate at a comfortable room temperature. As the probe passes close to the sun, it will briefly become the fastest machine ever built by humans, zipping along at a brisk 430,000 miles per hour. The Parker probe is the first NASA spacecraft to be named after a living person. Eugene Parker is an astrophysicist at the University of Chicago. In 1958, he suggested that the sun radiates a constant and intense stream of charged particles. He called it the solar wind. This wind pushes out comet tails and makes the long streamers seen in solar eclipses. With the Parker Solar Probe, scientists hope to learn more about the sun’s turbulent corona. How it accelerates particles, and how it flings huge clouds of fiery gas outward across space. Huge waves of magnetized gas are called coronal mass ejections. If Earth gets in the way of one of these storms, it could be bad news. Our planet is protected by its own magnetic field, but a direct hit from one of these galloping clouds of particles and radiation could disrupt satellites and force astronauts in the space station to take shelter. In 1859, a powerful storm called the Carrington Event produced auroras as far south as Cuba. A solar storm of that size today could cripple satellites and power grids around the world. If successful, the Parker probe’s mission to touch the sun may explain how solar storms form. Scientists hope it might teach us how to predict coronal outbursts more accurately and learn how to endure them. We’ve always depended on the kindness of a star, here on a planet riding the gentle fringe of barely calculable forces. Living with a star is not easy. But we’re learning. Solar Orbiter will be passing farther from the sun. At the closest point along its elliptical orbit, it will be just three million miles inside of the orbit of Mercury, and experience much less extreme temperatures. Instead of millions of degrees, temperatures at Solar Orbiter will reach several hundred degrees. That allows Solar Orbiter to carry a wider range of instruments. Coordinated observations between Parker and Solar Orbiter could identify phenomena on the surface with conditions in the corona. “It’s really a perfect dream, a marriage in heaven,” said Guenther Hasinger, director of science at European Space Agency during a news conference on Friday. In addition to Solar Orbiter and Parker Solar Probe, nine other missions are currently keeping an eye on the sun and the solar wind. Each has been designed to add unique data to our understanding of what our star is doing. Here is what else is out there: Advanced Composition Explorer, or ACE — A NASA spacecraft that monitors the solar wind from a vantage point between Earth and the sun. Cluster — Four European Space Agency Earth-orbiting spacecraft investigating the interactions of the solar wind with Earth’s magnetic field. Hinode — A Japanese spacecraft measuring the sun’s magnetic fields. Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph, or IRIS — A small NASA ultraviolet telescope in orbit around Earth that studies the movement of heat and energy in the lower parts of the sun’s atmosphere. Proba-2 — Two instruments on this low-cost European Space Agency satellite observe the sun. Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory, or Stereo — A NASA mission of two nearly identical spacecraft traveling around the sun in the same orbit as Earth, with one ahead of Earth and one trailing. Solar Dynamics Observatory, or S.D.O. — A NASA spacecraft in geosynchronous orbit that studies the influence of the sun and solar weather on Earth. Solar and Heliospheric Observatory, or SOHO — An earlier European-NASA collaboration that has been taking pictures of the sun since 1995. Wind — A NASA spacecraft observing heated gas of charged particles coming from the sun. Many big space missions are international collaborations. For Solar Orbiter, the European Space Agency was in charge of developing the spacecraft and its instruments. NASA paid for the Atlas 5 rocket for the trip to space. The James Webb Space Telescope, the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, is the opposite. NASA is building the telescope, and the Europeans are providing the launch vehicle, an Ariane 5 rocket from French Guiana. The Rosalind Franklin rover that is to launch to Mars this summer was originally another NASA-European Space Agency collaboration but NASA backed out in 2012, because of cuts in the NASA budget. The Europeans turned to Russia to provide the rocket and the system to land the rover on the surface. Solar Orbiter was not the only spacecraft scheduled to be launched from the East Coast on Sunday. A crewless Antares cargo ship with supplies, equipment and experiments destined for International Space Station was to lift off at 5:39 p.m. Eastern time from the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport in Virginia. However, after a short postponement, Sunday’s launch was called off. Northrop Grumman, which manages the Antares and Cygnus flights, described a problem with a sensor on the ground. It said it will not be able to attempt a launch again until Thursday because of weather concerns as well as time needed to address the problem that caused the scrubbed launch.

2020,What Are Iowa’s Satellite Caucuses? And How Did They Help Bernie Sanders?,"Mr. Sanders vastly outperformed his rivals in the ad hoc Iowa caucuses held in the state, across the nation and around the world. In an extremely tight race, his success in them could prove critical. They caucused in Arizona, in Paris and in the former Soviet republic of Georgia; inside workplaces, on college campuses and at nursing homes; in Spanish and in American Sign Language. Hundreds of Iowans who could not attend regular precinct caucuses expressed their preference in a new experiment conducted on Monday by the Iowa Democratic Party: satellite caucuses. Three days later, it now appears their participation may play a crucial role in deciding the outcome of a tight race. With 99 percent of total precincts reporting, the race in Iowa still remains too close to call. But the latest batches of results released on Wednesday and Thursday, which included data from many satellite caucuses, helped Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont close the gap with former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., who is leading. As of Thursday night, Mr. Buttigieg had 564 state delegate equivalents, or S.D.E.s; Mr. Sanders had 562. In a race that tight, every delegate matters. And with the party assigning more than 40 S.D.E.s to the satellite caucuses, who won them, and by how much, could help determine the Iowa winner. A New York Times analysis of the state party’s tabulated results shows that Mr. Sanders won the satellite caucuses that have reported by a wide margin. He has picked up 25.5 S.D.E.s from satellite caucuses so far, by the party’s accounting; Mr. Buttigieg got only 1.2. That difference is far greater than the margin between the two men in any of Iowa’s 99 counties. Those numbers could change, especially if the results are recanvassed, as Tom Perez, the Democratic National Committee chairman, called for on Thursday. Questions have also been raised about the formula the state party is using to award S.D.E.s to the satellite precincts. But what are these satellite caucuses, and how did they give Mr. Sanders such an advantage? Here’s a primer. Caucuses have a number of features that differentiate them from a primary. Of course, there are the odd mechanics of how they are actually conducted once a person arrives (which you can see in action here). But there are also logistical issues that critics say make it much harder for people to participate at all. For one, the regular caucuses begin at a single set time — in Iowa, 7 p.m. — rather than throughout the day. That can make them difficult to attend for people who work or go to school at night or who care for young children. And the events can drag on for hours, much of that time spent standing in a corner of a gym or other uncomfortable location. Attending a caucus can prove taxing for many people and nearly impossible for people with disabilities. Then there are the people away from home to consider, and caucusgoers who speak a language other than English. The list of accessibility challenges helps explain why in Iowa, a state of more than three million people, the largest number to participate in a Democratic caucus — at least as of Monday — was about 240,000 in 2008. Aware of these longstanding concerns, Democratic National Committee members voted in 2018 to encourage states that held caucuses to switch to primaries, and to require the caucus states that remained — like Iowa and Nevada — to find another way for people to participate. In Iowa, Democrats spent months trying to design a “virtual” caucus system, which would have allowed participation through a phone call, but the Democratic National Committee rejected that proposal over security concerns. They also considered mailing absentee paper ballots, but ditched that idea because of fears that it hemmed to close to being a primary. In the end, they landed on satellite caucuses, which went into action on Monday. To host a satellite caucus, people unable to attend their regular precinct caucus were required to apply, and a state party panel approved each of the gathering locations. The Iowa Democratic Party initially announced a list of 99 satellite caucuses, but later nixed 12 of them, leaving a total of 87 sites. The locations were variously meant to accommodate students, workers, older people, people with disabilities, people who speak a language other than English, people wintering in another state and people living abroad. Any registered Iowa Democrat was allowed to participate. Sixty of the 87 sites were in Iowa; the rest were elsewhere in the country and at three overseas locations. Party officials set up a formula to determine how many state delegate equivalents were allotted to the satellite caucuses, based on turnout at the events (more on that below). The party said more than 1,700 people had registered for a satellite caucus, though more may have shown up on Monday. Of those who registered, officials said a significant majority were out of state or at an international site. The Sanders team appeared to make the most concerted effort among the Democratic campaigns to capitalize on the new caucus format. It employed an organizing director specifically for the satellite caucuses. And it pushed for them to be held at universities, hoping to increase turnout from the young voters who power Mr. Sanders’s base of support. The Sanders campaign was also intently focused on winning the Latino vote in the state, and appeared to be the only one with precinct captains designated for Spanish-language caucuses. A Sanders campaign adviser said that of the 483 people who attended Spanish satellite caucuses, 430 went for Mr. Sanders. The party’s published results show how Mr. Sanders was able to dominate at many of the satellite locations. At one caucus held at the Better Day Cafe in Storm Lake, Mr. Sanders was supported by 93 of the 103 participants and picked up 2.98 S.D.E.s — the largest delegate haul for any candidate from any precinct in the state. But Mr. Sanders may also be benefiting from the way the state party is allocating S.D.E.s to the satellite caucuses. Close watchers of the results have raised questions about which formula the party is using; under other interpretations of the rules, the satellite caucuses would not be quite as valuable to Mr. Sanders in the S.D.E. count. And that, too, could make all the difference in a race now separated by the thinnest of margins. Reporting was contributed by Nate Cohn, Reid J. Epstein, Lisa Lerer and Jennifer Medina.

2020,Opinion | What Barr Did for Roger Stone Is Like Nothing I’ve Seen Before,"Has the Trump Department of Justice ever asked for a lower sentence for someone who wasn’t a presidential ally? Mr. Bookbinder is the executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. After much sound and fury, Roger Stone — Trump ally, Nixon devotee and longtime political mischief-maker — was sentenced on Thursday to 40 months in federal prison for lying to Congress and witness tampering. Despite what President Trump has claimed, both the career prosecutors and the judge in the case ensured justice was served. Attorney General William Barr’s actions in the days leading up to the sentencing, on the other hand, appropriately sent a chill down the spines of prosecutors across the country. Federal prosecutors submitted their sentencing recommendation regarding Mr. Stone on Feb. 10; the following day, the Justice Department called that recommendation excessive and replaced it with a recommendation calling for “far less” imprisonment — and just after President Trump tweeted his own disapproval of the original sentencing recommendation. All four career prosecutors on the case withdrew from the matter, with one of them resigning from the department altogether — a sign of how extraordinary and unwelcome the intervention was. Mr. Barr claims the decision to seek a milder sentence was made before the tweets, but it doesn’t really matter — he and other department leaders already knew the president felt strongly that the prosecution of his ally was unfair; they knew what he wanted and were prepared to deliver on his personal and political wishes, tweets or no tweets. It’s pretty obvious that this is anti-democratic and scary. The sentence that Judge Amy Berman Jackson imposed on Mr. Stone, while lower than the guideline range that the career prosecutors recommended, is not unusual; in 2018, federal judges imposed sentences outside the guidelines in about a quarter of all cases nationwide. As Judge Jackson said in Thursday’s hearing, she made this decision based on her own assessment of the relevant facts, and she likely would have imposed a sentence below the guideline range irrespective of Mr. Barr’s intervention. This is exactly what the law requires. But an examination of federal sentencing processes and principles makes clear that Mr. Barr’s intervention in the Stone case is actually considerably worse than it initially appeared. Some background on federal sentencing: The United States Sentencing Guidelines offer guidance on what kind of penalty a convicted criminal defendant should receive based on the crime and the characteristics of the defendant. The guidelines are nonbinding, and judges are permitted to sentence above or below them. But the guidelines seek to add consistency and fairness to the federal criminal justice system so that similar defendants are treated similarly, and the Justice Department in particular has sought to hew closely to them. In fact, the Trump administration has made clear, in a document colloquially known as “the Sessions memo,” that it expects prosecutors to consistently push for guidelines sentences. “In most cases,” the Sessions memo says, “recommending a sentence within the advisory guideline range will be appropriate. Recommendations for sentencing departures or variances require supervisory approval, and the reasoning must be documented in the file.” Recommending a sentence within the guideline range was precisely what the career prosecutors in the Stone case did. They engaged in an exhaustive analysis of the applicable guidelines, supported by ample evidence and careful argument, and asked for a sentence precisely within the range called for by the guidelines. Even the Justice Department’s extraordinary decision to reverse course the next day noted that the guidelines “enhancements” — the factors that led to the original sentencing recommendation — were “perhaps technically applicable,” and prosecutors on Thursday did not dispute the applicability of those enhancements. In other words, Mr. Barr and those carrying out his wishes did not really dispute the facts and the law as carefully laid out by the career prosecutors. Instead, they presented a litany of the arguments that Mr. Stone’s own lawyers had made for ignoring the guidelines and giving him lenient treatment. So the career prosecutors made exactly the kind of recommendation prosecutors are expected to make in our system, and one that the Trump administration specifically encourages them to make. In contrast, doing what the attorney general did, calling for a sentence “far less” than that called for by the guidelines, is generally frowned upon by the Justice Department. There is one other factor that makes this move all the more extraordinary. Roger Stone did not plead guilty, cooperate or accept responsibility in any sense. He took the case to trial, showed contempt toward the justice system and disobeyed the presiding judge’s orders. In cases in which a defendant not only fights prosecution but flouts the authority of the government and the court, it is standard practice to aggressively push for a sentence at least within the advisory guideline range. As a former federal corruption prosecutor and senior staffer at the United States Sentencing Commission, I can say unequivocally that what Mr. Barr and his team did was something I have never seen before. It calls into question his fitness to play a leading role in our nation’s justice system. The top prosecutor in the land must demonstrate a commitment to protecting the rule of law, not the president and his allies. So here’s a question the Justice Department has not answered: Can it point to a single case in which the defendant was not an ally of President Trump, or someone who could testify against the president, where the department overruled career prosecutors to ask for a sentence “far less” than that called for by the sentencing guidelines in a case that went to trial? Maybe for a drug offender? For someone who broke immigration laws? I’m not expecting an answer any time soon.

2020,What Being a Mayor Taught Pete Buttigieg,"The long run Some Democratic rivals question whether Mr. Buttigieg has the experience to be president. Some key episodes in South Bend show how he struggled, learned and grew as a leader. SOUTH BEND, Ind. — The news was alarming: Children in some of South Bend’s poorest neighborhoods had a higher rate of lead poisoning than children in Flint, Mich. At a meeting of anxious parents, it was revealed that two county agencies had lost funding to help combat the poisoning. Pete Buttigieg, then the city’s mayor, did not control the agencies, but his response at the meeting still struck some as a politician passing the buck. “We have state representatives. We have a state health department. We have a new governor,” he said. “They should be hearing from our community.” Mr. Buttigieg eventually took action, after pressure by an ad hoc community group and by The South Bend Tribune, which editorialized that it was “time to get cracking” on lead. The mayor won $2.3 million from Washington to repair rundown homes with peeling paint, the cause of the lead poisoning. “His first instinct was to say, hey, we’re covering what we’re in charge of,” said Kathy Schuth, who organized the meeting of parents in January 2017 where the mayor spoke. “And his second look at it was to say, this is a big problem. And there are ways we could play a strong role.” The experience Mr. Buttigieg gained as a mayor is a central part of his pitch as a presidential candidate, but it has also recently become a bull’s-eye for some of his rivals, who are trying to undercut his momentum in the race by sowing doubts about whether he is prepared for the Oval Office. On Tuesday, Mr. Buttigieg finished a strong second in the New Hampshire primary and a week earlier he made history as the first candidate to prevail in the Iowa caucuses whose highest elected position was mayor. In both states he beat a former vice president and several other veteran politicians, in large part with a message about what he learned as the son of a struggling Midwestern city who was determined to turn it around. But his record has also been challenged by some city residents and activists, particularly on problems facing black residents, and he has had some of his toughest moments in the race trying to explain his record on policing. In a debate in New Hampshire last week, he was pressed about an increase of arrests of black people for marijuana possession during his years in office, which he struggled to explain as a collateral effect of a crackdown on violent crime. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., fighting for the same center-left voters as Mr. Buttigieg, released a digital ad ahead of New Hampshire voting openly mocking Mr. Buttigieg’s qualifications. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota compared him in the debate to President Trump: “We got a newcomer in the White House and look where it got us,” she said. If elected, Mr. Buttigieg will be 39 on Inauguration Day, the youngest American leader in history. He is well aware that, if he continues to notch victories after Iowa, there will be voters wondering if a millennial who was mayor of Indiana’s fourth-largest city is truly qualified for the presidency. A close look at some key episodes for Mr. Buttigieg shed light on how he governed, struggled and grew over his eight years in office, in particular in responding to people’s needs and frustrations. The Harvard-educated, former McKinsey consultant came into office with a technocratic approach to leadership, and some of his actions are revealing about challenges he faces today — particularly his low support among African-Americans nationally and the perception that he is most at home with his fellow elites. Mr. Buttigieg argues that as mayor, he had to produce results every day. “If there’s a problem, you don’t get to say it’s fake news and pretend that the pothole isn’t there,” he told voters in South Carolina this fall. “You gotta go out there and deal with it.” If Mr. Buttigieg has won over some voters with that emphasis on problem-solving, his experience working with a Democratic-majority city council to tackle road repair is a far cry from negotiating with a Republican-led Senate on a complex legislative agenda. No mayor has ever ascended directly to the Oval Office. South Bend’s budget is about one-sixth that of San Antonio when it was led by another Democrat who sought the nomination, Julián Castro. Rahm Emanuel, a former mayor of Chicago who served as chief of staff to President Barack Obama, said voters should not measure a candidate’s readiness for the presidency in years or previous jobs. “Nobody walks into the office on Day 1 with what they need to know, full stop,” Mr. Emanuel said. “Do you have the experience to be self-reflective, to have the capacity to grow and to have judgment, and are you secure surrounding yourself with other smart people?” Serving as America’s youngest mayor of a city over 100,000, Mr. Buttigieg grew in office, becoming a more patient listener and more respectful of those with clashing views, supporters and critics agreed in interviews. For someone who by nature runs emotionally cool, given to detailed, clinical answers when challenged, Mr. Buttigieg came to embrace that a mayor’s primary job was not to always have the factually correct answer — as in the lead paint case — but to empathize and provide inspiration. “It has been a hard thing for Pete and for his administration to not be a top-down policymaker, but to find ways of gaining authentic input from large varieties of people,” said Ms. Schuth, director of Near Northwest Neighborhood Inc., which helps low-income residents buy homes. “And I absolutely think he’s gotten better at that.” To Oliver Davis, a former South Bend city council member who often tangled with Mr. Buttigieg, the former mayor is simply too green. “He’s ready on Day 2” of a crisis, is how Mr. Davis, who supports Mr. Biden, put it. Jake Teshka, the only Republican on the South Bend city council, said that Mr. Buttigieg won his support for one initiative to address lead poisoning — requiring city inspections of rental units — over Mr. Teshka’s initial objection. “He brought in the Real Estate Investors Association, he brought tenants’ rights groups — folks from the far right, far left, he brought them to the table,” Mr. Teshka said. “We got down and dirty with it and the mayor was supportive through the whole thing.” Mr. Teshka said Mr. Buttigieg had more relevant governing experience than either of the past two presidents, having managed more than 1,000 city employees and reached out to opponents to get things done. “Objectively speaking and removing partisanship, I’d say, look, it’s more scalable than being a reality TV star,” he said. One morning in 2013, in his first term, Mr. Buttigieg arrived at work in the County-City Building, his body braced against the whoosh of five lanes of one-way traffic. “It’s always bothered me we have this racetrack downtown,” he told his senior staff. Streets in the central city were designed to speed drivers to homes and shopping in the suburbs. Mr. Buttigieg believed a revival of South Bend, which Newsweek had named a “dying city,” should start with the urban core. His Smart Streets initiative proposed converting central thoroughfares to allow two-way traffic, and adding bicycle lanes, trees and on-street parking, all to slow vehicles and encourage pedestrians. The project was debated through 28 public meetings over two years, many of them heated, as Mr. Buttigieg and allies pitched Smart Streets as an investment that would ignite growth. Opponents called the $25 million project an expensive folly. “There was a lot of resistance because he was spending a lot of city money,” said Mark Neal, a former city controller. “People said the streets are perfectly fine.” Smart Streets finally passed the once-recalcitrant council. Big real estate projects flowed: the conversion of empty office buildings to residential lofts, a makeover of an abandoned Studebaker factory, a new Marriott Aloft hotel in the city’s tallest building that might have become a tear-down. There was more than $100 million in private investment, according to the city, though some of it might have happened anyway as South Bend emerged from the Great Recession. Today, about 1,000 people live downtown compared to virtually zero when Mr. Buttigieg took office. Jeff Rea, president of the South Bend Regional Chamber of Commerce, said Mr. Buttigieg earned the support of business people, many of them Republicans. “He’s been able to get folks who in theory should oppose him on partisan ideological grounds to the table over shared goals in terms of economic progress and improved sense of pride and momentum,” Mr. Rea said. One developer, Frank Perri, recalled that Mr. Buttigieg reached out to him about a downtown parcel he owned on the St. Joseph River that had sat empty for more than a decade. “What do we have to do to make this happen?” the mayor asked. Mr. Perri repeated what he had told earlier mayors without success: He wanted the city to build underground parking on the site. Mr. Buttigieg agreed. The city provided a $5 million incentive. Mr. Perri’s seven-story glass-wrapped building, the Cascade, is set to open soon with condos starting at $625,000. “It will pay off in spades in taxes,” Mr. Perri said. “As far as I’m concerned, he’s the reason South Bend is coming around,” he said of Mr. Buttigieg. But drive a few blocks west of downtown, into poor and largely black and Hispanic neighborhoods, and there are no $625,000 condos. You see many crumbling houses and empty storefronts instead. Prosperity has not been shared equally in South Bend, a source of criticism and resentment by some in minority communities. “It’s hard for me to say this is a turnaround city,” Regina Williams-Preston, a former member of the council, said in an interview last spring as Mr. Buttigieg was officially starting his presidential bid. Mr. Buttigieg’s major initiative for low-income neighborhoods was attacking blight by bulldozing vacant and abandoned houses. Postindustrial South Bend, like many Rust Belt cities, had lost nearly a quarter of its population. The West Side especially was dotted with empty houses that attracted squatters and crime. Setting an ambitious goal to address 1,000 houses in 1,000 days, Mr. Buttigieg was able to meet it two years later, in September 2015, ahead of schedule. According to the city, none of the demolished houses were occupied. Some critics said the city reached its target by too aggressively issuing code violations, and when poor landlords could not pay, calling in the bulldozer. “Our housing stock is being demolished and there’s no program to replace it with affordable housing,” said Henry Davis Jr., a black member of the city council. Stacey Odom, a resident of the West Side, was working on a rundown house she had bought for about $6,000 when she learned it was on the list to be demolished. Ms. Odom, who hoped to move into the house, staked out the County-City Building. When she spotted Mr. Buttigieg walking with other officials, she jumped out of her car. “I told him I am having all of these problems with the City of South Bend wanting to tear down houses,” Ms. Odom said. “He was with a group of people and they were not happy that he took the time to stop and speak with me. But he still stayed there and listened to everything I had to say. He said, ‘Well, we can work on that together.’” Ms. Odom got her home off the demolition list by showing she was slowly fixing it up. She credits Mr. Buttigieg with listening to people like her and adjusting the city’s policy from tearing down houses to rehabilitating many of them. The city introduced a series of home repair programs that currently award $1 million to homeowners. “He’s a person willing to change, willing to listen, willing to work with you and make things better,” Ms. Odom said. The question of whether the mayor improved the lives of poor minority residents of South Bend is complicated. For his presidential campaign, Mr. Buttigieg’s team released a sweeping program known as the Douglass Plan last summer, aimed at addressing structural racism in America. But it rings hollow to some at home because he did not always live by its promises there. Federal data shows that poverty for black households citywide dropped by six percentage points from Mr. Buttigieg’s first year in office through 2018, compared to a 2.3 percent drop nationally. Yet, while the Douglass Plan calls for directing 25 percent of federal contracts to companies with black and women owners, in South Bend, a city-commissioned study found that between 2015 and 2017, no city contracts went to black-owned businesses. Supporters of the mayor in the black community said African-American poverty has long persisted in South Bend, but Mr. Buttigieg was the first mayor to pay for studies to fully expose it, which led to policies aimed at a solution. The “disparity study” of city contracting noted that 12 percent of contracts went to firms owned by women and minorities other than African-Americans. It prodded the city to pass an ordinance to raise contracts with minority- and women-owned firms to 15 percent. Sharon McBride, a black council member and Buttigieg supporter, said the former mayor’s plan to revive the downtown ahead of residential neighborhoods was the right call. “In order to live, your heart has to function,” she said. “If you don’t have businesses coming in to sustain revenue, you can’t thrive. And now we are a thriving city.” For all of Mr. Buttigieg’s focus on the economy and housing, his time as mayor remains defined in the eye of the nation by his management of the police. Perhaps the most searing crisis he handled in office came last summer after the fatal shooting of Eric Logan, a black resident, by a white officer. At a chaotic community meeting, residents called on the mayor to fire the police chief. When a representative of the Rev. Al Sharpton tried to speak, the crowd booed him down, saying this was a South Bend affair. Mr. Davis, the former council member, said the outbursts reflected years of frustration by some black residents over Mr. Buttigieg’s oversight of the police, including his demotion of a black chief and the failure to increase diversity among officers. But Mr. Davis also praised the mayor for directly engaging with anguished residents. “In many cities — you’ve seen the Ferguson, Missouris — you didn’t have city leaders there in the heart of it,” he said. Days after the shooting, community members gathered on the basketball court of the Martin Luther King Jr. Center to share stories about the toll of gun violence in minority neighborhoods, as city officials listened. “I was watching Pete and he was listening, he was really concerned about people as individuals — in their take, in their experience of what has gone on,” said Tim Scott, president of the city council. “I think he saw it in probably a little more visceral way than he has ever before.” “Sometimes you’ve got to take a few cuts to understand what’s going on, and he did that,” he said. “I’ve seen Pete grow in the eight years he’s been here: better outreach, better communication within the African-American community.” Many black leaders in South Bend said their former mayor’s standing among minority residents has been distorted as he stepped onto the national stage, with a handful of dissident voices from the city providing an echo chamber in the news and on social media. In December, pushing back, a group of black South Bend leaders — council members, pastors and the president of the local N.A.A.C.P. — held a public forum to dispute what they called the false narrative of Mr. Buttigieg’s lack of minority support at home. “I have no idea where all this I-don’t-like-Pete attitude came from,” said Muhammad Shabazz II, a county employee. Mr. Shabazz used to set up lemonade stands with other community activists at scenes of gun violence, to get residents and victims’ family members to talk to one another. “Every time we did one of these things, Pete would somehow find his way there,” he said. In a bizarre scene, a protester seized the mic at the black leaders’ forum and demanded, “Who chose these black leaders?” while an older woman raised her cane to shoo him away. The protester, who wore a Black Lives Matter shirt, was a supporter of Senator Bernie Sanders. Days later, a founder of the Black Lives Matter group in South Bend, Jorden Giger, held a rally for Mr. Sanders at which Mr. Buttigieg was denounced. Nonetheless, Mr. Giger said in an interview that if Mr. Buttigieg becomes the nominee, he would vote for him. “He can be pushed,” he said. “It takes him a while to get there, but he can be pushed.” Updated Feb. 29, 2020",The New York Times
2020,What Companies Are Telling Employees About the Coronavirus,"Get an informed guide to the global outbreak with our daily Coronavirus

 Want this in your inbox each morning? Sign up here.) President Trump said yesterday that Vice President Mike Pence would coordinate the government’s response to the coronavirus. Despite mounting criticism, the president has played down the danger of a widespread U.S. outbreak, the NYT reports. Stocks are down again today, with U.S. futures suggesting that a sixth consecutive daily decline awaits. Wall Street strategists say the situation could get worse before it gets better. Yet shares in companies that cater to people staying home are outperforming — think disinfectants (Clorox), canned food (Campbell Soup), exercise equipment (Peloton) and videoconferencing tools (Zoom) — as are others like drug makers developing vaccines (Gilead) and gold miners who dig up the stuff hoarded by people freaked out about the economy (Newmont Mining). Companies are restricting travel and sending workers home, and rapidly reducing their expectations for sales at any business that relies on China as a buyer or supplier. (Microsoft is one of the latest to sound the alarm.) Quarantines and travel bans are particularly bad for deal makers who rely on in-person schmoozing, with bankers prevented from meeting clients. The problem goes beyond Asia — although it’s especially acute there. We’ll get a better view of the economic impact soon, and analyst forecasts for data releases due in the coming days are all over the place. Chinese officials are under pressure to rev up factories and get workers moving again, while some European authorities are questioning the region’s open-border policies. In a WSJ opinion piece, Kevin Warsh, a former Fed governor who is considered a front-runner to lead the U.S. central bank if Mr. Trump is re-elected, floated the idea for a coordinated global series of rate cuts to “make the most of scarce policy ammunition.” For more on the coronavirus — much, much more — subscribe to the NYT’s new Coronavirus Briefing email, with the latest developments and expert advice on prevention and treatment. In an industry obsessed with blockbusters, Disney’s choice for its next C.E.O., Bob Chapek, lacks star power. Mr. Chapek, the company veteran who currently runs its theme parks and cruise ships, is largely unknown in much of Hollywood, the NYT’s Brooks Barnes reports. Getting to know Bob C., as he’s called within Disney: Although he isn’t a fixture in TV and movie circles — unlike his charismatic predecessor, Bob Iger — Mr. Chapek isn’t as surprising a choice to take over the House of Mouse as it may seem. Retail titans are big fans, stemming from Mr. Chapek’s stints as head of Disney’s DVD and consumer products businesses. This is a good sign for Disney as it pivots to selling content directly to consumers via its nascent streaming service instead of relying on cable networks. Updated Feb. 26, 2020 • Doug McMillon, Walmart’s C.E.O., said, “Bob has always been someone we can trust to deliver on what he says.” • Brian Cornell, Target’s chief, said Mr. Chapek had a “deep understanding of what Disney fans really love about their brand.” Brooks wraps it up for us: The timing of the announcement feels suspicious to a lot of people. Something else has to be afoot, right? But everyone I talked to inside and outside of the company, including people who are not fans of Bob Iger (they exist), insisted that nothing prompted this beyond a need to get succession moving — Disney’s annual meeting is March 11 — and that the handoff is less abrupt than it seems at first blush. Mr. Iger is not going anywhere for another 22 months. Full stop. He will be overseeing all of Disney’s “creative endeavors,” which is basically everything that really matters, as executive chairman. Bob Chapek essentially has training wheels on for the next two years. Why not just elevate Mr. Chapek to chief operating officer or president, two jobs that currently don’t exist at Disney and would signal that he is the heir apparent? Because that has not worked out particularly well for Mr. Iger in the past. He chose that route for Thomas O. Staggs, who ended up leaving the company in 2016. It’s really hard to shine when you have no direct reports and a larger-than-life boss. People also forget that Mr. Iger’s run as president of Disney under then-C.E.O. Michael Eisner was torturous at times. Mr. Iger sometimes found himself undercut by division leaders, who would go straight to Mr. Eisner. By making Mr. Chapek chief executive right out of the gate, that kind of end run is harder. Tensions among several of SoftBank’s senior executives are well known. But a striking new WSJ report on alleged efforts by the head of its Vision Fund, Rajeev Misra, to discredit internal rivals is on another level. The WSJ reports that an associate of Mr. Misra’s tried to spy on rivals, including by obtaining and then leaking private bank statements. One purported scheme involved trying to entrap an executive in a sex scandal. A representative for Mr. Misra told us: “These are old allegations which contain a series of falsehoods that have been consistently denied. Mr. Misra did not orchestrate a campaign against his former colleagues.” But a spokeswoman for SoftBank said the company would be “reviewing the inferences made by The Wall Street Journal.” Common wisdom is that individual investors have no hope of beating institutional money managers. But Luke Kawa of Bloomberg Businessweek reports on how traders on Reddit’s freewheeling WallStreetBets forum — who go by names like “yolo_tron” — are changing the game. What they’re doing: swamping the market with call options, hoping to force market makers to buy the underlying stock, and exponentially increasing the value of those options (which give them the right to buy stocks at a fixed price). The big idea: The do-it-yourself traders of r/WSB are waging a kind of guerrilla warfare in the markets, trying to exploit what they see as weaknesses in the system to move prices where they want them. For anyone who wondered about where the small day traders who made the 1990s so wild went, meet the 2020 version. After years of indifference, individual investors seem to be finding their way back to stocks, for better or worse. They’re flexing muscles in ways that can easily call to mind excesses from the dot-com era. Many Trump administration policies are aimed at restricting immigration. But at a private event in Britain last week, the acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, said that immigrants were key to America’s future growth, according to the NYT’s Jeanna Smialek and Zolan Kanno-Youngs. “We are desperate, desperate for more people,” Mr. Mulvaney told a crowd, according to an audio recording given to The NYT. “We are running out of people to fuel the economic growth,” he added — though he said he wanted more immigrants only in a “legal” fashion. Although President Trump has described the country as “full,” slow population growth in the native-born U.S. work force means immigration will be needed to propel the economy. Immigrants accounted for about half of the labor force’s expansion over the past two decades. In an interview with NBC’s new Byers Market podcast, Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook outlined the tech giant’s plan to defend itself against rising public skepticism and political inquiries. • “There is growing concern, which is based on a lack of understanding, that we are using people’s information in a bad way — we are selling it, we are giving it away, we are violating it. None of that’s true. We do not sell data.” • “Here’s what we do: We take your information and we show you personalized ads,” she said, in order to give users “a much better experience.” OK, but ... “I’m going to give a big speech next month,” Ms. Sandberg said. “And I’m working on an op-ed. We need to go out and explain the business model clearly.” We’ll see. Deals • L Brands took a $700 million write-down after selling a majority stake in Victoria’s Secret.

2020,Opinion | What Did We Learn in Iowa?,"transcript I’m Michelle Goldberg. I’m Ross Douthat. I’m David Leonhardt, and this is “The Argument.” This week, what the heck happened in Iowa? We’re sleepwalking into this scenario where we all have to take this giant risk. Then how worried should we be about coronavirus, and what does it say about China? There is a story here of like this is how China blows up the world. And finally, a recommendation. You kind of understand just how big it’s going to become and just how politically influential it’s going to become in the way that she, the character, doesn’t. This year’s Iowa caucus was a mess. There were technical problems, which meant the state didn’t release any vote counts on Monday night, and everyone was left confused about the state of the Democratic race. We are taping this on Tuesday afternoon when it seems that Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg did best in Iowa, followed by Elizabeth Warren, and today we’re going to talk about both the race and about Iowa’s role in the process. Let’s start with the race itself. Michelle, you spent much of last week in Iowa working at the beginning and then getting sick at the end of the week, I’m sorry to hear. But Ross and I are interested to hear what you found when you were still up and about going to rallies. So yeah, I started out the week in Iowa going mainly to Bernie Sanders rallies. Although I also followed Pete a little bit. And then I got really sick, spent three days in my hotel room with the flu, waiting to be well enough to fly home. Little did I know that that was a portent of how everything in Iowa was going to go. But I mean, I guess what I saw with Bernie is that he has a movement behind him, maybe alone among all these candidates so we have this almost total bifurcation in the party between where the grassroots and where the energy is and where the kind of cultural ferment is. I mean, people even joking about Bernie-palooza because you had all these indie bands coming into Iowa to play Bernie rallies and then all the institutional support and all the kind of establishment of the party on the other side. It’s interesting, Ross, you’ve been talking about this notion that Biden would be the figure who’s got 25 percent support and benefits from a fractured field, but it’s also possible that Bernie is going to be that figure. Yeah. I mean, I think, again, based on what we think we know about Iowa’s results, and what we think we know is that Biden badly underperformed his polls. So far, the evidence from Iowa — and I use the term evidence loosely — is that maybe the pundit instinct was right, and this was Michelle’s instinct, certainly, since she’s the one of us who’s been out the most in the field. My basic sense is that you have to analyze the Iowa results in terms of the results themselves, and in terms of how they interact with the, pardon my language, there’s no other word but shit show to describe what happened. But to have this combination of him near the top, Biden apparently collapsing, and then this haze of confusion over the whole process, I think, yes, that sets him up pretty well to keep running his 20 percent to 25 percent campaign. So I think the combination of the fiasco and the outcome is pretty good for Bernie. I guess I want to argue against the Biden collapsing thesis because we know Biden is strongest among African-American voters, and we know he’s also pretty strong among Latino voters, and Iowa is an almost all white state. And so the idea that he underperformed in Iowa — and he certainly seems to have, I’m not saying otherwise — to me, you can’t actually say all that much about what this means until we get more diverse States voting. And it’s why as I reflected on what happened in Iowa, I realized I was actually happy about it. Because I don’t really know what I’m rooting for from this field, but I definitely am rooting for Iowa given all of its idiosyncrasies not to be picking the nominee. And I’m not convinced Biden is collapsing. But David, if you look at the polls, he’s also really starting to tank — I don’t know if tank is the right word, but he’s going down in South Carolina, certainly, compared to Bernie. And so I mean, I find myself just livid, livid at the Biden campaign, at whatever parts of the establishment urged him to get in because it seems like they’ve foisted this zombie candidacy on the party where he had enough name recognition and kind of stature to suck away oxygen from less well-known candidates, but not enough energy and, frankly, capability to bring it home. He’s put the party in this really terrible position where there aren’t that many moderate alternatives, and so it seems very likely that Bernie is going to run away with this and then lose. I mean Michelle, I’m sort of struck by how despairing you sound at the prospect of Bernie rumbling, stumbling, tumbling his way to the nomination. Do you feel like — have you bought in to the thesis, which is not a crazy thesis, that he’s going to lose to Trump? There are polls out there that show him doing relatively well against Trump. There are also polls about the unpopularity of socialism and large numbers of people saying they wouldn’t vote for a socialist. And I think we don’t know yet whether people know that Bernie identifies as Democratic socialist and discounts it or whether they just don’t know. Again, the polls show that Bernie could do well. I have enormous trepidation particularly about some of the districts like upscale suburban women voters who are not Bernie’s base. And I would also say that early reports show that turnout wasn’t great in the Iowa caucuses, which cuts against the claim that Bernie is going to be able to bring a lot more people into the process. That’s one of the rationales for his campaign, the argument that what they lose in upscale suburbanites they will win in this sort of remade electorate. Speaking of those moderate districts, Michelle, Jonathan Chait in New York Magazine had this, I thought, devastating list of quotes from people on the left in the Democratic Party heading into the midterms, where they basically said, look at all these moderate candidates who inspire no one. They can’t win. And basically, all those moderate candidates won in the midterms, and many of the Bernie-type left candidates lost. Call it the establishment, call it moderate Democrats, whatever choice you want, it looks pretty bad. I mean, you’re set up right now going into New Hampshire with Pete Buttigieg, who is a very talented guy, but also a somewhat ridiculous figure as a candidate for president of the United States as the not Biden alternative to Sanders, Amy Klobuchar, who I think we both agreed would have made a more plausible Democratic nominee, especially for those districts and those suburban female voters that Michelle is talking about, is pretty much knocked out by her performance. And so you’ve got Buttigieg who shows no capacity to win minority votes yet. You’ve got Michael Bloomberg lurking. Who’s the moderate candidate who emerges out of this, not just to beat Trump, but in a way that consolidates the party and doesn’t create some kind of total meltdown? It’s Bloomberg. OK. This is all setting up quite well for Bloomberg. It is. So let me make the case, and you guys can mock it. Look, Bloomberg got in the race when Biden looked at his weakest, and then when Biden seemed to rebound over the last few months, Bloomberg’s chances looked nil. I mean, if Biden does well, Bloomberg’s finished. But if the two of you are right, that Biden is in something that looks like a freefall rather than my being right that we can’t know so long as pretty much only white people are voting, I agree with you. I don’t think Buttigieg and Klobuchar have a very good path. I mean, you look at their polling in South Carolina and among African Americans more broadly, and it’s still horrific. Most young people are voting either for Bernie or for Warren. Can you imagine a scenario more calculated to make them cynical and to cause them to withdraw from this race? Nope, that’s the big downside. You’ve got a rich guy basically buying the nomination to some extent. I mean, obviously, not totally. He’d be winning votes in this scenario as well. But I think in that scenario, you do have a significant number of people who stay home or don’t vote, and that’s the risk in that scenario. And the question is, even if Bloomberg isn’t well suited to actually capture the American center as we talk about all the time, the actual American Center is to Bloomberg’s left on economics and well to his right on social issues. Americans don’t really make decisions based on white papers and adding up all the issues, and Bloomberg seems moderate. And so basically, what Bloomberg would need to do is run a version — and this is Biden’s strategy too, for that matter — run a version of the 2018 campaign where you get enough enthusiasm from younger people and more progressive voters just from an anti-Trump perspective and then you win those suburban moderates handily. I don’t think it’s impossible for Bloomberg to beat Trump, head to head. I guess what I see though looking forward is, when does the field consolidate to make it Bloomberg against Bernie? Because Buttigieg is going to say that he won or quasi won Iowa. He’s going to do pretty well in New Hampshire, presumably. So he’s going to say, look, I’m the moderate alternative here. Warren, presumably OK in Iowa will presumably do OK in New Hampshire, and if it’s this sort of scramble with delegate accumulation, there’s every reason for her to stay in. And it just seems like the most likely thing then is you’re headed for a scenario where Bloomberg is accumulating delegates for a contested convention. And for Bloomberg or anyone to hope to win it at a contested convention, I mean, it just seems like an epic world historical nightmare. If Bernie goes into the convention having won more states than anyone else and with a plurality of delegates and the plan is for Michael Bloomberg to have come in and won a ton of delegates to deny him the nomination, that’s not going to happen, right? No, it can’t happen. And especially if you assume that another block of delegates in that scenario belongs to Elizabeth Warren. Right? Right. Her and Bernie, the most likely scenario is that they combine forces. I mean, that’s the thing. I don’t see any good ending to this fiasco that Democrats seem to have sleepwalked into. I mean, we all have to just take this giant risk and hope that the young people whose time may have come knows what they’re doing. Well, Michelle, I think that’s basically one of the two cases for optimism, which is that politics is really hard to predict, and there are a bunch of reasons to think that Bernie actually might be a pretty good candidate to take on Trump. And so maybe he gets the nomination, and he’s able to win. And I think you and I both would not be super alarmed at the idea of a Bernie presidency. No, I’d be thrilled. No, don’t get me wrong, the idea of a Bernie presidency would be wonderful. Yeah. And then I think the second case for optimism is that whether it’s Biden being stronger than he looks in an all-white State or Bloomberg or emerging, unlikely as that may seem, that it still could be a more moderate nominee. And then I guess the third thing is just some kind of surprise, which is Warren stages a comeback, Buttigieg somehow gains support among African Americans, but the first two to me seem to be the most likely more optimistic cases for the Democrats. And the interesting thing is it feels like actually New Hampshire isn’t going to move this race that much because all the signs are that Bernie is going to win, and so then it’s still going to be roughly where we are about a week from now. Does that feel right to both of you? I mean, I think, again, depending on what comes out of the results, it could be a boost either for Pete or for Warren if one of them starts to look more viable based on what comes out of Iowa. Yeah. I think New Hampshire could do a lot to tell us whether Buttigieg has staying power and whether, as Michelle said, Warren can mount a comeback and present herself, again, as an alternative to the Bernie-Biden, or Bernie and Bloomberg showdown. But I guess I agree with you, David in the sense I think South Carolina now is huge because it’s the first place that tells us — I mean, Nevada too. The Nevada-South Carolina combination tells us basically one, is Biden still viable, and two, if he’s not, where do minority voters go? So let’s leave it there, and take a quick break, and we’ll be right back. Coronavirus has spread from the Chinese city of Wuhan to more than 20 countries around the world. Thousands of people have been infected, and several hundred have already died. In China and elsewhere, people have added a new item to their winter wardrobe — a face mask. The virus has raised serious public health questions, but I want to start with a more personal question for each of you, Ross and Michelle, how scared are you personally about this virus? Ross? Most of the time, not incredibly scared, but every few days, there will be — this is the wonders of social media, right — there will be some extremely long Twitter thread by some extremely competent-sounding person making the case that this is all vastly worse than public health authorities want you to believe. And not that we’re all going to die, but there will be some sort of major panic in the United States in Western Europe over this within the next few weeks that will shut down schools and cities and basically, bring the Chinese situation to the Western world. And I think that’s my biggest fear right now, not for my own life or the lives of my children, but that the spread will create conditions in our societies like conditions in China even if the actual death toll doesn’t get that high. What about you, Michelle? I mean, look, I have the flu. I am just getting over it. The flu is like a more serious disease by many accounts. It kills a lot more people than coronavirus. And so like, Ross, I don’t really have any fear about it for myself or my family. I certainly don’t trust this administration to manage a public health emergency. It’s interesting. I mean, in some ways, it’s the common theme between our two subjects this week, which is different kinds of institutional breakdown. And I’ve been really interested to see how these public health crises are different for China than almost anything else. It’s just much harder for them to bulldoze public opinion and just tell people that red is green and green is red because people are experiencing it themselves and the stakes are so high. Yeah. I mean, I think there’s a general fog that surrounds the Chinese situation that I think is just fundamentally different and unique to a totalitarian regime. There aren’t the basic structures of social control in America that in turn create incentives to what you might call the Chernobyl incentives, the incentives to avoid reckoning with a problem in the hopes that it goes away and to clamp down on information streams and then just leave this basic open question. There’s no reason right now, I think, for anyone outside China to trust the information flow that we have from China right now. Although it’s actually very different than Chernobyl. I mean, they’re certainly not underplaying the severity of this. The kind of scale of the response and the intensity of the response must be itself kind of a cause for panic. You kind of think is there something even bigger here given that they’ve basically shut down the world’s biggest economy, put whole megacities under lockdown. Michelle, you were just in Iowa, and David, a little bit before that, you took an extended trip to China, right? I did. And this was well before the coronavirus outbreak started, and you came back and wrote a column that I thought was pretty optimistic about the basic stability of Chinese societies, sort of abstracting from moral questions about the obvious wickedness of the regime, you emphasized in the 10 years since you’d last been there the growth of a pretty stable and optimistic middle class. And I mean, how does that feeling that you got to interact with something like this? Yeah. And I think your description of that column is fair. I think I was pretty optimistic on behalf of China’s power, if not on behalf of what it meant for the world. I mean, look, I think there are two clear risks to China’s ascent as a world power, but the first is a subject, Ross, you’ve written about, which is this massive coming demographic decline, the fact that the one child policy is going to leave them with an aging society that’s going to be really problematic for the future. And then I think the second risk is one that coronavirus really highlights, which is having authoritarian countries where you put no or little value on truth and the number one priority is keeping people in line, the number one domestic priority, can really create serious vulnerabilities, and a public health crisis may be the most serious of those. And so I still look at China and I say, here’s a country that on most measures of what it cares about, its ability to project military power in the Pacific, the diversification of its economy, its ability to produce, actually, innovative companies like TikTok, by all those measures, China really has had quite a good decade, and the United States, the country it’s chasing, has had a pretty bad decade. But it’s definitely the case that this isn’t just a public health crisis, but it also really highlights what is a huge problem with authoritarianism, not just the moral part of it, which is the biggest problem with it, but the kind of brass tacks does it work problem? Yeah, I mean, it seems to me like it is simultaneously a case study in how you could imagine the Chinese regime falling, that you have some internal disaster that basically produces a crisis of confidence that becomes impossible for the regime to manage. And I think that’s a pretty remote possibility overall, and I think one of the lessons of the last 20 years is just that there is much more stability to a certain kind of authoritarian quasi capitalism than 1989 and 1991 made people assume. But still, I think you can see in this how, if that happened, how it would happen. And then related to that, I mean, there’s also the more apocalyptic thing, and I’ll wax apocalyptic a little bit. Like there is a story here of like this is how China blows up the world, right? That you have this incredibly large, incredibly bound into the global economy hub that becomes the obvious vector for the kind of black swan scenarios that we worry about when we worry about the actual fate of human civilization. And that’s not going to be this virus, but the combination of authoritarian control, deep complexity. You started asking how worried we are. I think this is an event that reasonably triggers some deeper worries than just what’s the balance of power between the U.S. and China. I do think the darkest scenario involves the problems with the current version of China, which is China is so much more powerful today than when Mao ran it and so much more connected to the rest of the world. And so you really could see whether it’s a war or a pandemic. You really could see how China’s refusal to admit this was a problem when it first broke out, the fact that they punished doctors who were saying we’ve got a problem here rather than actually taking quick action, you really can see how China’s problems can impact the world much more than they did a half century ago. Well, I guess now that I’ve talked you into being as unreasonably grim as I am, David, we should just leave it there. Fair enough. Fair enough. And now it’s time for our weekly recommendation, when we make a suggestion that is meant to take your mind off of the grim news of the day. Michelle, this week is your turn. I’m not sure if you have cold remedies or something else for us, but what is your recommendation? Well, it’s not necessarily going to take your mind off the grim news of the day, but a couple of weeks ago I was working on this piece that I was calling “The End of the Future.” I think it ended up being called “The Darkness Where the Future Should Be.” And there was a book I read for that piece, which is the new memoir, “Uncanny Valley” by Anna Wiener. It’s a memoir of a young woman who goes to work in the tech industry and at first half buys in to the utopian culture around Silicon Valley and gradually becomes more jaded as the pernicious effects of Silicon Valley become more and more manifest in the world. And so it’s just like a really, really compelling kind of coming of age book that feels very zeitgeisty, but also penetrating look at the hubris and self-mythologizing around all of these big technology companies that are now in addition to breaking the entire world have also now broken the Iowa caucuses. Independent of the utter destruction of human flourishing being visited on the world by Silicon Valley, I’m very curious/fascinated by the gender dynamics. I mean, does the book— Yeah. I mean, the book is actually pretty startling in how bad it is to be a young woman at these companies. I mean, I think that there’s this idea out there that all of these companies are bending over backwards to be politically correct. And I think one of the things that you see, at least through her eyes, is that the definition of politically correct just means kind of not rampant sexual harassment and pay disparities and gender-race put downs. And then you kind of see the extreme resentment bubbling up of men who have to abide by even these minimal standards of even gesture to gender equality or gesture to a non-hostile workplace. And one of the themes of the book is that you see the alt right start to bubble up in these various message boards that she’s on. And you understand in this horror movie kind of way just how big it’s going to become and just how politically influential it’s going to become in a way that she, the character, doesn’t. Michelle, what’s the recommendation? The book is “Uncanny Valley” by Anna Wiener. Thank you. That’s our show for this week. Thank you so much for listening.

Green for Transmitter Media and edited by Sara Nics. Our executive producer is Gretta Cohn. We had help, as we always do, from Tyson Evans, Phoebe Lett, Ian Prasad Philbrick, and Francis Ying. Our theme was composed by Allison Leyton-Brown. We’ll see you back here next week. You could not invent a fiasco more calculated to illustrate, for instance, Michelle’s anxieties about how lousy technology and institutional failure are intersecting. I mean, we’ve got this app that comes from these companies named Shadow and Acronym, like it’s just— I mean, it’s just absurd. transcript I’m Michelle Goldberg. I’m Ross Douthat. I’m David Leonhardt, and this is “The Argument.” This week, what the heck happened in Iowa? We’re sleepwalking into this scenario where we all have to take this giant risk.

And I’m not convinced Biden is collapsing. But David, if you look at the polls, he’s also really starting to tank — I don’t know if tank is the right word, but he’s going down in South Carolina, certainly, compared to Bernie. And so I mean, I find myself just livid, livid at the Biden campaign, at whatever parts of the establishment urged him to get in because it seems like they’ve foisted this zombie candidacy on the party where he had enough name recognition and kind of stature to suck away oxygen from less well-known candidates, but not enough energy and, frankly, capability to bring it home. He’s put the party in this really terrible position where there aren’t that many moderate alternatives, and so it seems very likely that Bernie is going to run away with this and then lose. I mean Michelle, I’m sort of struck by how despairing you sound at the prospect of Bernie rumbling, stumbling, tumbling his way to the nomination. Do you feel like — have you bought in to the thesis, which is not a crazy thesis, that he’s going to lose to Trump? There are polls out there that show him doing relatively well against Trump. There are also polls about the unpopularity of socialism and large numbers of people saying they wouldn’t vote for a socialist. And I think we don’t know yet whether people know that Bernie identifies as Democratic socialist and discounts it or whether they just don’t know. Again, the polls show that Bernie could do well. I have enormous trepidation particularly about some of the districts like upscale suburban women voters who are not Bernie’s base. And I would also say that early reports show that turnout wasn’t great in the Iowa caucuses, which cuts against the claim that Bernie is going to be able to bring a lot more people into the process. That’s one of the rationales for his campaign, the argument that what they lose in upscale suburbanites they will win in this sort of remade electorate. Speaking of those moderate districts, Michelle, Jonathan Chait in New York Magazine had this, I thought, devastating list of quotes from people on the left in the Democratic Party heading into the midterms, where they basically said, look at all these moderate candidates who inspire no one. They can’t win. And basically, all those moderate candidates won in the midterms, and many of the Bernie-type left candidates lost. Call it the establishment, call it moderate Democrats, whatever choice you want, it looks pretty bad. I mean, you’re set up right now going into New Hampshire with Pete Buttigieg, who is a very talented guy, but also a somewhat ridiculous figure as a candidate for president of the United States as the not Biden alternative to Sanders, Amy Klobuchar, who I think we both agreed would have made a more plausible Democratic nominee, especially for those districts and those suburban female voters that Michelle is talking about, is pretty much knocked out by her performance. And so you’ve got Buttigieg who shows no capacity to win minority votes yet. You’ve got Michael Bloomberg lurking. Who’s the moderate candidate who emerges out of this, not just to beat Trump, but in a way that consolidates the party and doesn’t create some kind of total meltdown? It’s Bloomberg. OK. This is all setting up quite well for Bloomberg. It is. So let me make the case, and you guys can mock it. Look, Bloomberg got in the race when Biden looked at his weakest, and then when Biden seemed to rebound over the last few months, Bloomberg’s chances looked nil. I mean, if Biden does well, Bloomberg’s finished. But if the two of you are right, that Biden is in something that looks like a freefall rather than my being right that we can’t know so long as pretty much only white people are voting, I agree with you. I don’t think Buttigieg and Klobuchar have a very good path. I mean, you look at their polling in South Carolina and among African Americans more broadly, and it’s still horrific. Most young people are voting either for Bernie or for Warren. Can you imagine a scenario more calculated to make them cynical and to cause them to withdraw from this race? Nope, that’s the big downside. You’ve got a rich guy basically buying the nomination to some extent. I mean, obviously, not totally. He’d be winning votes in this scenario as well. But I think in that scenario, you do have a significant number of people who stay home or don’t vote, and that’s the risk in that scenario. And the question is, even if Bloomberg isn’t well suited to actually capture the American center as we talk about all the time, the actual American Center is to Bloomberg’s left on economics and well to his right on social issues. Americans don’t really make decisions based on white papers and adding up all the issues, and Bloomberg seems moderate. And so basically, what Bloomberg would need to do is run a version — and this is Biden’s strategy too, for that matter — run a version of the 2018 campaign where you get enough enthusiasm from younger people and more progressive voters just from an anti-Trump perspective and then you win those suburban moderates handily. I don’t think it’s impossible for Bloomberg to beat Trump, head to head. I guess what I see though looking forward is, when does the field consolidate to make it Bloomberg against Bernie? Because Buttigieg is going to say that he won or quasi won Iowa. He’s going to do pretty well in New Hampshire, presumably. So he’s going to say, look, I’m the moderate alternative here. Warren, presumably OK in Iowa will presumably do OK in New Hampshire, and if it’s this sort of scramble with delegate accumulation, there’s every reason for her to stay in. And it just seems like the most likely thing then is you’re headed for a scenario where Bloomberg is accumulating delegates for a contested convention. And for Bloomberg or anyone to hope to win it at a contested convention, I mean, it just seems like an epic world historical nightmare. If Bernie goes into the convention having won more states than anyone else and with a plurality of delegates and the plan is for Michael Bloomberg to have come in and won a ton of delegates to deny him the nomination, that’s not going to happen, right? No, it can’t happen. And especially if you assume that another block of delegates in that scenario belongs to Elizabeth Warren. Right? Right. Her and Bernie, the most likely scenario is that they combine forces. I mean, that’s the thing. I don’t see any good ending to this fiasco that Democrats seem to have sleepwalked into. I mean, we all have to just take this giant risk and hope that the young people whose time may have come knows what they’re doing. Well, Michelle, I think that’s basically one of the two cases for optimism, which is that politics is really hard to predict, and there are a bunch of reasons to think that Bernie actually might be a pretty good candidate to take on Trump. And so maybe he gets the nomination, and he’s able to win. And I think you and I both would not be super alarmed at the idea of a Bernie presidency. No, I’d be thrilled. No, don’t get me wrong, the idea of a Bernie presidency would be wonderful. Yeah. And then I think the second case for optimism is that whether it’s Biden being stronger than he looks in an all-white State or Bloomberg or emerging, unlikely as that may seem, that it still could be a more moderate nominee. And then I guess the third thing is just some kind of surprise, which is Warren stages a comeback, Buttigieg somehow gains support among African Americans, but the first two to me seem to be the most likely more optimistic cases for the Democrats. And the interesting thing is it feels like actually New Hampshire isn’t going to move this race that much because all the signs are that Bernie is going to win, and so then it’s still going to be roughly where we are about a week from now. Does that feel right to both of you? I mean, I think, again, depending on what comes out of the results, it could be a boost either for Pete or for Warren if one of them starts to look more viable based on what comes out of Iowa. Yeah. I think New Hampshire could do a lot to tell us whether Buttigieg has staying power and whether, as Michelle said, Warren can mount a comeback and present herself, again, as an alternative to the Bernie-Biden, or Bernie and Bloomberg showdown. But I guess I agree with you, David in the sense I think South Carolina now is huge because it’s the first place that tells us — I mean, Nevada too. The Nevada-South Carolina combination tells us basically one, is Biden still viable, and two, if he’s not, where do minority voters go? So let’s leave it there, and take a quick break, and we’ll be right back. Coronavirus has spread from the Chinese city of Wuhan to more than 20 countries around the world. Thousands of people have been infected, and several hundred have already died. In China and elsewhere, people have added a new item to their winter wardrobe — a face mask. The virus has raised serious public health questions, but I want to start with a more personal question for each of you, Ross and Michelle, how scared are you personally about this virus? Ross? Most of the time, not incredibly scared, but every few days, there will be — this is the wonders of social media, right — there will be some extremely long Twitter thread by some extremely competent-sounding person making the case that this is all vastly worse than public health authorities want you to believe. And not that we’re all going to die, but there will be some sort of major panic in the United States in Western Europe over this within the next few weeks that will shut down schools and cities and basically, bring the Chinese situation to the Western world. And I think that’s my biggest fear right now, not for my own life or the lives of my children, but that the spread will create conditions in our societies like conditions in China even if the actual death toll doesn’t get that high. What about you, Michelle? I mean, look, I have the flu. I am just getting over it. The flu is like a more serious disease by many accounts. It kills a lot more people than coronavirus. And so like, Ross, I don’t really have any fear about it for myself or my family. I certainly don’t trust this administration to manage a public health emergency. It’s interesting. I mean, in some ways, it’s the common theme between our two subjects this week, which is different kinds of institutional breakdown. And I’ve been really interested to see how these public health crises are different for China than almost anything else. It’s just much harder for them to bulldoze public opinion and just tell people that red is green and green is red because people are experiencing it themselves and the stakes are so high. Yeah. I mean, I think there’s a general fog that surrounds the Chinese situation that I think is just fundamentally different and unique to a totalitarian regime. There aren’t the basic structures of social control in America that in turn create incentives to what you might call the Chernobyl incentives, the incentives to avoid reckoning with a problem in the hopes that it goes away and to clamp down on information streams and then just leave this basic open question. There’s no reason right now, I think, for anyone outside China to trust the information flow that we have from China right now. Although it’s actually very different than Chernobyl. I mean, they’re certainly not underplaying the severity of this. The kind of scale of the response and the intensity of the response must be itself kind of a cause for panic. You kind of think is there something even bigger here given that they’ve basically shut down the world’s biggest economy, put whole megacities under lockdown. Michelle, you were just in Iowa, and David, a little bit before that, you took an extended trip to China, right? I did. And this was well before the coronavirus outbreak started, and you came back and wrote a column that I thought was pretty optimistic about the basic stability of Chinese societies, sort of abstracting from moral questions about the obvious wickedness of the regime, you emphasized in the 10 years since you’d last been there the growth of a pretty stable and optimistic middle class. And I mean, how does that feeling that you got to interact with something like this? Yeah. And I think your description of that column is fair. I think I was pretty optimistic on behalf of China’s power, if not on behalf of what it meant for the world. I mean, look, I think there are two clear risks to China’s ascent as a world power, but the first is a subject, Ross, you’ve written about, which is this massive coming demographic decline, the fact that the one child policy is going to leave them with an aging society that’s going to be really problematic for the future. And then I think the second risk is one that coronavirus really highlights, which is having authoritarian countries where you put no or little value on truth and the number one priority is keeping people in line, the number one domestic priority, can really create serious vulnerabilities, and a public health crisis may be the most serious of those. And so I still look at China and I say, here’s a country that on most measures of what it cares about, its ability to project military power in the Pacific, the diversification of its economy, its ability to produce, actually, innovative companies like TikTok, by all those measures, China really has had quite a good decade, and the United States, the country it’s chasing, has had a pretty bad decade. But it’s definitely the case that this isn’t just a public health crisis, but it also really highlights what is a huge problem with authoritarianism, not just the moral part of it, which is the biggest problem with it, but the kind of brass tacks does it work problem? Yeah, I mean, it seems to me like it is simultaneously a case study in how you could imagine the Chinese regime falling, that you have some internal disaster that basically produces a crisis of confidence that becomes impossible for the regime to manage. And I think that’s a pretty remote possibility overall, and I think one of the lessons of the last 20 years is just that there is much more stability to a certain kind of authoritarian quasi capitalism than 1989 and 1991 made people assume. But still, I think you can see in this how, if that happened, how it would happen. And then related to that, I mean, there’s also the more apocalyptic thing, and I’ll wax apocalyptic a little bit. Like there is a story here of like this is how China blows up the world, right? That you have this incredibly large, incredibly bound into the global economy hub that becomes the obvious vector for the kind of black swan scenarios that we worry about when we worry about the actual fate of human civilization. And that’s not going to be this virus, but the combination of authoritarian control, deep complexity. You started asking how worried we are. I think this is an event that reasonably triggers some deeper worries than just what’s the balance of power between the U.S. and China. I do think the darkest scenario involves the problems with the current version of China, which is China is so much more powerful today than when Mao ran it and so much more connected to the rest of the world. And so you really could see whether it’s a war or a pandemic. You really could see how China’s refusal to admit this was a problem when it first broke out, the fact that they punished doctors who were saying we’ve got a problem here rather than actually taking quick action, you really can see how China’s problems can impact the world much more than they did a half century ago. Well, I guess now that I’ve talked you into being as unreasonably grim as I am, David, we should just leave it there. Fair enough. Fair enough. And now it’s time for our weekly recommendation, when we make a suggestion that is meant to take your mind off of the grim news of the day. Michelle, this week is your turn. I’m not sure if you have cold remedies or something else for us, but what is your recommendation? Well, it’s not necessarily going to take your mind off the grim news of the day, but a couple of weeks ago I was working on this piece that I was calling “The End of the Future.” I think it ended up being called “The Darkness Where the Future Should Be.” And there was a book I read for that piece, which is the new memoir, “Uncanny Valley” by Anna Wiener. It’s a memoir of a young woman who goes to work in the tech industry and at first half buys in to the utopian culture around Silicon Valley and gradually becomes more jaded as the pernicious effects of Silicon Valley become more and more manifest in the world. And so it’s just like a really, really compelling kind of coming of age book that feels very zeitgeisty, but also penetrating look at the hubris and self-mythologizing around all of these big technology companies that are now in addition to breaking the entire world have also now broken the Iowa caucuses. Independent of the utter destruction of human flourishing being visited on the world by Silicon Valley, I’m very curious/fascinated by the gender dynamics. I mean, does the book— Yeah. I mean, the book is actually pretty startling in how bad it is to be a young woman at these companies. I mean, I think that there’s this idea out there that all of these companies are bending over backwards to be politically correct. And I think one of the things that you see, at least through her eyes, is that the definition of politically correct just means kind of not rampant sexual harassment and pay disparities and gender-race put downs. And then you kind of see the extreme resentment bubbling up of men who have to abide by even these minimal standards of even gesture to gender equality or gesture to a non-hostile workplace. And one of the themes of the book is that you see the alt right start to bubble up in these various message boards that she’s on. And you understand in this horror movie kind of way just how big it’s going to become and just how politically influential it’s going to become in a way that she, the character, doesn’t. Michelle, what’s the recommendation? The book is “Uncanny Valley” by Anna Wiener. Thank you. That’s our show for this week. Thank you so much for listening.

Fresh from a reporting trip to the Hawkeye State, Michelle Goldberg sees a Democratic electorate that’s neatly split between the pro-Bernie Sanders grass roots on one side and the party establishment on the other. The failure of moderate Democrats to coalesce around a single alternative to Joe Biden could hand Sanders the nomination, argues Ross Douthat. And David Leonhardt believes that the fracas of Monday’s caucuses is further reason to wrest away Iowa’s first-in-the-nation status for future elections. Then, how worried should we be about the Wuhan coronavirus — and what does its spread say about China’s global standing? And finally, Michelle recommends a new memoir about the power of technology that unfolds more like a horror movie. Background Reading: Ross on the winners and losers of the Iowa fiasco, how the lack of a moderate alternative to Biden helps Sanders and why a demographic crisis threatens China’s power Michelle on the movement behind Sanders and our looming technological dystopia David on why Monday’s mess is another argument against Iowa voting first, why Democrats shouldn’t count Biden out yet, how Biden’s weakness could help Michael Bloomberg and why China’s good decade owes a lot to America’s bad decade Jonathan Chait, “Running Bernie Sanders Against Trump Would Be an Act of Insanity” (New York Magazine) I’ve been an Op-Ed columnist since 2009, and I write about politics, religion, pop culture, sociology and the places where they all intersect. I’m a Catholic and a conservative, in that order, which means that I’m against abortion and critical of the sexual revolution, but I tend to agree with liberals that the Republican Party is too friendly to the rich. I was against Donald Trump in 2016 for reasons specific to Donald Trump, but in general I think the populist movements in Europe and America have legitimate grievances and I often prefer the populists to the “reasonable” elites. I’ve written books about Harvard, the G.O.P., American Christianity and Pope Francis; I’m working on one about decadence. Benedict XVI was my favorite pope. I review movies for National Review and have strong opinions about many prestige television shows. I have three small children, two girls and a boy, and I live in New Haven with my wife. I’ve been an Op-Ed columnist at The New York Times since 2017, writing mainly about politics, ideology and gender. These days people on the right and the left both use “liberal” as an epithet, but that’s basically what I am, though the nightmare of Donald Trump’s presidency has radicalized me and pushed me leftward. I’ve written three books, including one, in 2006, about the danger of right-wing populism in its religious fundamentalist guise. (My other two were about the global battle over reproductive rights and, in a brief detour from politics, about an adventurous Russian émigré who helped bring yoga to the West.) I love to travel; a long time ago, after my husband and I eloped, we spent a year backpacking through Asia. Now we live in Brooklyn with our son and daughter. I’ve worked at The Times since 1999 and have been an Op-Ed columnist since 2016. I caught the journalism bug a very long time ago — first as a little kid in the late 1970s who loved reading the Boston Globe sports section and later as a teenager working on my high school and college newspapers. I discovered that when my classmates and I put a complaint in print, for everyone to see, school administrators actually paid attention. I’ve since worked as a metro reporter at The Washington Post and a writer at Businessweek magazine. At The Times, I started as a reporter in the business section and have also been a Times Magazine staff writer, the Washington bureau chief and the founding editor of The Upshot. My politics are left of center. But I’m also to the right of many Times readers. I think education reform has accomplished a lot. I think two-parent families are good for society. I think progressives should be realistic about the cultural conservatism that dominates much of this country. Most of all, however, I worry deeply about today’s Republican Party, which has become dangerously extreme. This country faces some huge challenges — inequality, climate change, the rise of China — and they’ll be very hard to solve without having both parties committed to the basic functioning of American democracy.

2020,What Do Those Spotify ‘Top Fans’ Messages Mean?,"A new marketing message tells people they are big fans of certain artists. But why? This week, Spotify sent some unspecified portion of its hundreds of millions of users a message. The message told those users something important. “You are one of Taylor Swift’s top fans worldwide,” one iteration of this message said. “You’re one of their top 1% fans. Hit Play on their radio and we’ll provide an endless stream of their music.” People received similar messages about a wide array of artists in the app: Kendrick Lamar, the Barenaked Ladies, Tove Lo, the Doors and many, many more. The Spotify users weren’t always in the top one percent of fans; some messages claimed listeners ranked in the top two or three percent of the artists’ fans. Many reacted to these messages as Spotify might have hoped they would, sharing them with friends and with followers on social media. Regina Anderson, 22, was one of many people told they were among Ms. Swift’s top fans and who, upon receiving the message, broadcast it widely. But something struck Ms. Anderson, a communications assistant in Washington, D.C., about the message. “The way that they phrase it is a little weird,” she said. “It just seems odd. I guess one percent of Taylor Swift’s monthly listeners is 300,000 or something like that.” She wondered how many other people had received the same message. Peter Collins, a spokesperson for Spotify, declined to provide any information on how many fans received them, how the percentages were calculated or what it meant to be in a top percentile of an artist’s fan base. Mr. Collins did classify the messages as a “test.” “At Spotify, we routinely conduct a number of tests in an effort to improve our user experience,” he said in a statement. “Some of those tests end up paving the path for our broader user experience and others serve only as an important learning. We aren’t going to comment on specific tests at this time.” Like many other media platforms, Spotify has made no secret of its practice of collecting user data. It often incorporates that data into its marketing, feeding it back to users in order to promote itself. This practice is most prominent during its annual year-end Spotify Wrapped marketing campaign, in which the streaming platform provides users with a short presentation about their most-played artists and songs. In late 2019, Spotify Wrapped allowed users a window into their listening habits since 2010. “Spotify has user listening analytics data dating back to our first years as a streaming platform,” some of its engineers explained in a blog post about that project. But while the Spotify Wrapped campaign provides more context for the data it offers users, the messages this week were more difficult to parse. Spotify collects data, uses that data to market its features — in this case, artist-specific playlists — but will not give its users any insight into what the data means, or even whether it represents something real. “I thought it was kind of random given that it’s not the end of the year, it wasn’t part of a roundup, it was just like ‘oh hey by the way,’” said Kasey Carlson, 22, who was told that she was one of Chance the Rapper’s top fans. (Her favorite song of the artist’s is “Cocoa Butter Kisses.”) Cherie Hu, who writes the music technology newsletter Water and Music, said that the test was typical of Spotify’s lack of transparency. “What that message does is it reduces fandom to a very surface-level metric on Spotify,” she said. “This raises a question for me of how Spotify is actually calculating fandom. Are they calculating it just by the number of streams? Are they tracking it by how many people go to the artist page?” In some ways, what Spotify is doing is familiar, as anonymized data becomes a key component of how marketers appeal to customers. Jeff Chester, the head of the nonprofit Center for Digital Democracy, said that such practices had become commonplace. “Just think about going into the supermarket and getting mobile coupons,” he said. “All of that is tied together as part of the profiling process of you and you have no idea how it’s collected or what it means.” But these latest Spotify messages are different in two key ways. The first is that they purport to share the service’s information directly with users. And the second is that its data is centered on music, a particularly personal and personality-revealing aspect of peoples’s lives. Matthew Perpetua, a longtime music blogger and a former director of quizzes at BuzzFeed, said that the way that Spotify served up data to users was reminiscent of a personality quiz. “In this case, the quiz itself is just your engagement with Spotify,” he said. “In lieu of answering random questions that have been put before you, you’re just going about your life and listening to what you want. And they turn it into a quiz or game where they’re like, ‘This is who you are.’” Or not. While many who posted about the Spotify messages identified as fans of the artists they were being told they were fans of, others were baffled. Matt Moore, a 33-year-old software developer in New Jersey, was told on Thursday that he is one of Cake’s top fans. “I mean, I’m a moderate Cake fan,” he said. “I wouldn’t say I’m in the one percent. I listen to Cake every now and then.” Mr. Moore said that the message was confusing. “For the most part it makes me feel bad for Cake,” he said. “If I’m their number one biggest fan, then it’s saying something.”",The New York Times
2020,What Do You Wear to the End of Days?,"Fashion Review Or at least the end of the European experiment? At London Fashion Week, Burberry, JW Anderson and Simone Rocha offer some ideas. LONDON — In 1139 Archbishop Malachy of Armagh supposedly had a vision of the future that became known as the “prophesy of popes.” In it, the Irish saint predicted the names of 112 pontiffs who would rule until the end of days. Though it was later shown to be a 16th-century forgery, the second to last pope on the list was Benedict, which has suggested to some in the Roman Catholic world that the final pope could be the current pope, and the apocalypse is nigh. Actually, not just the Catholic world but, apparently, the fashion world, too. Over the weekend, Simone Rocha put the idea front and center on a dress. It was lovely — royal purple splashed with a gold scripted rendering of the saint’s name, draped in swathes of black satin — and it was sandwiched between piles of baptismal lace and tulle; watery fisherman knits and oyster satin slithers; elaborately embroidered cross-topped sacred hearts: the semiology of prayer, loss and rebirth. And it was not happenstance. Brexit has finally been approved. Storm Dennis, officially classified as a “weather bomb,” was lashing Britain as the shows began, flooding roads and wreaking havoc. A designer here could be forgiven for thinking it’s the end of days. It’s definitely the end of something. The issue for everyone is what comes next. 43 Photos View Slide Show › “Of course I’m worried,” said Molly Goddard after her show of tulle extravaganzas mixed with chunky Fair Isle knits and nerdy-cool tailoring that was an ode to her youth in the late 1990s around London’s Portobello Market. “I’m worried about the people in my factories, most of whom aren’t English, even though the factories are nearby.” That’s to be expected. As was the existential questioning of identity that was an underlying current in so many of the clothes here: What does it mean to be British? What content do these symbols we put on our backs contain any more? What was less predictable was where such thinking led some designers: not to the depths of despair, but somewhere else entirely. To a world after doomsday. To renewal, and reinvention. Could cynicism be out of fashion? What an idea. 43 Photos View Slide Show › But first, there was a lot of black. A lot of big, swaddling volumes. A lot of covert messaging and a lot of wrestling — some good, some weighed down with angst — with the past. For some: a lot of royal sleevage. For others: argyle, houndstooth, tweed. Victoria Beckham belted her curving black sheaths and neatly tailored culotte-suits with hands-across-the-hips silver and cut diamond-shaped holes into her sweater vests like a remembrance of things lost. Emilia Wickstead offered big puffed sleeves and even bigger skirts; Roksanda, a safe space of billowing, shimmering drapes of many colors and chunky, patchwork-nation knits. At Burberry, the chief creative officer, Riccardo Tisci, named his collection “Memories:” of the brand itself, but also of London, when he was a fashion student, living in the Bethnal Green neighborhood, and of his trips to India, where he started his own label; of the melting pot of the capital and the designer mind. That meant — checks! And trench coats! Lots of them with feathers and faux furs, deconstructed into parts and twisted into sari-like assemblages; mixed and matched and also madras for men and women; leopard and contrasting linings thrown in. 108 Photos View Slide Show › Also the occasional big star plastered on the front of a shirt, and a festival’s worth of rugby stripes in cinnamon and turmeric, as if for a game of Quidditch in Mumbai. Also some go-go silver fringe, for evening. Also a lot of green (afterward Burberry announced the show had been certified carbon neutral and that it was creating what it called “a regeneration fund” to support carbon insetting in its supply chain). If that sounds like it is skating across the surface — not the environmental initiatives, which are laudable, but the fashion interpretations of the national totems — that’s also how it looked: polished, easy to wear, but lacking depth and soul. Which is odd, because Mr. Tisci is nothing if not an emotional designer, and it often takes an outsider (he’s Italian) to really grapple with a country’s imagery. It’s as if he is deliberately denaturing himself to appeal to as many people as possible; going not with his gut, but with his market research. In any case, it still made more sense than Tommy Hilfiger’s #TommyNow celebration of Americana, inclusivity and his celebrity connections in stars, stripes, anchors aweigh, neon and slogans — “Just Rise;” “Still Human;” “Loyalty” — via collaborations with the singer H.E.R. and the Formula One star Lewis Hamilton. The effect was of a semi-party in a place that isn’t really in the mood to party any more (and that has increasingly mixed feelings about the “special relationship” between itself and its former colony anyway).

That is absolutely fine; not all clothes need a philosophical grounding (that would be exhausting). But a little sensitivity to context and timing is no bad thing.

2020,Opinion | What Does the Iranian Election Tell Us?,"The low turnout and the conservative victory in the parliamentary elections in Iran indicate intense electoral disenchantment and set the stage for the ascendance of a hard-liner as president. Mr. Tabaar is the author of “Religious Statecraft: The Politics of Islam in Iran.” On Friday Iran held its 11th parliamentary elections since the foundation of the Islamic Republic in 1979, and the first since the Trump administration renewed sanctions on Iran and battered its economy. The voting turnout — 42.5 percent — was the lowest since 1979, and a loose alliance of conservative candidates won. In Tehran, the capital, where about 75 percent of the voters chose not to vote, all 30 seats were won by the conservative candidates loyal to the supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei. The Iranian electorate faces a perpetual dilemma on whether to participate or boycott the elections as the choice of candidates is limited and the Guardian Council — a constitutional committee made up of six clerics and six jurists that vets the electoral candidates — bars those seen as critical of the regime or deviating from its positions. More than 7,000 candidates, most of them reformists and moderates, including 90 members of the current Iranian Parliament, were disqualified from Friday’s elections by the Guardian Council for having insufficient ideological loyalty, a move that reduced voter participation. The turnout was higher than Tehran in smaller cities, where citizens have more incentive to vote if the candidates promise better schools and hospitals, improved roads, faster internet, more ethnic inclusion and even individual patronage. As the American sanctions have debilitated the Iranian economy, greater participation in parliamentary elections offers the provinces an opportunity to bargain for a better share of the shrinking pie from Tehran. In Tehran and other major cities, the parliamentary elections signal not only the citizens’ preferences for particular factions within the regime but also its legitimacy as a whole. Participation rates in the major cities fluctuate more often and reflect the political diversity of the candidates. In the 2016 parliamentary elections, a high turnout enabled moderate reformist candidates to secure Tehran’s 30 seats in the Parliament. The conservative winners in Tehran, this weekend, were led by Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf, the former head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ air force wing, who is expected to be the speaker of the incoming Parliament. Victories like Mr. Qalibaf’s demonstrate that the Revolutionary Guard is ensuring its presence and domination of the Parliament as well. Iranians who refused to vote expressed their anger and their disappointment with the Revolutionary Guard’s bloody crackdown on protesters in November, and its cover-up of the accidental shooting of a civilian airplane near Tehran in January. But the trouble with boycotting the elections is that it opens the doors of the Parliament for the most conservative wing of the political system. Iranian society stands at an uncharted crossroad and the regime is bringing the apparatus of the state under the control of what it considers to be its most loyal elites, one election at a time. In a politically, economically and regionally tumultuous environment, doing so would allow an orderly transition to the next supreme leader. The brutal response to the November protests across the country showed the will and the capacity of the security apparatus to put down unrest. And a multinational army of proxies under the banner of the Revolutionary Guard’s Quds Force operating from Lebanon and Syria to Iraq and Yemen, have demonstrated Tehran’s will and effectiveness in defending its sphere of influence and fighting threats from hostile states to nonstate participants. Iran’s constitutional design places the Islamic Republic in a win-win position. High voter participation helps legitimize the regime and a boycott invariably leads to a conservative victory. Elections also serve as a convenient device for the state to learn about and manage popular sentiments before they turn into a mass revolt. Despite these institutional constraints, Iranian citizens have often outmaneuvered their leaders and stunned the world by using elections as a tool to coordinate nationwide social and political movements. After the 1989 death of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic, and with the gradual decline of revolutionary fervor, competition among Mr. Khomeini’s followers provided a narrow political opportunity for Iranian citizens. By choosing candidates who appeared furthest from the establishment, Iranians revealed their preference for radical change not only to the ruling elites but also to each other. Far from strengthening the regime, elections often turned into national protests, deepening the gap between the state and the society and further polarizing factional politics. The student uprising in 1999 over the government’s crackdown on the media and the Green Movement against what millions viewed as a rigged re-election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in 2009 were direct results of electoral politics and popular frustrations with the regime’s suppression of the people’s struggle for civil rights. The ruling elites managed this 30-year cycle of elections and protests through a sequence of crackdowns, concessions and more crackdowns. Disillusioned citizens sometimes boycotted elections only to return to the ballot box with vehemence. Parliamentary elections in Iran have become a consistent predictor of relations between the state and the society. The low turnout in the 2004 parliamentary elections signaled popular disillusionment after the failure of the reform movement that started in the 1997 presidential election to protect civic rights, which led to the 2005 election of Mr. Ahmadinejad to the presidency. The high turnout in the 2016 parliamentary elections confirmed the high approval rate of President Hassan Rouhani and the nuclear agreement he signed with the United States and other world powers, predicting his landslide re-election the following year. The conservative victory in the recent parliamentary elections indicates that the Iranian people are disenchanted with electoral politics that deliver nothing. It sets the stage for the ascendance of a hard-line president in the 2021 election if the population’s apathy persists. And the absence of public pressure and elite bargaining will determine the appointment of a possibly even more hawkish supreme leader after Ayatollah Khamenei. Yet after this electoral cycle, Iranian voters may not easily return to the ballot box. Friday’s election could be the beginning of the death of Iran’s limited electoral politics. Frustrations against the political system run deep in the country. So do anxieties over external threats to the nation’s security and territorial integrity. It is unclear which direction Iranian society will take. Elections in the past have laid the ground for cultural exchanges, diplomatic negotiations and a nuclear agreement between Iran and the United States. After the starkly low turnout and the conservative victory, we might be inching toward a more turbulent phase between the two countries.

2020,What Happened Between E. Jean Carroll and Elle Magazine?,"Her contract was terminated early, but the fashion magazine maintains it wasn’t because of her allegations against President Trump. In the fall of 2017, when Nina Garcia, the fashion editor and “Project Runway” judge, became the editor in chief of Elle magazine, E. Jean Carroll felt she needed to fight for her job. Ms. Garcia was remaking the staff and was scaling back on lucrative contracts the magazine offered freelance contributors like Ms. Carroll, who had written the Ask E. Jean advice column since 1993. But rather than dash off a pleading email, as many writers might, Ms. Carroll did something more in line with her outsize personality: She showed up at the offices of Hearst Magazines, the publisher of Elle, with a stack of hula hoops. “I said, ‘Here’s some hula hoops, let’s get it going girl!’” she recalled in a phone interview. Ms. Garcia appeared to love it. “Oh, my God, I adore E. Jean!” she said in a 2018 interview, about a year after taking over. “She’s just so perfect for this generation. Her voice is so modern, quirky, and cheeky. While everybody on Twitter thinks they could be the E. Jean, she is the E. Jean!” The same month that the interview ran, Ms. Garcia agreed to provide a blurb for Ms. Carroll’s forthcoming memoir, “What Do We Need Men For?,” praising her work at Elle. At that point, Ms. Carroll had shared the book’s contents with very few people, and Ms. Garcia had not read it. “E. Jean Carroll is a force of nature, whose natural vibrancy has held readers in rapture for decades,” read Ms. Garcia’s blurb, which was printed on the back cover. In the book, which recounts stories from her life, Ms. Carroll accuses Donald Trump of raping her in a department store dressing room in the mid-1990s. The details were revealed in an excerpt in New York magazine in June of 2019, just before the book was published, and quickly picked up by news outlets around the world. Mr. Trump denied ever meeting Ms. Carroll, calling her a liar. (“She’s not my type,” he told The Hill.) Several months later, she filed a defamation suit against him. She argued he had damaged her reputation and her career by denying that her story was true, and by saying that she took money from his political opponents to fabricate the allegation. Elle covered the story, reporting on her book’s revelations and the reaction to them on its website. It also ran a column in print (but not online) last fall in which Ms. Carroll explained why she had decided to come forward at last. But by December 2019, Elle’s regard for its columnist had changed. Ms. Carroll, 76, was contacted by a Hearst editor, Erin Hobday, who asked if she was free for a call; Ms. Carroll thought she was being invited to the company holiday party. Instead, she was informed that her contract, which was supposed to go through July of this year, was being terminated. She was asked to invoice for the remaining four columns, which would not be published and for which Ms. Carroll said she still has not been paid. “We and your readers so appreciate your many years of work for the magazine, and the wonderful columns you contributed to our publication,” Ms. Hobday wrote in an email, adding: “We will miss you tremendously.” On Feb. 18, Ms. Carroll wrote on Twitter: “Because Trump ridiculed my reputation, laughed at my looks, & dragged me through the mud, after 26 years, ELLE fired me. I don’t blame Elle. It was the great honor of my life writing ‘Ask E. Jean.’ I blame @realdonaldtrump.” Earlier that day, her lawyers had disclosed in a court filing in connection to her defamation suit against Mr. Trump that Elle had killed the Ask E. Jean column, which had been published virtually every month for 26 years. In response to a list of questions sent by The New York Times, a Hearst spokeswoman emailed a statement. “E. Jean Carroll was long a beloved voice in the pages of Elle, the decision not to renew her contract was a business decision and had nothing to do with politics,” it said. Even if Ms. Carroll did not blame Elle, others did, and were quick to say so. Soon, the hashtag #BoycottElleMagazine began appearing on Twitter. “Extremely disappointing from the woman’s mag that historically has done more hard hitting reporting and taken stands than most,” Clara Jeffery, the editor of Mother Jones magazine, wrote on Twitter. “If you ever wondered whether women’s magazines are really on the side of women, I think this says all we need to know,” said Nancy Jo Sales, a magazine writer. Many editors who have worked with Ms. Carroll say Elle has lost an important voice. “E. Jean is an American original and to many, an icon,” said Robbie Myers, the longtime editor of Elle, before Ms. Garcia. “E. Jean was just so beloved,” said Maggie Bullock, a former deputy editor at Elle. “It seems really sad that a women’s publication that had the chance to align itself with a woman who was speaking her truth — and speaking truth to power — in a time like this, chose not to. What a shortsighted thing to do.” But inside the Hearst building in Midtown Manhattan this week, some journalists quietly fumed at what they saw as an inaccurate portrayal. More than a dozen current and former Hearst employees, who spoke to The Times anonymously for fear they would face repercussions in their jobs, attributed Ms. Carroll’s contract termination, at least in part, to a steep paycheck and a break in convention: Ms. Carroll had given away the news-breaking excerpt from her book to New York magazine — not Elle. (The New York cover story, “Hideous Men,” was edited by Laurie Abraham, one of Ms. Carroll’s former editors at Elle. Ms. Abraham now works at The Atlantic.) Some said that Ms. Carroll’s contention that Mr. Trump’s insults cost her the columnist job was self-serving, since her defamation lawsuit against him will require her to prove she has been damaged by his remarks. Ms. Carroll dismissed those comments. “The lawsuit is for all women who have been harassed, who cannot speak up and don’t have the money to sue,” Ms. Carroll said. “I am speaking out now for the women who have spoken out and have met their doom. Sometimes you speak out against a man in power and you lose your job.” Ms. Carroll has been credited with helping to shape the advice column genre and voice, inspiring modern-day iterations like Ask Polly, published by New York magazine, and “Dear Sugars,” an advice column turned podcast. “She didn’t just toss off a bunch of fluff — she used research, referenced current events and politics, interviewed experts and actually gave real advice that often was as much about helping get a woman’s career on track as a relationship,” said Ms. Bullock, the former Elle editor, now a freelance writer. “Early on, Jean was inclusive and, you could argue, ‘woke.’” But the days of lucrative magazine contracts are largely a thing of the past. When Ms. Garcia took over Elle, Ms. Carroll was being paid $120,000 a year for 12 columns of about 1,800 words each. (At about $5.50 per word, that was more than twice the $2 per word usually paid to Elle’s freelance writers for the print magazine.) When Ms. Carroll’s contract came up for renewal during Ms. Garcia’s first year, editors went to bat for Ms. Carroll, arguing that her column had become synonymous with the Elle brand. Ms. Garcia gave Ms. Carroll a new contract: $60,000 per year for 12 columns of 900 words. The changes at Elle, many of them in response to the economic challenges of the magazine industry, reflect big shifts at its parent company, Hearst, which is also facing tension with employees who recently unionized. In 2018, David Carey, the president of Hearst Magazines for eight years, stepped down. Troy Young, who had previously overseen the company’s digital efforts, succeeded him. Since then, most of the high-profile editors who served under Mr. Carey have left. (In 2019, Mr. Carey was named by Hearst Corporation as senior vice president of public affairs and communications.) Ms. Garcia has worked to put her own stamp on Elle. She has made the magazine more visual, and amped up its social media presence. She has dedicated less space to political features, which had been a hallmark of Elle under its previous editors. Its annual women-in-Washington “Power List” magazine feature and awards dinner was canceled under Ms. Garcia. She has also worked hard to avoid ruffling feathers, according to some current and former employees. In a 2017 article about Whitney Wolfe, the founder of the dating app Bumble, several paragraphs detailing her perspective on feminism were removed from the digital version of the article after Ms. Wolfe complained that the quotes were taken out of context, according to four former staffers who were aware of the discussions. (Later, Hearst worked with Bumble to start Bumble Mag.) Last winter, a profile of Dr. Jen Gunter, the ob-gyn (and New York Times columnist) who has been a critic of Gwyneth Paltrow and Goop, was killed after top editors expressed concern that it might upset Ms. Paltrow and her publicist Stephen Huvane, who represents a variety of celebrity clients, according to three former staffers. (Ms. Paltrow appeared on a November 2019 cover of Elle.) Sources also said a profile of Lara Trump, the president’s daughter-in-law, was published in the print magazine but not on the Elle website because of fear it would stoke rage online. After sending the statement about Ms. Carroll, Hearst did not respond to questions about these editorial decisions. By the time Ms. Carroll was deciding where to excerpt her book — and publish her accusation that the sitting president had raped her years before — Ms. Carroll didn’t consider Elle. “Under Nina, Elle has been less into politics or news,” Ms. Carroll said. “Nina’s Elle is a fashion magazine. So I went with New York magazine, which knows how to break news.” That decision was revealed to Elle editors over drinks at the Russian Tea Room last spring, where Ms. Carroll and a few of the editors had gone to celebrate the upcoming publication of her book. It was there that she told the editors what the book was about — including what she had written about Mr. Trump — and that an excerpt containing this revelation would be running in New York magazine. “They were extremely disappointed,” Ms. Carroll said of the Elle editors. They told Ms. Carroll that they were shocked, both by what she said had happened to her and by the fact that she had not given Elle first dibs on the excerpt. By the terms of her contract, Ms. Carroll was not required to offer her story to Elle. But she agreed to help facilitate a phone call between Elle editors, her agent and a representative of her book publisher. The excerpt still was published by New York. When it came time to make budget cuts this past December, Hearst employees said, few felt lingering loyalty to Ms. Carroll. That’s when Ms. Hobday told her she had been cut loose. In a statement, Ms. Garcia, said: “E. Jean and I have known each other for more than two decades and she will always be part of the Elle DNA. We applaud and support her for coming forward with telling her story. The response to her allegations were not a factor in not renewing her contract.” Ms. Carroll is under no illusion that she was carrying the magazine into the next era. “I AM old, unhip and uncool, yes,” she wrote on Twitter. But she doesn’t believe Elle gave her the boot simply because it couldn’t afford her. “I would have taken a new contract for less money,” she said. By Thursday, Ms. Carroll said she had received inquiries from four other publications asking if she would consider writing for them.",The New York Times
2020,What Happened in Iowa?,"transcript Hello, Iowa City! All of the game day excitement is shifting to Iowa. The shape of the 2020 race could change dramatically. [CROWD CHANTING]: Warren! Warren! Warren! Warren! Warren! Buttigieg! Buttigieg! Buttigieg! Buttigieg! Today marks the beginning of the end for Donald Trump. What happened in Iowa? ^ARCHIVED RECORDING (JOE BIDEN)^ Well, it looks like it’s going to be a long night. But I’m feeling good. This is a real hit when it comes to A, the Iowa caucus, and B, faith that people have in free and fair elections in this country. It is too close to call. So I’m just going to tell you what I do know. Good afternoon, and thank you all so much for taking a little time today to chat a little bit about what happened last night. Hey, it’s Alex Burns, political reporter for The New York Times, still stuck in a hotel in Des Moines at 6:40 PM central time on Tuesday as we continue to wait for the final results of the Iowa caucus. The story of today has been that, after last night’s debacle, when some combination of human and technological error prevented the results from being announced, everyone was waiting impatiently for a 3:45 PM announcement from the Iowa Democratic Party chair, Troy Price. The reporting of the results and circumstances surrounding the 2020 Iowa Democratic Party caucuses were unacceptable. He comes out about 20 minutes late to start the briefing. As chair of the party, I apologize deeply for this. He apologizes. How can anyone trust you now? We have been working day and night. Takes some annoyed questions from reporters — And how can you assure Americans that these are verifiably accurate results? Well, we’re going to take the time we need to get these results done, now that we have the first batch that’s going to be coming out here in a couple of minutes. — and says the results are about to go live. So all of us still here in Des Moines immediately start hitting refresh on the Iowa Democratic Party website. And here in just a couple of minutes, we will be reporting — But basically, 18 hours after we expected the results, they are still a long, long way from complete. 62% of precincts from all 99 counties. Only 62% of the precincts have been reported. And look, I understand how much pressure the Iowa Democratic Party is under. But it seems like a highly questionable decision to make people wait this long for any information and then release only an incomplete picture. Anyways, thank you all folks. The results are coming in. We will see you later. So immediately, you see cable television trying to make sense of it in real time. And there you go. See it? So how does Sanders lead in the state delegate equivalent? Excuse me, how does Buttigieg lead in the state delegate equivalent if he’s not leading on the second allocation? It gets into it. And I’ve got to take a look here very closely. But as we’re recording this, it still remains unclear when we will actually know the final results of the Iowa caucuses. What is clear is that Pete Buttigieg and Bernie Sanders are the two candidates who have pulled ahead, away from the rest of the pack. And that Joe Biden has really fallen behind. But the latest is that the importance of those results really feels diminished in a meaningful way as a result of all this chaos. Typically, two things happen after Iowa. You see some candidates drop out. And you see one candidate claim victory and try to turn that into momentum heading into New Hampshire. But the way this has all played out, neither thing — clear losers, clear winners — is really happening yet. There’s still too much uncertainty about who the number one candidate will ultimately be. In fact, right now, Bernie Sanders is winning the popular vote while Pete Buttigieg is winning in the state delegate count. That second number has as much to do with geographic distribution of a candidate’s support as it has to do with the actual raw numbers of the vote. And it’s that number, the state delegates, that is the traditional measure of who wins Iowa. So what you’re seeing right now is both candidates trying to claim victory. They’re complete, but results are in from a majority of precincts. And they show our campaign in first place. We see Buttigieg come out on Tuesday afternoon, shortly after these partial results are announced, and deliver an emotional speech, claiming victory and validation and sounding for all the world like a man turning toward a general election against President Trump. A campaign that some said should have no business even making this attempt has taken its place at the front of this race to replace the current president with a better vision for the future. Meanwhile, Bernie Sanders is pushing hard on the idea that the popular vote, the count that matters in normal primary elections, is the most important measure of support here. Last night in Iowa, we received more votes on the first and second round than any other candidate. It’s possible, once the final results are in, that split, with Sanders claiming the most raw votes, but Buttigieg claiming the most state delegates, will remain. And neither of the top two candidates would ever concede that the other had won. Or maybe, in the end, we will end up with one clear winner, a candidate who gets to take that big traditional victory lap in the national spotlight. But we aren’t there yet. So that’s the latest. Tomorrow we head to New Hampshire, where we’ll start trying to understand what, if anything, these results mean to voters there and whether Bernie Sanders is still the favorite in a state that he dominated four years ago. A state, by the way, that takes a simple primary vote next Tuesday. transcript Hello, Iowa City! All of the game day excitement is shifting to Iowa.

I said last night let’s give them time, and I’m not being critical, let’s give them time to work out those issues carefully and deliberately because a lot depends on it.

2020,2020 Oscars Red Carpet Fashion,"Did you miss the preshow? We have you covered. 83 Photos View Slide Show › Ah, the Oscars red carpet. The ne plus ultra of awards season carpets. The most formal, most glamorous, most ogled, analyzed, criticized and branded carpet of them all. The one that attracts the most eyeballs and thus has the most money riding on it in terms of marketing budgets and contract riders that say this celebrity has to wear that designer because they have a formal brand ambassador relationship with the company. This is, after all, the carpet that turned Lady Gaga into a 21st-century version of … Grace Kelly? In black satin, opera gloves and up-do. Here’s what happened on the carpet this time around. Greta Gerwig, the director of “Little Women,” and Noah Baumbach, the director of “Marriage Story,” appeared together. Mr. Baumbach, who is Ms. Gerwig’s partner and who writes with her, gushed over her, as has become his custom. “She’s made me a better person and a better writer,” he said. “When we write together, I’m always trying to impress her. I write better because I work at it harder because I want her to be impressed.” “That’s really nice,” Ms. Gerwig said. Laura Dern, who won for best supporting actress for her role in “Marriage Story,” appeared on the red carpet wearing a pale pink Armani Privé gown with dripping black crystals. She was escorting several family members, including her mother. Ms. Dern, who at last night’s Independent Spirit Awards was honored by the Gay Men’s Chorus of Los Angeles, said that it was a privilege to make movies for a living. “Every job is complicated, every job has sacrifice,” Ms. Dern said. “But the bliss of getting to make movies as the thing you call your living is an incredible blessing.” Bong Joon Ho, the director of “Parasite,” was in Hollywood for the evening, though at the Independent Spirit Awards, he said he would rather be elsewhere. “After tomorrow, I can finally go home,” he said. “That’s what makes me happiest.” “Parasite,” which took home several awards, including best picture, making it the first non-English film to win that honor. Janelle Monáe appeared on the carpet in a crystal-lacquered custom Ralph Lauren gown. Asked about “Harriet,” in which she plays the supporting role of Marie Buchanon, she said she hoped viewers would walk away with an important understanding. “Listen to black women,” Ms. Monáe said. “When we are in positions of leadership, when we have your support, we can do the unthinkable. We can do the impossible.” Natalie Portman wore a Dior tuxedo cape on which the names of female directors, including Greta Gerwig, Lulu Wang and Marielle Heller, had been inscribed in gold cursive. Dwyane Wade, Gabrielle Union and Dove, the brand, invited De’Andre Arnold, an 18-year-old high school senior in Texas, to attend the Oscars after he was suspended in December for wearing dreadlocks. In a phone interview shortly before his flight to Los Angeles, De’Andre said that he was feeling “pride, and validation too,” for the opportunity to attend the show. “It’s like, look at me,” he said. “The little kid with dreads is at the Oscars. While all the people at home are mad? I’m at the Oscars.” Julia Butters, whom you may know as Leonardo DiCaprio’s young scene partner in “Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood,” wore Christian Siriano. Asked if she had talked to Mr. DiCaprio between takes, Julia, who is 10, said that they had not talked “like crazy.” “We wouldn’t be like, ‘Hey, let’s talk,’” she said. “We would kind of be professional.” Idina Menzel, at the awards with her husband, Aaron Lohr, said that she felt some pressure ahead of her performance of “Into the Unknown,” from “Frozen 2.” “Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio will be there, and I’d like to hit all the notes properly — not that they matter, honey!” she said to Mr. Lohr. “Not that they matter.” Remember the Golden Globes harness? For this year’s Oscars, Timothée Chalamet took a different tack: a Prada ensemble that is somewhere between a suit-suit and a tracksuit. Earlier in the evening, on Twitter, Kid Cudi, a fan (and friend) of the actor, expressed excitement to see what the “Little Women” man would wear. He was really excited. Wonder what he thinks! When the Grammys took place at the Staples Center on Jan. 26, Kobe Bryant was an undeniable presence, as fans congregated at the arena to pay tribute to the former Lakers star, who had died earlier that day. At the Oscars, the first visible tribute to Bryant came from the director Spike Lee. He wore purple and gold and the number 24, Bryant’s number in the later part of his career. “He beat me,” said Mr. Lee of Bryant. (Mr. Lee, famously, did not win an Oscar until 2019. Bryant won the award in 2018 for the short film “Dear Basketball.”) Rebel Wilson wore a glamorous off-the-shoulder Jason Wu gown for the awards ceremony. Fun fact: Jason Wu was one of the designers most disadvantaged by the Oscars falling in the middle of New York Fashion Week this year. His runway slot was at 6 p.m., right about the time people start tuning into red carpet coverage of one of the biggest fashion events of the year. But it was striking to see a Jason Wu gown on the carpet at all; his last notable appearance there was when Kerry Washington wore one of his designs in 2014. Last year we all said thank goodness for Billy Porter in his tuxedo ball gown, using his moment in the clothes spotlight to make a point. Tonight, he hosted an Oscars preshow on ABC, channeling royalty in gold, with a billowing skirt printed with imagery from Kensington Palace. “This look is all about royalty,” Mr. Porter wrote in an email before the show. The actor, best known for his role on the television show “Pose,” has become in recent years a reliable red carpet showstopper, known for his eye-catching fashion choices and general exuberance. But being a host is different from being the star. This is Mr. Porter’s second stint hosting the preshow, and he appears to have grown more comfortable reflecting the glamour of the moment, rather than exuding it. Some of the stars couldn’t help remarking on his red carpet reputation. Ms. Monáe told him, for instance, that he had inspired her to take her outfit to another level. “When I knew that you were coming, what you did last year and what you are doing now, I knew I had to come and I had to show up,” she said. When Penélope Cruz appeared, Mr. Porter plugged “Noel,” a 2004 movie in which he and she had appeared. “Look that up on Netflix, children,” he said. “It’s pretty good at Christmastime.”",The New York Times
2020,What Happened to the Students Caught Up in the College Admissions Scandal?,"None of the young people whose parents are accused of wrongdoing were charged with crimes in the admissions case. But they have faced consequences. BOSTON — They have been expelled from schools, haunted by nightmares and panic attacks, whispered about by classmates, and mocked online. For the young people whose parents were charged in the nation’s largest college admissions cheating scandal, society’s punishment came swiftly, often before their parents had their cases heard in court. While Sophia Macy, a daughter of the actors Felicity Huffman and William H. Macy, was flying to Juilliard for a final round of auditions for admission to the performing arts school, officials sent her an email withdrawing the invitation. “She called us from the airport in hysterics,” Mr. Macy wrote to a judge last year, as Ms. Huffman was being sentenced for arranging cheating on her daughter’s SAT test. “From the devastation of that day, Sophia is slowly regaining her equilibrium and getting on with her life.” Twenty parents, including Ms. Huffman, have pleaded guilty in the sweeping scandal, which prosecutors say involved cheating on college admissions exams and bribing coaches to get children admitted to elite schools as athletic recruits based on false credentials. Many have been sentenced to penalties ranging from probation to nine months in prison. Fifteen other parents, including the actress Lori Loughlin, have pleaded not guilty and appear headed to trial, possibly this year. Most of the parents — even those whose cases have yet to be decided — have faced consequences outside the courtroom: They lost high-paying jobs, had professional licenses suspended or investigated, or were publicly shamed as examples of greed and bad parenting. But since the case was announced a year ago, far less has been heard from the children of those involved in the scandal, many of whom were on the cusp of going to college or were already enrolled. No students were criminally charged, and prosecutors have said that many of them were unaware of the actions their parents had taken to try to get them admitted to top schools. Still, some of them have faced penalties as well. Almost immediately after arrests were announced last March, colleges opened investigations into students with ties to the scandal. Yale, Stanford, Georgetown, Northwestern and the University of Southern California each expelled students or revoked students’ admissions. Some students who were seniors in high school when their parents were arrested had their college applications denied or were forced to withdraw them. Others were admitted to colleges not tied to the cheating scheme, and some students who were already in college were investigated and allowed to stay. Matteo Sloane, whose father admitted to paying $250,000 to secure his admission as a water polo recruit, is still enrolled at U.S.C. (A lawyer for the father, Devin Sloane, declined to comment on whether the school had disciplined his son.) Matteo Sloane told The Wall Street Journal that it was hard to find out that his father had intervened in the admissions process. “It kind of takes the value away of the work I did to get there in the first place,” he said. “I was mad,” he said, “and then it kind of transformed into me feeling sorry for him.” It has been less clear how high schools have treated families ensnared in the scandal. But a recent filing by lawyers for Michelle Janavs, a philanthropist whose father and uncle invented Hot Pockets, a microwaveable sandwich, offered one school’s response. When Ms. Janavs, an heiress to the Hot Pockets fortune, was arrested last year, her two daughters were in their junior and senior years at Sage Hill School, a private school in Newport Coast, Calif. Ms. Janavs was on Sage Hill’s board, as was another parent charged in the case, Douglas Hodge, the former chief executive of the bond giant Pimco. The school quickly announced the resignations of Ms. Janavs and Mr. Hodge. According to Ms. Janavs’s lawyers, Sage Hill also banned her daughters from campus and events like graduation and prom, allowing them to complete the year’s work at home and allowing the older girl to receive a diploma. The lawyers wrote that the girls “were shunned by friends, teachers, and classmates.” A spokeswoman for the school declined to comment, citing student privacy. Ms. Janavs was sentenced on Tuesday to five months in prison after she pleaded guilty to two counts: money laundering conspiracy, and conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud and honest services mail and wire fraud. Ms. Janavs acknowledged paying a college consultant $100,000 to secure inflated scores on her daughters’ ACT exams. She also has acknowledged agreeing to pay $200,000 so that her older daughter would be admitted to U.S.C. as a recruit in women’s beach volleyball, a sport she did not play competitively. It appears from court filings that Ms. Janavs’s younger daughter was unaware that her mother was cheating on the ACT on her behalf, by paying for a corrupt proctor to correct her answers. It is not clear from court filings what the older daughter knew, and Ms. Janavs’s lawyers declined to comment. The older daughter, who had been conditionally accepted to U.S.C. as an athlete, had that acceptance rescinded and was barred from applying again, the lawyers said. She is now enrolled in a community college, the lawyers said, while Ms. Janavs’s younger daughter has enrolled in a public high school. In a letter to the judge, Ms. Janavs’s husband, Paul Janavs, said F.B.I. agents had handcuffed the two girls as they stood outside, barefoot in their pajamas, when Ms. Janavs was arrested in March. “While this has been excruciatingly painful and devastating for Michelle, it has been equally painful for our family,” he wrote. “There have been too many days during the past eleven months during which I held both of my daughters in my arms as they cried out of a broad combination of emotions including anger at their mother, sorrow and great anxiety about her fate.” Other parents have described how much their children have struggled. The wife of Agustin Huneeus, a Bay Area winemaker who pleaded guilty to participating in both the test cheating and bribery schemes, wrote in a letter to the judge sentencing her husband that her four daughters had suffered from panic attacks since they saw their father arrested. Macarena Huneeus, the wife, said that one daughter not connected to the cheating had nonetheless faced hostility from teachers and students at her high school. Another daughter — who prosecutors have said was aware that her father had paid a proctor to correct her answers on the SAT — had a very difficult year but had been resilient, Ms. Huneeus said. She retook the SAT, and started “at a great college” last fall, she said. In another case, Jack Buckingham, whose mother, Jane Buckingham, pleaded guilty to paying a consultant to get him an inflated score on the ACT, had already been admitted to Southern Methodist University when his mother was arrested. He spoke to the school, which allowed him to enroll based on his authentic scores from a previous administration of the test. He sent a statement last March to The Hollywood Reporter, saying in part: “I know there are millions of kids out there both wealthy and less fortunate who grind their ass off just to have a shot at the college of their dreams. I am upset that I was unknowingly involved in a large scheme that helps give kids who may not work as hard as others an advantage over those who truly deserve those spots.” Several students lost chances to go to elite schools. Ms. Loughlin’s two daughters were enrolled at U.S.C. when Ms. Loughlin and her husband, the fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli, were arrested on charges of conspiring to pay $500,000 in bribes to get the girls admitted to U.S.C. as crew recruits. Neither girl is enrolled now. The younger daughter, Olivia Jade, who had a lucrative career as a social media influencer before the scandal broke, addressed the situation in a YouTube video she posted in early December after a hiatus of more than eight months. In the video, shot in a bedroom, she wrung her hands as she spoke haltingly, acknowledging that she had been “gone for a really long time” and saying that “as much as I wish I could talk about all of this” she was “legally not allowed to speak on anything going on right now.” “I genuinely miss filming,” she said, adding that she felt like “a huge part of me” was not the same. “Thank you so much for your patience, or if you’ve stuck around for nine months just waiting, I really appreciate it,” she said. “This is the best I can do, and I want to move on with my life.”",The New York Times

2020,What Happens When QAnon Seeps From the Web to the Offline World,"A city council member in California took the dais and quoted from QAnon, a pro-Trump conspiracy theory about “deep state” traitors plotting against the president, concluding her remarks, “God bless Q.” A man spouting QAnon beliefs about child sex trafficking swung a crowbar inside a historic Catholic chapel in Arizona, damaging the altar and then fleeing before being arrested. And outside a Trump campaign rally in Florida, people in “Q” T-shirts stopped by a tent to hear outlandish tales of Democrats’ secretly torturing and killing children to extract a life-extending chemical from their blood. What began online more than two years ago as an intricate, if baseless, conspiracy theory that quickly attracted thousands of followers has since found footholds in the offline world. QAnon has surfaced in political campaigns, criminal cases, merchandising and at least one college class. Last month, hundreds of QAnon enthusiasts gathered in a Tampa, Fla., park to listen to speakers and pick up literature, and in England, a supporter of President Trump and the Brexit leader Nigel Farage raised a “Q” flag over a Cornish castle. Most recently, the botched Iowa Democratic caucuses and the coronavirus outbreak have provided fodder for conspiracy mongering: QAnon fans shared groundless theories online linking the liberal billionaire George Soros to technological problems that hobbled the caucuses, and passed around bogus and potentially dangerous “treatments” for the virus. About a dozen candidates for public office in the United States have promoted or dabbled in QAnon, and its adherents have been arrested in at least seven episodes, including a murder in New York and an armed standoff with the police near the Hoover Dam. The F.B.I. cited QAnon in an intelligence bulletin last May about the potential for violence motivated by “fringe political conspiracy theories.” Matthew Lusk, who is running unopposed in the Republican primary for a Florida congressional seat and openly embraces QAnon, said in an email that its anonymous creator was a patriot who “brings what the fake news will not touch without slanting.” As for the theory’s more extreme elements, Mr. Lusk said he was uncertain whether there really was a pedophile ring associated with the deep state. “That being said,” he added, “I do believe there is a group in Brussels, Belgium, that do eat aborted babies.” The seepage of conspiracy theorizing from the digital fever swamps into life offline is one of the more unsettling developments of the Trump era, in which the president has relentlessly pushed groundless conspiracies to reshape political narratives to his liking. In promoting fringe ideas about deep state schemes, Mr. Trump has at times elevated and encouraged QAnon followers — recirculating their posts on Twitter, posing with one for a photograph in the Oval Office, inviting some to a White House “social media summit.” Recently, during a daylong Twitter binge, Mr. Trump retweeted more than 20 posts from accounts that had trafficked in QAnon material. QAnon began in October 2017, when a pseudonymous user of the online message board 4chan started writing cryptic posts under the name Q Clearance Patriot. The person claimed to be a high-ranking official privy to top-secret information from Mr. Trump’s inner circle. Over two years and more than 3,500 posts, Q — whose identity has never been determined — has unspooled a sprawling conspiracy narrative that claims, among other things, that Mr. Trump was recruited by the military to run for office in order to break up a global cabal of pedophiles, and that Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s investigation would end with prominent Democrats being imprisoned at Guantánamo Bay. The anonymous posts subsequently moved to 8chan, where they remained until August, when that site was taken offline after the El Paso mass shooting. They now live on 8kun, a new website built by 8chan’s owner. Some QAnon fans are hardened conspiracy buffs who previously believed other fringe theories, such as the bogus claim that the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks were an “inside job.” But many QAnon adherents are everyday Americans who have found in Q’s messages a source of partisan energy, affirmation of their suspicions about powerful institutions or a feeling of having special knowledge. Some are older adults who discovered the theory through partisan Facebook groups or Twitter threads, and were drawn in by the movement’s promises of inside information from the White House (some QAnon devotees even believe that Mr. Trump posts himself, under the code name “Q+”). Others are seduced by the movement’s wild, often violent fantasies, including claims that Hollywood celebrities are part of a satanic child-trafficking ring. In online chat rooms, Facebook groups and Twitter threads, QAnon followers discuss the hidden messages and symbols they believe to be exposed in Q’s posts, or “drops” — for example, because Q is the 17th letter of the alphabet, a reference by Mr. Trump to the number 17 is seen as a possible signal of his support for them. They watch “Patriots’ Soapbox,” a YouTube call-in show devoted to coverage of QAnon, and other niche media projects that have popped up to fill the demand for Q-related content. Reddit barred a cluster of QAnon groups from its platform in 2018, after a spate of violent threats from members, and Apple pulled a popular QAnon app from its app store. But other social platforms, including Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, still host large amounts of QAnon content. In general, these platforms do not prohibit conspiracy theories unless their adherents break other rules, such as policies against hate speech or targeted harassment. The frequent introduction of new symbols and arcane plot points to dissect and decipher has given QAnon the feel of a theological study group, or a massive multiplayer online game. In interviews, several adherents described QAnon as a “lifestyle” or a “religion,” and said it had become their primary source of political news and analysis. “It’s more of a cult than other conspiracy theories,” said Joseph Uscinski, a political-science professor at the University of Miami who studies fringe beliefs. “QAnon is not just an idea; it’s an ongoing thing that people can sort of get into and follow along with that keeps them entertained.” With its core belief that the president is heroically battling entrenched evildoers, QAnon may be the ultimate manifestation of Trump-inspired conspiracy mongering. From the start, it was inexorably bound up with “Make America Great Again” communities online: The New York Times found last year that some 23,000 of Mr. Trump’s Twitter followers had QAnon references in their profiles. But QAnon has steadily migrated offline to Trump campaign rallies, where dozens of supporters can be found with Q paraphernalia, carrying signs and commiserating about the theory. In recent months, QAnon adherents have complained that security officials keep people from bringing their gear into the rallies; the campaign said it permitted only approved signs and licensed merchandise at its events. Harry Formanek, a 65-year-old retiree who attended Mr. Trump’s Florida rally in November wearing a QAnon T-shirt, said he learned about the theory after hearing allegations that top Democrats were running a child-sex ring out of a Washington pizza parlor — the hoax known as “Pizzagate,” which was something of a precursor to QAnon. Now, he said, he spends roughly an hour a day on QAnon-related websites and believes, among other things, that Mr. Trump signals his support with Q-shaped hand gestures during public appearances. “My friends think I’m crazy,” Mr. Formanek said. “I mean, the proofs are just undeniable.” With its growth in popularity, QAnon’s tangible presence is not limited to clothes, bumper stickers and campaign signs, all of which can be found for sale on Amazon and at other retailers. The theory also showed up at Mesa Community College in Arizona, where an adjunct professor of English, Douglas Belmore, began working it into classroom lectures. He was fired last summer after students complained. Mr. Belmore announced his dismissal on Twitter, saying, “Why aren’t more professors, teachers, cops, pastors, and woke Americans everywhere NOT talking about this?” Later, he tweeted, “I pray that you see The Truth about POTUS and Q and their War against the trafficking of children,” and posted a video clip of Mr. Trump at a rally pointing to a baby wearing a Q onesie. On the campaign trail during the past two years, at least six Republican congressional candidates, as well as several state and local politicians, have signaled some level of interest in QAnon. Danielle Stella, a Republican congressional candidate in Minnesota whose campaign’s Twitter account has “favorited” QAnon material and used a QAnon-related hashtag, was suspended from the platform in November after suggesting that the Democratic incumbent, Ilhan Omar, be hanged for treason. In an email responding to questions about her position on QAnon, Ms. Stella said through a campaign aide: “The decision to side with Twitter regarding my suspension for advocating for the enforcement of federal code proves that The New York Times and Twitter will always side with and fight to protect terrorists, traitors, pedophiles and rapists.” In San Juan Capistrano, Calif., Pam Patterson, a city council member, invoked QAnon in her farewell speech to the body in December 2018, reciting a Q posting as if it were Scripture. “To quote Q No. 2436,” she said, “for far too long, we have been silent and allowed our bands of strength that we once formed to defend freedom and liberty to deteriorate. We became divided. We became weak. We elected traitors to govern us.” Lin Bennett, a state legislator in South Carolina, spoke approvingly of QAnon on social media but later backed away from it, telling Charleston’s Post and Courier newspaper in May, “I got tired of looking at that stuff.” And in Montana, an elected justice of the peace, Michael Swingley, was reprimanded in November by a state judicial board for using his official email account to send an angry message to a journalist who had written an article skeptical of QAnon. Mr. Swingley wrote that, regardless of “whether Q is real,” patriots were uniting because of it and “your world of fake news and liberal agendas that give away our country to foreigners and protect the Clintons and Obamas is coming to an end.” Beyond the mainstreaming of QAnon in certain Republican circles, a bigger concern for researchers who track conspiracy theories is the potential for violence by unstable individuals who fall under its sway, particularly in the fraught political climate of the 2020 election. In its intelligence bulletin identifying QAnon as a potential domestic terror threat, the F.B.I. warned that partisan conspiracy mongering in the United States was being exacerbated by “the uncovering of real conspiracies or cover-ups” by political leaders. Social media was serving as an incubator for groundless theories and inspiring followers to take action, it said. “Although conspiracy-driven crime and violence is not a new phenomenon,” the bulletin said, “today’s information environment has changed the way conspiracy theories develop, spread and evolve.” Mr. Uscinski said that because some people with a conspiracy mind-set are willing to entertain political violence, it was perhaps inevitable that as QAnon attracted a bigger following, it would eventually come to include a dangerous, if tiny, subset of adherents. “Once you reach a threshold of people,” he said, “that particular apple is going to show up in the barrel.” The F.B.I. bulletin cited two episodes it said involved QAnon followers. In one, a 30-year-old Nevada man, Matthew Wright, armed himself with an AR-15-style rifle, a handgun and extra ammunition, and drove an armored truck onto a bridge near the Hoover Dam in June 2018. There, he engaged in a 90-minute standoff with police officers while demanding the release of an inspector general’s report on the government investigation of Hillary Clinton’s email practices. After his arrest, Mr. Wright wrote letters to Mr. Trump and other officials, calling himself a “humble patriot” and making references to the QAnon slogans “Great Awakening” and “Where we go one, we go all.” “I simply wanted the truth on behalf of all Americans,” Mr. Wright wrote, adding that he hoped those “responsible for purposely damaging our beloved country be held accountable and be brought to justice.” In Arizona, the leader of a local veterans-aid group in Tucson, Michael Lewis Arthur Meyer, 39, was arrested in July 2018 after occupying a tower at a cement plant that he insisted was sheltering a child-sex-trafficking ring. Mr. Meyer “alleged a law enforcement cover-up and referenced the QAnon conspiracy theory as he and armed group members searched” for the nonexistent ring, according to the F.B.I. bulletin. After the bulletin was prepared, there were additional incidents in Arizona and Colorado. Timothy Larson, 41, was accused in September of taking a crowbar to the altar inside the Chapel of the Holy Cross in Sedona, while yelling about the Catholic Church and sex trafficking. Mr. Larson’s social media posts are filled with QAnon references and pro-Trump memes. And in December the police in Parker, Colo., charged Cynthia Abcug, 50, with conspiring with fellow QAnon believers to kidnap one of her children, who had been removed from her custody. Ms. Abcug believed her child was being held by Satan worshipers and pedophiles, according to her arrest warrant. Also recently, Anthony Comello, 25, said in a New York City court in December that his belief in QAnon had led him to murder a mob boss, Francesco Cali, who he asserted was part of the deep state cabal working against Mr. Trump. Mr. Comello’s defense lawyer, Robert C. Gottlieb, said in a court filing that after the 2016 election, his client’s family “began to notice changes to his personality” that worsened over time. “Mr. Comello’s support for QAnon went beyond mere participation in a radical political organization,” Mr. Gottlieb wrote. “It evolved into a delusional obsession.”",The New York Times
2020,What Happens When You Get Famous Off One Song?,"Tom Austin released a hit. Now what? We asked him — and Rebecca Black. Credit...Alexander Coggin for The New York Times MILTON KEYNES, England — Last summer, a teenager named Tom Austin decided on a whim to record a rap song. He’d never made music before. But even as he was writing down lyrics — picking out references from an iPhone note of random stuff he’d been keeping — he was strangely sure of himself. “I don’t want to sound bigheaded,” he said, “but I knew it would do bits.” (Translation: Mr. Austin knew the song would connect widely.) The result was “Mary Berry,” a delightful, deadpan ode to life in small-town Britain. The title is a nod to the 84-year-old former “Great British Bake Off” co-host. In the song, Mr. Austin says he “needs a girl like” Ms. Berry; he defeats a local man in badminton; pulls out a secret Android cellphone; performs his own circumcision; threatens to fight the TV host Piers Morgan; flexes his discount Slazenger sneakers; and announces, “Top thing on my bucket list is to slide tackle the Queen.” For his rap alter-ego he borrowed the name Niko Bellic, an Eastern European gangster character from the video game Grand Theft Auto IV. As Mr. Austin later wrote on Instagram: “I decided to make a song within like 2 days and then 3 weeks later I signed a deal for it, now it’s 2mil+ streams across 3 platforms CRUUUD.” This success seems both calculated and hilariously accidental. In the intro to the song, he offhandedly shouts out the flashy East London Afrobeats group NSG; not long after its release, he was touring Britain as their opening act. He’s taking meetings and other “bits and bobs,” Mr. Austin said, and carefully planning a second single with a record label. He is now 19. In 2015, 13-year-old Billie Eilish posted the song “Ocean Eyes” on her SoundCloud and went to bed. She woke up to see it had accumulated thousands of plays overnight. She is now one of the biggest pop stars alive. The 16-year-old rapper Bhad Bhabie has built her career off a catchphrase-minting “Dr. Phil” appearance. The 13-year-old country singer Mason Ramsey has capitalized well off a recorded Walmart yodeling session. Their sudden, culture-saturating music moments would have been impossible before SoundCloud, TikTok, Instagram, YouTube and Twitter. Now the music industry, social media and the influence industry at large are racing to adapt for, and borrow from, such overnight success stories. Tom Austin — or Niko B, for that matter, as he’s now calling himself, possibly to avoid litigation — is nowhere near as well known as Bhad Bhabie or Billie Eilish. His success, to date, is very much niche, and contained within Britain. But he’s at a crossroads each saw for themselves. He made a song. It did bits. What’s next? A decade ago, instant virality could be a curse. Rebecca Black was 13 in 2011 when her uncanny-valley banger “Friday” — written for her in exchange for $4,000 of her mother’s money — exploded. “It took me years to get healed,” she said in a recent interview. “When you’re 13, nobody can explain to you how mentally extreme everything is.” Back then, she had vague dreams of Broadway, but no real career plan. In the years after “Friday,” she fended off all kinds of cynical business entreaties. Now at 22, she’s built a team around her that she trusts. And she’s back making music: “Sweetheart,” her latest release, is available on all streaming platforms. She’s also talking about her experience, and getting very positive reactions. “I had to figure out the long and hard way that nobody can give you this career,” Ms. Black said. “I had to do it in my own way.” In the years since “Friday,” it’s possible audiences have become less judgmental. While there’s still a bit of stigma associated with sudden virality, especially when it feels easily won, maybe we understand now that tunes can come from anywhere. Maybe we got tired of getting upset. Or maybe the latest generation got better at being ready. In the end, Bhad Bhabie has bangers. Mason Ramsey is a legit country radio presence. And Lil Nas X’s path to success was, on a much grander scale, similar to Tom Austin’s. He used meme knowledge and a social media base to turn “Old Town Road” into the longest-running No. 1 single in Billboard history. Ms. Black, as a pioneer, had no idea what was about to hit her. Teen creators now live knowing that any given thing they post might just change their life. On a recent weekday on the high street of the tiny old town of Newport Pagnell, near London, Mr. Austin sat in a foofy coffee shop with a Realtree-style coat zipped to the neck. (He only opened it once, briefly, to remove a single key from a Prada fanny pack surreptitiously strapped to his waist.) He grew up, and still lives, in a humdrum subdivision down the road called the Poets Estate. He and his buddies used to skateboard, break into abandoned places, hang out at the kebab shop. And the rest of the time — “deffo, 100 percent” — he was on the internet. At 8 or 9, that meant building Lego animations on YouTube. (“Like, a skeleton horse chasing a guy,” Mr. Austin said.) By 14 or 15, it was prank calls and mock news channel stuff. He managed to build up a bit of a YouTube following, then switched his attention to Instagram, where he first posted cool-guy fit pics before having a revelation. “Mate, if I’m just showing you what I’m wearing, that’s not gonna get me anywhere. This is Instagram. You can’t deep it,” Mr. Austin said, meaning “take it seriously.” So he pivoted and started posting stuff like “me looking in the mirror, and in the mirror is this really buff guy,” he said. “It was the right turn to make.” Around the same time, inspired by the multi-hyphenate talent Tyler, the Creator, he introduced a clothing label called Crowd; he now sells to customers as far as Dubai. He used to work at a Subway, but quit when a Crowd pop-up netted him more money in one weekend than he’d previously made in a month. He even wrote an elaborate resignation letter: “Thanks to everyone even Carlos bye Marisa I hope I can transfer my sandwich making skills to my future day to day life.” As much as anything, “Mary Berry” was a promo for Crowd. (The video is full of Crowd clothes, and a post-video drop was his best-selling to date.) But it was also born of a generational D.I.Y. ethos: Why not do it? Mr. Austin points to Alex From Glasto, a fellow pasty British teen who won viral fame last summer when he was pulled onstage at Glastonbury by the rapper Dave to perform the hit “Thiago Silva.” Since then, Alex From Glasto has released his own single. “I was like, ‘No offense to him, but if this guy can blow up …” Mr. Austin said, trailing off. The making and release of “Mary Berry” was tied — breathlessly, naturally — with Instagram documentation: edited fake DMs from Drake asking to get on the remix, surreal footage of Mr. Austin surrounded by a platoon of life-size Mary Berry cardboard cutouts. “I did a video of me throwing a basketball out a window and then the Lakers being like ‘yo, we need to sign you right now,’” he said. The first Instagram Story tracking the journey is just captioned “about to become a full time rapper.” He also got friends who are big on Instagram, like @GullyGuyLeo, to post a snippet of the song. Then he landed attention of @ImJustBait, an influential British meme account run by a slick operator named Antz. (According to lore that Mr. Austin repeats reverentially, Antz started it without even having a cellphone. “He used his friend’s phone! Now he’s got, like, the most known Instagram page!”) Antz messaged Mr. Austin, saying, “yo, you’re jokes.” Now Mr. Austin is signed to Antz’s imprint, WEAREBLK, an entity created specifically to avoid the pattern of established labels profiting off viral successes they had no hand in creating. So Mr. Austin is now officially, and accidentally but not accidentally, an independent musician. At an appearance at the taste-making Boiler Room Festival, he heard people sing his lyrics back to him for the first time. His tour with NSG took him to London and Birmingham and Manchester alongside “mad big artists.” “I felt so bad because all these artists put in so much time and I’m just like, ‘what is going on,’” he said. The juvenilia-fueled song made the rounds and even got back to his grandma. (He said she texted him about one of the more anatomically graphic lyrics.) Next up, hopefully, is some money. “My dad’s a builder and he doesn’t work right now, which is tough. And my mum’s a teacher in a special needs school. So pay off my parents debt, that’s the very first goal,” Mr. Austin said. “And after that it’s like — whatever. Literally tomorrow I could try beatboxing, and then, a year from now I could be a really famous beatboxer. Anything I wanna do, I’ll just do it. Cause there’s no reason for me not to do it. So I’ll do it.”",The New York Times
2020,What Has Mike Pence Done in Health?,"In naming him to lead the U.S. coronavirus response, President Trump praised his health policy record, but his biggest accomplishments are ones Republicans have opposed. Get an informed guide to the global outbreak with our daily Coronavirus
 newsletter.
 WASHINGTON — When President Trump announced Wednesday that Vice President Pence would take charge of the nation’s coronavirus response, he repeatedly touted the “great health care” in Indiana during Mr. Pence’s time as governor there, adding, “He’s got a certain talent for this.” So what does Mr. Pence’s record on health care look like? He has no training or expertise in health policy. Paradoxically, the two health initiatives that he got the most attention for in Indiana are actions that many in the Republican Party have strongly opposed. In 2015, he was one of the first Republican governors who agreed to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, a move that others in his party have shunned because of their opposition to the law. That same year, he allowed — albeit reluctantly — a program to provide clean needles for intravenous drug users in a rural county that was in the throes of an HIV outbreak. For weeks, Mr. Pence delayed permitting public health workers to distribute the clean needles to slow the epidemic, stating moral opposition to drug use. He relented as the number of HIV cases approached 100 (they ultimately surpassed 200) and doctors from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention pleaded with him — and after taking a few more nights to “pray on it,” according to Dr. Jerome Adams, the state health commissioner at the time and now the United States surgeon general. Today, his decision to allow a needle exchange — initially only for 30 days — is believed to have played an important role in slowing the epidemic. But while his decision allowed such exchanges to open statewide, no state funding was made available for them. More broadly, critics said that Mr. Pence, like previous Indiana governors, had failed to invest adequately in public health. “All his public health policies in Indiana were more about his beliefs or ideology, and not evidence based or around data,” said Carrie Ann Lawrence, associate director of the Rural Center for AIDS/STD Prevention at Indiana University. As a member of Congress from 2001 to 2013, his deep opposition to abortion led him to initiate efforts to strip federal funding from Planned Parenthood. A Planned Parenthood clinic had been the only place for HIV testing in Scott County, where the outbreak took place. It closed in 2013, largely due to cuts in state public health funding. Updated Feb. 26, 2020 A 2018 study from researchers at the Yale School of Public Health estimated that putting in place a robust public health response, including needle exchanges and stepped-up HIV testing, in 2013, when Mr. Pence took office and opioid abuse was quickly growing in the state, would have averted dozens of HIV cases. Mr. Pence initially refused to expand Medicaid as other, mostly Democratic-led states hurried to do so in 2014, when the Affordable Care Act started giving them the option to do so with the federal government paying nearly all the cost. But he ultimately persuaded the Obama administration to let him expand the program on his own terms, including some that had not been allowed before under federal rules. Mr. Pence designed the plan with Seema Verma, then his top health policy adviser and now the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Under his program, called Health Indiana Plan 2.0, low-income adults above the poverty level had to pay monthly premiums equaling two percent of their household income, instead of receiving care entirely for free. In a first for the Medicaid program, they could be disenrolled for six months if they failed to pay. Newly eligible adults below the poverty level did not have to pay premiums, but got more health benefits if they did. “It gives Hoosiers the dignity to pay for their own health insurance,” Mr. Pence said at the time, “and that transaction is important to starting people on a path toward really embracing greater ownership of their health care.” A state evaluation in 2017 found more than half of those who signed up for the program and were supposed to pay premiums during the first two years failed to do so, most before their coverage even kicked in. Many said the program was confusing as well as unaffordable. Still, from 2013 to 2016, Indiana’s uninsured rate fell by 7 percentage points, more than both the national average decrease of 5.2 percentage points and the 5.5 percentage point decrease in all Medicaid expansion states, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, a health policy research organization. The expansion was approved just in time to provide health coverage to people newly infected with HIV as a result of the outbreak. “Through the Health Indiana Plan model of Medicaid expansion, we learned firsthand the immense value of health insurance as a tool for responding to public health crises,” said Susan Jo Thomas, executive director of Covering Kids and Families of Indiana, a nonprofit group that advocates for health coverage. “We are all grateful that Indiana has the HIP program.” A staunch conservative and evangelical Christian, Mr. Pence was also known for promoting anti-abortion legislation during his time as governor, including a law that, among other things, required that miscarried or aborted fetuses be cremated or interred. Women expressed outrage about the law on social media in a campaign that became known as #periodsforpence. In brief remarks on Wednesday evening after Mr. Trump announced his new role, Mr. Pence mentioned only one experience handling a public health crisis: the first domestic case of Middle East respiratory syndrome, a highly infectious and dangerous virus known as MERS, in 2014, in an Indiana health care worker who had recently returned from Saudi Arabia. At the time, the C.D.C. praised the hospital where the patient had shown up in the emergency room for its infection control, including its rapid isolation of about 50 hospital workers who were exposed to the patient. Mr. Pence’s role was largely receiving updates from the state health department. According to the Fort Wayne Journal Gazette, he also held a news conference at the hospital, in Munster, a few days after the diagnosis, “partly to show that it was safe to be there.” [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]",The New York Times
2020,What I Learned About Filmmaking From These Oscar Nominees,"The right framing, a certain look, a bit of improvisation and some inspiring music all factor into how some of the season’s most interesting scenes came together. You can understand a lot about the moviemaking process by diving into one scene. As this awards season comes to a close, I’m looking back on the conversations I had with directors of a handful of the current Oscar nominees for best picture. Each director used one sequence to help me understand the nuances of what brings the film to life. Below are five lessons gleaned from their craft. transcript “I’m Martin Scorsese. And I made the movie, ‘The Irishman.’” “It is an honor for me to be here tonight to present this award to my dear friend, Mr. Frank Sheeran.” “We’re talking about a sequence that takes place in the Latin Casino. You have this wonderful reception for Frank Sheeran, who, really, it’s a highlight of his life. All the representatives of the power structure of that part of the country are there to celebrate him, supposedly. And it really is obviously— it’s for the union, it’s for Hoffa, and it’s to support Hoffa over Tony Provenzano. And it’s to show his support for Jimmy, and Jimmy’s support for Frank.” [APPLAUSE] “The highlight of my life. Thank you very— very, very much. And this man, James Riddle Hoffa, is the guy that gets the job done.” “Underlying all that, you have the darker elements, which are the men who are in real control of the situation.” “Any case, from the deepest part of my heart, I thank you all. Because I don’t really deserve all this. But I have bursitis, and I don’t deserve that, either.” “The structure of the scene is all about the looks. The dialogue doesn’t matter until you have this extraordinary moment, I think, between Russell and Frank, where Russell gives Frank this special ring that only three people have. And so for me, the playing of the scene had to be weaving all the sense of a celebration, so to speak, or family gathering, weaving all that around these beats, all strung together by the music: Jerry Vale.” ”(SINGING) Please—” “It has a very melodramatic tragedy to it. You know, a sweetness and a sadness at the same time.” ”(SINGING) Say you and your Spanish eyes—” “It’s like you go to an event, and there are factions. There are factions. And one faction may be polite, but they’re not going to be smiling too much. But they’re there. During that time, certain things are said. Looks are given, which are harder than words. But the main look’s Anna Paquin. A whole sequence revolves around Anna’s— Peggy, that is— picking up of the subtext of what’s going on. There is trouble happening. There are problems. And she knows— I mean, particularly even Anna Paquin said, when she did the dancing shot, and she looks over, and she’s says, I never saw looks like that from people. She said it chilled her as a person.” “Only three people in the world have one of these, and only one of them is Irish. I have one, Angelo has one, and now you have one.” “So really it’s about the balancing and the editing of the frames, which encompass medium shots— hardly any close-ups. Usually medium to medium close-up, like right below the shoulders up. That entails seeing a little more of the body language rather than giant close-ups. The reason for that is the atmosphere and the environment around them has to be present in the frame, because that affects them. And there you see them in that environment and that atmosphere. If it’s too close, I think you objectify it in a way. You push the audience away. But one of the hardest things to do was to get them in the frame in the wide shot, looking down, as Jerry Vale is singing in the background. They’re like the gods overlooking this world that they created in a way. There’s one shot— from their point of view, with a long lens— of Jimmy walking around and suddenly saying hello to Angelo Russo, played by Harvey Keitel. The reason is a personal reason. And that was that Harvey Keitel and Al Pacino were never in the same frame together in any movie.” “Things have gotten that with our friend again. And some people are having serious problems with him. And it’s at a point where you’re going to have to talk to him and tell him it’s what it is.” “Once I settled on the size of the frame and the size of the people in the frame, I know that, then, it was really myself and my editor, Thelma, in the editing room, playing with the dialogue and playing with the looks and the pauses— the pauses and the silences.” “These are the higher-ups.” “Well, he’s a higher-up, too. I mean, there’s no one—” “Not like this. You know that. Oh, come on, Frank. If they can whack a president, they can whack a president of the union. You know it, and I know it.” Yes, there is plenty of dialogue in Martin Scorsese’s epic “The Irishman.” And yet, much of its dramatic impact comes from characters’ silences. In a conversation with Scorsese, I learned about how much tension can be created through an actor’s expressions and subtle cues, rather than spoken lines. For a celebration sequence honoring the lead character, Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro), the director explained that “the structure of the scene is all about the looks.” In one key moment, Frank’s daughter Peggy (Anna Paquin) notices mobsters eyeing the union leader Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino), whom they want removed from power. Scorsese said the actress told him while doing the scene, “I never saw looks like that from people.” With dialogue secondary, Scorsese builds the scene through “the balancing of the editing of the frames, which encompass medium shots, hardly any close-ups,” he said. This allows viewers to see more of the characters’ body language and their environment, which has an impact on their decisions. transcript “Hello, this is Bong Joon Ho, director of ‘Parasite.’ This is the story about infiltration. One family infiltrates to other family. This is in the middle of that process. —that kind of moment.” “Simply speaking, it’s just something like ‘Mission: Impossible,’ the TV series when I was a little kid. I was a huge fan. And this some kind of nerdy family version of ‘Mission: Impossible.’” “In this moment for the young son, he is kind of manipulator. He controls everything. And he has a plan. When they rehearse, it looks like a kind of filmmaking. It is like the son is director, the father is the actor.” “I intentionally shoot those shots very quickly and some very spontaneous reaction and sudden, small, improvised. And something happened very naturally. Rolling the camera, that kind of momentary feeling is very important.” In the thriller “Parasite,” the patriarch Kim Ki-taek (Song Kang Ho) says to his son, “You know what plan never fails? No plan at all.” He continues, “With no plan, nothing can go wrong.” While the director Bong Joon Ho meticulously planned his construction of the film, one particular scene took more of an improvisational approach. In that sequence, Ki-taek is rehearsing the lines he will use to manipulate the wealthy family he is working for, while his son, Ki-woo (Choi Woo Shik), coaches him on the lines. The scene is a bit of an inside joke for Korean audiences because Song is a renowned actor in the country, while Choi is an up-and-comer. Bong said, “It’s as if Ansel Elgort is teaching acting to Al Pacino.” But the director said he shot this part of the scene quickly and had the actors improvise some of the dialogue, to create a kind of “momentary feeling,” which was very important to the spontaneous way parts of the sequence played. transcript Hi, this is Todd Phillips. I’m the director of “Joker.” So this scene is interesting because it’s right after a life-changing cataclysmic event in Arthur’s life, and he’s found this little kind of rundown park bathroom to go in and collect his thoughts and get himself together. What’s interesting about this scene to me is it’s entirely different than what we had scripted. In the script, Arthur was to come into the bathroom, hide his gun, wash off his makeup, and staring at himself in the mirror like what have I done. And when we got to the set on the day, Joaquin and I just sort of stood around like, this doesn’t really seem very Arthur. Why would Arthur care to hide his gun? And we really kind of tossed around a million ways to just do something different. And it was about an hour into it and I said, hey, you know, I got this piece of music from Hildur. Hildur Gudnadottir is our composer, and she’d been sending me music throughout, while we were shooting. And I just wanted to play Joaquin this piece of music. And Joaquin just started to dance to the music, and it was just me and him alone in the bathroom. There’s 250 people on the crew waiting outside. And he just starts doing this dance, and we both kind of look at each other and said, O.K., that’s the scene. It made sense to us because when I first met with Joaquin and we first started talking about “Joker,” I talked to him that Arthur is one of those people that has music in him. So music and dance became a theme in the film. And this is the second time we see him dancing, and it’s a little bit of Joker coming out, a little bit more than the scene before and a little bit less than the next time we see him dance. [MUSIC PLAYING] Often in movies, the score is not ready until after production is complete. But for this scene in “Joker,” in which Arthur (Joaquin Phoenix) does a haunting dance in a park bathroom and begins to find his Joker self, the score inspired its direction. Speaking about the moment, the director Todd Phillips said the scene was scripted differently than what was ultimately shot. On the set, he and Phoenix didn’t think the scripted version was working, but Phillips thought about some music he had received from the composer Hildur Gudnadottir. He said he played it for Phoenix, who then started to dance to it organically: “We both kind of looked at each other and said, ‘O.K., that’s the scene.’” transcript “Hi, I’m Noah Baumbach, and I’m the director of ‘Marriage Story.’” “What I love about Charlie— Charlie is undaunted.” “This is the second part of the two opening montages that begin the movie. The first is Charlie talking about Nicole. Then here is Nicole saying what I love about Charlie.” “Charlie eats like he’s trying to get it over with and like there won’t be enough food for everyone. A sandwich is to be strangled while devoured.” “And so I thought it was a kind of interesting way to establish these characters but also create a kind of rhythm for the movie that will both continue throughout the movie, but it’s also going to alter and change once we find out that this couple is getting divorced. I also sort of thought of this section a little bit like an overture in a musical. It’s almost like we’re establishing all the themes of the movie before the movie begins, in a sense. Randy Newman did this beautiful score with this chamber orchestra that establishes the musical themes for the movie too. We’re going to revisit these themes later on in the movie. And sometimes these moments can be difficult to shoot because they’re so small. Like if you’re setting up a big scene in a movie, you’re sort of starting at the beginning. You’re going to the end. When you do these little moments, you’re kind of capturing people in the middle. And so, for instance, the Monopoly sequence, we’re kind of setting up a whole Monopoly game even though they know the moment that’s going to be in the movie. But you’re kind of trying to capture something spontaneous and ordinary, but you know you’re only going to use seconds of it.” The drama “Marriage Story” begins with two montages, with each of the lead characters (Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson) discussing what they love about the other person. We see scenes of their domestic life as they talk in voice-over. The writer-director Noah Baumbach said he thought of the sequence “like an overture in a musical. It’s almost like we're establishing all the themes of the movie, before the movie begins.” Although this is the movie’s start, for it to work, Baumbach said it was important to capture people in the middle of moments. He wanted to paint a picture of an ongoing domestic life, which meant setting up and shooting long scenes, only to use a few seconds to capture the emotional beats. transcript “I’m Greta Gerwig, and I directed and wrote the screenplay for ‘Little Women.’” “Jo, would you like to dance with me?” “So this is “Laurie” Lawrence and Jo March. And they’re hiding in a back room at a party, and they’re talking about maybe trying to dance. And obviously, this is Saoirse Ronan and Timothée Chalamet, who I adore.” “You can laugh if you want to. It’s funny, I know.” “I have an idea of how we manage.” “And then they dance. Well, they’re going to dance outside. And it’s the book that Laurie and Jo dance wildly, they say. But I was looking for a hallway while we were scouting. Because it’s in a hallway in the book. And I wanted a long hallway, and I had this idea for how it would look. But I couldn’t find one. And then I just kept coming back to this location because I liked it. And then I came back at night, and I thought, oh, you could see the dancers through the window, and then see them outside as these figures having their little party on the porch. And my choreographer, who’s very wonderful, Monica Bill Barnes— she created this dance with Saoirse and Timothée. And I wanted it to feel both totally modern and period accurate, in terms of I didn’t want them to be doing dances that they wouldn’t necessarily know. But I did want to feel joyful and young, like kids dance. And this is part of the story that takes place in their childhood, obviously. And it has this very snow globe quality. I wanted everything to feel very shimmery and very beautiful. And we shot with a certain filter to give it that feeling. And it has this warmth. We called it this golden glow that we were going for. And every part of it looks like a painting, but also an ornament. And this is, of course, Laura Dern as Marmee. And this is the first time you’re really inside the March house, looking at it through Laurie’s eyes, and seeing this kind of glorious female utopia. And the actors— I wanted them all to be speaking over each other, which took a lot of coordination, a lot of rehearsal to get this choreographed chaos going.” “I enjoy baking in the middle of the night. And don’t mind the clutter, Mr. Lawrence, we don’t.” “Laurie, please.” “But I just wanted it to be this cacophony of words and sounds, and everybody’s doing something, and there’s all these little moments. I looked at a lot of Altman thinking about it. Because he always has a way of creating spaces with lots of people and lots of activity. And I thought one of the beautiful things about ‘Little Women’ is the way the male characters hold the space for who women are without a spectator. And he’s looking at them, but they’re existing naturally, and he loves them because of who they are. And I think Timothée does such a beautiful job, and these girls are so wonderfully loud. And then this kind of position of this magical house that looks like a little mushroom coming out of the ground, but inside it’s like a jewel box when you open it up.” Greta Gerwig’s adaptation of “Little Women"" sticks with the novel’s period, but is imbued with lively touches that feel up-to-date. One of those can be found when Jo March (Saoirse Ronan) and Theodore “Laurie” Laurence (Timothée Chalamet) dance together. Because she’s accidentally burned her dress, they’re alone on the porch, bathed in the light of the bigger dance happening behind them. The choreography by Monica Bill Barnes has a youthful buoyancy that makes it almost float right off the screen. It’s a little punk rock yet a little classic. “I wanted it to feel both totally modern and period accurate,” Gerwig said. She was inspired by a “Saturday Night Live” sketch with Gilda Radner and Steve Martin that captured the same spirit. “For our film,” Gerwig said, “we wanted it to be this shimmery moment that feels like maybe it almost didn’t even happen.”",The New York Times
2020,What I Spent to Adopt My Child,"Three families share their adoption stories, illuminating the variety of choices — and costs — involved in the process. This piece is part of “The Price of Modern Parenting.” Read about the sandwich generation, caring for aging relatives and out-of-pocket expenses for preterm births. Each adoption process shares the same ultimate purpose: to unite children who need families with those that want children. Yet, despite this common goal, the price tag of adoption in the United States varies widely. The cost depends on what path you choose: If adopting through the public foster care system, your total out-of-pocket expenses can be next to nothing. If you hope to adopt a newborn, however, the cost can reach $45,000 or sometimes higher if you’re adopting from outside the country. [What to know before adopting a child] There are two main paths to adopt an infant in the United States: through a lawyer, often referred to as an “independent adoption,” or through an agency. An independent adoption can cost $15,000 to $40,000, according to the Child Welfare Information Gateway, a federal service. These fees typically cover a birth mother’s medical expenses, legal representation for adoptive and birth parents, court fees, social workers and more. Prospective parents will also be responsible for finding a birth mother, a process that can involve advertising on websites and in print ads. “Fees can be from several hundred for low-cost advertising up to tens of thousands of dollars,” said Colleen Quinn, a private adoption attorney working in Virginia. When adopting through an agency, costs can vary by state, ranging from $20,000 to $45,000, according to the Child Welfare Information Gateway. That covers organizational, legal and medical expenses. And all agencies operate differently, “so be sure to carefully review what is and is not covered in their rate prior to signing with them,” said Molly Rampe Thomas, founder of Choice Network, an agency based in Ohio. Here are the stories of three families who pursued adoption through different paths. Their stories help illuminate the variety of choices — and costs — facing adoptive parents. When Marc Koenigsberg, 45, and Robb Layne, 40, first met the 9-year-old boy who would become their son, they spent the day playing catch in a park, flanked by social workers. “It was such a contrived situation,” Koenigsberg said. “He originally seemed very shy and uninterested in us.” On their drive home, however, the young boy surprised them. “So when are you going to adopt me?” he asked from the back seat. Koenigsberg, a lawyer, not usually at a loss for words, managed an answer about needing to make sure “the fit” was right for everybody, to which the boy responded, confidently: “It’s a good fit.” [The topics parents are talking about. Evidence-based guidance. Personal stories that matter. Sign up now to get NYT Parenting in your inbox every week.] “My heart must have stopped in that moment,” said Koenigsberg. After serving as his foster parents for nearly a year, Koenigsberg and Layne legally adopted the young boy in December 2009 with the help of Sierra Forever Families, a nonprofit agency operating in 12 counties in California. The couple, who recently celebrated their 14th wedding anniversary, said they always planned to form their family through adoption. “I don’t know my biological family,” said Layne, who was raised by adoptive parents. “So who better equipped to adopt than me?” They researched various paths — including private and international adoption — but decided to work within foster care because of what Layne described as the system’s “unparalleled network of resources and support.” The federal government subsidizes the costs of adopting through the public foster care system, up to $2,000. Once a child is officially placed in their care, foster parents receive a monthly stipend to help offset the costs of childrearing until the child turns 18 (or 21 in certain states). Those who are matched with “hard to place” children, such as those who are older or have special needs, may qualify for additional financial support. Koenigsberg and Layne received $1,000 a month from the state of California after their adoption was finalized. They dedicated half of this money for day-to-day costs, like medical copays, clothes and piano lessons. The other half they put into a college savings account, which totaled $60,000 by the time their son, now 20, enrolled in college. Yet Layne stressed that this financial assistance had little to do with their decision to pursue foster care. “I would hate for anyone to choose this simply because it’s the cheapest option,” he said. The real advantage, he said, was the additional resources offered to families who adopt through the foster-care system. Though it varies by state, this support can include things like continued access to health care coverage, educational vouchers, waivers and post-adoption support, said Rita Soronen, president and chief executive officer of the Dave Thomas Foundation for Adoption. When asked to total the out-of-pocket expenses the couple allocated toward their adoption, Layne said, “At the risk of sounding glib — gas money. Otherwise, nothing. No processing fees, or surprise $1,000 bills here and there, and that’s very typical of the foster care experience.” When Jacqui Hunt was 18 and living in California, she gave birth to a baby boy and placed him for adoption. “I just wasn’t prepared to be a single parent at that point in my life,” Hunt, now 53, said. “It’s not something my family, or society, would have accepted at the time.” Over 30 years later, she is happily embracing parenthood on her own — this time as an adoptive parent herself in New York City. “I’ve kind of come full circle on the issue,” she said. Like many parents by way of adoption, Hunt spent many years trying, and failing, to conceive. Eventually, she turned to adoption, looking first into the foster care system. She quickly learned, however, that New York was among the 25 states requiring foster parents to provide any child older than an infant — which represent the overwhelming majority of those in foster care — with their own bedroom. To qualify, she’d need to move from her studio apartment, in the Washington Heights neighborhood of Manhattan, to a larger unit. For Hunt, a public school teacher, a two-bedroom apartment in New York — where the average rent for a two-bedroom is $3,390, according to the real estate site Zumper — was cost prohibitive. Though a private adoption would be more expensive, Hunt reasoned that it would still be cheaper in the end since she could remain in her more affordable apartment for the foreseeable future. She had $20,000 in savings that she planned to dedicate toward the adoption fee, and figured she’d take out a loan to cover the balance. Initially, she signed up with Adoption Star, a nonprofit agency with an office in a suburb of Buffalo, N.Y. She was roughly $13,000 into the process — allocated toward an adoption consultant, educational seminars, initial agency fees and travel — when she learned Spence-Chapin, an agency in Manhattan, was accepting applications. Hunt decided to switch agencies to help cut down on travel time and costs. She also preferred the flat-fee structure of Spence-Chapin, which services just New York and New Jersey and charged $36,000 start to finish at the time (its rate increased to $46,000 as of 2019). At Adoption Star, which works nationally, fees vary based on the state where the adoption is completed. Eventually, Hunt matched with a newborn girl who exhibited certain risk factors. As an incentive for prospective parents to consider matching with children with “special needs,” like ongoing therapeutic or medical attention, Spence-Chapin waives professional fees. In Hunt’s instance, this led to a discount of $15,000. And at a local adoption event, she learned of the scholarship program HelpUsAdopt.org — one of the few grant organizations that accepts applications from single parents — through which she was awarded $13,000. After the grant and the Spence-Chapin exemption, Hunt ultimately spent $20,500 for her adoption — including the initial costs toward Adoption Star — almost precisely the amount she had in savings to cover the costs. “It was a tumultuous path that got me here, but I don’t regret a thing,” she said. “My daughter is the joy of my life.” Married since 2006, Deirdre and James Parker-Young haven’t been on a dinner date in nearly four years, they said. They haven’t taken a single vacation during this time, either. And they’ve relied on one car to negotiate the schedules of their demanding jobs — she a preschool teacher and he a logistician for the Navy. The motivation for their penny pinching: to gain the approval of the social worker conducting their adoption home study. [Two jobs, two new parents: how to negotiate your new reality] Deirdre, 38, and James, 39, attribute their long-held interest in adoption to their upbringings. “Growing up, it wasn’t unusual to have a neighborhood kid who needed a place to stay for a bit come live with us for awhile,” Deirdre said, adding that adoption “is just something we’ve always wanted to do.” It came as a surprise, however, that they would have to tighten their budget so severely to be able to adopt. Deirdre and James also worked with Spence-Chapin, planning to adopt an infant through the agency’s domestic program. But the couple, who live in Washington, D.C., learned that program is available only to prospective parents in New York and New Jersey, so they instead decided to apply to its South Africa program, which works with parents nationally. Most countries require adoptive parents to travel to the country of origin to finalize the adoption. The number of trips and length of stay required will vary by country, as will adoption program fees. There are also additional court fees for immigration processing. The total cost of an international adoption can fall between $20,000 to $50,000, according to the Child Welfare Information Gateway. The South Africa program would require the couple to spend at least six weeks abroad to complete the process, but it also had the potential to be less expensive than a domestic adoption. Spence-Chapin estimates the costs of adopting through the South Africa program to be just over $18,000. Every adoptive parent must complete a home study, though the process differs by state, agency and the type of adoption. Most home studies take three to six months, and will include several visits from a caseworker, criminal and financial background checks, and physical and mental health assessments. Those pursuing international adoption, however, will need to satisfy the requirements of both countries, which can complicate the process. For Deirdre and James, this meant making some major adjustments to their finances. Deirdre owed $105,500 in student loans, prompting the social worker to deny their home-study approval. Spence Chapin paired the couple with a free consultant from Your Adoption Finance Coach, a company that helps prospective adoptive parents create financial plans to fund their adoption. “They told us it was going to be an uphill climb, and would take longer than normal to get approval, but that it was doable,” James said. So the couple cut costs, and Deirdre worked a second job during the summers. Eventually, they saved more than $20,000, and paid down $40,000 worth of student loan and credit card debt. They also bought their first home. “I think that’s what put us over the edge,” Deirdre said. Shortly after completing their home study, Spence-Chapin matched the couple with a 2-year-old boy, whom they officially adopted in May 2019. Start to finish, the couple estimates the adoption cost them $21,000. “It’s been the joy of our lives,” Deirdre said, when asked if all the belt tightening had been worth it. But, she admitted, it was nice to finally be able to eat out again — now as a family of three.

2020,What I Wanted to Say in ‘The Inheritance.’ And What I Didn’t.,"Matthew Lopez on what inspired his two-part play about gay culture in the wake of AIDS, and the limits of “affirmative representation.” Theatergoers of different generations have had passionate responses to “The Inheritance,” Matthew Lopez’s two-part play about gay culture and the legacy of AIDS. The show was celebrated in its original runs in London, but the reception has been more divided on Broadway, both among professional critics and regular attendees. While many have found the show inordinately moving, others have criticized a lack of diversity in the central cast and narrow representation of contemporary gay life. We asked Lopez to write about what inspired the play and to reflect on why some audience members don’t like what they see. In March 2018, my play “The Inheritance” began performances in London. Until its first preview, it was anyone’s guess how it would be received. A reimagining of E.M. Forster’s “Howards End” — using three generations of gay New Yorkers to explore class, community and the legacy of H.I.V. — hardly bears the makings of an obvious hit. And yet audiences, then critics, embraced the play. Since then, over 200,000 ticket-buyers have seen the play in its three productions, two in London and now on Broadway. Almost every one of those people, whether belonging to or allied with the L.G.B.T.Q. community, has a story to share relating to its themes. I have heard from many of them — people who, after seeing the play, have healed broken relationships with their queer children, have decided to save their lives by seeking help for addiction, have finally put away their grief over those they lost during the epidemic. My journey to writing it began when I was 15 years old, watching the Merchant Ivory film adaptation of “Howards End.” Somehow a gay Puerto Rican kid from the Florida panhandle was able to see some part of his experience reflected back in the story of the Schlegel sisters. He could identify with scenes of Londoners making sense of life at the turn of the last century, and even find a version of his abuela in the character of Ruth Wilcox. I fell madly in love with Forster that day. We are an unlikely couple. But, besides my marriage, it has been the happiest union of my life. At least Forster doesn’t make me go buy eggs at 7 in the morning. In writing “The Inheritance,” I wanted to take my favorite novel and retell it in a way that its closeted author never felt free to do in his lifetime. I wanted to write a play that was true to my experience, my philosophy, my heart as a gay man who has enjoyed opportunities that were denied Forster. It was my attempt to explain myself to the world as a gay man of my particular generation. I wasn’t attempting to create a generationally defining work of theater that spoke for the entire queer experience. I think that if I had started with that intention, I never would have finished. There are some who feel the play should have done just that, and who fault me for not painting on a broader canvas. Those responses led me to wonder: What do we expect from art, particularly when it is made by members of our own community? And, conversely, what are the responsibilities of artists to the communities to which they belong? Art can be expected to hold a mirror up to society, but it cannot be expected to hold a mirror up to every individual who is engaging with it. Even with its long running time, there is a lot “The Inheritance” does not and cannot cover. No one piece of writing about our complex, sprawling community will ever tell the entire story, and I believe that is a good thing: It creates an unquenchable thirst for more and more narratives — a thirst that has been evident in audiences for “The Inheritance” and a thirst that the theater, television and film industries have been too slow to satisfy. “The Inheritance” was not my attempt at a grand summation of the past quarter century of queer history. What I was attempting was an examination of class, economic inequality, and poverty within the gay community — issues I have rarely seen depicted in theater. I have painted on a broad canvas. It is simply not the canvas others might have chosen. I wanted to write about addiction and alcoholism — a disease I have struggled with, and an epidemic that plagues our community just as perniciously as H.I.V./AIDS did 30 years ago. I also wanted to write about sex: how it can be used as a vehicle for pleasure and intimacy, but how it is also used as a tool to cauterize pain. Such examinations run counter to our current desire for affirmative representation. But avoidance of uncomfortable truths is not the role of the artist. Healing is impossible if you don’t understand the cause of the injury. And while I examine race in “The Inheritance,” it is not one of its central themes. This is a decision for which I have been criticized, but it is a decision that I made consciously as a person of color. It is a consideration that is not asked of white writers, but it is one that writers of color must face with every project we begin. Responsibility to community is the first question we must answer for ourselves. I believe that in writing honestly about my experience as a gay man, I have also contributed one more example of what it means to be a Puerto Rican man. I have been asked by some why I didn’t write “The Inheritance” from a Latinx perspective. It is a question that reveals to me just how far we have to go in understanding the true nature of diversity of expression. I answer: Can you not see how, by virtue of the fact that I have written it, “The Inheritance” is a reflection of a Latinx perspective? It reminds me of Sonia Sotomayor’s formulation that “a wise Latina woman with the richness of her experience would, more often than not, reach a better conclusion” than her white colleagues. Justice Sotomayor is not given only the Puerto Rican cases to decide; she helps decide all the cases. And her decisions are based just as much on her knowledge of the law as it is by her experiences as a Puerto Rican woman. The same is true for “The Inheritance” and me. It is because I am Puerto Rican that “The Inheritance” is the play it is, not in spite of it. Eric Glass, my central character, may be a white man, but he is a white man who was created by a Puerto Rican one. That has fundamentally informed his journey through the play. Others have questioned why there isn’t more representation of the younger generation in the play. It is true that most of the characters are near or close to my age. That is partly due to the function of adaptation — the Schlegel sisters (who became the mid-30s boyfriends Eric Glass and Toby Darling) are, after all, the central characters in “Howards End.” It is also a function of my own perspective. I wrote mostly about people in their 30s because that’s the experience I was living as I wrote the play. There is a reason, however, that I chose to end the play in the future, focusing on the creative output of the youngest and most marginalized character in the play. I end “The Inheritance” with the acknowledgment that the future has yet to be written — and when it is, it will be written by the youngest among us. My hope is that, while not presuming to speak for the younger generation, I have spoken to it, and that its members might come to the play in an attempt to understand the life of someone who came before them, and who, for better or worse, through his words and actions helped shape the world that they will inherit.",The New York Times
2020,What Is Your Reaction to the Results of the Iowa Caucuses?,"student opinion Who do you think was the big winner on the night? Who was the biggest loser? How do you think the results will impact the rest of the presidential race? Find all our Student Opinion questions here. The 2020 presidential primary season began with the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 3. How much have you been paying attention to the presidential campaign? Do you discuss it with your friends and family or in school? Do you have a favorite candidate or issue? Although Iowa has only 41 out of the 1,990 delegates needed to win the Democratic nomination, it is seen as critical in “creating the kind of momentum that can propel a candidate into New Hampshire, Nevada, South Carolina and beyond with a burst of enthusiasm. After an embarrassing 20-hour delay, the Iowa Democratic Party released its first set of results from 62 percent of caucus precincts on Feb. 4. (You can find the latest results here.) Who do you think was the big winner on the night? Who was the biggest loser? How do you think the results will impact the rest of the presidential race? In “Iowa Democrats Release Partial Caucus Results, but No Winner Yet,” Alexander Burns and Shane Goldmacher write: Democratic officials in Iowa on Tuesday provided a measure of clarity to the muddled outcome of its statewide caucuses, releasing a delayed first wave of partial results that showed Pete Buttigieg and Senator Bernie Sanders with a preliminary lead and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. falling well behind the other top-tier candidates. The release of the partial data, which accounted for 71 percent of caucus precincts, came after a night and day of suspense, confusion and silence from the Iowa Democratic Party after major problems with its new results reporting system. Even as the party began preparing to release the partial results on Tuesday afternoon, it drew sharp criticism from several campaigns that wanted a complete result, either to have a definitive outcome or frame their Iowa performance in the best possible light. While the results of Monday night’s caucuses could change with more data, the highly competitive race between Mr. Buttigieg, a moderate, and Mr. Sanders, a liberal, reflected the divisions among Democrats about the ideological direction of the party, and sets up a crucial test for both wings of the party in the New Hampshire primary, on Feb. 11, where Mr. Sanders leads in the polls. The partial Iowa results also showed Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts in third place, with Mr. Biden trailing her by several points and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota behind him. Yet there was little evidence in the data released Tuesday that any candidate was on the way to the kind of dominant victory that would have a good chance of transforming the Democratic race. No one appeared on track to receive more than about a quarter of the vote, and five held support in the double digits — a further indication that the Iowa caucuses were unlikely to play a decisive role in deciding the Democratic nominee. Several other candidates, including Andrew Yang and Tom Steyer, registered about 1 percent support or less. The article continues: The halting and hectic process in Iowa was an unsightly spectacle for the Democratic Party at the start of its presidential nominating process, offering President Trump an easy target for gloating and ridicule and raising serious questions about whether Iowa would be allowed to retain its first-in-the-nation status in future elections. Troy Price, the chairman of the Iowa Democratic Party, appeared downcast on Tuesday as he described the process as “unacceptable” in remarks to reporters. “As chair of the party, I apologize deeply for this,” he said. Mr. Price repeatedly stressed that the data was accurate and said the security of the returns was his “paramount concern.” The returns posted on Tuesday largely mirrored the scenario that the leading presidential campaigns detected during the caucuses, gathering precinct-level information on their own and in some cases releasing it to the media to make up for the void of hard results. Should the rest of the Iowa results mostly mirror the data published on Tuesday, it could represent a significant embarrassment for Mr. Biden, who entered the race as a front-runner last spring but has struggled mightily in recent months to compete with fresher-faced and more liberal rivals in both Iowa and New Hampshire. For a period in January, his campaign had grown hopeful that he had a chance of winning Iowa and establishing early dominance, but by caucus night that seemed a remote prospect. Mr. Biden is aiming to retake control of the race later in February, when the competition moves to Nevada and South Carolina, two far more diverse states long seen as friendly to his candidacy. But first he may have to explain his Iowa slump to the political donors whose support he needs to compete in the larger primary states that vote at the beginning of March. Students, read the entire article, then tell us: What is your reaction to the results of the Iowa caucuses? Who do you think was the big winner on the night? Who was the biggest loser? How do you think the results will impact the rest of the presidential race? What is your reaction to the delays in reporting the results of the caucuses? How do you think the confusion and delays around the results will affect the Democratic Party and its presidential candidates? Do you think the 2020 presidential race is an important one? Do you think it will have a big impact on you, your family and your community? In “The Trouble With Iowa,” David Leonhardt questions why the small state always gets to go first in the primary season: The combined population of Iowa and New Hampshire is 87 percent non-Hispanic white, which is roughly what the United States was in 1870. The states are also disproportionately older and completely lacking in cities with more than 250,000 residents. And yet Iowa and New Hampshire are treated like a national microcosm every four years and given outsize influence in choosing the president. This makes no sense. I know the usual justifications — that the states’ citizens take their democratic responsibilities seriously. But when you boil down that argument to its essence, it’s really an argument claiming that Iowans and New Hampshirites are intellectually and morally superior to other Americans. Do you agree with Mr. Leonhardt that it is unfair that such a small, and primarily white, state should always go first? Or, do you think Iowa should continue to go first and play a pivotal role in the nomination process? We know it is very early in the process, but go out on a limb and make a big prediction: Who will win the 2020 Democratic nomination? Students 13 and older are invited to comment.

2020,Will There Be a Brokered Convention? Here’s What’s Happened Before,"Senator Bernie Sanders is surging. Democratic Party leaders are nervous. And his rivals are hanging on, raising speculation about a brokered or contested convention. Every four years, party strategists, political junkies and, well, reporters ponder the question, some with dread and others with relish: Is this the year we will finally see a brokered convention? It has been nearly 70 years since there was a true nominating fight on the convention floor, with candidates nervously waiting for delegates to go through rounds of voting to pick the eventual candidate. Since then, both parties have made rule changes for picking and counting delegates to avoid that situation, primarily because a nominee in a brokered convention very rarely goes on to win the general election. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont is leading the Democratic delegate race so far, and seems poised to continue his successful primary run. But none of his seven competitors appear willing to drop out and party leaders continue to fret about a Sanders candidacy, increasing apprehension about a suspenseful convention in Milwaukee, rather than the predictable media event Americans have grown used to. The goal at this year’s Democratic convention is simple: capture a clear majority — 1,991, to be precise — of the 3,979 pledged delegates. Decades ago, party bosses controlled how delegates voted, but the primary system has been democratized so that voters ultimately pick the nominee. Still, if a candidate goes into the convention with doubts about his or her viability, chaos can ensue. Here’s what history suggests could happen. Brokered and contested are often used interchangeably, but there are distinctions. A brokered convention happens when a candidate fails to win a majority of delegates after the first round of voting, something that has not occurred with either party since 1952. Delegates then keep voting until a nominee is picked. In between votes, horse trading and negotiating may go on behind the scenes, with candidates promising each other the vice presidency or another job in exchange for dropping out. A contested convention is when a candidate has a lead but is not guaranteed to secure the nomination after the first ballot, said Elaine C. Kamarck, a former member of the Democratic National Committee. The last Democrat who won the general election after multiple rounds of voting at the convention was Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1932. For Republicans, it was Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1952. Both contested and brokered conventions hinder “the candidate’s general ability to show they have a united party behind them,” said Suzanne Chod, associate professor of political science at North Central College. This year, especially, Democrats should fear either one, she said. “The No. 1 thing on the mind of current primary voters is beating the current president, and the last thing they should want is a contested convention,” Professor Chod said. “Even if it could be fun to watch.” For more than a century, party leaders like governors, senators and mayors controlled the delegates and picked the nominee. Most candidates saw traveling the country to seek voter and delegate support as a waste of time. Senator Estes Kefauver learned this in 1952, when he campaigned for the Democratic nomination, said Ms. Kamarck, who wrote a book about primaries and is now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. Mr. Kefauver, a Tennessee liberal who led congressional hearings into organized crime, tried to convert his fame into a successful presidential run. He won 12 of 15 primaries before the July convention, handily defeating his opponent, Adlai Stevenson. But the hearings that made him famous also took down several prominent Democrats. Resentful party bosses instructed their delegates to pick Mr. Stevenson, who won the nomination after three rounds of voting but lost in the fall to Eisenhower. Voters did not replace party bosses until after the disastrous 1968 Democratic convention in Chicago, where antiwar activists gathered in the streets to protest, in part, the nomination of Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey, who was seen as the establishment candidate. Mr. Humphrey had campaigned only for delegates while his opponents, Senators Eugene McCarthy and Robert Kennedy, sought the support of primary voters. Mr. Kennedy, who was seen as Mr. Humphrey’s strongest rival, was assassinated before the convention. Mr. Humphrey cruised to the nomination, but protesters were beaten in front of reporters on the streets — and the violent images revealed a deeply divided party. By 1972, Democrats had changed the rules so that when candidates won primaries, they were apportioned a certain number of pledged delegates based on the percentage of the vote they received. For the first time, voters had a real say in the nominee, Ms. Kamarck said. “Primaries become binding instead of merely beauty contests,” she said. In 1980, President Jimmy Carter went into the convention having won the majority of delegates over Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, who had challenged him during the primary. But Mr. Kennedy would not accept defeat. At the convention, he and his operatives moved to persuade delegates to leave Mr. Carter, arguing that delegates should be free to switch allegiances. “It was wild, totally, totally wild,” said Ms. Kamarck, who was a 30-year-old party employee at the time. “It was an all-out assault on President Carter by Senator Kennedy.” Delegations broke out into arguments on the floor. One Kennedy supporter marched to the lectern to scream at a Carter operative when credentials for Kennedy supporters failed to arrive. The sergeant-at-arms had to separate them, Ms. Kamarck recalled. Finally, Mr. Kennedy abandoned the effort — but humiliated Mr. Carter toward the end of the convention. Mr. Carter wanted the senator to join him onstage so they could hold hands as a sign of unity. Instead, Mr. Kennedy forced the president to wait at the lectern while he glad-handed on the floor. He finally joined Mr. Carter onstage and shook his hand coolly. Soon after the 1980 convention, Democrats introduced superdelegates, who could vote for the candidate of their choice, regardless of the voters, said Norman Williams, a law professor at Willamette University. That accomplished two goals: throwing support behind a candidate more favored by the establishment and increasing the show of support around a candidate to avoid another debacle. In 2016, supporters of Mr. Sanders complained that superdelegates were symbolic of a “rigged” system that gave party leaders and donors a chance to subvert the will of voters. Democrats later amended party rules so that superdelegates would cast ballots only if there were multiple rounds of voting. After 1980, conventions for both parties became mostly tame and so predictable that in 1996, the “Nightline” host Ted Koppel told viewers that he was leaving the Republican convention early and would treat the Democratic convention the same way. “This convention is more of an infomercial than a news event,” he said. History would suggest that whoever goes into the convention with 1,991 delegates is pretty much assured the nomination. True, delegates are not robots, as Mr. Kennedy tried to argue in 1980, and party rules allow them to switch allegiances. The rules say delegates “shall in all good conscience reflect the sentiments of those who elected them.” This gives wiggle room to a delegate who may be worried that Mr. Sanders’s objectives are too far out of the mainstream to make him electable in the fall. “Sanders is a very polarizing candidate, and as we learn more about him we’ll have to see if people develop buyer’s remorse,” Ms. Kamarck said. It was the same dilemma Republicans faced in 2016 when Donald J. Trump became the nominee. But like Republicans, Democrats are unlikely to overrule voters and create a situation where candidates and party operatives begin wheeling and dealing, Professor Williams said. “Brokered conventions are a bad thing for the health of the party and democracy,” he said. “Now it’s not the voters making a choice, but the candidates or party insiders making the choice.” Updated Feb. 29, 2020",The New York Times
2020,What Is a Stock Market Correction?,"The S&P 500 entered correction territory after a sell-off this week. Here’s what that means. The sell-off in stocks has fallen to a new level in market lingo: a correction. After tumbling in the past week, the S&P 500-stock index closed on Thursday in that territory. A correction is a 10 percent drop in stocks from their most recent peak. Since Feb. 19, the S&P 500 has fallen 12 percent. In some ways, 10 percent is an arbitrary threshold. But it often signals that investors have turned more pessimistic about the markets. Not necessarily. Over the past 20 years, there have been 10 corrections in the S&P 500, including the current one, according to Yardeni Research. The previous correction ended in December 2018. Of those corrections, only two have turned into bear markets: It is a more severe and usually more sustained downturn in the market, when stocks drop by at least 20 percent. The last one, during the financial crisis, lasted until March 2009. Then, the S&P 500 sank nearly 57 percent from peak to trough. The previous bear market occurred during the dot-com bust. From the top of the market in March 2000 until the bottom in October 2002, the S&P 500 lost 49 percent. Stock markets have recently fallen over fears that economic growth is too strong. Here’s why, and one way how steep, sustained sell-offs could end up hurting the economy.",The New York Times
2020,What Is the Election Needle? And Why Will We Have 4 of Them Tonight?,"A closer look at our election forecaster before the Iowa caucuses. Shortly before 9 p.m. Eastern on Monday, we expect the first returns from the Iowa Democratic caucuses. If you choose to follow the results live tonight, we hope you’ll do it with us: We’ll have results, analysis from our reporters and interactive maps. We’ll also have what we call a live forecast, known to many readers simply as “The Needle.” Below, we’ve provided answers to some common questions about the needle and our plans to use it during the caucuses. It’s the visual representation of The Times’s live election night forecast. It combines initial election returns with other sources of data to estimate the final result of an election before all the votes have been counted. Before the election, we use polling data, census data and prior election results to come up with a baseline estimate for how every precinct or county will vote. As the results come in, we compare the actual returns with our baseline. We then adjust our expectations for the vote that’s left: If a candidate is running ahead of our pre-election expectations in the areas that are counted, we might assume that he or she is also poised to do better in the demographically similar areas that remain. The needle gives many readers the piece of information they want more than anything else on election night: It tells them who is on track to win the election. And when the needle doesn’t know, it tells them that, too. The needle works because incomplete election results are often deeply unrepresentative. In some races — including the Iowa caucuses — predominantly rural places tend to be the first ones to report votes. The raw vote count can be misleading evidence about who is actually in a better position to win, even after most votes have been reported. Sophisticated election analysts and decision desks know this. Most casual followers of an election do not. The needle is a shortcut to most of the things we know about political geography. In 2016, the needle helped us realize fairly early on election night that Donald J. Trump was on track to win. We showed him with an edge in Pennsylvania, even when Hillary Clinton had a double-digit lead in tallied votes. Using similar methods in 2014, we were able to tell readers that Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, was probably on his way back to the Senate despite trailing all the way through 99 percent of precinct reports. In Alabama’s special Senate election in 2017, the needle showed that the Democrat, Doug Jones, had a path to victory before many analysts did. For those who wonder whether the world really needs the election needle, we realize the actual results will emerge soon enough. But we also think that the millions of people who follow election night results online ought to have the context to understand them as well as experts do. The Iowa caucuses pose a number of challenges for election night forecasting. First, Iowa is the first contest of the Democratic primary season. We think we have a pretty good idea of where each candidate should fare well, based on polling data and past elections. But Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders have never faced off before; it’s hard to be absolutely sure who would have the edge in rural areas, for instance, until we start to see some votes. Certainly, we’re far less confident of who will win a given county in Iowa than we would be in a general election between Democrats and Republicans. Second, Iowa polls have often been inaccurate, and it is hard to know how changes in the race — like a hypothetical election night surge from Amy Klobuchar — might wind up upsetting our expectations. The large number of candidates adds volatility to our expectations. Third, the caucuses are complex and involve multiple stages of voting. It is hard to know how each of these stages will play out over all, or by precinct. Voters can make strategic decisions in a specific caucus site that we do not anticipate. A final complicating factor is that in 2020, the Iowa caucuses aren’t just in Iowa. There will be satellite caucuses in retirement communities, mosques and people’s homes, some as far away as Paris, Scotland and Tbilisi, Georgia. Without any prior voting history there, or knowledge of the demographics of who will attend, it’s hard for us to know what to expect from these locations. Nonetheless, we do have some things going for us: In general, the demographic divisions in the Democratic field are good news for the needle. Based on our polling, we have a decent idea of the likely geography of the Iowa caucuses: Bernie Sanders has an edge in many urban areas and college towns; Pete Buttigieg is relatively strong in rural areas; Elizabeth Warren does well in areas with more college graduates; and the Des Moines suburbs are a battleground. We expect to receive results by precinct, rather than by county; these more granular results will help us make sense of the data fairly quickly. Historically, there does not appear to be a big difference between the preference of voters when they show up to caucus and the actual state delegate equivalency results, based on entrance poll data. The complicated nature of the delegate math is easy for computers, but hard for humans. Even an expert in Iowa’s political geography might have a hard time translating first alignment votes to delegate totals for thousands of precincts in real time. Advantage, Needle. Yes, depending on what you mean by “wrong.” Once all of the votes have been counted, the needle will — by definition — match up perfectly with the final result. But before all votes have been counted, the needle may suggest that one candidate has a pretty good chance of winning, only to have someone else eventually win. A 65 percent chance of winning means losing quite often. Likely to happen does not mean certainly will happen. We don’t quite think of this as “wrong.” (We know that some people do. This year, the needle will also describe probabilities with a simple phrase; it would describe the odds of someone with a 65 percent chance of winning as “likelier than not.”) The needle can also be wrong by reacting too quickly to unrepresentative returns, or by failing to anticipate them. If, by random chance, a candidate’s very best or worst precincts are the first ones to report, the needle may be misleading. That problem briefly confused the needle in the 2017 Alabama Senate race between Mr. Jones and Roy Moore. For a few minutes, the needle projected Republican turnout to be abysmal — but this was because the first counties to complete their count included some of the weakest Republican turnout of the night. The magnitude of our error at that point was huge — nearly seven percentage points. But our model quickly realized that Republican turnout was going to be higher in other counties. On the other hand, if the results are reported in a perfectly representative way, the needle may not offer much insight beyond raw vote totals. Our main forecast will be for state delegate equivalents, a measure reflecting a precinct’s vote at final alignment (after caucusgoers whose initial candidate didn’t meet a minimum reallocate themselves). The candidate with the most state delegate equivalents has traditionally been declared the winner of the Iowa caucuses, and in 2020 The New York Times, along with most news media organizations, will again characterize the candidate with the most state delegate equivalents as the winner. But for the first time, the Iowa Democratic Party is making data available from other steps of the precinct caucuses. We’ll offer live estimates on those measures, too: The first alignment reflects the first preference of caucusgoers when they arrive at their precinct. The final alignment reflects the preference of caucusgoers after the supporters of nonviable candidates have an opportunity to realign with candidates who remain viable in their precinct. Usually, a candidate needs 15 percent in a precinct to be viable. The pledged delegate count is awarded based on the number of state delegate equivalents won by each candidate statewide and by congressional district. Believe it or not, it is possible for different candidates to win each measure. We’ll need precinct data (as opposed to county data) to make reliable forecasts for all of these measures. If we don’t get this data, there will be not be a needle. (In 2018, data problems caused us to take the needle offline in the middle of the special election of Pennsylvania’s 18th district, ultimately won by Conor Lamb, a Democrat.) No. Calling is for humans. The needle reflects an estimate of the size and the makeup of the outstanding vote. And it may fail to anticipate returns that don’t fit the patterns we’ve seen until a certain point. For this reason and others, the needle is not used to make definitive statements about who has won.

2020,Opinion | What Is the Power of Celibacy?,"For both traditionalists and modernizers in the Roman Catholic Church, everything seems tied up with this priestly requirement. Mr. Caldwell, a contributing Opinion writer, is the author of “The Age of Entitlement: America Since the Sixties.” Pope Francis issued one of the most eagerly awaited documents of his papacy this month: a letter that could have laid the groundwork for eliminating the Roman Catholic Church’s requirement of priestly celibacy. But it didn’t. To the relief of conservative Catholics, and to the dismay of his progressive well-wishers, Francis let the matter drop. Ever since Francis summoned 185 bishops to the Vatican in October for three weeks of discussion about the Amazon region, the church had been in a state of agitation — and not over burning rain forests or endangered indigenous cultures or the mercurial Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro. The controversy centered on whether certain married church deacons would be permitted to offer Mass in churches too remote for priests to reach regularly. While this might look to an outsider like a petty procedural question, it would have been a crack in the centuries-old edifice of celibacy. Two-thirds of bishops at the conference approved the idea, arguing that it would help preserve the viability of the Catholic Church in remote parts of South America (where as many as 70 percent of Catholics have no priest to give them communion on Sunday). Some argued that priestly celibacy was dissuading young men from joining the priesthood. Conservatives in the church, including a circle of intellectuals around former Pope Benedict XVI, countered that to speak of a “priest shortage” was to get the wrong end of the stick. The church is not a factory or a phone bank, with so many vacant “posts” — it is a holy calling. And the tradition of priestly celibacy, they argued, is central, not peripheral, to that vocation. Although opponents of celibacy present it as newfangled, dating only to the Lateran councils of the 12th century, it is older than that. Sexual continence is important in Jesus’s teaching in the Gospels, and it has been urged on bishops from the outset. It is the rule, not the exception, in church history. Attempts to require celibacy for all clergy were underway during the fourth century — around the time Constantine was making Christianity the religion of the Roman Empire and, unwittingly, provoking a crisis of morals. “While the Church was kept purified by the fires of persecution,” explained the 19th-century religious historian Henry Charles Lea, “it offered few attractions for the worldly and ambitious.” But as prospects of wealth and power opened up, the church would have to protect itself from “a new class of men, dangerous alike from their talents or their vices.” Celibacy was one way of “preventing such wolves from seeking a place among the sheep.” It also prevented priestly dynasties. Celibacy works in different ways in different times. For the past few centuries, it helped make the church a haven for young people whose sexuality did not match the ideas of the society at large. Professor Lea’s history, written a century ago, is filled with stories of “flagellants.” Frédéric Martel, in last year’s anecdotal investigation “In the Closet of the Vatican,” asserted that a large percentage of the Vatican’s top clerics — who would have entered the priesthood around the 1960s — are homosexual. As long as society was repressive, impulses of sexual nonconformity almost never became visible. But when society turned liberationist, as it did in the 1960s and ’70s, hidden sexualities emerged. The church had become a nest of difficult-to-socialize libidos, and a vast number of priestly molestation cases followed, peaking between 1970 and 1980. The rocky transition into sexual modernity has done lasting damage to the church’s reputation, especially when it comes to its teachings concerning sexuality. Since 1970, Catholics have remained a remarkably consistent 17 percent or 18 percent of the world’s growing population, their numbers roughly doubling (from 650 million to 1.3 billion). The problem has come with priests. They remain stuck at their level of decades ago, around 415,000, although some regions have seen steep declines. (In 1985 the United States had 57,000 priests, according to the Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate at Georgetown University; by 2015 that number had fallen by a third.) This combination of sex scandals and priestly shortfalls confronts traditionalists with the challenge of defending celibacy’s relevance anew. In “From the Depths of Our Hearts,” to be published next month, former Pope Benedict XVI and Cardinal Robert Sarah of Guinea each give an explanation grounded in theology, not sociology. Benedict considers celibacy a main link binding the new (Catholic) covenant to the old (Jewish) one. It is an outgrowth of Old Testament ideas of priestly abstinence during sacrifices, extended to reflect the daily responsibilities of a Christian priest. He notes that the Eucharistic prayer draws on Deuteronomy for its language of what it means to “stand before God and serve him.” The Christian priest’s renunciation of his share in God’s physical creation has a parallel in God’s promise to Israel — all Israel’s tribes had right to land except the priestly tribe of Levi. Levites therefore had to live “by God and for God,” just as the unwed priest does. Neither Benedict nor Cardinal Sarah is naïve or prudish. Celibacy is not asexuality. It is sexuality regulated in a special way. Its logic rests on an elaborate analogy between holy orders and holy matrimony. The church is the bride of Christ. Just as a married man must give the whole of himself to his wife, a celibate priest must give the whole of himself to the church. Still, the non-Catholic reader who does not follow Cardinal Sarah and Benedict’s reasoning closely and patiently is likely to find it weird. Cardinal Sarah writes, “Every time a priest repeats ‘this is my Body,’ he offers his body, as a man” — “son corps sexué,” in the French original — “in continuity with the sacrifice on the Cross.” This is the sense in which celibacy is a “gift to the church,” a formula of the reformist Pope Paul VI that many priests, including Pope Francis himself, are fond of repeating. Note well, though — it is a gift to the church, not to the individual priest’s character-building or his emotional needs. This complicates the worldly problem that roiled Pope Francis’s recent Amazon deliberations. Whatever its theological justification, is celibacy shutting out otherwise eligible young men who would make good priests? That is the view of Erwin Kräutler, the Austrian-Brazilian bishop who for 35 years headed the Amazonian prelature of Xingu. He claims the natives there do not even understand celibacy and pity those who practice it. “When I go to an indigenous village,” Bishop Kräutler said in October, “the first thing they ask is: ‘Where is your wife?’” Others, however, including Cardinal Sarah, believe this is an “error in perspective.” Cardinal Sarah is an important bridge figure. He is conservative and he has been a priest for 50 years. But missionaries brought his Guinean parents into the church, and he grew up among non-Christians. “The younger a Church is, the more she needs an encounter with the radical character of the Gospel,” he explains, insisting that if his village had been evangelized by a married man, he would not today be a priest. “The radical character of the missionaries’ life is what attracted me.” On both sides of this debate, everything seems to be tied up with celibacy. For Cardinal Sarah, as long as the traditional conception of celibacy holds up — the conception that a priest celebrating Mass “offers his body, as a man” — there is an ironclad logic against ordaining female priests. Should celibacy be rethought, he admits, the logic of female exclusion would grow weaker, as would the traditional conception of the priesthood and, with it, the traditional conception of the church. That is why the battle between traditionalists and modernizers has come to a head over this seemingly marginal issue — and perhaps why Benedict, at 92, has chosen it as an occasion to come out of “retirement.” Although the present pope has not taken an unequivocal stand, his defenders seem to be lining up on the side of liberalization. The church historian Hubert Wolf warned in The Washington Post last summer that without reform of the celibacy rules, the church “will be at its end.” It is one of those conflicts in which the tiniest procedural adjustment threatens a cascade of consequences and each party fears extinction should the other prevail. Of course, we live in a time when a good number of conflicts are like that.

2020,"What Is ‘Dance Monkey,’ and How Did It Take Over the World?","Diary of a Song The hit song by Tones and I started as a sensation on the streets of Australia before reaching No. 1 in 20 countries and topping 1 billion plays on Spotify. See how it was made. transcript “Hello.” “Hello.” “Do I call you Tones or Toni?” “Tones. I can’t even believe that this is my life sometimes. It’s going number one in so many countries. “‘Dance Monkey.’” “‘Dance Monkey.’” “‘Dance Monkey.’” “For anyone that thinks that I’m, like, an overnight success just doesn’t know about, like, the hard yards I’ve already put in. I used to work at a surf shop on Bourke Street, which is really the busiest part of Melbourne. And there was like, you could busk on Bourke Street. I really, really wanted to busk. I couldn’t even play an instrument at this point. One of my friends was like, you should come to Byron because you can literally just park up and busk out of the side of your van. And I was like, OK, I’ll give it a go. So I bought a van, moved to Byron Bay and started living in my van.” “What was your impression of Byron Bay when you first got there?” “I said, ‘I don’t think I’m going to fit in here.’ There’s a lot of buskers in Byron, but very acoustic guitar. It’s very, like, bohemian. So probably the first time anyone’s pulled out a keyboard on the street, let alone, like, the drum pad, the synthesizers, and the loop pedal and the harmonizers.” [singing] “I stumbled across her when she was busking in Byron, in September 2017. It was the very first time she’d tried busking. I heard that, and I said to my wife like, ‘Whoa. That was pretty cool.’” “He gave me his card — said ‘entertainment lawyer’ on it. And I said to him, ‘I don’t have any legal issues.’” “Tones was my first management client. She came in, and lived with me and my family for a while after there, and worked out of my studio a lot in that first year while she was busking.” “I’d go up every Monday, Tuesday and stay there, write music, go busk for the week. I was busking day, day, day, day — in the winter, when no one else would busk. In the rain, when no one else would be busking, I would be busking. It wasn’t about the money. It was about, no matter what, being able to get more fans. So there might be 20 people that night that would otherwise never know who I was.” “When did it hit you that your busking was becoming a thing, that you were an attraction?” “I know that there was a point where I realized if I posted on my social media, and said I was busking somewhere people would come. Other buskers started getting angry at me. Some started a Facebook group. And were, like, we’re going to run Tones out of town — like, for no reason. They just hated how big the crowds were getting.” “People don’t walk past Tones. No one does. By the second song there were always like 10, 20 people. By the fifth, the crowd was hectic every single time.” “I love busking. There’s so many good, amazing people on the street. It’s the reason that I’m here. But there was one night that was very frustrating. And I wrote a song about that. People grab my hands and be like, ‘You know you stopped me dead in my tracks when I was walking by.’ [singing] ‘Just sing one more song, just one more song.’ ‘I’m just going to get my husband.’ I’m literally just repeating what people tell me. That’s why if you replace ‘dance’ with the word ‘sing,’ it’s just about me busking. [singing] I always wanted to do a song with a bass drop chorus. I really like that song that’s like, ‘You just want attention. You don’t want my heart.’ I loved how it was like — So I played some bass, and I kept that loop. I put the other loop down. I sang what I’d already written. It just felt so right. I wrote ‘Dance Monkey’ in half an hour, and then it was done.” [singing] “Just watching her busk with it, early on, people just loved it. And we’re like, this is going to be a cracker. Like a proper cracker.” “You guys basically specialize in buskers at this point?” “Essentially —” “We just like working with buskers, that’s the thing, we like working with people that want to create art, and tour and make their life music, and buskers do that.” “Did Tones have original music when you guys first made contact with her?” Yeah, yeah, absolutely. ‘Johnny Run Away’ was the most developed demo, and that was the first release we put out. [singing] That caught a fire real quick in Australia, crossed over to commercial radio, which was huge.” “In Australian terms, ‘Johnny’ — it doesn’t get any better than that for a debut.” “Even though, like, my song was getting high rotation on like, all the mainstream radios, that does nothing. You have to keep busking, and I didn’t want to work at Woolworth’s.” “So when did you first hear the demo for ‘Dance Monkey?’” “I never heard a demo. She came into the studio, and played me the song how she played it. And then it was sort of our job in the studio to make it, I guess like, radio friendly. Just about that bass drop, making sure that it was not too straight, that it really swung.” “We set up ‘Dance Monkey,’ and were going to release it. I was like, ‘Look, maybe it’s just a live track. Maybe it’s just a banging live. Maybe it doesn’t do as well as ‘Johnny,’ and I was trying to just, I don’t know, just keep expectations in check.” “Dave said to me that, ‘Don’t be upset if this song doesn’t live up to ‘Johnny Run Away’ because that song is probably more of a radio hit, which is apparently everything that matters these days.” “Now she forever tells a story that, ‘This is the song that my manager Dave said was probably not a radio song,’ and it’s like the biggest song in the world right now.” [singing] “In Australia, it’s broken the the record of any female artist ever. Any Australian artist ever, and any song at number one, the most consecutive weeks.” “A lot of songs become big in Australia. Some of them cross over to the U.K., and other European countries, but not all of them can make the leap to America, like, what does it mean for your song to break in the U.S.? Is that meaningful to you?” “That is like another whole universe in itself. It’s like, breaking the U.S. is like re-releasing ‘Dance Monkey’ again to the world.” “Do you ever feel guilty that the song that helped you make it is sort of complaining about the very thing that helped you make it?” “No, I’m writing it about the girl that knocked over my keyboard, and the guy that tried to steal my money and the two guys that were literally yelling out ‘Again! Again! Again! Again! Again!’ right in my face, and the guy that walked past me and said, you’re [expletive] — all in, like, 30 minutes.” “Have you been back to busk since ‘Dance Monkey’ hit number one?” “It’s very hard to do. I want to dress up as Old Tones from the ‘Dance Monkey’ film clip and go busk. People ask me how I feel. I get a little bit frustrated because I don’t know how I feel, but like sometimes I have those small moments when you’re driving in your car on your own, and you just think to yourself, ‘Holy [expletive], I have the most streamed song in the world right now.’” [singing] Before the song “Dance Monkey” hit No. 1 in 20 countries, it was a local attraction on the beachfront streets of Byron Bay, Australia. Written by a busker named Toni Watson, 26, who performs as the solo act Tones and I, “Dance Monkey” uses a plunking keyboard and thumping bass line as a backdrop to describe the very specific life of a street musician: “Just like a monkey I’ve been dancing my whole life,” she sings. “And you just beg to see me dance just one more time.” In an unlikely twist, that sentiment went global. A one-time basketball prospect and surf shop employee, Watson moved to Byron Bay, a small resort town south of Brisbane, to play music in a busker’s paradise. She lived out of her van and relied solely on tips from passers-by, who were increasingly mesmerized by the singer’s distinct wail. From her sidewalk setup, Tones and I found a management team and local success with a single called “Johnny Run Away.” That might’ve been the singer’s peak, as Tones’s team warned her not to get her hopes up for the follow-up single. “Dance Monkey” had been primarily a live sensation, attracting growing crowds for Tones and I’s free public shows. But after its official release last May, the track caught on not just in Australia, where it became the longest running No. 1 song of all time, but around the world, including in Belgium, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Portugal, Slovenia, Canada and Britain. Written alone in a dark closet in not much more than 30 minutes, “Dance Monkey” has since leapt over to the United States, where it has been a steady presence near the top of the Billboard chart since October, peaking this week at No. 5, alongside acts like Post Malone, Maroon 5 and Billie Eilish. The song has also consistently topped the global charts on Spotify, where it has racked up more than 1 billion streams, and YouTube, where the “Dance Monkey” music video has been viewed more than 664 million times. In the latest episode of The New York Times video series Diary of a Song, which breaks down how music is made today, Tones and I describes her bizarre journey from local novelty to “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,” alongside her managers and the producer Konstantin Kersting. See how “Dance Monkey” became a viral hit in the clip above. “Diary of a Song” provides an up-close, behind-the-scenes look at how pop music is made today, using archival material — voice memos, demo versions, text messages, emails, interviews and more — to tell the story behind the track.

2020,Opinion | What It Means to Be Black in America,"Six short films for Black History Month. Gee’s Bend is a rural community in lower Alabama that is widely recognized for its extraordinary quilts. The quilts reflect a collective history and a deep sense of place. And they register the bold individual voices of the women who made them. transcript Have you have ever paid trees any attention? Some of them are light green, dark green, greener green, yellowish green. Have you ever paid how the leaves are blowing? They have a glimmer in it. And I called it silver because it be wavy. (SINGING) I don’t want nobody to praise me when I’m gone. Mm. Then some time at night, when I’m laying down in the bed, I’m dreaming about something. And I have my pencil and my paper beside the bed. And I just sketch that out on paper. (SINGING) Lord, I don’t want nobody to praise me when I’m gone. Whoa. It’s just something to keep your mind occupied. That’s all. And then you quilt for your children. (SINGING) — whiles I yet live. (SINGING) If you want to put it on — Make me a quilt. (SINGING) Lord, to help me. Yes, if I — At first I wanted to leave home. But then when I got older, I began to like it a little more. And then I began to fall in love with it. The biggest of my challenges was farming. I picked cotton. I didn’t like it, not at all. But it was life. We had to do what we had to do to make a living. When my parents finished their farm then we go over and helped our neighbor get their farm. We just worked together. [humming] I started cooking at age of 6. Would you believe that? I was the only girl, but my mom gave all of my brothers a chore in the kitchen. She made them learn how to cook because she told them you might not get a wife and at least you’ll know how to cook. [laughter] Don’t that make perfectly good sense? Gee’s Bend, Alabama, is a rural community. How’d Zeus manage to get over there? [goats bleating] I opened the gate. You have to go 50 miles to shop. But to live in a community where everybody knows everybody, that’s a good thing. [goats bleating] I am Essie Pettway. Everybody call me Toot. China Pettway. My name is Mary Lee Bendolph. My real name is Rita Mae, but most people call me Rabbit. If one not related to the other one, they’re related to the other one. And we all know one another. We are kin people. My mamma died when I was 4. And my grandparents, they didn’t want to raise me. My granddaddy said when I started walking, I just jumped up and went a-running. And so that’s why they called me Rabbit, because I was so fast. My grandmother taught me how to quilt. It’s keep me occupied from doing other things that I might not need to be doing. Sew it like that. That’s what you call the housetop. I was born and raised here. I went to New York and stayed for two weeks, but I came back. Mhm. And I’ve been here ever since. I remember when my mom and my grandmom and their neighbors used to come by to quilt together. And I used to just sit there and look up under the quilt and wonder how they was going up and down, up and down with that needle. They wasn’t even sticking their fingers, but — I said, I’d have stuck my finger to death. But it was real exciting to see that as a child. And I say when I get older, I’m going make me lots of quilts so I can have them to keep my kids warm. [humming] They would teach us when we was under the quilt listening to them, praying and talking to God about their children, how they wanted them to grow up and be mens and womens. (SINGING) Lord, have mercy. To love their children and to teach them the value of life. (SINGING) Lord, have mercy. They understood what it was about family. (SINGING) Save my soul. You could feel the love. Sometimes you’re walking along the highway, you see a little piece of material. You pick it up and run home and give it to my mamma. And she put it in a quilt. Somehow are our old blue jeans. And I just took them and cut them up and made this, turn it into a quilt. Look at what your mamma made me. That’s the way you do it. I do all my sewing by hand and so — I have a sewing machine, but I don’t — I use it when I have to use. And then go to stitching it. When I’m doing my quilt, my mind is totally into it, and I don’t have to be perfect. It give you a piece of mind. You can take time out and talk to God and say thank you. (SINGING) Father, I stray. My hand to thee. O.K. There we go. There we go. I get to make the decision of whether I want to put this in there or take it out. And if nobody else like it, so what? It going on my bed because it’s mine. (SINGING) Swing low, sweet old chariot, coming to carry me home. Swing low, sweet old chariot, coming to carry me home. I looked over Jordan; then what did I see — whoa — coming to carry me home? When we were young, we worked a whole lot. Sure. I worked at school at the lunchroom. But the rest of the people were working in fields and picking cotton and stuff like that. We was living on a white man’s place at that time. We didn’t want to live in the same old rut. We wanted to move. I did. Don’t know what everybody else wanted to do, but I wanted to do better things. When I went to march in the civil rights movement, I didn’t know the police and everything was there, taking people to jail, beating them, and all that kind of stuff. I didn’t know. But I really wanted to become a registered voter. You know, when you become a voter, you could do something. It’s O.K. now, but not like it should be. I was always held back because of where I came from, who my mother were, who my father were. But I realized I am somebody. I can do anything that I put my mind to doing. It make me feel great. I never thought quilts would be in no museum, no way. That’s mine, that picture right there. Mhm. That’s the first year I started. There’s my quilt there. There’s a quilt there. And this is Essie, her quilt. It just was a joy to see. It’s just like something just burst open because I never thought that a quilt would be an artwork, people would think that was beautiful, that something we’d done could be shown all over the world and people get joy out of it. Oh, girl, I just loved it. You can look at a quilt. It can give you a feeling of something. You know, it gives you love. You can see love. You can see peace. You can see joy in different quilts. I just loved to see my beautiful quilt hanging up there. And I don’t know what happened to them, but — (SINGING) Oh, please. Oh, please. He asked me, was it all right for him to sell my quilt? I tell him, yeah, because you sent me some money, but he ain’t told me nothing else since then (SINGING) Oh, please. Oh, please. We’re going leave this all behind one day. It’s not ours in the beginning. We just only borrowing it for the time we are here (SINGING) Oh, thank God. Oh, thank God. This is the underdog story of a young fencer from Brooklyn who overcame a gauntlet of hardships on the road to the Olympics. You might think that Keeth Smart would be morose as he recounts his parents’ passing or his own brush with death. Instead, he glows. transcript Oh, I got it. And I haven’t used one of these in so long. Yeah, I had — so I made up my mind to be done the year before. So I knew 2008 was it. I’m suffocating inside my mask. Can’t breathe. I feel the weight of everyone. But I have to fence. You got to fence. [CHANTING] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] [CHEERING] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Make him fall short. As I am attacking, I step out of bounds. [CHANTING] And all the Russians start celebrating like they won. And it was a 10- or 15-minute discussion for the video replay and all this crap going on. And I remember just saying a little prayer. I was like, I’ve been through so much this year. God, Mom, Dad, whatever, you got to help me through this. I grew up in Brooklyn, New York, Flatbush, where it’s majority West Indian. My mother had come to America when she was in her 20s. [INTERPOSING VOICES] Her and my dad wanted us to go to college. That was their focus. So they began asking and doing research about what are the best scholarship opportunities. My dad worked at Sports Illustrated at the time, and he saw an article come across his desk about Peter Westbrook, Olympic bronze medalist from 1984. Peter had decided to start the Peter Westbrook Foundation specifically to help kids from inner-city neighborhoods, black kids, and introduce them to the sport of fencing. The first medal of any kind by an American saber competitor. And I says all right, guys, let me introduce you to the sport. And I took him there. Erinn, my younger sister by 18 months, she was talented, and they were like, oh, my God. This is a prodigy, and she was. Basically Erinn received a fencing scholarship on the spot. That’s it! Yes, Erinn! Erinn just won her bout. But my parents, which was very smart on their part, was, well, if you’re going to give one to Erinn, you have to give one to Keeth. And they’re like, what are you talking about? Like, this kid sucks. And they were like, no. I’m not going to let my daughter come all the way to the Upper West Side by herself. She’s going to — he’s going to be basically her chaperone. And if he’s going to be there, he might as well fence. Oh, wow, when is Keeth going to hit that. Yeah, you see that. Peter and the guys, they looked at me as this kid who had never made any result. So the first rule they made was a 7-0 shutout. So if you couldn’t get one point until their seven, you were off the strip for the whole night. I would literally get one bout in. They beat me 7-zip, I’m upstairs doing footwork for the rest of the night. Then I got good enough where I can get one point. So then they changed the rule to 9-1 shutout. And this happened for my first three years of high school. [SINGING] I didn’t even think fencing was in my future. So I went to a very competitive high school, Brooklyn Tech. Go ahead. Close up. Kiss him. I was focused on becoming an engineer. So I was just holding my breath for Erinn to make the Olympic team, and then my fencing career would end. And I’d move on into the sunset. I don’t want no stupid [INAUDIBLE] about— Erinn, get the hell out the— Keeth, for real. Do I have to take that? Erinn— Look, look, picture. It’s all right. You’re not jealous. Look, hi, Keeth. This is Keeth. [INAUDIBLE] My battery’s dying. My mom’s first suggestion to me was, Keeth, I want you fencing. You’re just not like a tiger. And I need you to roar like a tiger. So— [INAUDIBLE] Go ahead. My dad back then— Well, people, here I am. I’m talking to you— Dance around, move them, do whatever it takes to then hit ‘em like bam. Oh, O.K. It’s not that simple. Come on, Keeth. What are you doing? My senior year of high school, everyone makes the world championship team in the club except for myself. [YELLING] Peter comes to me, and he’s like, where’s your warm-up jacket for world championship? And I’m like, I don’t have one. So that’s when I doubled down. I decided to train even harder, that I would be the underdog. When people would stop practicing at 8 o’clock, I would stay to 9 o’clock. And we’re going to go up and down the strip. And I don’t care if they’re dripping in sweat and I’m dripping in sweat, but they’re going to have to fight for every tap. They’re going to be in a war. Stay close, stay close. What I want to do is just take a step back and pick at the target, but you come under every time. Bravo! [APPLAUSE] [INTERPOSING VOICES] [APPLAUSE] Remember when you were 11 years old? I remember when you couldn’t hold the weapon. Wow, man. [CHEERING] And welcome back to the show. I’m Tom McDonald, and it’s the first time I’ve ever held one of these in my hand, Sort of like cool, like a movie. And my guest— I’d better put this down— Keeth Smart. Welcome to the show. Thank you. And this is a clue as to why he’s here. He grew up in Brooklyn— Correct. And is now one of the best fencers in America. Yes, as well as in the world right now. In the world. Wow, that’s impressive. And Keeth, who is the first American fencer to rank No. 1— the world No. 1 ranking. Keeth, what’s your last name again? Smart. Smart. And you — what are they wearing this morning, Cheryl? They have on some fun flip-flops, beach flip-flops. Having your life story turned into a melodramatic montage narrated by Bob Costas. Yes. Exactly. This is good for camcorder. Yeah. [INAUDIBLE] From what my mom told Erinn and I, the timing sucked that she had been diagnosed with cancer essentially a year before the Games. And the only option for her to go to the Olympic Games was to take a double dosage of chemotherapy. Keeth. She wasn’t fully recovered, but she was recovered enough and strength enough where she was a normal tourist at the Olympics. So it was a summer of 2005, one of those days where it’s 98 degrees, high humidity. When they say don’t work out outside, you’re not supposed to work out outside. There’s a reason why they say that. And my dad, he was a Vietnam vet, so he was kind of stubborn. And he went for a jog. Mom, I’m on top of Eiffel Tower. I just wanted you to know. Hey, Mom, I’m in Tunisia. Just wanted to you know. I’m in Moscow. You would love it here. Every day we spoke. [INTERPOSING VOICES] Erinn and I would alternate weekends flying to Florida to be with our mom. Keeth, [INAUDIBLE] think of this exchange. To take her to chemotherapy. And then we would fly to World Cup. [INTERPOSING VOICES] I just want to say from the bottom of my heart that I really, really appreciate this. I don’t want to cry or anything. But it was a tough year, and you all helped me make it through. Each and every one of you contributed. I remember when I started chemotherapy, I said whatever anybody gave me, whether it was a big help or a little help, I was going to appreciate it. And I really thank you all. [CLAPPING] And I can’t say anything more. [LAUGHING] You broke me. I didn’t think I’d get broken, but I broke. Thanks again. So finally the last World Cup was in Algeria. So when I came back from Algeria. I felt lightheaded. The next morning, my eyeballs were covered in blood, and there was blood blisters all over my skin. I was like, holy cow. I’m just bleeding to death. So the diagnosis was I.T.P. It’s a form of leukemia. So that’s why I was bleeding through my eyes, bleeding out of my ears. I’d just made the Olympic team. I ranked fourth in the world. They were like, I don’t think you understand. You should be dead, and you will never fence again, let alone any physical activity. I go to the specialist, and he said that — he was like, look, I don’t know if this will work. But at this point we have nothing to lose. And based off of your physical conditioning, this would be a great case study for myself. [CHUCKLING] I was like, oh, Mom, did you have porridge today? She was like, yeah, but I only eat a little bit. I knew she was dying. I wasn’t stupid. And I would tell her, they cleared me to walk. And she was like, thank you, Lord. Today they cleared me to run around the block, and she was like, thank you, Jesus. Thank you. And toward the end, I got cleared to start to fence. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, thank you. I knew you would be back. [FIREWORKS] As I was given the all-clear sign, my mom died the same weekend. [BREATHING HEAVILY] [COUGHING] So now it’s June. Everyone else in the world has trained every day. They’re professional athletes. I haven’t done anything for two months. And the Olympics were two months away. Due to all the medication I had taken, I would get winded just by going up a flight of stairs. So for the next two months, I trained like I’d never trained before in my life. Let’s go. Come on, man. Let’s go, let’s go. - [INAUDIBLE] Fix your hat, man. Your hat doesn’t— [CHANTING] U.S.A., U.S.A., U.S.A. [CHEERING] Mom, Dad, God, you got to help me through this. But, in fact, it was a nullified touch. Back en guarde. And then I said this little prayer, I’ve come too far. Take me home, Mom and Dad. [INTERPOSING VOICES] [CHEERING] Dada. Dada. Dada. You’re saying dada, yes, Taylor. Dada. Da. Taylor, what did you think? Ed Dwight Jr. was invited by his country to train to be the first African-American astronaut. But the United States never sent him to space. Mr. Dwight is now a prolific artist, building memorials and creating public art honoring African-American history. transcript A monument is an ideal. A memorial is a memorial of something that really happened in life. I could have been the first black guy in space. Was that my fate that I’ll be remembered for that, for something that I didn’t do? Think about that one. How the hell do you get famous for something you didn’t do? There rest burdens heavier than have rested on the shoulders of any president since the time of Lincoln. In the ’60s, there was a lot of tension, an incredible amount of tension. In 1959, the first seven astronauts were appointed by Eisenhower, seven guys that become immortal by proclamation only. The way the story goes, the Kennedy White House said, we’ll satisfy our black community by making a black astronaut. One black guy on a Wheaties box. O.K., but how do you make an astronaut? I was born in Kansas City in 1933. I wanted to be an artist. My dad said, “No, no, no, no. You’re going to go to engineering school. You’re going to be an engineer.” All the pilots, the good pilots, the aces, they all grew up on farms. Every one of them. We lived on a farm. And the Fairfax airport was within walking distance. I didn’t know where these airplanes had been when they came and landed. And I didn’t know where the hell they were going when they took off. But it had to be exciting. I did get the flying bug. I was down there every day. I became their mascot. I’d hang out in the maintenance shacks. And I’d hand the guys the tools. And after a while, I said, “Why don’t you just take me up?” [AIRCRAFT ENGINE BUZZING] Immediately, when you can see past the horizon, you say, oh, my god. All of a sudden, your world expands to this bigger and bigger and bigger space. That whole expanse of stuff, you get even more curious about it. Why were we here? And what part do we play? And what, if anything, can we do about it? I was probably 18. And I had a paper route for the white newspaper. And I had a paper route for the black newspaper. On the front page of my black newspaper was a black jet pilot standing on the wing of an F-86 Saber jet. My world about exploded. Oh, my god, they’re letting black folks fly airplanes. I almost stopped throwing papers that minute. I went straight to the Air Force recruiting office. By the time I got to be upper class, I had all these stripes on my arm. I had my own office. I was an officer all the way through the whole thing. And lo and behold, I get this letter, all the Pentagon trapping, all this stuff on it. Direction of the president, opportunity to be an astronaut. So I took it to my boss and he said, “Tear it up. You don’t want any part of that, man. They’re going to make hamburger out of you down there, buddy. Ed, stick with us. You’ve got a career. You’re going to be a general. You have a family here. So leave it alone.” But my curiosity overwhelmed me. So I secretly sent all my information in. And within days, days, not weeks, months, years, I got an assignment to go to Edwards Air Force Base for me to enter experimental test pilot school. I was a Kennedy boy. That’s the term they used, Kennedy boy. I knew full well when I got on the base that it wasn’t going to be a cakewalk. It seems like every street at Edwards Air Force Base is named after a dead test pilot. Every time I strapped that airplane on my behind, I don’t know whether I’m coming back. And on top of that, I was told, Chuck Yeager, the guy that was running the whole damn school, had called the students and the instructor staff into the auditorium and said, here’s our plan. Don’t talk to him. Don’t socialize with him. Don’t drink with him. Don’t invite him to your parties. Just ignore him like he doesn’t exist. And in six months, he’ll be gone, because that’ll psychologically break him. He’ll quit. And so they set about doing that. That’s Chuck Yeager. My dad had issues in his work world. Whether you’re a baseball star like he was or whatever you did, I mean, you still suffer the ravages of prejudice. And he would go on these rants. “All white men are the worst people in the world and they’ll stab you in the back.” But my mother had the last word. “Don’t pay any attention to what your dad said. All people are equal.” And those were the last words I heard every day until I was 18 years old. You can teach your brain to help you, or you can teach your brain to destroy you. And your brain will react to what it’s been told. Every day of my life, my mother told me how much she loved me and how I could do anything in the universe. I don’t care what it was, you have the ability to do that, as long as you’re prepared for it. That removed any other force coming into my space plane. But if I had all this other trash running around in my head, I wouldn’t be able to do any of that kind of stuff. They were announcing names to go into the second phase of it. And of course, that next level moved you on to NASA, which was the third thing. Just graduated from test pilot school and we were all vying for a spot. So guess who’s not quitting? Captain Ed Dwight. 29-year-old Negro says he is anxious to go into space. He’s Captain Edward Dwight of the Air Force, selected to be an astronaut, the first of his race to be so designated. Captain Dwight and his family got the news at their home at Edwards Air Force Base in California. And of course, that was hot news, I mean, really, really hot news. Place was packed. The press came out from D.C. Cameras were everywhere. All these photographers on me. And they have one cover all the rest of them. Immediately, I was getting 1,500 fan mails a day. And I was on the cover of all these magazines around the world. See, I was being handled out of the White House. So everywhere I went, I was bombarded with it. So there was a lot of unhappy people about this. There’s a black guy that can do this? Oh, god, you’ve got to be kidding me. Kennedy boy, Kennedy boy. All that nonsense, couldn’t give it a parking space in my brain. We were in bioastronautics training at Brooks. They were trying to figure out how far they could take a person and break them. They did everything they could possibly do. They’d stick needles in your head and then introduce these waves. Centrifuge training, a lot of guys couldn’t handle that. They’d take you up to 15 g’s. Of course, your tear ducts close and the tears creep over to here. And they’re like bullets when they hit your ears, that thing is so fast. God, I just ate that up. I really enjoyed it. It was just absolutely fabulous. The happy ending of this thing would be going into space. [ROCKET ENGINES BOOMING] O.K., I guess you all know why you’re here today and why we’re here. We’d like to introduce the new group of 14 astronauts who we’ve been in the process of selecting for about the last four months. [APPLAUSE] Was there a Negro boy in the last 30 or so that you brought here for consideration? No, there was not. They were announcing a new group of astronauts and I wasn’t in that group. A month or so later, Kennedy has been assassinated. Are you now in fact completely out of the astronaut program? Why aren’t you an astronaut? Do you feel that what’s happened to you was a setback for civil rights opportunities in this country? I would rather not comment on that. I resigned in ’66, loaded my Volkswagen to the brim and drove off the base. You know, god, I start getting emotional. [CHUCKLES] I mean, that was tough. Next question. [SLOW STRING MUSIC] If I just receded into nothingness, it would have been all well and good with everybody else, because that’s how things are supposed to happen. I would have loved going into space, you know, had this thing all worked out that way. That choice was snatched away from me. So why bother about it, you know? I have to attribute that to some kind of fate. Well, maybe there’s some more work for me to do. Maybe my fate was I had to bring the African-American story to the public venue. [SLOW STRING MUSIC] And so I started building things, making things. 129. I’ve completed 129 memorials since I’ve done this and over 18,000 gallery pieces. A monument is an ideal. But a memorial is a memorial of something that really happened in life. How do you go from slavery to freedom and accomplishment? What happened? Harriet Tubman, George Washington Carver, Rosa Parks, Sojourner Truth, Dr. King, B.B. King, Dizzy Gillespie, Miles Davis, step by step by step by step. Guion Bluford. First African-American in space. Founded in 1966 in Oakland, Calif., to combat police violence, the Black Panther Party and its story are a key part of our nation’s still-complicated racial narrative. transcript IDs / TIMECODES	AUDIO / VIDEO

Protest Montage
“Hands up! Don’t shoot!”

	2014


	V/O Stanley Nelson 

The stories in the news today remind me of the sentiments of almost 50 years ago, when many young black people felt that policing for them was unfair .

	1966

	JAMAL JOSEPH
BLACK PANTHER PARTY

During that time period being Black in America meant that you didn’t walk down the street with the same sense of safety and the same sense of privilege as a white person. 

	BILL CALHOUN
BLACK PANTHER PARTY

There was absolutely no difference in the way the police treated us in .. in Mississippi than they did in California. They may not have called you Nigger every day but they treated you the same way they did in Mississippi . 

	WAYNE PHARR 
BLACK PANTHER PARTY

The police jump on you. Beat you up. Put the gun at your head. This is what we were going through on a daily basis . 


	SOT CONTEMP PROTESTER

I’m tired of this, I’ll stay here as long as I have to!

	V/O Stanley Nelson

Now, as then, the need for change is real. Nearly every black man I know has a story about an encounter with the police. I myself have been stopped, searched, and had a gun put to my head for no rational reason.

	SOT BLACK PANTHERS MARCHING

Left! Left! Left!


	V/O Stanley Nelson

One response to police brutality in 1966 was the founding of The Black Panther Party for Self-Defense .

	SOT HUEY NEWTON 
BLACK PANTHER PARTY

We use the black panther as our symbol because the nature of a panther. Panther doesn’t strike anyone but, when he is assailed upon, he’ll back up first. But if the aggressor continues then he will strike out. 

	ELBERT “BIG MAN” HOWARD
BLACK PANTHER PARTY

When I first met Huey and Bobby, they were in the process of forming an organization for primarily self-defense . // We didn’t plan to have a nationwide organization or anything like that. We were organized in dealing with the problem in Oakland .

	V/O Stanley Nelson

In 1966, California law allowed civilians to carry loaded weapons as long as they were not concealed - as do many states today . And the newly-formed Black Panther Party took advantage of the law .







	SOT HUEY NEWTON	
BLACK PANTHER PARTY
	
The California Penal Code Section 12020 through 12027 and also the Second Amendment of a Constitution guarantees the citizen the right to bear arms on public property .

	ELBERT “BIG MAN” HOWARD
BLACK PANTHER PARTY

Huey said we’re gonna carry our guns and we’re gonna follow the police and if they stop someone we’re gonna stop, we’re gonna maintain a legal distance and we’re gonna observe these so-called law officers in the performance of their duties .

	SOT

“Are you there? We’re coming around the corner, just stay facing the way you are.”

	SHERWIN FORTE

We would stop. We would get out of the cars. We would walk up to the scene. Those who had rifles, would carry them in the open. Clearly visible . 

	SOT HUEY NEWTON	
BLACK PANTHER PARTY

We would stand at a distance where the police couldn’t say they were interfering with their arrest or their detention of the individual and make sure that there was no brutality .

	V/O Stanley Nelson

The police were confronted by citizens who were not just voicing their opinions, but were armed . 

	RAY GAUL 
OAKLAND POLICE DEPARTMENT

They would take the weapon and pass it across like this. And it would sweep right over the officer. 

	SHERWIN FORTE
BLACK PANTHER PARTY

No one would do anything until a policeman ejected a round in the chamber then we would all eject rounds in the chamber and all up and down the streets you could hear this clackity-clack-clack-clack-clack . 





	RAY GAUL 
OAKLAND POLICE DEPARTMENT

And then when the traffic stop or the incident’s over, they bring the weapon down across by you like this and get back in their car and drive off . It was pretty intimidating.

	V/O Stanley Nelson

The Black Panther Party spread quickly, partly because young African Americans across the country had similar experiences with the police .

	ERICKA HUGGINS
BLACK PANTHER PARTY

We would get calls from Atlanta, Nashville, Raleigh, North Carolina; from Washington, D.C. ; Bridgeport, Connecticut. Every city small or large you could think of wanted a chapter of the Black Panther Party . 







	V/O Stanley Nelson

There’s no question that the Panthers were provocative . But there’s also no question that law enforcement exaggerated the threat they posed, and overreacted .

I think very definitely it is.
 
SOT REPORTER 
What is the answer?
 
SOT HOOVER 
The answer is vigorous law enforcement.
 
SOT REPORTER 
That’s the only answer?
 
SOT HOOVER 
That’s the only answer.

SOT REPORTER
How about justice? You hear a lot about justice with law enforcement.

HOOVER
Justice is merely incidental to law and order.





	SOT ANCHOR

FBI Director J Edgar Hoover today asserted that the Black Panthers represent the greatest internal threat to the nation . Hoover said the Panthers have perpetrated numerous assaults on police and have engaged in violent confrontations throughout the country .

	CLAYBORNE CARSON

When Hoover identified the Black Panther Party as the Number one threat to the national security of the United States at a time when they are fighting in Vietnam, of course that was crazy, but it was politically very effective. It says to law enforcement at the local level, “we can take the gloves off now. We don’t have to respect the civil liberties and we can go after them with everything we’ve got“. 



	SOT - REPORTERS

Obviously, we are nowhere near this today. 

In fact, we may be at a transformative moment. People of all ages and races are recognizing the problems with policing in black communities and are protesting. 

	SOT - PRESENT DAY PROTESTS
“We’re fired up! Can’t take it no more!”

Now, there is a chance for real change. 

But police departments and political leaders must not over react as they did 50 years ago. They need to listen.

	END There’s no stopping when it comes to the legendary artist Betye Saar, now 93. Her work reflects her very personal visions of nature, spirituality and ideas addressing equality and a new kind of African-American representation. transcript [MUSIC PLAYING] I am a person who walks looking down, because you can find lots of great things on the ground. I’m basically a recycler. You know, I find other people’s stuff and junk and recycle it into my stuff and junk. I can’t pass a yard sale. Action. Is that the word? Yeah, action. I come from a household where my mother was very artistic. In her era, women made quilts. They crocheted. They did things with their hands. Women were not particularly encouraged to be artists, especially women of color, so design was my choice at school. Through the years, I shifted into other kinds of art. My favorite probably is collage and assemblage, where I mix up materials, objects, ideas. Sometimes they tell a story, and sometimes they don’t. I prefer it when they don’t tell a story, so the viewer can invent their own story. I rarely look for a specific thing. I just kind of spot. I kind of go by my intuition. I can tell when a fan has something for me that I might use. At that time, there were very few black artists in Los Angeles. There was a larger community, a national community. They were having a conference in Chicago. So David Hammons and I decided that we wanted to go. During our spare time we went to the Field Museum. African art, oceanic art, primitive art, and folk art were not really considered art, so they were down in the basement. And it was weird down there, because it was all this energy from these tribal kinds of materials. When we came back to California, that was when I started doing the ancestral cast pieces, working with objects from Africa and organic things. When you know Betye and you start to really look into her work, you’d think that she escaped from one of the pyramids or something, you know what I mean? She’s just into a strong mystical quality. I was always interested in alternative beliefs, palmistry and phonology, astrology, and so forth. In the ’60s, I became more interested in what was happening about feminism and racism. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., his murder was something that was really horrific for me and shocking. I remember how I felt physically, just really angry and upset. But I was a mother with young children. I couldn’t walk in protest. But I did have a weapon. And that was art. That was when I started using black derogatory images. I did this piece called ‘The Liberation of Aunt Jemima,’ because it went back to how black people were thought of as comical, or caricatures, or animals. And I wanted to do something to show my protest for that, so I made Aunt Jemima as a warrior, as a fighter. She has a rifle and a hand grenade. She’s taking care of business. I was really hesitant about putting that figure up there. Some people thought it was humorous. But it did something that I didn’t know it would do. It made people think. It’s been forever. Racism hasn’t gone away. Has sexism gone away? No. So you still have to keep repeating things. My daughter found this scale for me — the weight of racism or so forth. I will probably paint the outside of it green and the inside red, so it looks like they’re in a watermelon. That’s my sense of humor. This sounds really gross. I applied for a National Endowment. And I received — I don’t know how many thousand. But when I got that check, I looked in the mirror, and I said, “Oh, Betye Saar. You’re really an artist.” Before I was just making stuff. I’ve been used to being a long admirer of hers for a long time. And suddenly, everywhere I go, people talk about her work. We’re in a culture that likes objects. You’re attracted maybe to beauty, or to usefulness. Or there’s other objects that you look and you’re disgusted with them. Everything has a past, so I feel that that energy is somehow enclosed with the object. What do I have now that’s new? Antlers. That’s my latest thing. Antlers. It’s always a puzzlement when I start collecting things. Like, “What can I do with this? I mean, what’s the point of that?” And then I’ll find another component and it says, “Oh, yeah. I can use it here.” It’s a very selfish reason that I make art. Because I like doing it. I’m in my 90s now. And all these pieces are sitting around waiting for me to put them together. And time is the biggest challenge. To find time to do it. I do have a birthday coming up. I’m a Leo. It means that I am like the lion. It’s best you not hear me roar. And that’s a wrap. This virtual reality film explores the legacy of The Green Book, a Jim Crow-era guidebook developed by Victor Hugo Green that help steer African-American travelers to points of welcome and safety across a virulently racist landscape. transcript [music] “The Negro Motorist Green Book,” first published in 1936, was a critical guide for African-Americans traveling during the ‘40s, ‘50s and early ‘60s. [music] It was created by a Harlem postal worker, Victor Green, and his colleagues, who gathered a listing of restaurants, bars, hotels and private homes that welcomed black travelers across the country. [music] In a time where Americans started hitting the road, African-Americans faced restrictions as they traveled. Although you could purchase a car, you couldn’t get gas, stay in hotels or eat in restaurants. Travel was difficult and dangerous. [music] Ben’s Chili Bowl, at 1213 U Street, Washington, D.C., was originally a silent movie theater called the Minnehaha. It was later featured in the “Green Book” as a pool hall. Since 1958, Ben’s Chili Bowl has continued the legacy of the “Green Book,” providing a refuge for the whole community. [music] I was born in Washington, D.C., in 1939 in a segregated hospital. I lived in a segregated neighborhood and I went to a segregated school. First, I didn’t realize any difference because all the people around me looked like me. And I was comfortable with that, until I realized that I was being discriminated against. [music] We couldn’t shop downtown at the major stores. You couldn’t try on clothes. You couldn’t try on hats. Because if you tried them on, they didn’t want you to get grease on the hats. You know, we oil our hair. And our makeup is dark, and so they didn’t want us to try on clothes because you might get makeup on the clothes. I remember being about 7, maybe 10 years old in Hecht’s department store when a little girl called me a nigger and spat on me. And I couldn’t retaliate. I couldn’t say anything. I couldn’t do anything. I was so angry inside, but I couldn’t do anything about it because I knew that it would be blamed on me. [interposing voices] “The ‘Green Book’ was a guide for African-Americans to travel safely, to find shelter, food and gas in a time where these basic rights were not guaranteed.” [interposing voices] “Washington, D.C., had more listings in the ‘Green Book’ than any other city in this country. The 1213 U Street was listed in the ‘Green Book,’ and that’s why we’re sitting here in Ben’s Chili Bowl at 1213 U Street today. From the very day that we opened up to the current time, it’s still a safe haven for people.” [music] “And we invited the community in, and we started with the neighborhood young men that thought this was home for them. They always sat over there in that corner. There was always eight, six, eight, 10 of them every evening, from different walks of life in the community. When someone spilled something on the floor and the staff was busy, one of them took care of it — go in the back, get the mop. If we were running out of ice, they’d say, ‘Hey, Joe, go get some ice for me’ — kind of place. That was really the beginning of the building of the relationship with this community, these young guys that found this to be home. As soon as they started to broadcast professional basketball, they put the TV up for them to keep them here so they wouldn’t have to go see that game someplace else. We didn’t have TVs in Ben’s Chili Bowl, but that was for them. And that brought in that segment of our community. And then, of course, this being the strong close-knit community that it was, when you came here for a chili dog, you ran into a friend.” [music] Particularly in the early ‘50s, when we would leave Washington, D.C., on the train, we could sit anywhere on the train, until you got to the Virginia line. And when you get to the Virginia line, you had to go to the last train on the back. And I remember being so frustrated because we could not eat on the highway if the train stopped. We couldn’t eat. We couldn’t relieve ourselves on the train. You either had to hold it or relieve yourself sitting there, and then you’re wet. When the train stopped, you would get off the train and you would relieve yourself outside, almost like you would if you were a dog. [music] And that’s the way basically I thought that white people felt about me as a black African-American — or Negro woman, or nigger woman, or whatever — that they felt like I was not human, not a human being, that I was less than a human being. I see people treat their dogs better now. Right now, they treat the dogs better than they treated us as black Americans. [interposing voices] “Well, one of the things that I remember was traveling from southwest Georgia down to Mississippi. And this was right after Miss Hamer had been beaten. I mean, they dragged her off the bus and beat her and crippled her. And one of the things that I remembered on that bus, I felt two things. First, I had to sit in the front of the bus, just like you. But second, I also was, in my head, saying, what am I going to do if these people come on the bus and try to treat me like Miss Hamer? And one of the things I was very clear about is that I was not getting off the bus and going to any of these places to try to use the bathroom. I was not going to get off the bus to try to get anything to eat. I knew enough to pack a lunch before I got on that bus. Now, it was a 10-hour ride from Albany, Ga., down to Jackson, Miss. But, I mean, it was really tough trying to not only deal with the question of where you’re going to go to the bathroom, where you’re going to go eat, but whether if you exercised your right under the law, whether somebody was going to come up there and try to assault you. That was a reality that we wanted to change. I mean, I remember I was maybe 14 years old when I started seeing the challenge, the real challenge, in Montgomery with the bus boycott, with Rosa Parks. Just in terms of local transportation and interstate transportation, we had to face people telling us, you’re not good as we are. And now because of people who got on the bus and challenged the institutions that were developed, you can dream big. You can dream bigger than we could dream. It was important. I mean, the biggest thing that we were able to do — and Frank can tell you this — the biggest thing we were able to do is we were able to say, you cannot block our dreams. Now we couldn’t say what our dreams were, but we could say, you can’t block our dreams. You can’t tell us what we can’t do. We’re going to kick down all these barriers.” [music] “Those barriers could be life threatening. Every trip through America for a black person during those times was potentially fatal. It seemed like many people were out to hurt us, or even kill us, just because we were black.” [thud] [grunt] [thud] [thud] [thud] [siren blaring] “The assumption is, at some time it stopped. And that’s not the case. It never stopped.” [shouting] “That’s a continuous thing that hasn’t changed since the beginning of the relationship that exists here between blacks and whites in the United States. It’s like a river that keeps flowing, and we don’t really see all of it. But at the end of the day, it’s something that started back in slavery and continues today. Young black people don’t have the ‘Green Book’ in front of them, but they have it in their head. We are no longer looking at ‘No Negroes Allowed’ and stuff like that, but you’re looking at the same thing, which says, these are barriers here. And then people feel that if you cross these barriers, they have a right to kill you.” [shouting] [music] “Tamir was such a energetic kid. At 12 years old, he would actually get up in my arms, as big as he was, and let me hold him and kiss him and squeeze all on him.” [music] “So that day when you got the knock on the door, what happened?” “So, I was actually coming from the store and putting groceries up, and a knock came at the door. Two little boys told me that my son was shot by the police. And I was like in denial. I’m like, ‘No, you’re not talking about my kids. My kids is at the rec playing.’ And my oldest son was laying on the couch. He wasn’t feeling well. But he ran out right past me. I guess he heard it in the little boy’s voice. And he ran out before me, and I’m still trying to get my coat and my shoes on, talking about, ‘No, my kids is playing.’ And surely enough, as I walk across the street around a little track where I could see the kids, my son is laying on the ground with 10 police officers surrounding him. And my daughter is screaming in the back of the police car. And they have my other son surrounded, and they put him in the back of the police car. So it was terrible. That’s how that day turned out. The police asked me — well they didn’t ask me, they told me to calm down or they were going to put me in the back of the police car. Because I was trying to get to my son. They never let me get to him. They also let me ride in the front seat as a passenger.” “Of the police car.” “Of the ambulance.” “Of the ambulance.” “So I never even got a chance to get back close to my son, to hold his hand, to kiss him and let him know that it was going to be all right. I don’t know what they were doing.” “So he was in the back of the ambulance, and you were in the front.” “Yeah, I was in the front, like a passenger.” “What kind of service were they giving Tamir at the scene?” “I don’t know because they were surrounding him.” “They were surrounding him.” “I couldn’t really see.” “What were the officers doing? They were just standing there?” “Well they were just blocking me, not letting me go towards him, and telling me to calm down. And I’m telling them, you need to let my kids out the car. They’re minors and stuff like that. And like I told you, they gave me an ultimatum to stay at the scene of the crime with the other two children or to go with Tamir. I chose to go with Tamir, and I had to leave two children at the scene of a crime.” [music] “Everybody see what happened to my son. They didn’t even want to release that tape. My attorney had to threaten them to release the tape. And after that tape was released, it just went worldwide.” “What did you see on that tape? What was your reaction to it?” “My son was scared when they rolled up. He was scared. And he shrugged his shoulders, like this. They tried to say he was reaching for his waistband. He wasn’t reaching for nothing. When you roll up fast like that, you scared him.” “Absolutely.” “And that’s what I see.” “He was just stuck. He was just like — “ “Yeah. Like, what did I do?” “Right.” “Yeah. So, yeah, I will never get that vision out my head. That’s devastating. I play it over and over again. Also, with the picture of him laying on a gurney, and they would not allow me to touch him because they said he was evidence. So I didn’t even get a chance to touch him or none of that. No kiss goodbye. No nothing. No feeling him or nothing. So they said he was evidence, so I couldn’t touch him. And I don’t really know how that works.” “What ultimately happened to Tamir’s body?” “So — I had to get Tamir — well I didn’t have to, I choose to get him cremated. I don’t really think I told anyone that. But I don’t want to leave my son in Cleveland when I leave Ohio, so I will be taking him and my mother with me and have them in urns in my house.” “So to take him everywhere that you go, every stage of the rest of your life.” “Yeah, he has to go with me. Yeah. Because he just has to go. I wasn’t finished raising him, you know? I wasn’t finished nourishing him. And America robbed me. Yep, they robbed me.” “So when people talk about the American dream, what do you call it?” “A nightmare, especially if you’re black. Yeah.” [music] Traveling while black means to me that discrimination, segregation is still alive and well. And that even though I don’t have to have the “Green Book” to guide me to a black person’s house and I can stay in any hotel I want, but just think about the people who have been killed while traveling black. A young man, who was involved in the schools in the area where he lived, killed in front of his fiancée and their child, traveling while black. Traveling while black, I’m driving down the highway and the police decide to stop me. Even though I’m an elderly black woman, I could be killed just because I’m black and don’t give them the answer that they want. Traveling while black in America is still happening. And I am really frightened for black men traveling while black. I wonder, when does it end? [music] The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

2020,What It Was Like to Work for Andrew Yang,"He has called his campaign “the journey of my life.” But what got lost in the novelty of his bid, former employees say, was scrutiny of his life before this particular journey. Andrew Yang has pitched himself to voters as an entrepreneurial problem solver on quest to save America from automation.Credit...Christopher Lee for The New York Times MANCHESTER, N.H. — The Andrew Yang on the presidential debate stage, the one who spoke about the need for more women in leadership and the lack of racial diversity among top-tier Democratic candidates, was the same person they’d once worked for. But for some of his former employees, it seemed almost impossible to believe how far he’d come since a moment a few years ago when he told everyone at his nonprofit about a horror movie he’d read about. Mr. Yang had been struck by an article about the film, “The Babadook,” which was written and directed by a woman and explores themes of motherhood. Movies like “The Babadook,” he told his employees, were in short supply and thus filled a gap in the market. If only more women were given opportunities, he continued — echoing an argument he made publicly around the same time in a 2015 essay — they would identify different problems than men and similarly help address market demands with their endeavors. Members of the mostly female team recalled exchanging glances. To some, it felt as if Mr. Yang were discovering sexism for the first time and explaining it to them. Seven former staff members, some of whom attended this talk, discussed the episode and other staff meetings in interviews with The New York Times, describing the conversations in general and the movie discussion in particular as emblematic of Mr. Yang’s behavior as a boss. In his life before politics, they said they saw in Mr. Yang a man who was smart, had good ideas, was a persuasive speaker and was occasionally inspiring. But he sometimes stumbled in his dealings with gender and race, expressing what the former employees said were antiquated and unnerving views for a presidential candidate seeking the nomination from a Democratic Party that has been moving to the left. On the campaign trail, Mr. Yang has pitched himself to voters as an entrepreneurial problem solver on a quest to save America from automation — a candidate with the ideas to ignite a movement and the business savvy to get things done. Yang supporters have flocked to him, they say, because he has one clear idea: universal basic income. And one clear message about who he is. He earned a spot at the debate Friday in New Hampshire mostly on the strength of his rapport with voters here. He arrived from Iowa apparently without any pledged delegates, and in the aftermath of that performance has fired members of his campaign staff. He has signaled repeatedly that the primary Tuesday is of paramount importance in terms of his campaign’s viability. Join us for live analysis on debate night. Subscribe to “On Politics,” and we’ll send you a link. 
 Regardless of the outcome, the sheer magnitude of what Mr. Yang has achieved seems to be dawning fully upon him. He broke down in tears last week at an event in Iowa as he observed that campaigning for the last two years had been “the journey of my life.” And speaking with voters in New Hampshire on Wednesday, he shared what he said he had been telling his two young boys in recent days: “Daddy’s got a big deadline on Tuesday.” When the Democrats do eventually pick a nominee and reflect on this process, the rise and staying power of Mr. Yang in this race — outlasting some governors and senators, drawing money and interest far longer than most people expected him to — will offer a clear lesson: In a campaign of maximum anxiety and maximum field size, an outsider with a specific message and a fanciful promise of free money can stand out. But what was lost in the novelty, his former employees say, was real scrutiny. Some of his former employees see, in Mr. Yang’s unlikely staying power into the early 2020 nominating contests, not just an odd embrace of an outsider, but a casual disregard for allegations about how he treated women who worked for him. It is a collective shrug, they say, that they find all the more disconcerting given how explosive and relevant gender has become in the race. At the same time, Mr. Yang’s cavalier use of racial stereotypes about Asian-Americans and what his former employees say is a surprising lack of attention to his record as a chief executive have also gnawed at those who say they watched their boss similarly fumble delicate topics and conversations for years. Some of Mr. Yang’s former employees describe a jubilant, funny, thoughtful leader who gave high fives and fist pounds, and sought to keep the mood light — a man who resembles the candidate they see on the campaign trail. Mr. Yang does not drink alcohol, but he would buy the first round during company celebrations, they said. He took employees on ski trips and to sporting events. And he encouraged people to do well while holding them to account. But even years after their time spent working for him, many other former employees still recall specific episodes that they say highlighted Mr. Yang’s shortcomings: several women allege that he treated them unfairly when it came to compensation and employment; he once offhandedly remarked that the nonprofit fellowship program, Venture for America, might simply not be the best fit for black applicants; he convinced his nonprofit to pay for his family to join him on a lengthy fund-raising trip to California that proved largely unsuccessful. Ten of his former employees said they harbored deep reservations about his leadership and decision making. Many of the 20 people who worked for or closely with Mr. Yang who discussed their memories did so on the condition of anonymity, fearing reprisal from the entrepreneur, a negative impact on their work and social circles and virulent online harassment from his supporters, known as the “Yang Gang.” In an interview, Mr. Yang said he was proud of what he and his teams accomplished over the years at what he called “goal-oriented, high-performing organizations.” “I think that most people felt that my heart was in the right place,” he said, “even if I mis-stepped at various times.” On the stump, Mr. Yang summarizes his early years in a matter of minutes: After graduating from Brown University, he went to law school, spent five months as an unhappy corporate lawyer and then co-founded a business that experienced a “mini rise and maximum fall.” The business, Stargiving, had been designed to help celebrities raise money for their favorite charities and gave Mr. Yang experience pitching and interacting with stars about two decades before an eclectic group of actors — including Dave Chappelle, Donald Glover and Ken Jeong — would find their way into his presidential camp. Mr. Yang then moved on to work at two more start-ups, but a job at a health care start up hit a dead end in 2005. Around that time Mr. Yang reconnected with Zeke Vanderhoek, the founder of the test-prep company then called Manhattan GMAT where Mr. Yang had previously written curricular materials and sometimes filled in as an instructor. Now Mr. Vanderhoek wanted to start a charter school — and he wanted Mr. Yang to take over the company. Mr. Yang agreed and began running it in 2006, at age 30. “I was charged up and ready to make a mark,” Mr. Yang wrote in his first book. Several people who worked at the test-prep company described a close-knit office of about 15 full-time staff members and several other part-time employees. The atmosphere there was “loose” and “upbeat,” said Jeremy Shinewald, who worked almost daily with Mr. Yang at Manhattan Prep and later served on the board of Venture for America. Four people who worked with Mr. Yang at the test-prep company said he was socially awkward and prone to overstepping boundaries. They variously recounted moments when he burst out laughing when someone discussed a tragic event or when he pressured employees to participate at company karaoke outings. Chris Ryan, an executive director at Kaplan who worked at Manhattan Prep as a part-time instructor in 2003 and became full time in 2007, said he believed Mr. Yang’s efforts at team building were “earnest and well meaning.” “He was like, ‘I’m going to do the goofy teacher role,’” Mr. Ryan said. The company was sold to Kaplan in late 2009 for what Mr. Yang has said was the “low tens of millions.” After the transfer cleared, he described giving out checks to employees like “Asian Santa Claus” and realizing that he had just been minted a “34-year-old millionaire,” though it is not clear exactly how much he was worth at the time. (In financial disclosure forms filed last summer, Mr. Yang reported assets worth as much as $2.4 million.) Having completed his work at the test-prep company, Mr. Yang began a new endeavor: Venture for America. The goal of the nonprofit was to create 100,000 jobs by 2025 in the underserved cities where the fellows that the organization selected and trained would work and start businesses. Mr. Yang has since acknowledged that Venture for America, which continues to operate under different leadership, has fallen well short of its goal. But as a presidential candidate, he puts a positive spin on V.F.A.’s failure to hit the goal, saying it led him to investigate the root causes of job loss and discover the impact of automation. Many of Mr. Yang’s former employees said that he worked extremely hard alongside them and that in some cases, Mr. Yang and the people he worked with became personal friends. Todd Nelson, who was part of the program’s first class of Venture for America fellows in 2012, and later worked for Mr. Yang as part of the organization, said his former boss maintained “high expectations” and praised his integrity. As Mr. Nelson was beginning to mull rabbinical school several years ago, he ran the idea by Mr. Yang, who he said was extremely supportive. “I will trust him until the day I die,” Mr. Nelson said. But several former Venture for America employees said there were moments when they questioned Mr. Yang’s judgment. For example, multiple employees recalled a period in 2016 when he had the nonprofit pay for him, his family and their nanny to stay at an Airbnb in the Bay Area for about 10 weeks on the assumption that he would procure significant new sources of funding for Venture for America. Mr. Yang, they said, failed to generate anywhere close to the $500,000 he had hoped to solicit. In an interview, Mr. Yang broadly confirmed that the episodes described by former employees took place. “I’m now a dad with two boys and so instead trying to lead the team out on a karaoke night, I try to run home and see my kids,” he said. “And that’s probably better for everyone, because it turns out a lot of people don’t want the boss around in their off hours.” As for his trip to the Bay Area, he said: “We didn’t raise the money I was trying to raise, but it was certainly not for want of trying.” Mr. Yang’s support among men tends to outpace his support among women. And in recent months, claims of gender-based discrimination and harassment have surfaced among campaign volunteers, some of whom wrote a letter to Mr. Yang in which they warned of a “bro-culture problem.” The Yang campaign said it was assessing the allegations, and would bring in an expert to conduct anti-harassment training. Those developments have not surprised some of Mr. Yang’s former employees, who said Mr. Yang’s boorish behavior sometimes made him look and sound more like a fraternity brother than a chief executive. And indeed, there have been episodes on the trail that could be described that way. In one of his books, Mr. Yang described nicknaming his pectorals “Lex” and “Rex” and in another he said he worked out “a little too much” in college. In an interview last fall, he specified that Rex is the right pectoral muscle and Lex is the left one. “Check it out, this is Rex still trying to talk,” he said, flexing the muscle. At an office opening in December, Mr. Yang sprayed whipped cream into the open mouth of a man kneeling on the ground in front of him, remarking, “It’s just a joke” as he did it. Mr. Yang’s campaign manager sought to intervene moments later as the candidate repeated the stunt with a second person. These episodes have struck some as being somewhat at odds with the way Mr. Yang has framed himself as a progressive champion for women. He has won praise for highlighting the value of his wife’s work as a stay-at-home mother and speaking out in favor of paid family leave and closing the gender pay gap. Ronit Pelman, who was one of Manhattan Prep’s first employees and became part of Mr. Yang’s leadership team there, said that while watching Mr. Yang on the trail, she has been struck by his genuine desire to pitch ideas that “are centered around fixing the world.” She spoke glowingly about her time working for Mr. Yang years ago. When she was pregnant, she said, he figured out a way to allow her to work remotely from Florida after the birth of her first child. “We were friends,” she added. “Andrew was the best.” But not all of the women at Manhattan Prep felt that way. In September, a woman who worked for Mr. Yang there alleged that he had fired her because she had gotten married and he thought her work would suffer. Mr. Yang and Mr. Vanderhoek have forcefully denied that Mr. Yang engaged in gender discrimination when he fired the employee, saying she was let go because of her job performance. In an interview, the woman, Kimberly Watkins, said she was “not at all surprised” by what she said was Mr. Yang’s “knee-jerk” impulse to call her a liar. “There is no data that I was not executing my job properly,” she said. “He promoted me and I hit every revenue goal, every marker set out for me.” In November, a second woman who worked at Manhattan Prep alleged that Mr. Yang had engaged in wrongful termination and discrimination when he let her go after multiple discussions about her pay not being in line with that of male colleagues doing commensurate work. Her recollection was broadly confirmed by documents and by a co-worker to whom she relayed conversations about the situation at the time. At various points, she said Mr. Yang had acknowledged that her pay was inequitable, but refused to increase her salary. In a statement, a spokesman for Mr. Yang’s campaign said: “Andrew Yang has had the unfortunate task of letting staff go who did not meet the organization’s standards. The information provided by the letter-writer does not reflect the reality of the situation.” For months, Mr. Yang has drawn applause with this line: “The opposite of Donald Trump is an Asian man who likes math.” The son of Taiwanese immigrants, Mr. Yang is one of a small handful of Asian-American candidates ever to run for president. As such, the way Mr. Yang has discussed race has been the subject of intense scrutiny. His embrace of stereotypes that perpetuate the model-minority myth about Asian-Americans was sharply criticized in the fall over a proclamation he made during a nationally televised debate: “I am Asian, so I know a lot of doctors.” Several former employees described being struck by the awkward and sometimes aloof way they said Mr. Yang talked about race. Venture for America had been forced to grapple with diversity and inclusion issues from the outset; the former employees said — and an analysis of information on the organization’s website confirms — that about 60 of the 100 people in the first two classes of fellows were white men, though over the years, the diversity of subsequent fellowship classes improved. The employees spoke of a perennial tension around how strongly to prioritize diversity and inclusion when it came to selecting fellows. Five former V.F.A. employees recalled that as they were expressing concerns over black fellows’ struggles to procure job placements, Mr. Yang suggested offhandedly that the program might simply not be the best fit for black applicants — a remark that enraged some team members who say he later walked the remark back. Some also said that Mr. Yang vacillated on whether to categorize Asian-Americans as people of color, an underrepresented minority or underprivileged minority, given that he said they were overrepresented in the start-up and tech worlds. Mr. Yang confirmed the recollections of his former employees regarding the discussions about black fellows. He also confirmed that he had told his team it should not herald the diversity of its fellowship classes if the diversity amounted mostly to “a bunch of Asian-Americans who are overrepresented in the space.” Speaking more generally on how to discuss the subject of identity in the workplace and on the campaign trail, Mr. Yang told The New York Times: “I do have very strong feelings and points of view on race. I understand my identity very acutely.” “But,” he added, “I’m not sure if leading with that is necessarily the most helpful way to move any community forward.” His identity now, he said in an interview after a long day of campaigning in New Hampshire on Thursday, has been shaped by the two years he has spent on the trail. He opens up more. He is not just about charts and figures. He said that people tell him that his run has made them think that better things are possible in this country. And they tell him it has made them think something else, too: “That people who aren’t career politicians can just decide to run for president.” Stacey Stowe and Isabella Grullón Paz contributed reporting from New York.

2020,What It’s Like to Be Quarantined on an Island Over Coronavirus Fears,"inside the outbreak Evacuees taken to Australia’s Christmas Island, a former detention center for asylum seekers, have been given sunscreen, sandals and shorts. They also have video games. Get an informed guide to the global outbreak with our daily Coronavirus
 newsletter.
 Life in an immigration detention center on Australia’s Christmas Island has not been as bad as David Huang feared. It is certainly a far cry from the conditions that thousands of asylum seekers have faced in the country’s offshore detention centers in recent years. Sure, the steel on the building’s facade is rusted in parts. The Wi-Fi is shaky, especially at meal times when he and others are trying to contact their families and friends. Dinner, at least on Tuesday, the first night he spent there, was uninspiring and mushy. Yet after being evacuated from the Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, he had set his expectations low. Mr. Huang, a 22-year-old student from Sydney, is one of about 270 Australian citizens and permanent residents who have been flown out of China in the past week and taken to Christmas Island. None of the evacuees have tested positive for the virus, Australia’s health minister said on Tuesday. Health experts have criticized the government’s decision to quarantine them for two weeks in a center usually used to house asylum seekers rather than holding the evacuees in better-equipped military bases on the mainland. But while some evacuees have said the conditions at the center are worse than they had imagined, Mr. Huang said he personally found the quarantine bearable. Although he said the travelers had found dead moths in their beds and dead cockroaches on the floors, and spent much of their first night in the center cleaning, Mr. Huang said he didn’t really mind. “It’s obviously not great for the rooms to have dirty conditions,” he said by telephone. “But I think its important to think about the fact that there are so many families here that they have to accommodate.” Workers at the center have been responsive to the evacuees’ requests, Mr. Huang said. They added more fruit and vegetables to the meals, handed out soap and cigarettes, as well as sunscreen, shorts and sandals — attire more suited to the tropical island than the clothes they had brought from China. There are Xbox 360 gaming devices, which some of the evacuees were playing to pass the time. Those in the quarantine have been given wrist bands with QR codes that, when scanned, provide access to their medical records. And every day, doctors wearing face masks and full protective medical gear take their temperatures. Families are split into two people per room. Mr. Huang and his father are staying in one room, while his mother and brother are staying in another. The rooms have bunk beds and a desk. Showers and toilets are shared. For Mr. Huang and his family, their journey began on Sunday in the city of Xiangyang in Hubei Province, about three hours away from Wuhan, the Chinese city hardest hit by the virus. They had been visiting relatives during the Lunar New Year holiday last month when the authorities locked down Xiangyang as part of a security cordon to contain the epidemic. When the family decided to leave, they made a series of phone calls to Chinese and Australian officials and received documents that allowed them to drive through multiple checkpoints to Wuhan’s airport. The flight first landed on Learmonth, an air base in Western Australia. Passengers were then transferred on separate flights to Christmas Island. There, Mr. Huang, who is worried about contracting the virus, has mostly kept to himself. Each day after waking up, he goes for a walk outside the building, which is surrounded by tall fences. After breakfast and a medical check, Mr. Huang, who is studying game development, returns to his room, where he plays computer games for a few hours. Then he goes for another walk to check his social media accounts. To pass the time, his mother has been teaching him how to read and write Chinese characters. “And repeat,” he said. “That’s what my daily schedule looks like.” Mr. Huang said the hardest thing to deal with was the sense of isolation on an unfamiliar island, and he misses his friends in Sydney. “Very, very homesick, I think describes both my family and the families around us,” he wrote on Facebook Messenger shortly before the internet seemed to drop out once more.",The New York Times
2020,What It’s Like to Be the Face of Trump’s Super Bowl Ad,"The president commuted the life sentence of Alice Marie Johnson. “For him to highlight me,” she says, “it makes me know he’s not only proud, he’s super proud.” WASHINGTON — Alice Marie Johnson was watching the Super Bowl with two of her sisters on Sunday night when she saw her own face in an advertisement amid the commercials for Doritos and Audis. Ms. Johnson was serving a life sentence in an Alabama prison for a nonviolent drug conviction when the president commuted her sentence in 2018. The reality television star Kim Kardashian West had discovered Ms. Johnson’s story on social media and personally appealed to him on her behalf. And now the 64-year-old African-American woman was the star of the Trump campaign’s multimillion-dollar Super Bowl ad, part of an effort by Mr. Trump and his son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, to reach black voters. Footage of Ms. Johnson reuniting with her family after nearly 22 years in prison was viewed by 102 million football and Jennifer Lopez fans watching the game. For Ms. Johnson, who cannot vote in the election because of her criminal conviction, it all came as a bit of a surprise. “I knew it was a strong possibility that I was going to be in the ad,” Ms. Johnson said in an interview on Thursday afternoon. “At least a week before, I’d been told there was a possibility. I didn’t know I would be the full ad. I thought I might be somewhere in the ad.” The ad featuring Ms. Johnson was made by the Trump campaign late last year. But the president settled on using the 30-second spot during the Super Bowl only in the days leading up to the game, people familiar with the process said. Ms. Johnson described the experience of seeing it for the first time, in real time, from her hotel room in Miami as “thrilling,” and the reaction, after the fact, as out-of-body. “I was going through the airport and I could see people trying to figure out, ‘Is that that lady?’ I had someone in the seat next to me say, ‘Are you that lady who Kim Kardashian helped come home?’” Since her release, Ms. Johnson has worked as a criminal justice reform activist, and published a memoir, “After Life: My Journey From Incarceration to Freedom.” It was a coincidence that she happened to also be in Miami, this year’s Super Bowl host city, on Sunday night, where she was attending an event for the Stand Together Foundation, which helps people living in poverty find jobs. Mr. Trump, over the past few days, has proved himself to be a master of elevating a heartwarming story that affects just one person as evidence of the larger good his administration is doing for working people’s lives. At his State of the Union address on Tuesday night, he surprised Stephanie Davis, a single mother, with a scholarship that would allow her fourth-grade daughter to attend the school of her choice. Ms. Johnson said she was aware of some backlash to the Super Bowl advertisement, with critics calling it a political play aimed at papering over Mr. Trump’s record on race. But she said highlighting her personal story was good for her movement, even if some saw it as a cynical maneuver. “Some people say, ‘Oh, this poor lady is being used,’” she said. “I don’t feel like a prop. To have criminal justice reform as the centerpiece of the Super Bowl ad, that lifts everyone up in this arena.” Ms. Johnson said she was not a political person and did not have any plans to campaign for Mr. Trump. But she said she was proud to be the face of his campaign on television. “I’ve been such a source of pride for him,” she said. “Who doesn’t want to show something they’re proud of during an election year? That’s what all the candidates do. For him to highlight me, it makes me know he’s not only proud, he’s super proud.” She described herself as “not an expert in politics” but someone fighting for “anything that advances my cause, anything that advances my cause of bringing people home.” Ms. Johnson would not say whether she would vote for Mr. Trump if she could. “I can’t vote, and that’s part of what I’m fighting for,” she said. But as for criticizing Mr. Trump, she said that was simply out of the question for her. “Can you imagine turning on someone who saves your life?” she said. “Just on a personal level, can you imagine?” Updated Feb. 29, 2020",The New York Times
2020,What Makes Sustainable Fashion?,"Fashion Review It’s not just about the yarn. Ideas from Gabriela Hearst, Coach and Rodarte. For all that the climate crisis has been at the center of the international conversation; for all it has been at the forefront of the Democratic presidential debates; for all the talk about it around the Oscars; for all that it was one of the biggest trends to emerge from the shows last season — for all that, as the New York collections draw to a close, the question of sustainability has been strangely absent from the catwalks. (So, for that matter, have most issues.) Admittedly, paper invitations have largely given way to digital ones, and designers have hinted at the subject: At Sies Marjan, Sander Lak claimed inspiration from a Guggenheim exhibition by Rem Koolhaus opening next week entitled “Countryside: The Future,” about — yes — the ecology of the outdoors. (Mr. Lak is a sponsor, so he’s putting his money where his mind is.) Then he used material science to bring it in: embedding leaves in cloudlike white dresses and suiting; adding tendrils of root systems to a big black overcoat; felting and fraying wool so it looked like mossy fungus. But it was Gabriela Hearst who put waste front and center. Sort of. Ms. Hearst, who last season announced a carbon-neutral fashion show, has long been one of the most vocal designers in the city about climate change and fashion’s responsibility therein. This time around she had borrowed giant bales of scrap paper from a recycling plant in Brooklyn and installed them as a backdrop, turning her store into the setting for a peculiarly urban hoedown — and raising expectations. Would the whole show be about garbage? How enticing! (That is not sarcasm.) Well, no. And yes. Ms. Hearst had, indeed, been thinking about repurposing and its role in a collection. She had sourced antique rug remnants from a Turkish market and turned them into a terrific woven jacket and sweeping greatcoat. She had gone through her storeroom and found two groups of unsold coats in her trademark exacting tailoring — one camel, one navy — cut them up and blanket-stitched them back together into two-tone cool. She had placed a big bet on some bolts of dead stock and sewed it into a slick tuxedo suit seamed in braid and a one-shoulder dress caught up with a brass buckle on the collarbone. But these were only a fraction of what was shown, sandwiched between swishy, deep-pile corduroy suiting with nipped-in waists, big pleated pockets and epaulets on the shoulders; extravagantly fringed chunky knits and hand-painted leathers. That can make the upcycling and the bales seem like decoration — a superficial gloss laid atop a story that is actually same old/same old, no matter how tangibly desirable. It can expose fashion to oft-repeated charges of hypocrisy. But that kind of criticism, easy to make, actually misses the point. One that is rarely discussed, but that the non-upcycled bits of Ms. Hearst’s collection made clear: If you make something signature, something women love, then you have made a sustainable garment because you have made something non-disposable. That should be the yardstick against which all else is measured. That is the difference between an heirloom and landfill. And that should be the goal of all designers all the time, whether or not they are measuring their carbon imprint or researching materials made from pineapple. So though it was easy to see the flower boas and headdresses made from live orchids at the Rodarte show and think “What an unnecessary sacrifice,” and while that was true, it is also true that the designers Kate and Laura Mulleavy make singular, fantastical garments. The sort of garments that blossom in the imagination and exist outside of time and trend: polka-dot 1940s tea dresses and witchy white robes corseted in crystal spider webs; royal brocade rocker trousers and Midsummer Night’s Dream bias-cut silks. (A sorcerer’s vibe showed up, too, in Vera Wang’s Gashlycrumb Tinies-in-a-sex-shop combinations of delicate slips trailing wings of tulle atop tailored shorts, thigh-high socks and towering platforms — a nod to magical thinking, perhaps.) And similarly, it was easy to see the plethora of leather — leather culottes and leather shirts and leather coats — and fuzzy, collaged shearling at Coach and raise an eyebrow, since the brand enthusiastically got on the anti-fur bandwagon in 2018. Yes, as the designer Stuart Vevers said backstage after the show, these skins are byproducts of the meat industry, but yes, leather production is also chemical-intensive, and if you’re going to feel bad for the animals, maybe you should think about their habitat, too. Yet it is also true, as Mr. Vevers pointed out, that leather tends to be kept and gets better with age. And that in their unforced tactile detail and connection to Coach’s legacy past, these qualified as investment pieces. That’s what Michael Kors was thinking about, anyway, when he revisited a cape (one of many in this collection, mixed in among the paisley pleats and hammered metal sequins, the organic denim and shearling) he first made 21 years ago. Originally modeled by Naomi Campbell, it was later worn by Joan Didion in a portrait by Tina Barney and now reimagined in an enveloping, striped cayenne pepper-colored cashgora — part security blanket, part urban cowgirl. That’s what he was thinking when he paired almost every look with Wellie-like riding boots, just as he did in his first collection, almost 40 years ago. It’s this kind of signature that was missing from Prabal Gurung’s uptown amalgamation of snazzy white tuxedos, leopard print, diva dresses draped on the hip, explosive peplums and feather fripperies. Each look on its own with a champagne polish, but lacking identity. And thus, staying power. Which is why the kitchen-sink craftiness of Eckhaus Latta, awkward and alluring at the same time, has so much resonance. There’s something entirely personal about its weird juxtapositions and connections, even as the results have become more sophisticated: high-waist acid-washed denim jeans with pockets placed back to front; irregular patchwork knits and slithery magenta nylon; cropped triangular jackets over shrunken pleated miniskirts; and juicy orange and blue sheaths with space age-y oval cutouts at the clavicle. They are unmistakably clothes to live in over time. Oh, and by the way, those runway shoes? They were Prada, Fendi and Gucci, secondhand, sourced from the resale site The RealReal. And they will be resold accordingly.",The New York Times
2020,Opinion | What My Epilepsy Taught Me About the Value of Time,"We know more about epilepsy than ever. But I am still trying to reckon with mine. Ms. Bruenig is an Opinion writer. Among the many special causes entrusted to the patronage of St. Valentine — beekeeping, love — is epilepsy, though no one seems to know exactly why. The great 20th-century psychiatrist Leo Kanner guessed in a 1930 paper on epileptic folklore that the association was earned by the similarity between the sound of Valentine’s name spoken in German and the epithet “fallende Sucht,” “the falling disease.” It may have been that over time, entreaties to Valentine from epileptics were answered with particular generosity. They needed all the help they could get. Kanner cites several other saints known to be patrons of epilepsy, whose names were given over time as euphemisms for the disease — St. John, St. Donato, St. Cornelius and scores more. It has been some time now since epileptics had only the saints for recourse, though the path from superstition and desperation to social acceptance and medical improvements has been fraught. The bad old days are far behind us, but the essential features of the disease — the loneliness, the suffering, the search for meaning in it — remain much the same. I have been epileptic all my life, and I am still trying to reckon with it. To have epilepsy is to have one of any number of underlying conditions. Epilepsy describes not the problem — which could be congenital; acquired, as through injury; or some combination of both — but its manifestation: having recurrent, unprovoked seizures. Roughly 3.4 million people in the United States have some form of active epilepsy. The kind I have, Janz Syndrome, is among the more common. There are remedies for seizures: medications, devices, surgeries and diets. All have varying levels of success depending on the syndrome and the type of seizure, and even the particular patient. And none are without long and miserable side-effect profiles. I have tried a half-dozen of these drugs and have hated them all, and a few years ago I decided to dispense with medication altogether. I have more seizures, but I’m happier, too. It isn’t advised — and I wouldn’t necessarily advise it — but for me, the occasional trauma of seizures is preferable to the daily misery of headaches, nausea and incoherent drowsiness. I doubt most epileptics would be willing to go so far, especially those with catastrophic forms of the disease. If my condition were much worse, I would most likely find the viselike press of a permanent headache preferable to the alternative. Neurologists tend to be impatient with pickiness about medications, and perhaps they have a point. Things used to be much worse, and we ought to be grateful. But one at least imagines the saints to be sympathetic. Which is not to say that premodern societies were especially solicitous regarding the welfare of epileptics. The historical record indicates that civilizations dating back to antiquity were aware of people who had seizures chronically and that they struggled to figure out what to make of them. Around 400 B.C., an anonymous physician compiled a monograph on the subject titled “On the Sacred Disease,” which was meant to dispel the apparently widespread belief that epilepsy had some magical aspect. His effort to establish epilepsy as an ordinary medical phenomenon was valiant, but long in the vindication. By the Middle Ages, seizures had become associated less with prophetic insight and more with demonic activity, though some physicians held to the ancient idea of epilepsy as a natural disease. Supernatural explanations for seizures lasted through the Enlightenment, and then modernity bestowed its own strange gifts upon epileptics. In the proceedings of the first annual meeting of the National Association for the Study of Epilepsy and the Care and Treatment of Epileptics, in Washington in May of 1901, a philanthropist listed only by the name I.F. Mack wondered how many such “hopeless, helpless, unfortunate creatures” there must have been in the United States, all in want of internment in residential colonies for their kind. By his count, thousands were already locked away in such centers, and thousands more would be over time. In fact, Buck v. Bell, the 1927 Supreme Court decision that enshrined involuntary, eugenic sterilization in law, regarded a woman who was held at the Virginia State Colony of Epileptics and Feebleminded, though she herself was neither. Nevertheless, untold numbers of epileptics were sterilized against their will under the ruling, which has never been overturned, though forced sterilizations declined significantly in the second half of the 20th century. Today, thanks in part to a broadening of civil rights and in part to advances in medical science, epilepsy is neither a spiritual gift nor a moral malady. Epileptics are not generally thought of as incapable of managing independent life, nor do any public structures remain that could house and treat them at any rate. Finding meaning in the disease, and sorting out how to live with it, is up to each one of us — alone. If the past saw epilepsy as a communal problem, either relating to gods and devils and their intentions for humankind or to the genetic quality of whole nations, it is now a distinctly private one. And what does it mean? It means that there are limits on the things I can do — I don’t drive, for instance — but it moreover means there are limits on my time. My greatest seizure trigger is sleep deprivation. Even an hour of missed sleep can be disastrous — but I still miss hours and hours of sleep. This condition has given me cause to reflect on what is worth rising early for or staying up late for. If my daughters are sick, it is worth the risk to hold a late vigil; if they stir at dawn on Christmas morning, it is worth the risk to see them delight in their presents. When friends arrive after midnight from out of town, or when election results on which everything depends (there seem to be many of these now) come in late or when I am in the middle of a conversation I don’t want to leave — all of these things come at a cost, and I am willing to pay it. Willing because they are worth it. They are the conduits through which love flows into our lives — and so perhaps the dual patronage of St. Valentine is especially apt. This is what living with epilepsy is like, this ready payment for minutes and hours, because to give them up is to cease living. I used to think of this as a heavy tax leveled by my epilepsy, but now I see that I simply misunderstood the value of time before. I see it even in the plain and uneventful moments: My daughter and I sit on the floor so that we can cook together, and she peers down as I chop an onion, her eyes reddening at the corners. Why does it hurt my eyes, she asks, when you cut up the onion. It’s how onions protect themselves, I tell her: Every living thing wants most of all to live. And I am no different.

2020,What Needs to Happen to Get Boeing’s 737 Max Flying Again?,"The plane could be back in the air relatively soon, but the company, regulators and airlines must do several things first. Boeing’s 737 Max could be flying again before too long. The plane has been grounded since last March, after two crashes in five months killed 346 people. The crisis has cost Boeing billions of dollars and led to the ouster of its chief executive, who repeatedly offered overly optimistic assessments of when the Max would be back in the air. Now there are signs that the Max may return to service relatively soon. On Thursday, Stephen Dickson, the administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration, said a crucial test flight could occur in the coming weeks, setting in motion the complex process of ungrounding the plane. He also revealed that there was yet another problem with the Max: an indicator light that erroneously activated because of an issue with the flight control computer. Boeing is working to resolve the issue, which the company said it did not believe would cause further delays. Given the approaching test flight, and barring significant new problems, airlines like Southwest, American and United may be able to stick to their plans to use the Max this summer. Here’s what has to happen first. The indicator light is just one of several issues that Boeing is still trying to resolve. Another major sticking point is whether Boeing needs to separate wire bundles that could, in rare circumstances, cause a short circuit and possibly lead to a catastrophic failure. Boeing is evaluating the issue and publicly says it will turn its analysis over to the F.A.A. and allow the regulator to make a decision. Privately, the company is making the case that the bundles do not need to be separated, according to two people familiar with the matter. Some F.A.A. officials and European regulators, however, made it clear to Boeing that it must have a persuasive argument for not separating the wires. “Regarding wire bundles, we continue to perform the appropriate analysis, including lab testing, fleet data assessment and third-party reviews,” Boeing said in a statement on Thursday. “It would be premature to speculate as to whether this analysis will lead to any design changes.” Boeing is also still working with Collins Aerospace, one of its major subcontractors, to fix lingering issues with updates to the computers that control MCAS, the software that contributed to both crashes. Changes to the software have introduced new complications, such as the issue with the indicator light. Another irregularity, related to the software that monitors the plane as it powers up, is also being worked through. When Boeing is convinced that all these issues are resolved, it will hand the updated software over to the F.A.A., which will issue what is known as a type inspection authorization memo. Once that is issued, the F.A.A. can conduct its certification flights. Pilots from the F.A.A. will take a 737 Max to the sky for a few flights over a couple of days in the Seattle area, where the plane is made. If the current timing holds, that could happen in late February or early March. The test plane will be outfitted with sensors and other monitoring equipment, and F.A.A. officials will be joined by a top Boeing test pilot. If all goes well, the F.A.A. will conclude that the Max flew as expected. But if it finds other issues, it could require additional work from Boeing. After the successful completion of the certification flights, Boeing will compile a final package of certification documents to submit to the F.A.A., which could take another couple of weeks. After the certification flights, international regulators will convene for several days to determine final training requirements for the Max. Last month, Boeing said it would recommend that pilots train in flight simulators before flying the Max. Regulators are likely to concur, though the specifics have yet to be determined. The regulators will then offer training to more than a dozen flight crews from airlines around the globe and test their responses to emergencies on the Max in a flight simulator. After those tests, the F.A.A. will produce a report recommending training, which will be open to public comments for 15 days. After the public comment period, the agency will release its final training requirements. Once the certification flights are done, the paperwork is complete and the training is set, the F.A.A. will issue an airworthiness directive instructing airlines how to install new software and fix other issues on the Max so that it can fly again. It will then release a separate document formally ending the grounding. Boeing will also send a bulletin, containing much of the same information, to the airlines that operate the 737 Max. With those steps complete, pilots could begin training. The F.A.A. is not the only aviation regulator that needs to clear the Max. Officials in Europe, Canada, Brazil and other countries will have to make their own decisions. And while there is a good chance that some international regulators may give the Max the all-clear at the same time as the F.A.A., some could take longer. When airlines are finally prepared to fly the Max, they will have to get their planes ready. That process — which involves checking all the plane’s systems, as well as its fluids, engines, tires and more — takes a week to 10 days per plane. Airlines are also likely to give the interiors a deep cleaning, and they will have to install the updated software, which should take only a few hours. Boeing will go through a similar process for the roughly 400 jets built during the grounding that are now in storage. The backlog of completed jets contributed to Boeing’s decision to temporarily shut the 737 factory last month. It will take well over a year to deliver all the already built planes to customers, and Boeing wanted to stop the backlog from growing. Moving the first planes out of storage and into the hands of customers will be a major milestone for Boeing, and it will signal that the return of the Max is imminent. Once the Max is approved, airlines face the task of persuading people to get on it. Boeing’s own research shows that as of December, 40 percent of travelers said they were unwilling to board a Max. And while Boeing has briefed airlines on its plans to help convince the flying public that the Max is safe to fly, many airline executives acknowledge that it could be a difficult sell, especially early on.",The New York Times
2020,Opinion | What Nevada Wants in a President,"This diverse state is home to immigrants, transients, ranchers and union members — and many of us are struggling. Contributing Opinion Writer. LAS VEGAS — No Democratic candidate for president can win the nomination without the overwhelming support of voters of color, and Nevada — with its nearly 30 percent Latino, 10 percent African-American, and about 9.5 percent Asian-American and Pacific Islander population — is the first contest to offer insight into which of the remaining all-white front-runners can earn it. As early caucus voting began in Las Vegas, appealing to nonwhite voters was a clear focus of the candidates. Senator Bernie Sanders marched to a polling place alongside a crowd of young Latinx voters. Pete Buttigieg answered town hall questions about immigration reform in Spanish. Senator Elizabeth Warren ordered boba tea and strolled the small businesses of Las Vegas’s Chinatown plaza. Tom Steyer hosted a Black History Month Concert featuring members of En Vogue and Boyz II Men. At Las Vegas’s First African Methodist Episcopal Church, former Vice President Joe Biden shared stories with congregants about his boyhood experiences visiting black churches. To understand what’s on Nevadans’ minds as they cast their votes, remember that the state is ground zero for some of the most pressing national crises of our moment, many of which disproportionately impact these minority communities. More than one in 10 Nevadans have no health insurance. The state is the worst in the availability of affordable housing for low-income residents. It has the fourth-highest level of income inequality. And Las Vegas, a concrete slab in the belly of the Mojave Desert, is the fastest-warming city in the United States. It should be no surprise, then, that a recent poll showed the two most progressive candidates had the highest favorability ratings among likely caucus-goers. Senator Warren’s focus on corruption has resonated with Nevada’s primarily working-class families, many of whom, just a decade ago, were destroyed by predatory lending. Although her best-case scenario is a second- or third-place finish here, Senator Sanders is well on his way to his largest victory yet of the presidential contest. His promises to reinstate DACA and abolish ICE are enticing to a state population of which 7 percent are undocumented. Hispanic voters and thriving activist organizations form the foundation of his support. Also driving support for Senator Sanders is the fact that, for working-class communities that are not covered by the protection of a union or citizenship, a life in Nevada is defined by economic struggle and poverty. Our Democratic legislators have not hesitated to use billions of dollars to build an N.F.L. stadium or to raise regressive sales taxes that hit the poor the hardest. For decades, leaders of both political parties have sacrificed comprehensive government services to protect the pocketbooks of the wealthy, refusing to raise desperately needed revenue by raising income or property taxes. Nevada is considered one of the best states for the wealthy, but for those who are struggling, Senator Sanders’s populist message hits close to home. Still, outside of diverse Clark County, registered Republicans outnumber Democrats in 15 out of 16 of Nevada’s mostly rural counties. In a general election, a “socialist” message will struggle here, even if it is a democratic one. And Nevada has always been guided by a spirit of political pragmatism. In this state of immigrants, transients, ranchers and union card-holding members, decades of organizing, bargaining and long, tireless work have shaped our collective identity to understand the realities of negotiation, that change doesn’t always happen overnight and often requires compromise. This could explain why for so long, Mr. Biden seemed like the state’s most likely choice. His strong relationship with unions, the state party and nonwhite voters aligned him with the state’s preferences, at least on paper. This is a swing state that has gone to the Democrats in every presidential election since 2008. And despite all of the far-left critiques of the “political establishment,” it was, in fact, Nevada’s that all but guaranteed, then hand-delivered, two sweeping blue waves in 2016 and 2018. The party knows how to pick winning candidates, and the last elections brought with them Nevada’s two sitting female Democratic senators, a Democratic governor, and a majority-Democratic, historic majority-female Nevada State Legislature. So Nevada’s diverse voters have historically trusted the party’s judgment. But Mr. Biden’s poor performances in the first two contests have taken a toll, and the late surges of other moderates are likely to siphon enough votes to keep Mr. Biden well below Senator Sanders. If the state party coalesces around Mr. Biden — which seems possible based on their major endorsements — there’s a small possibility it could keep his campaign above water. Some moderate Nevadans have already turned a listening ear to the unoffensive centrism of Senator Amy Klobuchar and the starkly youthful energy of Mr. Buttigieg, who may have opportunities here to outperform expectations. They appeal here for the same reasons they did in Iowa and New Hampshire. After all, Nevadans’ transience means that residents often bring their geographic sensibilities with them. The state remains Senator Sanders’s to win. But until the caucus ends on Saturday, the candidates will work to appeal to voters in a state that is in many ways unique, but more important, offers the most realistic reflection yet of the demographics of their party.

2020,What the Jury's Note Could Mean for a Verdict in the Weinstein Trial,"A tantalizing question sent to the trial judge left many people wondering if the jurors were nearing a conviction. The jury that will determine Harvey Weinstein’s fate begins a second week of deliberations on Monday after indicating last week that it may have been deadlocked on the two most serious charges in the indictment, but possibly in agreement on the lesser counts. The jurors in the Harvey Weinstein trial sent out a tantalizing note during their lunch hour on Friday afternoon, just before they were scheduled to break for the weekend. The note, posed as a question to the presiding judge, Justice James M. Burke, suggested that they might have reached a verdict on some of the lower charges in the case — rape and forced oral sex — but were unable to decide on the more serious charges of predatory sexual assault. The note sent the courtroom, filled with dozens of reporters from around the world, into a frenzy. Outside of the courtroom, in legal circles and on social media, it sparked spirited speculation about what the verdict might be. Mr. Weinstein’s trial is the most closely watched in recent history and the second most high profile sexual assault case in the aftermath of #MeToo. Here is some background about the charges Mr. Weinstein is facing and what the jury’s note may mean. While partial verdicts are never a desirable result, especially in high-profile matters like the Weinstein trial, they are not uncommon. Typically, judges accept partial verdicts only after they strongly urge the jury to reach a consensus and determine that the panel is hopelessly deadlocked on some of the charges. If a judge takes a partial verdict, then prosecutors can retry the defendant on the remaining charges with a different jury. After receiving the note, Justice Burke gave the jury a standard order to continue its deliberations. With court scheduled to end early on Friday — at 3 p.m., not 4:30 p.m. as usual — the jurors went home for the weekend and will continue their deliberations on Monday morning. Two of those charges — first-degree rape and third-degree rape — are based on the account of Jessica Mann, a onetime aspiring actress who testified that Mr. Weinstein sexually assaulted her at a hotel in Midtown Manhattan in March 2013. A third charge — criminal sexual act — is based on the account of Miriam Haley, a former production assistant for the reality television show “Project Runway,” who testified that Mr. Weinstein forced oral sex on her at his apartment in Manhattan’s TriBeCa neighborhood in July 2006. But Mr. Weinstein also faces two counts of predatory sexual assault, the most severe charges in the indictment. Those charges are particularly complex, requiring prosecutors to prove that Mr. Weinstein attacked at least two different victims. To prove the predatory sexual assault charges, prosecutors introduced the testimony of a third accuser, Annabella Sciorra, an actress from “The Sopranos,” who claimed that Mr. Weinstein raped her at her Gramercy Park apartment in the winter months of 1993 or 1994. One of the predatory sexual assault charges is based on the combined accounts of Ms. Mann and Ms. Sciorra; the other is based on the combined accounts of Ms. Haley and Ms. Sciorra. That means that a conviction on either of those charges depends on proving one of the lower charges, plus Ms. Sciorra’s rape allegation. Not necessarily, but it does suggest that they may have reached a guilty verdict on at least one of the lower charges involving Ms. Mann or Ms. Haley. If the jurors are following the complicated charging sheet correctly, their note indicates that they are at least mulling a guilty verdict on one or more of the charges of rape and criminal sex act. Technically speaking, the jurors could not be deadlocked on the higher charge of predatory sexual assault without having first decided that Mr. Weinstein was guilty of a lower charge, legal experts said. Said a different way, if the jurors had decided to acquit Mr. Weinstein on the charges involving Ms. Mann and Ms. Haley, they would not need to continue deliberating on the charges involving Ms. Sciorra. Though Ms. Sciorra’s rape allegation is too old to be charged as a separate crime under state law, it can be used to prove the sexual predator charge. If, however, the jurors are confused about the structure of the charges, they could be headed in the completely opposite direction. It is possible that the jurors have reached a unanimous decision to acquit Mr. Weinstein on the lower charges involving Ms. Mann and Ms. Haley, but that some of them are still hoping to convict him on the more serious charges involving Ms. Sciorra. But that is not a viable option. Under this scenario, the note could be read as an appeal by the jurors who understand the charges to have Justice Burke step in and explain the law to those jurors who do not. There is some support for this second theory. The jury’s first note, which was sent out on the initial day of deliberations, essentially asked if it was possible to convict Mr. Weinstein only of the charges involving Ms. Sciorra. The most recent note could suggest that some of the jurors are still attempting, wrongly, to pursue that as an option. Mr. Weinstein can be convicted on all or some of the charges that accuse him of raping Ms. Mann and forcing oral sex on Ms. Haley, even if the jurors do not believe that he raped Ms. Sciorra. But the opposite is not true. To convict Mr. Weinstein of predatory sexual assault, the jury has to find that he committed a serious crime against either Ms. Mann or Ms. Haley — or both — and that he committed a crime against Ms. Sciorra. Mr. Weinstein’s lawyers quickly indicated in court on Friday that they were willing to accept a partial verdict and take the jury’s decision on only the lower charges, not the higher ones, which remained undecided. The move suggested that the lawyers may have been looking to reduce Mr. Weinstein’s possible sentence. The two top charges of predatory sexual assault carry the stiffest penalty: a minimum of 10 years and a maximum of life in prison. The lower charges carry penalties that range from a conditional discharge (the equivalent of unsupervised probation) to 25 years in prison. So, Mr. Weinstein’s lawyers might have calculated that if the jury was deadlocked on the two most serious charges and was leaning toward convicting on one of the lesser charges, the best strategy would be to stop the trial and cut their losses. They did not comment on the proceedings.",The New York Times
2020,Climate Change in California: San Francisco Faces Rising Seas,"Wednesday: How the Bay Area is confronting climate change. Also: Bernie Sanders takes a wide lead in a new poll. Good morning. (If you don’t already get California Today by email, here’s the sign-up.) Recently, my colleagues Somini Sengupta and Chang W. Lee traveled to two very different cities, Manila and San Francisco, with one big thing in common: They’ve been forced to adapt to rising seas. They explored how in this expansive, beautiful and unsettling project. We asked Somini to write about how the piece came together. Here’s her dispatch: We’ve all read dire projections of how rising global temperatures are raising sea levels. I wanted to better understand what that means for people in coastal cities right now. Not in the distant future, but right now. I chose sprawling, fast-growing Metropolitan Manila and the San Francisco Bay Area. I grew up in California, though very far from the ocean, in the flat, inland suburb of Covina. Like many Californians, I thought living by the ocean would be dreamy, and until recently I had not really give much thought to the risks we have inherited by building right up to the water’s edge. Houses, highways, sewer mains: They’re now at risk. Saving them means building costly walls and barriers — or moving people and property out of harm’s way. Those are hard choices. [Sign up for The Times’s Climate Fwd: newsletter for all our coverage of climate change.] Reporting this story sharpened three lessons for me. First, the hazards of the present are shaped by decisions of the past. According to the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission, more than 20,000 households and 13 miles of highway are at risk of permanent inundation with two feet of sea level rise. Second, climate change has starkly unequal impacts. How you face the rising sea, I wrote, “depends mostly on the accident of birth,” whether your property is worth millions or is little more than a tin roof. Third, dealing with the impact of sea level rise means not just moving people away from hazardous parts of the coast, but reimagining these sprawling, car-congested metropolitan areas altogether. My photographer colleague, Chang W. Lee, and I planned our reporting days in the Bay Area to avoid the chockablock traffic on Highway 101. (We were not always successful.) In Manila, we rode tricycle cabs, hired a boat to get around a few times, and sat in traffic for hours. Commutes are typically two hours or more each way. Housing is scarce and expensive in both places. I heard experts press for a climate solution that on its face has nothing to do with sea level rise: Build more dense, affordable housing, they said, close to jobs, schools and public transportation. That’s politically difficult, including in the Bay Area. [Read more of Somini’s work here.] We often link to sites that limit access for nonsubscribers.

2020,What Role Have Coaches Played in Your Life?,"student opinion An immigrant from Brazil must prove he is an “extraordinary” coach to stay in the U.S. What do you think makes a great coach? Find all our Student Opinion questions here. Have you ever had a great coach, whether in or out of school? One who not only helped you to master a skill or a sport, but who also helped shape you as a person? In “An Immigrant From Brazil Has Changed Lives as a Coach. Is That Enough to Stay in the U.S.?,” Miriam Jordan writes: LOS ANGELES — For the past three years, Henrique “Hicu” Motta, a rowing coach, has created unlikely success stories in a sport long associated with the privileged. He has taken his team of high school girls from working-class families to the national championships and sent several of them to Division I colleges on athletic scholarships. “I’m Latina, little and had never been on a sports team,” said Isabella Soto, 17, the daughter of a nanny and a machinist who hopes to row at an elite college next fall. Isabella, who was accepted onto the RowLA team despite being only 5 feet 2 inches tall “on a good day,” is a first-generation American whose parents are undocumented Mexicans. Kassie Kim is the child of Korean immigrants, a cashier and a fire-alarm installer. Samadhi Dissanayake, a Sri Lankan-American raised by a single mother in subsidized housing, rides two buses to practice. “I hated sports before coming here,” said Samadhi, who is also considering rowing in college. “Now I love rowing and the sense of community.” But Mr. Motta, 39, a Brazilian who is in the country on a work visa, has been notified that his petition to remain in the United States has been denied. In order to stay, U.S. immigration authorities said, he must prove that he has “extraordinary ability” to do a job that might otherwise go to an American. In a sport dominated by athletes who are white and wealthy, RowLA under Mr. Motta’s leadership has long made a point of enlisting those who normally would not have access to rowing. Neither build nor athletic acumen determine who gets to compete and succeed. “He can take a girl, regardless of size and ability, and turn her into a serious rower. That’s rare among coaches,” said Liz Greenberger, a retired international security analyst who founded the team a decade ago and brought Mr. Motta in as their second coach in 2017. “It’s Hicu’s philosophy that is perfect for our program,” she said. Mr. Motta’s philosophy is simple: “I try to make something special out of any girl who wants to give rowing a shot,” he said. The question is, does that amount to extraordinary ability? In the three years since receiving a work visa, Mr. Motta has crafted a program of dedicated rowers who have competed in the U.S. Rowing Youth Nationals, the highest level for high school rowers, and won college scholarships. But Mr. Motta does not just coach. A nutritionist by training, he instructs his athletes to maintain a balanced diet. (No processed food before races. Stick to fruit for energy and coconut water for hydration.) Mr. Motta urges his rowers to spend time on their studies and think about futures that can be full of possibilities. “We don’t just focus on rowing performance; we’re developing student athletes,” said Mr. Motta, standing in Parking Lot 77 at Marina del Rey in West Los Angeles, where the team assembles six days a week to train, rain or shine. Students, read the entire article, then tell us: What role have coaches played in your life? (Keep in mind that “coach” can be defined broadly as “one who instructs or trains,” so you might consider anyone who has played that role for you, whether in school, through extracurricular activities, at a summer camp or anywhere else where you have learned a skill.) Have any of your coaches had a big effect on you? If so, tell us about your experiences together. Did your coach have any of the qualities of Mr. Motta described in the article? What do you think makes a good coach? Mr. Motta says, “We don’t just focus on rowing performance; we’re developing student athletes.” Do you agree with his philosophy? Should coaching focus on more than just performance? Why do you think Mr. Motta has such an impact on the girls he has worked with? Based on the article, do you think he has demonstrated “extraordinary abilities”? Why or why not? Would you want him to be your coach? According to the article, one reason the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services agency rejected Mr. Motta’s application for a green card was that he had not received a “major, internationally recognized prize or award” for his team. Should prizes and awards be an important measure of a coach’s abilities? Do you think the government should reverse its decision on whether to grant Mr. Motta permanent legal status? Why or why not? Would you ever consider becoming a coach? What do you imagine would be the rewards of such a job? Students 13 and older are invited to comment.

2020,Opinion | What South Dakota Doesn’t Get About Transgender Children,"Here’s how their medical care really works. Dr. Turban is a resident physician in child and adolescent psychiatry. Early in my medical training, I read a landmark case study about a 12-year-old boy who wrote a suicide note to his mother saying he would rather die than go through puberty. I later met teenagers who tightly bound their chests — knowing that it could result in fractured ribs — because the emotional pain of seeing their breasts was much worse than any imaginable physical pain. These children are transgender, and they account for almost 2 percent of youth in the United States. They are suffering from the psychological pain of having a body that doesn’t match their gender identity. I’ve dedicated my medical and research career to better understanding their mental health. Over the past few decades, physicians have learned how to help these young people. In the past, doctors tried to force them to be cisgender, to identify with the sex they were assigned at birth. New research shows that this approach is associated with their attempting suicide. Having learned from these mistakes, we now follow new protocols that guide us to accept and affirm transgender youths in their transgender identities. We often use medications that prevent some of the physical changes of puberty that cause these adolescents distress. Unfortunately, huge shifts in medical literature do not always make their way to politicians. While there is broad consensus among doctors that these affirmative medical protocols are important, legislators in several states are planning to make this medical care illegal. In South Dakota, the House recently passed a bill that would fine or even imprison pediatricians who provide gender-affirmative care to patients under 16. The bills are about medical care, but the state representatives sponsoring them seem unfazed by the fact that all relevant major medical organizations disagree with them. The American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry released a statement condemning the bills. The American Academy of Pediatrics and the Endocrine Society have both published clear protocols advocating gender-affirming care for youth, making them likely to follow suit. The public deserves accurate medical information about how doctors care for transgender youth, instead of alarmist commentary from pundits and politicians. One of the most important things to know is that doctors offer affirmation in different ways at different stages of development. For prepubescent children, the only intervention would be a “social transition.” This may involve allowing the child to take on the name, pronoun, style of dress and so on that matches their gender identity. Mostly, it means not placing limits on children around how they express their gender and not promoting shame around gender “atypical” behaviors. Two studies to date have shown that transgender children who are allowed to socially transition have mental health nearly indistinguishable from that of cisgender children. This is in stark contrast to children who weren’t allowed to socially transition, who had elevated rates of anxiety and depression. At puberty, a child may be offered what’s called a “puberty blocker.” This medication pauses puberty to buy adolescents more time to decide whether they want to later take estrogen or testosterone, medications to go through the puberty that matches their identity. Without puberty blockers, a child will go through physical changes like voice deepening or breast development that are difficult to reverse and often require surgery. Just last month, our research team from Harvard Medical School and the Fenway Institute published a study showing that access to puberty blockers during adolescence is associated with lower odds of transgender young adults considering suicide. Despite fearmongering, these are safe medications that doctors have been using for decades for cisgender children who go through puberty too early. They also are reversible — if the medication is stopped, puberty will progress. Deciding to start estrogen or testosterone treatment is a more serious decision. They cause cosmetic changes that are difficult to reverse, including body fat redistribution and voice changes. For this reason, medical guidelines recommend that they generally not be provided until age 16, or at the earliest, 14. Though the evidence is still emerging, all existing data suggests that access to estrogen or testosterone is associated with improved mental health for these kids. There has been growing attention to the idea that some youth who start estrogen or testosterone will later choose to stop it. That appears to be rare. Our group from Harvard Medical School recently published a case of an adolescent who started estrogen and chose to stop. That young person told us they did not regret the trial of estrogen and that it helped them to better understand their gender identity, even though they now have some cosmetic changes to their body (mostly body fat and hair redistribution). In other cases, kids “de-transition” because their communities place so much pressure on them to be cisgender that they feel they have no choice. While conservatives highlight that youth may later regret the physical changes from estrogen or testosterone, the doctors who take care of these patients know it is far more likely that a young transgender person will have regrets when physicians refuse to provide the medical care to pause the puberty that is actively distressing them. The potential benefits of providing gender-affirmative care typically outweigh the minor risks associated with treatment. These medications are administered only after thoughtful conversations between patient, family and physician. Medical interventions are not started without all three being on board and understanding the risks and benefits. Legislation that puts these decisions in the hands of the government instead of families and physicians is dangerous. Conservatives also like to use phrases like “sex change surgery” to scare the general public. Under current medical guidelines, genital surgeries for transgender patients are never offered before adulthood. The only surgeries that are sometimes considered before the patient is an adult is the removal of breast tissue. It is something that requires careful evaluation before proceeding. Furthermore, youth who need this surgery are generally those who were not able to obtain puberty blockers, subsequently developed significant breast tissue, then had strong negative emotional reactions to their chest. Easier access to puberty blockers in the first place could eliminate the need for this kind of surgery. State legislators need to educate themselves about these young people and their medical care before introducing legislation that will hurt them. They need to reach out to physicians and professional medical societies for input. They need to talk to the researchers in this area, and most important, they need to bring in the transgender youth themselves. If their bodies are going to be legislated, they should have the opportunity to be heard by the legislators who would do this to them. The medical profession has made it clear: This kind of legislation is dangerous and should not become law.

2020,"What Students Are Saying About Experiencing Racism, Becoming an Adult and Bonding Over Food","current events conversation Teenage comments in response to our recent writing prompts, and an invitation to join the ongoing conversation. After a couple weeks devoted to rounding up comments on a single topic that resonated with students, we’re returning to our usual format of spotlighting three of the week’s most popular writing prompts. This week, we asked students to tell us about their racial identities, when they think someone becomes an adult, and their memories of shared meals. You’ll notice that this week’s roundup is longer than most. That’s because we got over 200 responses to a question about students’ experiences with racism and we wanted to include as many comments as possible. We’d like to give a special shout-out to two classmates, Grace Robertson and Jacob Jarrett of Hoggard High School, whose discussion of the merit of Black History Month particularly moved us. While we read many excellent comments on this prompt, we were struck by these students’ candor and open-mindedness in discussing such a sensitive and important issue. These are exactly the types of conversations we love to see happening on our site. We’ve published part of their discussion (which continued offline) below, but you can read the whole thing here. Before we get to this week’s comments, we want to offer a warm welcome to new classes from Corbin, Ky.; Petaluma, Calif.; The Central Valley of California; and West Windsor, N.J. Please note: Student comments have been lightly edited for length, but otherwise appear exactly as they were originally submitted. _________ In “How Much Racism Do You Face Every Day?” Amy Harmon writes about the experiences of 101 black teenagers in Washington, D.C., who were surveyed about how much racism they experience on a daily basis. So we asked students about their own experiences with race and how they thought it compared to that of their peers. The responses were candid and heart-rending. We hope you’ll take the time to read them in full and see what you can learn from their experiences. The first time I remember being aware of my race was the 1rst grade. I was on the bus and one of my friends was arguing with another boy. It was about something that happened at lunch. I should’ve just let my friend handle it, but me being the nosy kid I was, I just HAD to intervene. I asked them to quit arguing and the little boy turned around and said, “What do you know? You’re just a dumb black girl!” Looking back at it, that wasn’t the worst thing he could’ve said. But I’d never had anyone say something like that to me, so I was a bit out of it. I spent the rest of the afternoon looking at the skin on my arms. I remember just wondering who I was. Just wondering who my skin made me. I think that particular experience made me perfectly aware of my race. I have grown since then. Being a young black woman used to make me embarrassed. Now, it empowers me. — Bree Thomas, Julia R. Masterman, PA From the moment I looked around my school cafeteria seeing rows of caucasian children lining each of the tables, I knew I was different. From the moment I overheard my mom talking to my dad about reluctancy to move our family to the Deep South, I knew I wasn’t normal. But It wasn’t until the moment I first had someone point at me and laugh, their fingers stuck to the corners of their eyes pulling them outward till you could see nothing more than a slit, that I knew what racism was. I walk into my math class where all of my friends are talking about our latest test scores. They ask me what my grade is; I reluctantly tell them. They cheer, laugh, and the phrase “I beat the asian!” is tossed around in the air as if it’s nothing more than a beach ball at a concert. I stand there with an uncomfortable smile on my face. A small half-laugh manages to escape my mouth. It’s no big deal. I’m fine. I walk into my history class and sit at my seat. We take our notes on 16th Century Chinese Dynasties. The name of an emperor comes up on the powerpoint. I tilt my head toward my paper to write it down, but it is jolted upward by the sound of one of my friend’s voices. “Ching Chong Ling Long” escapes his mouth. He turns to me with a beaming smile looking for the credit his magnificent joke deserves. The same distressed smile is plastered on my face. That same nervous laughter makes its way into the air. I tell myself that I don’t care, but deep down, I know the truth. — Uma Volety, Hoggard High School in Wilmington, NC My name is Amina Malik and I am a Pakistani American. My parents have never been hesitant about sharing anything about their birth country. As a child to this day I have always loved participating in religious and cultural events that my family and I participate in. I’ve always loved my identity, but there was a time when I tried to hide who I was from others. I’ve always worn cultural clothing to school and one day in middle school I remember people making fun of my attire. I was devastated and I stopped wearing Pakistani clothing to school. This is when I became more observant of the world around me and the fact that every single person is different … In high school, I started wearing my cultural clothing to school again. In fact I am wearing a colorful and huge Pakistani scarf right now. A notice that as my days get older more and more people are becoming comfortable sharing their identity with the world. Just like I am openly able to share about mine with a smile. We all are in the same journey, so it only makes sense to help each other, to love each other, to learn together. — Amina Malik, Glenbard West High school Growing up, I didn’t realize when some people were being racist. I think by playing it off as a joke, I refused to believe that it was happening. I’ve gone through school with people making “Ching Chong” comments and stereotyping me into the basic Asian characteristics of “bad at sports, good at math.” I think I’ve faced more racism than I like to think, through those “jokes” and offhand statements or thoughts. — Francine Wei, Hoggard High School in Wilmington, NC Being an Indian Muslim in America, I can say that I have experienced racism and microaggressions quite a few times … I remember the first instance where I really understood racism: I was in elementary school, asking my friend if I could go to her house, when she said “No, sorry, my dad doesn’t like Indians.” I brushed it off at the time, but thinking back, that was a really painful statement and it just made me feel “less.” Throughout the years, I have heard multiple “jokes” about all Muslims — or even just brown people in general—being terrorists. I do not find these funny at all, and think these kind of jokes just feed into the negative stereotypes of Muslim people. — Ridah Shaikh, Glenbard West, Glen Ellyn, IL Being a white male I personally do not face racism and my intent isn’t to pander to progressive audiences I genuinely think racism exists at a moderate level in current society. My good friend for instance is an Arab Muslim. He faces racially discriminatory jokes constantly and he feels required to laugh them off when it is actually harmful to how he feels as a person. Constantly being compared to a terrorist and a supporter of terrorism can make somebody feel bad about themselves for something they have no control over. — Henry Leonard, Hoggard High School in Wilmington, NC I am a person of color but I’ve never really known what my race is. On official documents, I usually put white but that isn’t accurate. If I was white, people wouldn’t be making terrorist jokes. If I was white, people wouldn’t try to guess where I’m from. “Are you Mexican, Indian, Native American.” Most of the white people I interact with definitely don’t think about their whiteness and if they do, it’s for validation. — Malak, King of Prussia Racism is everywhere, and it’s unavoidable. I haven’t been told to pick cotton in about two years. I haven’t heard anyone joking about lynching or take an “anti-racemixing” stance in a few months. No one’s called me a n****r in a few weeks. People tell me racism is dead. They believe I’m being over sensitive when I get offended. They tell me to calm down when I hear racist things in real life or online. They are convinced that racist jokes aren’t racist. They feel that “if anyone can say it, then everyone can say it” … Can you look me in the eyes and tell me it’s not racist to undercut my victories on the basis of my race, to remind me again and again of my “criminal status,” or to repeat the slurs of our past in joyous refrain … as a “joke”? Can you tell me it’s not racist to say “black women are annoying,” to pick up a “blaccent” at random times while talking to me, or to call me “the whitest black guy in existence” on the grounds that I wear a belt and get good grades? Can you really believe it’s acceptable to criticize me for caring too much about black issues, to declare yourself above racism due to me being your acquaintance, or to complain about having to learn about black history for the shortest month out of every year? Racism is everywhere, and it’s unavoidable. I don’t have major run-ins with racists often, but it’s the small things- the microaggressions from your peers, your teachers, and your friends- that hurt the most. — Jacob Jarrett, Hoggard High School in Wilmington, NC At school and with friends, I receive lots of indirect racism. Friends and classmates often make extremely rude and ignorant comments. I’ve endured a lot of it, from seeing people pull their eyes out to resemble what they think are ‘Chinese eyes’, to hearing someone say, “Chinese people all have to be so dumb to eat crazy stuff like that, they’re disgusting,” when I showed them a dish from home. Many seem to think racism is only when someone uses a racial slur but fail to realize that gaining a few laughs from saying something like, “I must be super smart, I beat the Korean on my math test!” is just as racist. There has always been a stigma with Chinese people in Vietnam, and I think the culture here has normalized and taught Asians to be tolerant of this behavior. — Justine, Saigon South Int. School, HCMC, Vietnam I’ve been called a fake Latina multiple times. By my own parents, because I refuse to dance and don’t like Mexican food, by my Latina friends because I’m Puerto Rican and Puerto Ricans are “wack” and even by a few of my white friends who called me that when I was the only person not to take a bite out of a jalapeno pepper. I hate spicy things, which is another reason why I’m a fake Latina. In fact I don’t even like Mexican food, whether its actual homemade Mexican made by my friends mom’s or Taco Bell. I wouldn’t say it’s something that hurts me, I know my parents and friends just call me that as a joke, and I’ve never put so much importance on my ethnicity to be bothered when people speak about it in a bad manner. — Natalia Rivera, Hoggard High School in Wilmington NC As a Muslim woman who also happens to be an immigrant, I can confidently say that there has not been a single day of my high school career where I have not felt the limitations of my identity. Attending a school that prides itself in challenging its students and being diverse in nature, I will be the first to attest that my school does, in fact, offer many clubs in which students of various backgrounds can feel welcome. However, within the predominantly white student body, it is easy to feel like an outcast. The hardest part about being non-white at school is constantly wanting to assimilate and forget about my differences that separate me; but, these same differences are what make me who I am and it upsets me that I feel ashamed about it because of societal pressures. — Arfa Hassan, Glenbard West HS Glen Ellyn To preface, I don’t think that most of the people I know are racist. However, occasionally, someone will say something that really irritates me. I know people that will mention the fact that I am black almost every time I see them. They will say things and compare me to things that just don’t make sense. I thought that it didn’t bother me but now I just don’t know how I feel. I simultaneously care and don’t care at the same time. — Akye Nixon-McCray, Hoggard High School in Wilmington, NC I’m different. I know it. They know it. Brown eyes. Brown skin. Thick dark brown hair. Human … but apparently not in some people’s eyes. People look at me, and all they see is another stereotypical Asian girl. Apparently there’s nothing more to me than my grades and math and school. Apparently all I do is study. I sit down in class like any other kid, but I’m just bombarded with questions on how to do the math. Apparently I know it all. I don’t. I’m learning too. It’s hard to find good friends that aren’t just using me for free answers, and it shouldn’t be that way. People shouldn’t see me and start imagining some Indian accent that they rudely imitate. I don’t have one. I can’t escape it. It’s everyone and everywhere. — Shivani Patel, Hoggard High School in Wilmington, NC My parents have always discussed race with us, even when we were little. I think this is because they wanted me to feel comfortable as a mixed race person. Still, it still hurts when people assume I can’t be both Asian and Caucasian. For example, one of the questions at the end of this very article asked, “If you do not identify as a person of color, do you ever think about your whiteness?” Questions like these make me uncomfortable because, even though I do identify as a person of color, I am still “white.” People expect me to “pick a side”, but they don’t understand that I would be denying a part of myself. Interracial marriage has been legal in all U.S. states since 1967, yet I still must check a single box for race on standardized tests. They have boxes for most races, and a box that says “other.” I’m not other, I’m both. — Calliope Beatty, J.R. Masterman As a person of color, my race has definitely been brought up in conversations daily outside of school. My racial identity is questioned because of my mixed race. This has often led to me feeling like I am left out as I do not identify with one group. On a daily basis, I feel like I am different. When documents hold my race, they always say that I am caucasian which makes me feel like I’m not represented or cared about. When I’m out with my family, I am always asked if I am with them. — Marlina Casady, Florida I have experienced a lot of racism. It is also very hard for me because I am light skin and have black and white in me. I sort of feel like I don’t belong anywhere. I can’t fully be white and I can’t fully be black. I have gotten questions like “why is your hair like that?” and I honestly had no answer. When I went to an all-white school I got bullied so much that I wanted to be white but now I am proud of my natural hair and proud to say I am African American. — Diana Bedden, Upper Merion High School @Diana Bedden I’m glad you finally realized that you should love where you come from, even if others are putting you down. I can definitely relate to what you’re saying about not belonging. I’m Mexican American but have very pale skin and I frequently travel to Mexico. When I do, I feel like I’m too “American” for the Mexicans and when I’m here I feel like I’m too “Mexican” for the Americans. I hope you can somewhat relate to what I’m saying because I understand how you feel. — Carla Luna, Glenbard West HS Glen Ellyn, IL I have not faced racism once in my life. However, I feel for those who have experienced it, such as the students that participated in the survey. I believe that the numbers that were produced from the survey describe our society today: racist. I see it everywhere I go, and sometimes even I am the culprit of it. I sit with only white people at lunch, I hang out with only white people outside of school, and I play sports dominated by white people. I know that this is bad, and there is really no justification for it. This article has inspired me to become a much more open person, and to try to include people of different backgrounds into my daily life, because not only will I gain more friends, I could also gain people that I never would have thought possible. — Carter Osborn, Hoggard High School in Wilmington, NC First off, I am white, yet I live in a town that is majority Asian. One might think that I, due to my skin color, have not experienced racism, yet I have. I have had a multitude of my achievements attributed not to my determination to succeed or my personal skill, but rather to my skin color. For example, I was named captain of my middle school tennis team in 8th grade; I had at least 3 people tell me that my position as captain was solely based on me being white, not due to my hard work and skill. I have been told that my success in school is because I am white and my teachers are white … One time, my English was talking about race, and before I even spoke, I was told by an Asian female peer of mine that I suffer from an “unconscious racial bias.” These events may seem rather trivial, but they are not. — Robert, West Windsor, NJ Everybody says to me since you are a white male you will never experience racism or discrimination. Now so far I have not but that does mean it is impossible for me to experience discrimination. I am also Jewish which I have learned comes with its own difficulties and problems too. I feel almost every day I hear in the news there was another attack on Israel or some murder was related to antisemitism. My parents have told me not to tell random people I am volunteering with that I am Jewish because we don’t know who they are or what dangers could come from telling a random person. I hope that one day in the near future that there won’t be racism, antisemitism, or discrimination because we are all human! — Ryan Altschuler, J.R Masterman School I feel like making a big deal out of Black History Month is a step in the wrong direction. Before you immediately get mad at me, point your finger, and call me an ignorant, bigoted, conservative white girl— (do you catch the irony?)— just consider how much more intense the rage is about race-differences with things we’ve made up like Black History Month. We have differences that should be acknowledged and sometimes even cherished, but we’re calling things racism/hate speech that really are not racism/hate speech. We’re saying that something no one living today participated in is still an injustice that must be corrected, and that we need to pay reparations to those people who were not alive for these injustices. The past, ugly as it is, is in the past and must be remembered, but we’re achieving nothing by living in those times. In fact, I would say we’re regressing. — Grace Robertson, Hoggard High School Wilmington, NC @Grace Robertson Black History month was founded in 1926 by the late historian Carter G. Woodson. Originally dubbed Negro History Week, it was established under the pretense- the knowledge- that White Americans were not doing their job. It was established with the understanding that for 51 months of the year, students learn about white history. The education system was established such that students are made to believe black people have not accomplished anything of merit (save the few greats that are mentioned), students learn nothing of Africa (save the fact that slaves were taken from there), and black students are thus indoctrinated into accepting their subservient status. — Jacob Jarrett, Hoggard High School in Wilmington, NC Your argument that Black History month is regressive is, quite frankly, offensive. The only harm that comes from Black History month is racist white people having to acknowledge how unsubstantiated their beliefs are or “well-meaning” white folk feeling a bit of white guilt. It’s offensive that you would place your own white guilt over the fates and education of African-American boys and girls around the country, and offensive that you could compare this feeling of guilt to the racism involved in Jim Crow or Slavery. I shouldn’t have to tell you this, but you acknowledging the past and the struggles and lasting effects caused by it is nowhere near as painful as the trauma you wish to ignore. You are not the one suffering the most from racism in the United States right now, and your implication that you feel you are is disappointing. Your argument that the only thing that you can take away from Black History month is the crimes of your past is very offensive. It implies that black history is nothing more than a compilation of suffering. That black history is nothing but suffering. It is ignoring all the beauty of black history. With the struggle comes triumph. With oppression comes advancement. With suffering comes music and art and culture. — Jacob Jarrett, Hoggard High School in Wilmington, NC After having a long, respectful, beneficial discussion with my friend Jacob, I’ve changed my mind some. He is a big proponent for Black History Month and black empowerment, and he was actually willing to have a discussion with me in person about it. I must confess that my mind is not completely turned around, but he shows me a perspective I don’t usually see. As he describes Black History Month, it’s a time to educate people (black children especially) about a rich cultural past that isn’t covered very well in schools. Black History Month, as it’s meant to be, would eventually expand into our normal history lessons and way of life, teaching important facts and lessons and empowering people with stories we may not have otherwise heard. In a perfect world, we wouldn’t need Black History Month because we would already be learning these things, but until we get there, the little bit we get during Black History Month will have to matter. — Grace Robertson, Hoggard High School Wilmington, NC At the end of the day, it’s important that everyone knows they matter, and that they have to make the choice each day of their life to work for the betterment of both themselves and society as a whole. Sometimes that means not putting yourself first, sometimes that means being willing to consider different ideas and points of views. Thank you, Jacob, for being willing to debate with me, listen to me, and then civilly disagree about how to improve our world and expand our vision. — Grace Robertson, Hoggard High School Wilmington, NC _________ “America has been inconsistent at best when it comes to deciding what 18- to 21-year-olds are too young, or just old enough, to do,” Maria Cramer writes in “When Are You Really an Adult?” We asked students when they think someone is truly grown up. Many argued that adulthood can’t be defined by a certain age, while others said that age-limit laws exist for a reason. Here are what they consider the true markers of adulthood: Being an adult is a level of maturity that some legal “adults” lack. People seem to think that adults are always right, but the truth is age is just a number. They are bluffing their way through questions the same as you and me, they still struggle to open jars, and stub their toes on door frames. Adults are not perfect however, real adults must have the ability to handle their responsibilities as well as care for their family. They must be able to take care of themselves and take on the duties that come with adulthood, such as taxes, mortgages, cooking, cleaning, and even grocery shopping. Adulthood is remembering things on your own without your mom’s reminders, and it can get hard, but nobody ever said it was going to be easy. Nobody ever said you would mentally become an adult at 18 years old, you have to work for it. — Charlotte Todd, Hoggard High School I think that being an adult is when do and show adult actions like being responsible, advocating for yourself, and etc. Though there are some adults that still act like children and there are some children that act like adults. — Diana Bedden, Upper Merion High School I believe there is no age for being an adult, I think it’s more based on maturity. Maturity is the true meaning of being an adult and reasoning. If a person isn’t mature no one would believe in or take seriously a person who isn’t liable and or mature to make the important and impactive decisions. — Sofie Longoria, Quest Forward Academy The big one-eight! On nearly every Instagram post or story for someone’s eighteenth birthday, a friend will make the statement, “You’re an adult now!” However, is this really true? Does turning a magic number mark the difference between childhood and adulthood, a sort of stepping stone into a different life? I would argue that rather than 18 being the defining mark of adulthood, I believe one becomes a “grown up” when they do “grown up” things, the biggest of which is living independently. Even though, as a teenager, it seems like you have a lot of independence, there is an unmatched feeling of knowing not only do you have to get your own food, stay alone, and also do taxes (spooky!), but also the idea that if something happens, you can’t simply run back to your mom or dad or older sibling, but must make smart decisions alone. Almost like a push into the deep end, living independently from your family and old friends forces a person to mature faster than they ever have in the past. This, rather than the magic 18, is the true mark of adulthood. — Lauren, Glenbard West High School I don’t consider myself an adult now because I don’t pay bills. I feel like you reach adulthood when you are financially supporting yourself. I know some people my age that pay their car note, insurance, phone bill and buy all their food. I would consider them an adult because they have reached the level of responsibility that is required to be one. — Cassidy Land, Bryant High School in Bryant Arkansas When you get the right to vote, you should be able to contribute to society, otherwise how would the new laws and government officials even affect you? Adulthood is a passage into the real world, so there should be real changes in how someone chooses to live, instead of just someone living off their parents money all of their life. — Melissa Dudley, Glenbard West, Glen Ellyn, IL The difference between setting ages to be legally allowed to smoke and drink vs vote is the associated risk of each activity. Voting isn’t exactly risky, but smoking and drinking can ruin your life quickly if bad habits are developed. Sure you become an adult at 18, but does that mean we want 18 year olds being legally allowed to permanently destroy their life with addiction. — Molly M, Glenbard West High School Smoking, drinking, and owning a firearm should be at twenty-one. This keeps people from harming themselves or those around them as much. Getting married and enlisting in the military should be kept at eighteen. If you can go to university, you should be able to enlist in the military and make the choice if you want to get married or not. For voting, however, I think the requirements should be lowered to sixteen or seventeen, this is because, who is in office affects the young people the most. — Alex, Corbin KY I do think that a lot of responsibilities should be given at the same age as the drinking age, the right to vote, or the right to bear arms. I do not care whether the age is 18 or 21 but it should all happen at once … I think it is the job of our government to sort something like this out if it was up to the people it is likely that everyone will be at each other’s throats. — Evan, Atlanta The legal minimum age for activities considered “for adults” should be determined based on the brain development process. According to scientific research, the human brain doesn’t reach full maturity until age 25. Although people under the age of 25 should be allowed to do some of what is now considered 18 and older activities, the stage of development of the brain should be taken into consideration. If the brain isn’t fully developed, the government should be aware that the decisions of people under the age of 25 may not be as completely thought out as those of age 25 or older. Activities such as buying alcohol or cigarettes should be truly thought over because of the greater harm that it could do to an underdeveloped brain. The side effects of these things could be much more damaging when the brain isn’t developed. — Erin Key, Bryant High School Adulthood in my own definition is a sense of fulfillment within your life, a time where you learn to appreciate life as it is given to you and where you are able to look back on the memories of your life and are able to value the lessons you’ve learned. — Olivia Moore, Lubbock, TX Many people, like myself, are forced to grow up faster. I’m barely a teenager, but I’ve had to grow up a lot faster than many of my friends due to stress and problems in my life that only adults should have to deal with. I know that scientists say that the decision making part brain isn’t developed fully until age 25, but I think that by the time you’re 15 or so, you can make your own choices largely for yourself. — Seneca Halner, The Central Valley of California I do not feel as though I am an adult now. Sure, I might have “adult” responsibilities such as a job or driving, but these do not make me considered an adult. I don’t pay the bills, I do not vote, and I can’t go on a plane without being labeled “unaccompanied minor.” I think I will be an adult once I am of legal age to live on my own, make decisions for myself and make a living for myself. — Sophia Caparelli, Hoggard Highschool in Wilmington, NC I am seventeen years old, and although I am technically still a child, I do not feel like one. I associate with my college friends, some of which are twenty-one, and can relate and talk to them, without feeling younger than them … My teachers, parents, and any adult figure in general, talk to me, usually, as less than an equal. They have authority over many things in my life, and often when talking to them I get the vibe that they don’t treat my opinions with the same respect they would someone of their same age. And, while I concede that in many scenarios like that of a teacher to student, the teacher has authority over their students, it still doesn’t feel good when you are treated as a child, when you truly feel like an adult. — Kendall Hermanson, Glenbard West HS Glen Ellyn, IL I believe that becoming an adult is not a law or scientific fact, but a mindset that we all grow into as we mature … For example, my parents have been pushing me to start driving but every time I get on the road I just feel in my gut that it's not the right time for me; they say that I have to start acting like an adult. I am only going to put myself into situations I feel I can handle well. Of course I’m still pushing myself to grow and improve but forcing myself into a situation I’m not mature enough for will only do more harm. — Izzy Pizarro, Sarasota, FL When you have to start taking on the responsibilities of an adult, that’s when you start to become one. For instance at the age of sixteen I started paying rent to my mom to help out, and started taking on more adult responsibilities so perhaps that’s when I became an adult. — Katlyn Anderson, Glenbard west high school, Glen Ellyn IL _________ Senator Amy Klobuchar’s Taconite Tater Tot Hot Dish has taken center stage at her campaign gatherings as she tries to endear herself to voters. In our Picture Prompt, “Food Favors,” we asked students what they thought of this tactic and whether they’ve ever done something similar. They agreed that “food is the way to the heart” and shared meaningful stories about the recipes that are important to them. I think Ms. Klobuchar’s attempt to connect with her fellow Americans via food is a way to show connectedness and a sense of similarity between her voters and herself. Often times, there is a bit of disillusionment with these big names that are running for politics. In many instances, they are billionaires, hyper wealthy, able to pay for their own campaign and what not. That makes voters become disinterested and out of reach from those that will represent them in politics. By showcasing a family recipe, Ms. Klobuchar seems quite down to earth. She is able to not talk about politics for one moment and go beyond her position as a potential-Democratic nominee. The connection through food is something everyone experiences, and allows people to become vested in something that is shared through all, instead of through issues like taxes, foreign policy, etc. — William Hohe, Glenbard West High School, Glen Ellyn, Illinois Race, culture and geography all separates us as a human race, but the one thing we all have in common is our desire to make and consume food. Ms. Klobuchar’s tactic to unite the masses using this similar interest was definitely a good idea … On top of this food transcends politics and reaches into homes and kitchens all across America allowing her to bring the people closer together all through the means of her campaign, something that’s been proving to be a strategy. — Abdurrahman, Illinois, United States Food is the fastest way to find a similarity, experience a new culture, or just create a strong bond. Dinner parties have been around for ages so that peers can get together and talk about their lives, maybe to try and catch up with old friends. Although the food may not be the exact similarity between the two people, it is a catalyst for a conversation. — Molly Howard, Glenbard West HS Glen Ellyn, IL I can relate as every day, we have a family dinner where each person shares important and interesting things that happened during their day. I bond well with other people while I eat because eating is a mindless task. — Shiv, King of Prussia, PA For many people, food is very close to the heart. In sickness, warm chicken noodle soup can ease the restless mind and body. In sadness, a tub of ice cream can provide a comforting remedy. To spark a connection with someone we find interesting, we chat over dinner. To share news and social developments, we meet over coffee. To celebrate holidays, anniversaries, birthdays, and monumental occasions, we gather together for dinner. Families bond over the dining room table, discussing the little things that intertwine their lives. Memories are created with food, and certain meals can remind us of happy moments that have occurred in our lives. A banana split after finally scaling a rope to the top in gymnastics. An Arby’s Kids Meal after seeing the production that inspired me to change the path of my ballet career. Chai tea and backstage jitters. Apple juice and being far away from home for the first time. — Matalin Bloomfield, Hoggard High School in Wilmington, NC I believe that food plays an immense role in culture. Throughout the world, food varies greatly depending on location, religion, or even tradition. It also serves as a way for people to connect with one another. During reunions or celebrations, people come together to share a meal, or use certain kinds of food to help make the day even more special. Food can also be a way to show appreciation for another person, such as purchasing chocolates for your significant other on Valentine’s Day, or buying someone cupcakes for their birthday. — Kiera W., Glenbard West HS, Glen Ellyn, IL As you grow older you come to realize how much effort really goes into making something like a cake or dish. This past year my friend had hosted my birthday party, which was really just a get together with my small group of friends, and it was wonderful. However, out of everything he did for my birthday the one thing I didn’t expect from him was a cake. He’d made my birthday cake for my party and the moment he revealed to me that he’d made it I felt like the most important person in the world. A small gesture like that really means the world to a person — Ani, Glenbard West High School I have little experience with cooking, so it’s not likely for me to bring home-made food to a gathering. However, even though some people may say this doesn’t count as a food, I enjoy making coffee. Ever since my mom taught me how to make coffee, I became obsessed with doing it. I really like how you can personalize each drink slightly. — Thalia, J.R. Masterman I personally have many fond memories involving food. My family recently enjoyed Thanksgiving at a resort where there was a huge spread of dishes. At Christmas, my grandmother served an amazing king crab feast that I’ll never forget. And, most recently, I enjoyed chicken wings with friends at a Super Bowl party. In addition to enjoying meals with friends and family, I also appreciate the flavors and think about the work and care that went into putting a meal on the table or the history behind a favorite family recipe like my Grandmother’s banana cake and lemon squares. — William Hudson, Hoggard High School in Wilmington, NC Coming from a large Italian family, I understand the effect that food has upon bonds and connections between people. For every family gathering, from Easter to Christmas and the many birthdays in between, everyone is happy to come together and contribute a dish. We ultimately use every holiday or birthday as a supplement to the true purpose of our gathering. The talk is never about the day of the year it is, it’s about the food. Food is used as a sign of compassion and love. It doesn’t even matter whether or not the food is any good, which in most cases it’s delicious. The giving of food shows each other that you would put your time, money and effort into an hourly process, just to see it be enjoyed by the ones you love in mere minutes. — Matthew D., Glenbard West HS, Glen Ellyn, IL I am not much of a cook, but one thing I can do is make really good frosting for cupcakes. It is a secret recipe, so I am not sharing it here, but my friends and family all tell me it is really good. If I were a presidential candidate, I think people would think of my cupcakes as something really good that everyone will love. Then, everyone would love me. — Mia Melishchuk, J.R. Masterman, Philadelphia, PA Food is by far the fastest way to someone’s heart. When you consider the effort that someone has to put in to find the ingredients, follow their recipe correctly, and create a satisfying dish, it’s much more desired than other things you could give a person … I used to make bread for my friends because I enjoyed baking, and I often had surpluses. Compliments and gifts were generally effective on them, but when a fresh loaf of bread was presented, their eyes lit up like never before. Food brings people closer for sure. — Will Metcalf, Glenbard West HS Glen Ellyn, IL",The New York Times
2020,"What Students Are Saying About How Much They Use Their Phones, and Whether We Should Be Worried","current events conversation New research challenges assumptions about the negative effects of social media and smartphones on children. We asked teenagers whether their parents should worry about how much time they spend on their devices. Please note: This post is part of The Learning Network’s ongoing Current Events Conversation feature. We invite students to react to the news via our daily writing prompts and, each week, we publish a selection of their comments. We frequently ask students about their relationship with screens, but a question we posed this week seems to have struck a chord with the teenagers who comment on our writing prompts. Inspired by the article “Panicking About Your Kids’ Phones? New Research Says Don’t,” we asked students: Should the adults in your life be worried by how much you use your phone? We heard from over 300 teenagers who gave a flurry of nuanced, thoughtful and enlightening responses. In fact, their comments were so good that we decided to feature only this prompt in this week’s Current Events Conversation, instead of the usual three, so we can highlight as many responses as possible. Some students admitted to spending upward of eight hours a day online, with the majority averaging around two to four hours. Some said their devices were a reasonable escape from the pressures of teenage life, while others explained they were essential for school. And still others raised an insightful question: Why is their “phone addiction” perceived as more harmful than that of the adults in their lives? As you’ll see below, one thing was crystal clear in their reflections: These teenagers spend a lot of time thinking about their phone usage. And they have a critical lens not only on how much they use their phones, but also on how it affects their education, emotional life and relationships. Read on for a fuller scope of the comments, but before you do, we want to offer a warm welcome to new classes from Ames High School, Iowa; Carney; Florida; Fort Mill High School; Georgia; Hightstown High School, N.J.; Nelson County High School; New Berlin, Wis.; New York; and Pennsylvania. Please note: Student comments have been lightly edited for length, but otherwise appear exactly as they were originally submitted. I think that I spend a little too much time on my phone per day. And by a little, I mean a lot. I’m not sure my average but I know I could be going to bed a lot earlier and get my work done quicker if I just put it down. I do many things on my phone like text people, snapchat, play games, and so on. I think it does have a positive benefit on my well being because without it, I would not have friendships and relationships I have today. The negative effects it has on me is time usage and keeping me from doing work and going to bed on time. I am worried about being on my phone too much but I don’t think it interferes with me being social, especially in this day and age. — Ryan, GA My average screen time is probably about 12 hours a day. I worry a lot about how much time I spend on my phone. But the way I socialize is through my phone. I use social media to communicate, and I have to use my phone to make calls and text. But whenever I have to study, I pull out my phone and go on it for about an hour … When it is time to go to sleep, I go on my phone in the dark with dark mode on. My bed has my charger connected to it so I can easily stay up all night. I want to remove it but because I am so addicted to my phone, I do not. One time I fell asleep at 2 am because I was on my phone, and it made me extremely tired (this was on a school night). — Jessica Chen, J.R. Masterman, Philadelphia, PA Since I got an iPhone, I have spent more time on my phone because of social media apps. I caught myself on multiple occasions telling myself “only 15 more minutes and then I’ll start my homework,” but then I end up spending 30 minutes on my phone. When I have tried to use my phone less I end up watching tv, so I just go from one type of a screen to the next. — Allison Ciero, Glenbard West HS Glen Ellyn, IL I spend too much time on my phone. I sometimes think about how much I am on my phone and I’m disgusted with how much time I feel like I’m wasting. But the truth is, I do a lot more than scroll through social media or watch stupid videos on my phone. My phone is a portable library that carries all of my favorite books on it. And those stupid videos and posts sometimes completely change my day for the better. — Mason Evans, Hoggard High School Wilmington, NC On average, I spend about 6 hours a day on my phone. It is spent with me going on social media, playing games, or watching Netflix. Every weekend, a notification pops up showing me how much time I have spent and each week it has gone up. I am starting to become a lot more cautious about how much time I spend on my phone because it is starting to worry me. My phone has become something that I always have to have and it never leaves my side. It has gotten in the way of me studying and spending time with my family which has started to worry me. I believe that parents should know how much time their kid is using their phone but I don’t think that they should act upon it. — Mark, Hightstown I understand a little micromanaging when it comes to technology time. However, by the time we reach high school, we should all be responsible for ourselves in that realm, to turn in homework, to know our time limits. It is time for the parents to release their grasp unless it is absolutely necessary. It is our job as teenagers to learn what happens when we stay on our phones too long and we don’t get enough sleep or don’t finish a homework assignment, we won’t understand the consequences if we don’t learn for ourselves. — Josh Reifel, Glenbard West, Glen Ellyn, IL While I stand by this statement, I would also like to point out that our parents didn’t grow up with this stuff, and they may not know how to handle our usage in the best way. Often times I find my parents using the phone — that they bought for us — as punishment. They threaten to take it away or to throw it out, this only makes out subconscious want it more. Moreover, they make us feel guilty for being born in a world where we do have access to these devices — as if we could help it. They say “when I was a kid we didn’t have to talk to our friends all the time, we would wait to see them the next day at school.” They try us guilt you into not using which once again, will only make us want it more to spite them. — kenna royce, Glenbard West HS Glen Ellyn, Il While some parents see it beneficial to limit teens usage on phones, others don’t take any action. For example, my parents have always trusted me to be responsible in my time management, and balancing school, Church, and friends. However, I do understand that my parents pay for my phone, and data usage, and I would willingly comply if they had any restrictions or rules. Phones, however, often rely as a crutch for parents, meaning they often incorrectly blame their child’s issue, or challenges for how much time they spend on their phone. — Anna Atwood, Bryant High School Arkansas In observing my friends and classmates, I think that most of us have a handle on what an appropriate amount of screen time is. Social media can be a breeding ground for bullying, which can then lead to depression and anxiety, but I’m not entirely sure that would correlate with simply spending more time on devices. Hopefully, if parents instill the value of limitations while kids are young, they will be able to control themselves appropriately in the future. — Sarah Song, Ames High School I feel like I’m extremely in touch with my personal media usage, but it isn’t easy. Apps are designed to keep you on them as long as possible, and sometimes it’s horribly hard to put down a phone after seeing a Snapchat from your friend pop up. After checking just now, I spent an average of 1 hour 58 minutes on my phone last month. Just shy of 2 hours, which is the recommendation maximum time adolescents should spend on non-education related screens. Many of my peers use them 6+ hours daily. I notice an exact correlation between the amount of time I’m on my phone and how productive I am that given day. If I get out of bed and don’t immediately pick up my phone, I feel like I can get ready faster, and feel more energized and motivated. Sometimes, if I have a lot of homework one night, I plug my phone in in a separate room, so I won’t think about it. It’s just so easy to forget about the essay you need to write if you unlock your phone and start messing around. They’re excellent distractions. I couldn’t agree more with the statement that “phones increase anxiety, depression and sleep deprivation among teenagers.” I’ve seen it happen in myself and my peers. In the 3 years I’ve had a phone, there have been too many nights I regret sacrificing sleep for texting to a friend online or getting lost on YouTube. It’s becoming more important to be aware of how our phones affect our lives as they take over more and more aspects of our days. — Mollie Brinker, Hoggard High School in Wilmington, NC I think that in some ways it could be good for adults to monitor how much children are on their phones today. However, who is going to monitor the adults? What I have noticed while growing up in this world of technology, is that so many adults around me are on their phone just as often as the children. I think it can be difficult to stay away from our phones when everyone around you is on their phones. I think we have to accept technology’s role and try to be as responsible with it as we can. — Kaylee Phillips, Glenbard West HS, Glen Ellyn, IL Some evenings at my house consists of our family in the same room, each of us on our same devices. Adults should worry about cell phone usage, in both their life and their children’s lives. A part of the issue is that parents can use their devices just as much as the kids. Adults must realize that they too must change. If they take their kid’s phone away, they should put theirs away too. They should push their child to have real-life experiences, where words can’t be misinterpreted. — Evan Lippolis, Ames High School I feel like phones have a negative effect on the mental stability of most teenagers today. There are so many things we worry about now … “How many snaps have I got this hour?”, “Has he seen my story yet?”, “I wonder if he’s just ignoring me?” Our phones present us with an ultimatum, Go out and be social, or stay in and get on facetime. It’s not the same, there are certain endorphins your mind releases when you are physically in contact with another person. Human interaction is healthy. My phone brings me mixed emotions, and I kind of rely on my phone for almost everything. Before I had a phone my life was so easy and I was a social butterfly, now I’m a 17 year old girl who comes home from work and watches a movie on my phone until my eyes physically will not open. — Brooklyn Harcrow, Lubbock, TX I usually spend about 3 hours a week on my phone. I grew up in Haiti, so most of the time I am in contact with my friends back home. When we lived in Haiti, FaceTime was a way that I could not only talk to my sister, who was at Iowa State, but we could also see her. My phone has had negative impacts on my health. I have had chronic migraines that have been affected by my posture, which is aggravated by being hunched over my phone all day. I also find myself in more pain after even a short time on my phone. Social media has also left me feeling left out and more discouraged about my own life. As someone who is in a new atmosphere and environment, when I see on social media my friends’ activities I feel more isolated and alone. — Kerlande Mompremier, Ames High School I most definitely see the connection between higher levels of stress and being on your phone for a more than needed amount of time. Scrolling through social media and looking at small square sized snapshots of a person’s “picture perfect life” can really have an effect on both self-esteem and mental health. The world and especially the younger generations must learn to spark creativity and imagination. Those things can only be formed through one’s mind, experiences, and thoughts, not any phone or device on the planet can provide them. — Sadie Dunne, Hoggard High school in Wilmington, NC For me personally, I tend to find myself veering away from my phone during stressful times because I feel like all it does is add to it. I have anxiety and have seen that the negative effects from social media only add to that anxiousness. I agree that phone usage and constant usage of social media can definitely increase anxiety and depression, if you allow yourself to get involved so much you can’t return to a normal lifestyle without it. I think that as I feel like I’m starting to feel more anxious and stressed, my phone does not help the situation but makes it worse, so I try to stay away from it during these times. — Taylor Tomlinson, Lubbock, TX Speaking personally, I can recall many times in which social media has helped me feel less lonely than I otherwise would have been. I have severe anxiety, so the idea of socializing with people in a less formal setting, such as in a lunchroom, or outside of class is terrifying to me. So, as a result, I am often alone during these periods. I’ll go off and find my own corner, and I sit and have to watch as those around me have fun with their friends and socialize. I have gone through this process near-daily for ten years, and I am confident that without social media to fall back on, I would have been driven mad. Social media makes me feel as though there are people out there I can talk to, and that I can control the conversation however I like. I can have friends that I respond to at my own pace, leaving me room to better formulate my responses. — Jackson Bumgarner, Bryant High School, AR My mom is a really busy woman and she’s not always there for me and my phone has been my shelter since 5th grade. When I came home feeling sad in school, a couple of youtube videos can cheer me up. Smartphones also make contacting friends and families easier making me less lonely during my sad times. The use of phone also opens a new window of opportunities, I learnt how to edit and shoot videos from youtube. There was a time when my mental health was just not great and the internet saved me. — shirley, fhs My first friend was an online friend. I was in fifth grade and I was obsessed with Hamilton, and would spend hours reading about and listening to the songs. My family was on vacation in WildWood, and we were living in a small hotel. I was swimming in the pool and a kid came up to me, and I found out we both liked Hamilton a lot, so we started talking. At the end of the vacation the kid told me her email and we started texting on hangouts. We still text to this day. My phone played a big part in letting me stay in touch, and it built my relationship with her. — Arianna Andriyevsky, Julia R. Masterman As the life of a teenager continues to increase in its complexity and demands, the resources and tools a smartphone can provide help keep teenagers grounded. So, before adults chastise us for our use of phones (while they’re leveling up in Candy Crush) it’s important to show that phones are very powerful tools, sometimes too powerful. With how many activities a teenager can be involved in these days, smartphones help make more productive use of their time, keeping up with meetings, get-togethers, and updates. Whether it be communicating with other club members, or simply catching up with friends, these communication tools help bring people closer without necessitating time-consuming travel. — Sayre S., Ames High School I am on my phone about three hours a day. The majority of this is spent on social media apps like snapchat or twitter and listening to music. My phone has a positive influence on me. I feel more connected to the world and what is going on and while that is not always a good thing it is nice to be informed and updated on events within seconds. — Mehdi Sebghati, Ames High School My average screen time is about 40 minutes per week. I typically look at news, talk with my relatives in China through WeChat, or go on Youtube to watch cooking videos … My phone does help me build my Chinese skills when texting in WeChat. On WeChat, I can also build relationships with my relatives and friends that I cannot meet face-to-face. However, my parents are still very worried about my time on my phone. That’s because I have glasses, and my eyesight has been worsening every year. They express their concern by speaking my name in a warning tone when they think I’ve been on my phone long enough. I listen to them, because I know that they are trying to do the best for them. — Daniella Liang, J.R. Masterman I think adults should be worried about how much their child is on their phone. If my child was constantly on their phone I would be mad because it is disrespectful when you are with someone and they won’t get off their phone. I get offended and annoyed when my friends are on their phones instead of talking to me and I wouldn’t want to be that rude to someone so if my parents told me I shouldn’t be on my phone I think that’s a good thing. Parents are supposed to teach their children how to talk, walk, and ride a bike, they should teach them proper manners and to not go be on your phone for too long. — Anna Diab, Glenbard West HS, Glen Ellyn, IL The answer to this question is different for me than many of my peers because unlike many “savvy” teens I have a flip phone. When I was fifteen I decided to stick with a flip phone, it solved my basic needs. I’m currently seventeen and have friends. It came down to me seeing kids and people on their phones at dangerous and inappropriate times. They were on their while driving, in school, and at the supper table. When I see somebody on their phone it reminds me that there is more to life. I am on my phone for less than ten minutes a day, still, I have survived. I can call and text people without the hassle of getting social media notifications. I’m not saying smartphones are bad they can be very useful. I just prefer reality. — Ethan Morton, Ames, Iowa I hate that I’m one of those teenagers who have a mini heart attack when they don’t feel their phone in their pocket. I know I’m not on my phone nearly as much as some of my peers, but even the time I do spend there I resent. Despite what the article says about technology not having any real negative influence on mental health, I can’t help but feel like it causes other problems. We text and DM people when we have something to say, leaving behind outdated voice-calling and — gasp — that archaic practice of talking in person. So much of communication is nonverbal. Many today struggle to maintain eye contact, pay full undivided attention to others, and meaningfully interact in person. Screens are our modern-day masks and boy, do we love hiding behind them. While maybe it is true that technology doesn’t directly connect to the rise in mental disease and anxiety, it leads to a host of other problems, most prominent among these being social decay. — Grace Robertson, Hoggard High School Wilmington, NC Basically I have always had really bad anxiety way before I got a phone. Once I got to middle school and I started to mature it got worse because I was finally able to see all the bad in the world that my parents had protected me from. Which I believe is one of the leading factors of my depression. But once I got a phone I was so happy because I was always able to communicate with my friends no matter where I was. Then when I was given social media I really felt connected because I was able to get updates on what everyone was doing and what was going on in the world, but then when my parents found out about my depression they complete ignored the fact that they had sheltered me my entire life and blamed it all on my phone so now I do not have social media and I still feel the same way but I feel less connected and more isolated. I guess what I’m trying to say is that I don’t think that phones have ruined a generation I think it’s the parents, they don’t realize that sheltering us is hurting us … — Caleb, America I feel like the anxiety, stress, and depression are not the result of my phone but from the expectations from parents and teachers, how unsafe I feel in my school, from the medication making me “normal and calm,” and from the news where nothing good is heard. I don’t think my phone stops me from socializing or from sleeping, and I am constantly trying to put down my phone. My parents will warn me once or twice but they are on it as much as me. But I believe that adults try to use phones as a scapegoat instead of admitting that there are bigger issues, such as global warming, political divisions etc. that teens face or the problems that they themselves cause with high expectations. — Lilian, Hoggard High School in Wilmington, NC",The New York Times
2020,"What Students Are Saying About Lessons on Slavery, Meme Culture and an Adventurous Kayaker","current events conversation Teenage comments in response to our recent writing prompts, and an invitation to join the ongoing conversation. For this week’s weekly roundup of student comments on our writing prompts, we’re featuring teenagers’ thoughts about lessons on slavery and internet memes, as well as short stories and poems inspired by a kayaker’s daring expedition. Welcome to two new classes who joined the conversation this week from Hatboro-Horsham High School and Orlando, Fla. Please note: Student comments have been lightly edited for length, but otherwise appear exactly as they were originally submitted. _________ In “Why Can’t We Teach Slavery Right in American Schools,” Nikita Stewart writes about the history of teaching about slavery in the United States. Inspired by her essay, The New York Times asked readers to share what and how they learned about slavery, so we thought we’d ask students about their experiences. They told us about the lessons they believe have been sugarcoated or avoided altogether, as well as some thoughtful approaches. They also suggested ways to teach slavery better and why they think the topic is so important. Slavery was taught in a way that made it seem mellow in elementary school. I wasn’t aware of how awful it truly was until well after the fifth grade. In elementary school, all we were told was that Harriet Tubman was a hero of the slaves, and that slaves were taken to plantations to “work.” As we’ve grown up, the truth has been revealed on how horrible the conditions were for slaves. The conditions included being whipped and abused, chained tightly together on ships, and even more brutal acts. People still discuss slavery as if it wasn’t a big issue. Young children are shielded from the truth. They need to understand America’s history, even if it includes topics that make them uncomfortable. — Kynzie White, Lubbock, Texas I first learned about the Civil War in elementary school. My school was private and sheltered, and there was not even a textbook we read from; the teacher lectured us instead. We learned all the typical Civil War things: causes, battles, and almost as an afterthought, slavery. Slavery was said to be, in a very euphemistic, roundabout manner, “a method of forcing people to do work even if they did not want to.” This lacking definition does not even begin to fathom the horrors of slavery. And this was my basis for thought on slavery for almost three years, until I was halfway through middle school and learned the truth. — Sean Hession, Hoggard High School in Wilmington, NC Being in high school I can honestly say that I do not remember being taught much about slavery through elementary and even through middle school. I know that it was talked about, but it was never conveyed in a way that was accurate and straight forward. When I was younger I believed that slave owners took care of their slaves and cared for them as long as they could still work and were making them money. I was never told all of the gruesome parts and tougher to accept details, which shouldn’t be taught at a young age but I think it is very important that schools stop sugar coating the details of the transporting and care of slaves. Some people may have a hard time handling it, but that is what makes it easier to sympathize with and understand more about it. — Taylor Tomlinson, Lubbock, TX I did not learn about slavery until my 8th grade year. Being in middle school, people often joked about it but I did not really understand. In the beginning of my 8th grade year, I was in for a shock. US History introduced me to things I could never imagine. My teacher often described what slaves went through in heavy detail … I believe that this topic is being erased from our teaching curriculum and not taken seriously. Kids my age still make jokes about slavery and it is really unsettling to know that something so tragic in our country is seen as a joke. — Marlina Casady, Florida I think that I was taught about slavery in school, but it wasn’t a prioritized topic. We glanced at slavery just long enough to say it was bad, but we had whole units and spent weeks of time doing projects on the Holocaust or even the Bolshevik Revolution. Both of these other historical events are important to learn about, but because slavery was domestic and that is the topic we don’t talk about as much, it raises some questions. It seems like we try to avoid it to make us feel better about our nation. We are fine demonizing Germans or Russians and talking about all the faults of their nation, but when the finger is pointed at us, we want to gloss over it. I do, however, think that it is important to foster a sense of national pride, something I think this generation has next to none of. But, I think that hiding from our past mistakes is not an effective way to have justified pride in our nation. We should be able to talk about our mistakes and move on from them so that we don’t repeat them again. Incorrectly representing slavery doesn’t promote national pride, it just keeps us from acknowledging how we can keep from ever repeating the atrocities of the past. — Brynnan Brooks, Lubbock, TX Honestly, I have learned very little about slavery in my schooling career. I feel as if they would beat around the bush on how bad it was, it’s like our history classes would focus more on the wars and different movements but little on slavery and how it effected us and the world today. There’s a lot more focus on today’s problems or things that aren’t as important as slavery. I think there should be a stronger curriculum about it. Let’s not put what people went through behind us, let’s show how it impacted us and how we’re building off of it and growing from it. — Katie, Hanover Throughout my school career, I learned about the same slavery stories over and over again. Harriet Tubman and the Underground Railroad, the book Uncle Tom’s Cabin, Sojourner truth, these names and stories must’ve been said to me about a million times. I didn’t really go in deep into slavery until 10th grade AP history. If it weren’t for that class, I wouldn’t know nearly as much about slavery as I do now, but if I wouldn’t have taken that college level class, I wonder if I would’ve ever been taught it in high school. Slavery seems to be something that every teacher skips over because they assume you’ve heard about it before or just that they don’t feel comfortable going into the horrors of it. They cherry pick which stories and what images of slavery they show to us, and for what reason I’m not sure. To compare it to the Holocaust, I’ve have talked about the terrors of concentration camps a million times, I’ve seen movies, read book, seen pictures. It seems as though we are scared to show the inhumane acts that happened on our own soil. We are so open about demonizing Germans, but don’t have the guts to do it to ourselves. — Olivia Moore, Lubbock, TX Throughout my years in school, I do not feel as though I have been properly informed on the subject of slavery. It wasn’t until I researched and analyzed historical documents, as well as, empathize with people represented in narrative writings, that I was able to grasp a better understanding of the matter. — Hannah Hudgens, Lubbock, TX Most people bash technology, mostly our phones. We use them to text, play games, call, remind us to do simple tasks that can easily be forgotten, etc. When it all comes down to it, I’ve learned more about the horrors of slavery in the comfort of my own home than at school or in text books, on guess what? My phone. The whole point of school is to learn where they don’t want you on your phone a lot, but sometimes our phones can teach us what schools cannot or will not. School sometimes hold back or modify what they teach, for the sake of our so-called “innocent” minds, instead of teaching us what really went on. Our phones on the other hand, tells us the bad and the ugly of slavery, the truth, not the half truth, but they do give a warning for younger audiences, or those with a weak stomach. — Aaliyah Butler, Hoggard High School in Wilmington, NC I learn about slavery approximately 28 days out of the year. During Black History Month each year, I usually have one teacher who decides to spend the month of February teaching about slavery and the progression of how African Americans have lived in America since then. Although I’m glad that my teachers tend to dedicate this month to teaching slavery, I wish it seemed like less of an obligation to Black History Month and more of a genuine desire to teach it. Sometimes I wonder if we didn’t have a month dedicated to this if I would learn about slavery at all. I think the first time that I’ve truly learned about slavery from a historical point of view was this year in my tenth grade AP World History class. We went pretty in depth into how it started and learned what happened in the time period where it was considered legal in the US. We read documents and journal entries from former slaves, and we learned about the large scale effects that it had on Africa. I think I was pretty lucky to be able to learn about it this year after reading this article and seeing how many people couldn’t say the same. — Hayden Carroll, Hoggard High School in Wilmington, NC When it comes to historical events or matters, I believe it is best to tell kids the full truth of what happened no matter the cruelty or severity of the event, because as kids it will resonate with them more … I’m glad I was taught the horrors and history of slavery and black oppression in the US as it is relevant today as race continues to be controversial in America. I think it should be a required to teach both that the civil war was caused by disputes over slavery, and the subsequent attempts by the South to downplay the role of slavery and their continued oppression of blacks. — Thomas Wahlman, Glenbard West High School The problem with slavery being taught has more to do with education standards in general here in America rather than with slavery itself. Like many other subjects and topics being taught, I think there need to be stricter, standardized guidelines when it comes to the discussion of slavery. We need clearly defined points that will give everyone in the country the same base of information about slavery and then advanced classes that go more in-depth about slavery if students wish to chose them. This will ensure that everyone is taught the same, proper information and we do not have curriculums that vary wildly and provide some with an entirely inaccurate understanding of the history of slavery. — Sam McNamara, John T. Hoggard High (Wilmington, NC) When teaching about slavery, I believe we shouldn’t sugarcoat it. Using the textbooks to describe and teach about slavery is great; however, society has changed in the understanding and knowledge of slavery. It only shows a portion of what it was. Basically the north was a working region and very industrialized, while the south held the slaves. In contrast to those particular ideas, the north AND the south both had slavery just alike. I do believe textbooks should be used sparingly when teaching about slavery. I do think teachers should use textbooks to back them up; however, they should be able to speak freely and not by the textbook on the view of slavery. Not teaching what really happened and the whole truth about slavery is only keeping the next generation from knowing what their country came to be founded on. Like the article said, history isn’t alive anymore if history isn’t taught correctly. — Gabby Huddleston, Lubbock, TX I learned about slavery in my classes but they never really was much depth to it, there was the concept of slavery and the effects of slavery but never any actual history of slavery. I feel like there needs to be more representation of slaves in our education system to fully grasp an understanding of how slaves lived. — Jesus L., Fresno, California We often teach racism and slavery as things of the past. We teach them things that aren’t white people’s problems without realizing it. Guys. Racism exists today. Because we have ignored the impact of these things on our history for so long- waiting for all the way up until the end of middle school- we have a disconnect to its implications … We should be learning about our past, not covering it up for the sake of filling students with the lie that America is a perfect country. We. Are. Not. When Germany went through the Holocaust, they had memorials, they have laws that are enacted today to prevent oppression from ever slipping back into their country. What did we as America do? Threw it under the rug. I bet you didn’t even know that America had a successful coup d’etat. I bet you didn’t know that the Reconstruction was working in Wilmington. I bet you didn’t even know that black people were massacred all threw its streets when the white people overthrew the black people in power. I bet you didn’t even know because Wilmington is my hometown, and I didn’t even know about this until I was fourteen. — Gracelynn Whitaker, Hoggard High School in Wilmington, NC Growing up in school, I feel that I knew slavery existed in the country, but didn’t quite understand the gravity of that fact or it’s implications on society today. I think that as I have gotten older and advanced through school I have gradually learned more about these things. Slavery in the United States is so much more than just a thing that happened. Slavery is about a deeply rooted racism, and even deeper selfishness that dominated and continues to dominate the hearts of American people. This attitude, although not in the form of slavery, still manifests itself today. Through continued education about slavery and what it’s existence actually means, we can work to correct this. — Colin Hess, Glenbard West HS Glen Ellyn, IL _________ In “The Role of Memes in Teen Culture,” Jennifer L.W. Fink writes about her mixed feelings on the prevalence of memes among youth. We asked students about their connection to meme culture. They told us how memes inform them about the world and current events, make them laugh, help them process scary information, and, sometimes, cross a line. Memes and the internet in general are beautiful things. During 20’s the radio was found throughout every home in the United States, allowing everyone to have some form of similar entertainment no matter where they were. This similar form of entertainment allowed the whole country to collectively laugh at jokes said over the radio, collectively ponder about societal issues, and collectively mourn over tragedies. This unifying force managed to do something no American saw before: a national form of unity. Now during this blessed age of the internet we once again see this unity, but this time at a much larger scale. People in Europe, America and in other places laugh at the same memes, use the same formats, and chase the same likes. Memes have united the world as we know it at a scale we never seen before. — Abdurrahman, Illinois, United States I believe that memes make the internet a better place. Memes allow people across the world to relate to others and have a good laugh. Memes bring people together and create many different communities. Personally I am a part of many communities in the form of subreddits and they each have many different styles of memes and types of humor. Each one of them has one thing in common. The people making the memes like to express themselves through their memes and appreciate the memes of others. — Anthony Owens, Minnesota Memes show the emphatic side of people because memes are supposed to be relatable, that is the whole point of the meme. The meme brings us together by relating to one another’s struggles and experiences. — Vthehealthnut, Fresno Memes are a form of communication. They are used by a wide range of ages simple because they are simple. Simple to understand, and simple to send. I truly enjoy the meme culture and how it has resulted in a mockery of most serious topics. Too many people in this world take things far too seriously. Instead of blowing things out of proportion, we can turn it into a joke. Although many in this society get easily offended, it is an evolved form of communication that actually shows us not to take anything quite that literally. — Grace Garland, Glenbard West High School, IL Despite dealing with scarier topics, the coronavirus and World War 3 memes are just ways to make jokes: there is no complex hidden depth to any of these memes. In regards to the “anti-Asian messages” of these memes, offensive jokes have been told by stand up comedians and celebrities for ages. Jokes dealing with race are nothing new, thus it is silly to get worked up over something mildly offensive just because it is produced through a different platform. When one tries to thoroughly analyze memes to find some larger truth, it comes off as a mediocre wanna-be psychoanalysis of the teen mind. — Omar V, Glenbard West, Glen Ellyn, IL The world is a scary place and alot of us deal with it by laughing at it. When you laugh at something it doesn’t seem as scary anymore. I believe that this is what happened with all the WW3 memes that were going around at the beginning of the year … I think that memes are a good thing, they are fun to laugh at and a big part of the younger generation. As much as we are told we have a voice and that we are being listened to sometimes we don’t always feel heard. In times like that, we find memes we can relate to our make memes of the situation because it is so much easier to laugh at things than deal with what could be a scary reality. — Jamaelle Guerrier, Orlando, FL Personally I enjoy the thought of memes, I enjoy the complexity that can go overlooked by a simple cartoon and caption, I like the wow you get when something crazy happens, the thought provokers that make you consider things you haven’t before, and how there’s always something creative being made. — Demetrius Gibson, Glenbard West High School, IL Memes have been a mainstay of the internet since it’s early days, but never have they been more prevalent in politics and overall general media. We use it to express opinions about governments, social ideals, comment on the mortality of man, or to crack a quick joke with some friends. Everything should be allowed to joked about as if you start putting limits about what is or isn’t socially acceptable, you end up with a similar situation as china, who has banned Winnie the Pooh from all forms of media because of a meme relating the president to the famous bear … We need this freedom to express people’s ideas and thoughts, no matter the subject matter. — Jordan Burger, Glenbard West, Glen Ellyn IL I get about 90% of my news from memes. Memes are how I found out about the Coronavirus, and about the deaths of many famous people, for example Stan Lee. In my opinion, making memes about things going on in the news is great. It helps get people informed about the things that are going on in the world, while being funny. Memes about news can also get you to research the things that the meme is talking about. — Matt Dougherty, J. R. Masterman As someone who gets a lot of new information from social media, including memes, I think comedy in memes about current events is fine … Sure, maybe meme pages on Instagram aren’t the best places to receive information, but I think that sometimes they’re a more clear way of relaying information than some news sources. News source hold bias, and while the people who make memes certainly can as well, they’re mostly for entertainment or laughs, and don’t need to be taken 100% seriously. Memes aren’t meant to be factual, reliable sources, and most of the time introduce me to an event that I can later research and get the facts on. — Samantha Rogala, Norwood High School, Norwood, MA Besides being very humorous, I do learn a lot from memes. I learn what’s going on around the world, and how serious of an issue it is. There can be times where memes and they news should and shouldn’t be separated, and I think it is ok to laugh at serious news. Like the article said humor is a big part of a teenagers coping mechanism, and teenagers need the humor to feel more comfortable with what is going on around the world. — Julian V., Glenbard West HS, Glen Ellyn, IL My generation also has to be aware of the biases of the information being presented. News can come from memes but it is not the best source, it is a convenient source. This reflects my generation’s lack of care towards finding the real truth of the information that contains no biases. Memes can contain false information that are sent out across the world that can change the opinion of millions. A meme can hold much power and what we do with that matters since anyone can make a meme. — Marisa Silk, Norwood High School, Norwood, MA I believe that, to a great extent, memes make the internet a worse place. While yes, memes can provide a good laugh and a smile, I have personally seen very negative things about these posts. I, among many others, have witnessed horribly offensive ‘memes’ that should not be taken lightly. For example, I have seen posts that make fun of race, ability-levels, and mental illness. While yes, some people may be trying to make a dark situation lighthearted and funny, many can find these as horribly offensive and hurtful. Rather than made fun of, diversity must be embraced by everyone on the media. The internet should be a place of learning, acceptance and fun, and should not degrade anyone of their position as a human. — Ava Orr, Glenbard West HS Glen Ellyn, IL I can definitely say that I have used humor to hide pain, but when it’s on a larger scale, it could be hurtful. There are lots of things going on in the world that are hard for us to process and understand, but making fun of those situations isn’t the answer. For example, take the Coronavirus. This is a disease that is very quickly spreading and killing lots of people in China and other areas, which is unsettling for many of us. Some people responded with humor, making memes about preparing for the Coronavirus by slicing up some limes. However, think of this meme through the perspective of someone who is actually dealing with this disease. If you just lost a family member to the Coronavirus, do you still find this funny? Or if you’re battling it yourself, do you enjoy others laughing at your pain? This is why we need to be more considerate of the people who will see what we post on the internet, whether they live next door or around the globe. — Hannah, Cooper High School For me personally humor can be a coping strategy or a way to process scary or hurtful information. I believe when using humor as a coping method you have to be careful as others may just find you rude or crass. If humor helps you process your emotions then I see no problem with it but just because it works for you doesn’t mean it works for other people. With that in mind there is always a right place and a wrong place for humor therefore there is always a right and wrong audience. If you feel comfortable coping with difficult, painful, or tragic subjects through humor go ahead but be careful as you can easily cross a line and hurt someone who was deeply wounded by the same event or subject. — Jordan Mozockie, Glenbard West HS Glen Ellyn, IL It seems that my generation has become so drenched in irony that making terrible memes is about the only way we can cope with horrible world events that we had no control over. I’ve seen plenty of memes that were egregious and over-the-top in pretending to be racist, to the point where it’s obviously a joke yet still has the power to hurt people. — Jackson Pekny, Glenbard West HS, Glen Ellyn, IL _________ This video isn’t a work of fiction (that really is a kayaker plunging over a 134-foot waterfall), but it inspired students to write imaginative short stories and poems for our Picture Prompt “Over the Falls.” We loved the way they used literary devices like imagery, personification, rhythm and rhyme to bring these pieces to life. The tasking movement of my arms wears a familiar fatigue into my fascia. I blink water out of my eyes so I can see the course ahead. Not so straight and narrow. The rapids rock me in every direction, though I feel no comfort in their arms. I twist and turn, pressing through the water. I feel the heavy resistance as I lift the paddle, making a quick adjustment to counterbalance myself. I breathe deeply. Water pounds into my face, but as I crest the waterfall, I see a blissful moment of stillness below. Somehow, in all of the speed and rigor of the drop, the clear blue water fills me some kind of pride. — Matalin Bloomfield, Hoggard High School in Wilmington, NC white, turquoise, blues, greens, a current pulls forward, over the edge. The river flows onward, all water that flows with it goes over, it is a moment of uncertainty in a linear life. All people face such drops, they are natural, and to fall over the ledge only advances the world you know. what lies at the bottom, at the end of the drop, is unknown, and uncertainty pushes one forward … — William L, Glenbard West High School Water, water, water, water: Surrounding me, Rushing, Gushing, Spewing over mountain tops, Looking for an escape, Looking for a thrill. Water, water, water, water: Ever-flowing, Never slowing, Always changing, Condensing, evaporating, precipitating. Water, water, water, water: Why can’t I be like you? Brave, fierce, determined, I’m stuck in my human prison Yet you’ve never understood confinement, I need you for life, Yet you need no one. Water, water, water, water: You see the bright flame, And head towards it with no abandon, Reckless with your life, So that at least it was worth living, Why can’t I be like you? Water, water, water, water. — Laura Arbona, Hoggard High School in Wilmington, NC Dang it, I think to myself. This is what happens when I don’t eat breakfast. It’s too late, as I let the power of the water and gravity pull me down. I feel the mixed rush of adrenaline and fear jolt through my body like electricity. This is what I love. I crave that moment of feeling weightless in the air — the perfect mix of that drop tower thrill with a little bit of crazy mixed into it. Then, I relax. My once shut eyes open hesitantly, as I marvel at the view for the longest three seconds of my life. The frigid water bites at my face as I hit the water with a big SLAP. When my vision clears, I can see the world with a whole new view. — Hope Heinrichs, Hoggard High School in Wilmington, NC Did she really mean it? Is she really gone? These thoughts race through my head as I make my way down the rushing river. With every paddle I can feel myself getting closer and closer to a choice I can never take back, a choice that could end my life. It all started last night when Elizebeth my wife of four years, my only true soulmate left me. We had been fighting for months but I never thought she would leave. I can feel the rush of the water picking up as I approach my demise. I am now seemly flying though the water as I decide I don’t want to do it, but it's too late. As my kayak emerges over the edge, my heart begins to race knowing this is my final seconds. As I fall a calm overcomes my body, the water almost as blue as Elizabeth’s eyes looks inviting. I am ready to go as I close my eyes and accept my fate. — Dave, Glenbard West HS, Glen Ellyn, IL Visions of grandeurSensations of earth surround I embrace the fall — Joe Keller, Hoggard High School in Wilmington NC Just before we fall Remember what’s important You will rise again — Jason Quinteros, Glenbard West HS, Glen Ellyn, IL",The New York Times
2020,"What Students Are Saying About Vegetarianism, Parental Advice and How We Listen","current events conversation Teenage comments in response to our recent writing prompts, and an invitation to join the ongoing conversation. For this week’s roundup of student comments on our writing prompts, we asked teenagers to tell us what they think about vegetarianism, share how often they turn to their parents for advice, and interpret an image about talking and listening. Before we jump in, we want to offer a warm welcome to new classes who joined the conversation this week from Arleta, Calif.; Arts in Action Middle School, Calif.; Cape Town, South Africa; Columbus, Ohio; Michigan; North Hollywood, Calif.; Polytechnic Senior High, Calif.; Springville, N.Y.; and Washington. Please note: Student comments have been lightly edited for length, but otherwise appear exactly as they were originally submitted. _________ In the Opinion piece “I Admire Vegetarians. It’s a Choice I Won’t Ever Make,” Alicia P.Q. Wittmeyer discusses how meat is central to her family’s culture, and the challenges involved with ever giving meat up. We asked students if they were vegetarian or vegan or if they had ever thought about adopting that diet. They told us how their cultures, the environment, ethics and health reasons have all influenced their decisions about what they eat and don’t eat. In my big Italian family, food is the center of every occasion, event, and party. My family as well myself love to cook and we sit down and eat dinner with each other every night and even have family dinners with my uncle, aunt, and cousins on Sundays. I can’t imagine a major holiday like Christmas without seafood or meatballs, it just wouldn’t be the same. — Josie S., Glenbard West HS Glen Ellyn, IL Meat has a significant impact on my life, much more so than I thought. As an Asian, more specifically Korean, my family eats meat daily. If I were to be a vegetarian or vegan, I would become a burden on my family. My mom would have to change her grocery plan to fit my specific needs on top of the rest of my six-person family. When visiting grandparents or aunts and uncles, whether it be for a reunion or holiday, meat is served in almost all dishes. I would either have to ask them to make something specifically for me, bring my own meal, or simply not eat. Food is a big part of bonding as well. Korean barbecue is a frequented holiday meal and I can become detached from my family if I do not participate. — Sophia Lee, Glenbard West HS Glen Ellyn, IL I am not necessarily a vegetarian, but there have been times when I have had to do so because of religious beliefs. Every time there is a full moon, my family and I do not eat meat or go vegetarian for a day. We choose to do this because we believe that by not harming the animals the Gods will return us a favor in the future. My family and I rarely eat red meat, but we do have a lot of chicken and fish. I think that if we tried to go vegan or vegetarian it would be easy because our meals already consist of a lot of vegetables. — Phebe Truong, J.R Masterman I grew up in a Mexican family where meat was so prevalent in the food we ate, yet, my parents and I quit meat back in 2015. Not eating meat would mean alienating ourselves from our histories and traditions, but I would argue this is a good thing. It’s these past traditions that have put our planet in this harsh, urgent condition. I disagree with the notion of placing our personal wants before an issue which is or will impact everyone: climate change. We somehow value our taste buds that much? To me, the cultural aspect of meat and food itself is little compared to our ideas, our languages, our music, etc. — Oscar Espejel, Glenbard West High School, Glen Ellyn IL I am not a vegetarian or vegan, however I do observe a number of meat free and egg free (lacto-vegetarian) days for religious reasons. I am South African-Indian Hindu and take part in a fast that abstains from the consumption of meat and eggs, every Monday, Tuesday and occasional Hindu auspicious days. My family and I also take part in a month long fast from mid September to mid October in the Tamil month of Purtassi and we do not eat beef and pork at all. In the past three years I have continuously contemplated becoming vegetarian for religious, ethical and environmental reasons, and it’s a constant battle because living a vegetarian lifestyle comes with great benefits. My closest friends are also vegetarian and I always feel uncomfortable eating meat around them. — Keenen Gilbert, Cape Town, Soth Africa I’ve been vegan actually for four years now (since I was 12, I’m 16 now). I’m Puerto Rican, therefore meat is a big part of my culture. It’s really easy and my family is very supportive. Whenever my parents cook they just make my own meal with vegan products. — Alejandro, South Carolina I have been a vegetarian for four years and while it can be hard to find food sometimes in such a carnist society, I can’t say that I regret it. To me, it’s a matter of having as little impact on the Earth as I can. Over a year, a vegetarian will use 3 fewer acres of land, be responsible for 60% fewer emissions, and save up to 270 animals. In a growing population, turning to vegetarianism and veganism is the only way that we will be able to feed our entire population because of the huge amounts of land we use to grow grain for livestock and graze them. I am tired of hearing the excuse, “But I really like meat.” Yes, ideally, it would be great if we could all eat meat, but we are currently in a climate crisis. Big problems require big solutions and changing your diet is the single biggest thing you can do to lower your emissions. — Cooper Hyldahl, Hoggard High School in Wilmington, NC Throughout all my years, I have been on and off vegetarian. It started in middle school and to this day, I try to avoid meat. I think that the reasoning behind it is more targeted for the food industry and the pure animal abuse that is behind the meat (and dairy) industry. If everyone in the world became vegetarian and continued a sustainable lifestyle, our CO2 emissions would plummet, as well as greenhouse gasses and other harmful chemicals. For years I’ve been finding new ways to replace meat in my diet and I don’t miss meat at all -and that’s coming from a steakhouse chefs daughter. — Ava Iserloth, Glenbard West HS Glen Ellyn, IL I admire people who become vegetarian for environmental reasons, since usually they have had meat before, probably miss it, but want to do what is best for the Earth. It is also probably a healthier option. But I eat meat practically every day. — MC, PA No. I would never go vegetarian in my life. I like cheeseburgers, steak, and chicken and I couldn’t imagine only eating salad and veggie burgers. If anything I would minimize my meat intake but I’d never stop eating meat and become a vegetarian. With the new impossible burger from Burger King I think it would be interesting to try to new plant based burgers and chicken and everything but I would never not eat burgers, steak, or chicken. — Nolan Hart, Glenbard West High School, IL I think that becoming a vegetarian is a brave decision. I have seen many people who are vegetarian and can keep their decision to do not eat meat at all, but I cannot. I consider a balanced diet that brings me different amino acids and minerals which are necessaries for my body. A balanced diet contains proteins, carbohydrates, vegetables, fruits, grains, and dairy. One of the proteins from this diet is meat that is important because it brings us iron, some essential amino acids, vitamins A and B12. — Andrea SW, YC CLIP I chose to become pescatarian for a variety of reasons, the first being the health benefits. As a ballet dancer I have to be very careful with what I put into my body to power myself while maintaining how I look, so I decided to cut out red meat, then chicken and now I am left with fish. I have found that by doing this, my body has responded in a positive way, lending it towards dance more. — Lauren Alving, Glenbard West High school Nine months ago I decided to become vegetarian. While I’ve eaten meat my entire life, I felt better without it. The thing is, it hasn’t made this drastic impact, my family continues to eat meat, I don’t feel the need to pressure others into not eating it, and I continue to go out to eat wherever I want. Becoming a vegetarian can be for your own reasons, for me I felt healthier without the grease, as well as the impact the meat industry has on the environment. — Charlotte Todd, Hoggard High School Last year for about 6 months I actually was vegetarian. I saw this video about how they processed meat in factories, it was heartbreaking seeing what they did to the animals. When I was vegetarian I couldn’t even fathom eating meat. I’m very lucky to have a family that supports me and were more than willing to cook separate meals for me that didn’t contain meat. — Bailey Hughes, Hoggard High School in Wilmington, NC In my short 16 years of being alive, I have found few foods that I enjoy, in all honesty, certain meat products are ones I have come to enjoy. So being a vegetarian or vegan isn’t something I really would want to do. And I don't think that it will stop the problem of animal abuse and neglect by huge mass producing farms. Local small farms that actually care for their animals and offer them a healthy, normal life are the best way to protect animal welfare. Treat them with love and they will treat you with love back. — Gabe Pellette, Springville, Ny I get why people become vegetarian; they are against killing animals and the abusive nature of how they are raised. I can see why people don’t like that, but in my opinion refusing to eat meat won’t change what’s going on. If you go into a store and refuse to buy meat, then someone else after you is going to end up buying it. If the meats already in the package and in stores, you might as well not let it go to waste. That’s my philosophy, but I also believe the meat industry is very cruel and they should find other ways to operate their industry. — Luke Zemenak, Glenbard West, Glen Ellyn, IL _________ Why do teenagers reject parents’ solutions to their problems? “It’s usually because we’re not giving them what they’re really looking for,” Lisa Damour writes in an article about how teenagers want their parents to respond. We asked students who they go to when they need help. Many thought they were “different” than most teenagers because they do turn to their parents for advice. But in the responses below, you’ll see they’re not alone. Others told us about the friends, teachers and family members who they prefer talking to, and why. After school, the first person I talk to is my mom. We talk about our days, the good and the bad. She is literally my best friend. I ask her for advice on just about everything. It shows that you can build a strong and trustful bond between a parent and child … My parents are two people in this world who I trust the most, and by opening that line of communication between us, it makes my life so much better. — Katie, Hanover Most of the time, I turn to my mom for advice (in any situation). She always says her opinion on things so confidently, which, I guess, somehow satisfies me. Even if the solution she gives me isn’t what I was particularly looking for, her reasoning on why she thought/felt that way always seems to make sense. Also, because she says things so confidently and with good reasoning, it gives me a whole new perspective to the problem. — Chloe, Saigon South Int. School, HCMC, Vietnam I do ask my mother for advice most of the time. When I do I feel like I’m getting the right solution. But, sometimes it can be hard to talk to her. Like, when she does not understand what I’m inferring to or, I have to repeat myself. Which, gets very annoying. But, I still ask and try to explain to her. My mother is also supportive of my decisions. I don’t know what I’ll have done without her. — Samantha, Northern Academy At a younger stage of my life, I believed the best place to go with problems or questions was my friends and not my parents. As I’ve grown, I’ve done the exact opposite. Realizing that my parents have experienced way more than me has opened me up to them. Many of the problems I face today seem like grown up problems that need to be taken care of by adults, as I become an adult I learn by my parents helping me solve these problems. — Jakub M, Glenbard West HS Glen Ellyn, IL I am lucky to have parents that listen to me and give me good advice. Many times after something happens that upsets me, I often turn to my mom to complain about teachers, tests and homework, as well as drama that happens with friends and peers. My mom has been through high school before, so she knows what it is like. Although, when she was in high school, many things were very different. So at times, it is hard for her to understand what I am going through. This can cause miscommunications or me getting frustrated and going to talk to a friend about it. — Keira McWilliams, Hoggard High School in Wilmington NC I think it’s easier to go to an older friend. Someone who has truly had experience but also understands what we may be going through. Parents sometimes don’t really understand the stress some of us have. They forget what it was like to be our age. — Sydney Short, Hoggard High School in Wilmington, NC I usually go to a teacher I trust because they have known me for a long time and they actually give advice. Sometimes my mom will just get upset when I ask her for advice. I only really ask her about my grades. Then she will never give me advice she’ll only get upset and ask me how I got there instead of helping. — Renee Regnier, Nipomo High School To me, talking to my parents about an issue is an awkward experience. If I have an issue that I need help solving I usually hop on my phone and text my group chat. All 15 people in the group chat are some of my closest friends that I feel like I can share anything with. — Dean, Glenbard West Highschool When I need advice specifically at school, I have multiple teachers that I am comfortable talking to. For instance, earlier this year I was having a problem with anxiety, and my math teacher from last year helped me through it. When I was feeling overwhelmed, I would go to her classroom and we would talk out my problems. I think having these trusting relationships with mothers and teachers is healthy and important for students because it gives them away to comfortably discuss their emotions. — Summer Brown, Bryant, Arkansas Personally, I don’t like going to my parents for advice. Nothing against my parents but I think my friends understand me better. I feel more comfortable turning to a friend for help rather than one of my parents. My parents will say that I can tell them anything and that they will help but, whenever I do they start lecturing me on what I have done wrong or how I haven’t done anything to help. I feel like whenever I turn to my parents for help it’s just a headache for me to deal with. — Brianna K., J.R Masterman Though it may seem reasonable to seek advice or help from your parents, in my case it does not rest the same. Growing up with immigrant parents was difficult, in the aspect that they were not as open enough to me and were highly strict with their parenting terms. Their strictness may have prevented me from opening up to a relationship with them, but for many cases found in immigrant families, it is more likely, causing more signs of anxiety and depression. — Vanessa Gonzalez, John H. Francis Polytechnic High School My issue is when I try to talk to my mom about situations that are happening in my life, she nicely tells me that it’s my fault that I’m in the situation and then gives me a lecture about knowing right from wrong and other similar subjects. First of all that’s not helpful second it makes me feel attacked and then I don’t want to talk anymore. So I don't tell myself much of anything unless I really have to. Although I wouldn’t mind telling my mom everything going on in my life, it just never goes well for me. — Daleah Vallardo, California It’s hard and uncomfortable for me to share my problems with my parents because they don’t always react how I want them to. Sometimes they say that it’s my fault, so I don’t really talk to them about my issues, because I think I can handle them on my own. Also, I know that they’re busy and don’t have time, so I don’t bother them with stuff. I don’t ask for help on anything. I only ask if I’m desperate. They say I shouldn’t be asking for help much, and I should try to figure it out on my own. — Catherine Jonathan, J.R Masterman Telling our parents about our issues can sometimes be the biggest problem. For example I find that whenever I receive a bad grade, or fail to do something, my issue is never really that I am worried about what I can do to fix it, but how my parents will react to the news. Because of this I only feel comfortable talking to my parents about certain things, like teachers, or other topics not related to grades and schoolwork, that happen at school. — Valeria, J.R. Masterman Usually I’m the type to hold on my feelings until I decide I’ve had enough, I do that with my friends and my family. I speak my mind when I need to and I say what I have to say, but when it comes to my feelings, they are harder to express. Often times, going to my mom isn’t the easiest or most comfortable option I have. When I go to my mom, I have to gather up courage to face my mother in a raw, letting go of my pride sort of way in order to tell her how I feel. — Jessica Elkotbeid, Los Angeles, CA This is to parents; We teens act mostly on our emotion, especially when we have it all bunched up in us. And when we turn to you guys for help, we expect that you guys would be there to tell us it’ll be ok. Instead some parents are criticize our thoughts because sometimes they think it is too immature … — zero, Upper Merion High School, PA When a pile of stress is dropped on us, we get lost and feel alone when we don’t know who to turn too. Parents try to help in any way they can, and they usually try to help by give advice. However, in the eyes of a teenager, parents seem to be criticizing our every move when we are only look for a support system. For parents and teens to overcome this obstacle, it is best for parents to know that we are not always looking for a solution. — Jamyah Bernard, Wekiva High School, Apopka FL I can majorly relate to the “rinse and repeat” motion of explanation, interruption, and anger that come with many of the conversations. This anger usually erupts from my hopes for an ear to listen being taken over by a mouth saying “well why don’t you try this” or “you should be doing that.” Most of the time, I don’t want advice. Rather, I need to let my feelings out with someone I feel comfortable with. — Megan Hoerster, Glenbard West HS Glen Ellyn, IL _________ We asked students to tell us what they thought the above image from our Picture Prompt “Talking and Listening” was saying. They interpreted it in a number of ways: from the dangers of not being open to new ideas to the need for men to listen to women. At first, I saw this picture and instantly thought that this is another painting that shows how the ‘world’ tries to pull you in their direction. The noise, comments, adds, famous opinions can change the way you think. Then I looked a little deeper. The man is listening, he is cuffing his ear so he can hear better. His face is calm. He doesn’t look confused or torn between the opinions of the world. He wants to listen. I think this art piece is truly beautiful. The man shows an example of listening even when the people are angry, joyful, sad. You never know the wisdom or relationships you will find if you just listen. — Adin Williams, Hawaii This simple picture speaks volumes on how people interact with one another. Taking a closer look you see really only speech bubbles in the background, a handful of people talking and creating speech bubbles, and yet there is only one person listening. I can relate to this picture rather deeply. I personally think of myself a more of a listener- despite being a rather loquacious person. Seems contradictory, right? But really when it comes down to it I’d much rather listen to other people talk about their day, their inspiration, their interests, their problems, than to bulldoze a conversation and hop at any opportunity to give my opinion. — Ani, Glenbard West High School The fact that there’s only one major figure in the entire art piece who’s listening to all the colorful chaos that people are saying speaks loudly to what this piece is about, in my opinion. I find it to be speaking about how there’d very few people who will actually want to listen to what people are trying to say. I also noticed how none of the speech bubbles from the people are actually going into the listeners ear. This could signify how larger companies or authority figures can sometimes say they are listening to the community or people when in reality they aren’t. — JD, Kauai, HI The image is suggesting that it is overwhelming to try to listen to everyone you can in the world. When seeking advice or answers from the community, people will often hear answers which contradict or have no correlation with each other — making it very difficult to draw a personal conclusion. On my football team, I might be told by my position coach to do something a specific way (the “right” way); but 5 minutes later I am told to do it in the complete opposite manner: this causes an overwhelming and stressful environment to make my own decisions in. — Braden Spiech, Glenbard West HS Glen Ellyn, IL This image speaks to me in the way that people will provide positive and negative influences/ words to you which will change you as a human. This image shows an open-eared person listening to all the bad and good that comes out of people’s mouths to them and a big problem in our society is that people actually won’t talk bad to someone to their face its always behind their back or thru a screen. In my opinion if you got something to say negative about a person then tell them straight up because if you are too cowardly to even confront them or tell them what you think about them, then you shouldn’t be talking bad in the first place. — Gianni Melle, Kauai, HI It seems as though he’s pretending to listen, like the women in the picture are trying to say something important but their words are falling on deaf ears. It also seems like the man is meant to be white while the women are diverse and come from multiple different races. It’s a statement about how the cries of people of color, specifically women of color, aren’t heard by white men, the powerful in our current society. He seems to be patronizing them and not quite listening to them because he’s turned away, like he’s turned his back to them and their problems. — Elliot Wells, Hoggard High School in Wilmington, NC The picture shows many women saying something at a man. This picture represents how women might be disrespected in workplaces or at home. In general, I think the illustration conveys the idea of listening to one another. The man in the picture isn’t, which could allude to how to be a good listener we have to stop talking. — Priya Patel, Hoggard High School in Wilmington, NC This image is saying that men need to listen to women more. Throughout history, women have constantly been shut up and their opinions cast aside. While I believe that this still happens a little bit in today’s society, I believe that there is a bigger problem: nobody is listening to each other. In the world today, there are so many voices that want to be heard, but there are so few people that are willing to listen to what is being said. I believe it is important to listen and to not always be the one who is talking. Listening is a good skill to have because it allows you to have deeper and more meaningful conversations, and it allows you to have multiple perspectives on issues in the world. — Skye S, Glenbard West HS Glen Ellyn, IL The image is demonstrating what it means to engage in an issue. All around us there are views and opinions on every issue imaginable. Some will be on one end of the debate, others will be on the complete opposite side, and many will be in between the two extremes. Amid all these differing and conversing views, it can be difficult to listen to opinions that might contradict or challenge your own view. But like the man in the picture, it is vital that when engaging in a debate we listen to all sides of the debate, even those we may disagree with, and treat those views with respect and an open mind. — Gavin Schilling, Glenbard West HS Glen Ellyn, Il We often have political debates in class and the sides are divided, one side fights with the other and they are so focused on voicing their own ideas that they forget to listen or even consider what the other side is saying. Why are we wired like this, imagine if we sat back and listened to others opinions and built off them, used their ideas to support our own even if they have a different opinion than us. We would probably learn so much more. — Charlotte Todd, Hoggard High School I am a listener. Not just by choice but because of my incapability to stand up for myself. I can act pretty confident but it comes in waves and even then my anxiety floods my brain. I wish I had the energy to express myself more but I choose to listen to other’s issues and ideas instead. Over the years I’ve learned how important it is to really be silent and listen to others. Last year, my class would set up socratic seminars where we could speak our minds. I couldn’t help but be bothered by those who raised their hands too often or changed the topic so they could speak about themselves. Sadly, we were graded by the number of times we talked instead of the quality of our conversations. The calm seminars soon turned into a quiet but deadly war of backhanded compliments. It hurt my ego to see my classmates fighting. All because they couldn’t truly listen. Listening is much more than sounds waves entering the auricle, passing through the auditory canal, and hitting our eardrum. Listening means putting everything down and thinking about something or someone other than yourself. This can include an unprofessional therapy session with a friend or even a lecture by your math teacher. So please, from the nervous girl in chemistry or the loud spontaneous track runner. Next time someone has the courage to talk, Listen. — Chloe Scatton-Tessier, Hoggard High School in Wilmington, NC",The New York Times
2020,"What They Left Behind: ‘Hairspray,’ Posters and a City of Sketches","Legacies of the Recently Departed Some gems from the life’s work of people remembered in recent obituaries in The New York Times. Obituaries in The New York Times give account of the lives of the people around us — what they accomplished and how they lived — and reading them can be an exercise in discovering, or rediscovering, the marvelous things they created. Here is a sampling of obituaries from recent weeks showcasing the legacies of creative people. Bill Ray was there when Pvt. Elvis Presley blew kisses to fans before shipping out. He was there when Jacqueline Kennedy married the billionaire shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis. And he was at Madison Square Garden when a movie star sang “Happy Birthday” to a president. Mr. Ray was one of the last surviving photographers who had made their names at Life magazine, which provided a photographic chronicle of its times. Read his obituary here If the 1960s had a look, Wes Wilson had a hand in it. He designed psychedelic-tinged concert posters using wild colors, swirling lettering and vibrant images that helped give a visual imprint to an era. Read his obituary here When the Simon & Schuster publishing house asked staff members in 2014 to vote on their 90 favorite books issued by the company over the past 90 years, nearly one-third of the winners had been edited by one person: Alice Mayhew. She left behind a slew of nonfiction political page-turners. Read her obituary here Peter Serkin was born to musical royalty, but as a young man in the 1960s he rebelled against his aristocratic past and many of the conventions of classical music. Before he went on a soul-searching hiatus, however, he released an exemplary recording of Bach’s “Goldberg” variations, at age 18, that some critics compared favorably to Glenn Gould’s storied version. Read his obituary here Del Pitt Feldman turned the seemingly mundane medium of crocheting into something hip and fashionable, designing crocheted garments and selling them out of her East Village store, which became popular with counterculture personages and mainstream celebrities. Read her obituary here Emily Mason was an abstract painter who compared painting to playing chess: “Pick it up, make a move, wait, let time go in between,” she said. “Then I know what to do.” One critic described her works as “pools of colors crashing into each other.” Read her obituary here Jason Polan was a Don Quixote of the city streets, an artist who tilted at the windmill of sketching every single person in New York City. He published a book with more than 30,000 such drawings. He had other projects, too, like drawing every item on display at the Museum of Modern Art, meeting regularly with drawing mavens at a Taco Bell, and depicting random “Things I Saw” for The New York Times. Read his obituary here Margo Lion was an independent producer who put her own money into shows and worked to rustle up funds from other investors to get a show mounted. She was a major force in bringing “Jelly’s Last Jam” and “Hairspray” to Broadway. Read her obituary here",The New York Times

2020,What We Know About the Sarah Lawrence Trafficking Case,"New York Today [Want to get New York Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.] It’s Thursday. Weather: Early rain will diminish during the day, with a high around 50. Alternate-side parking: In effect until Monday (Presidents’ Day). It began when a man recently released from prison decided to move into his daughter’s dorm room at an elite college in a New York City suburb. It would turn into a bizarre tale that would end up with the man being arrested on Tuesday and charged with extortion, prostitution and other counts. At Sarah Lawrence College in Yonkers, prosecutors say, the man, Lawrence V. Ray, started doing “therapy sessions” with his daughter’s roommates soon after moving into the dorm room in 2010. As time passed, Mr. Ray had so much control over the young adults that he got them to confess to crimes they did not commit, prosecutors said. He also extorted hundreds of thousands of dollars from them, made them work without pay and in one case forced a young woman into prostitution, federal prosecutors said. [A Sarah Lawrence College parent is accused of sex trafficking and abusing students.] Prosecutors in Manhattan charged Mr. Ray, 60, with conspiracy, extortion, sex trafficking, forced labor and related offenses. Yesterday, prosecutors revealed more of the evidence they had against Mr. Ray, including a collection of cellphone videos — some of which were sexually explicit — journals, financial records and interviews with 17 witnesses. At the hearing, Mr. Ray pleaded not guilty to all charges. The investigation that led to Mr. Ray’s charges was prompted by a New York magazine article published in April. Here’s what you need to know about the case. In his time at Sarah Lawrence, Mr. Ray acted like a cult leader who exploited his victims — college sophomores at the time — by alienating them from their parents and convincing them that they were “broken and in need of fixing,” the authorities said. At the college, Mr. Ray “laid the groundwork for psychological conditioning that would eventually lead these young adults to become unwitting victims of sexual exploitation, verbal and physical abuse, extortion, forced labor and prostitution,” William F. Sweeney Jr., the head of the F.B.I.’s office in New York, said at a news conference on Tuesday. After Mr. Ray moved out of the dorm, the abuse continued for eight years, the indictment said. In the summer of 2011, according to the indictment, Mr. Ray kept exploiting a group of the students who had moved in with him at a one-bedroom apartment on Manhattan’s Upper East Side. He would question his daughter’s friends during interrogation sessions that lasted for hours and often escalated into verbal and physical abuse, the indictment said. He also forced his victims to work for him, according to the indictment. Around 2013, Mr. Ray took some of his victims to Pinehurst, N.C., where he forced them to do manual labor on his family’s property to repay money he said they owed him. From 2014 to 2018, he took more than $500,000 from the young woman he forced to work as a prostitute, prosecutors said. Mr. Ray used tactics like sleep deprivation, psychological and sexual humiliation, physical violence and threats of legal action to get his victims to make false confessions, the indictment said. It also accused him of laundering about $1 million he obtained from his victims. Mr. Ray, who was arrested on Tuesday at his home in Piscataway, N.J., has a strange history with mob figures and top law enforcement and military officials. He was once a close associate of a former New York City police commissioner, Bernard B. Kerik. Mr. Ray was Mr. Kerik’s best man at his wedding. Later, Mr. Kerik helped Mr. Ray get a job with a construction company. The two had a falling-out in 2000 when Mr. Ray began cooperating with prosecutors who were investigating Mr. Kerik as a result of work done by the construction company at Mr. Kerik’s home in the Bronx. In 1997, Mr. Ray arranged a City Hall meeting between then-Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Mikhail Gorbachev, the former Soviet Union leader. In the late 1990s, Mr. Ray was an F.B.I. informant for an investigation into a securities fraud scheme involving the mob. But he and more than a dozen other men were indicted and charged with having been involved in the scheme. He then served time in a New Jersey state prison on charges related to a child custody dispute. It was after serving this sentence that Mr. Ray moved into his daughter’s dormitory in late 2010, the authorities said. Yesterday, Sarah Lawrence’s president, Cristle Collins Judd, said in a statement that the college was not aware of Mr. Ray’s presence on campus. “What we do know is that no reports about this parent’s presence on campus during that semester, formal or informal, were lodged by students sharing that small living space, by their student neighbors, or by anyone else,” she said. Students at the college said they had been aware of the New York magazine article from last year. Several said they felt relieved that Mr. Ray had been arrested. But some said they were concerned that he had managed to hide his behavior for so long. “It’s pretty shocking that it’s taken 10 years to get this guy charged,” said Wyatt Button, 20, a sophomore studying film.

I found what seemed to be the perfect parking spot near a corner. Backing up, I realized that the space was actually a little tight for my minivan. But I was determined. I pulled forward and then backed into the spot with my arm deftly turning the wheel. Coming to a stop, I realized I didn’t need to pull forward. I had just parallel parked perfectly, but I was alone and no one was there to see it. Or so I thought. When I stepped onto the sidewalk, a group of people sitting at outdoor tables on the opposite corner stood up and gave me a standing ovation. It made my night. Two men came running over. They told me they were about to bet on whether I could make it into the space, but I had pulled in so quickly that they hadn’t completed the wager. One of the men said that he was glad. He would have lost the bet because he never thought I would make it. It made my year. — Dana E. Friedman New York Today is published weekdays around 6 a.m. Sign up here to get it by email.

2020,What We Learned in Kansas City’s Super Bowl Victory,"The Chiefs mounted their third double-digit comeback of the postseason, overwhelming the 49ers and ending a 50-year championship drought. MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. — The Kansas City Chiefs stormed back for a ridiculous 31-20 win over the San Francisco 49ers in the Super Bowl, reeling off three touchdowns in just over five minutes to overwhelm one of the N.F.L.’s most dominant defenses. The win snapped a 50-year championship drought for the Chiefs, while handing San Francisco its second Super Bowl loss since the team last won one following the 1994 season. Here’s what we learned from the game: Andy Reid had to give up a title to get a title. The Chiefs head coach entered Sunday as the winningest coach in N.F.L. history to have never won a Super Bowl. With his 222nd win (including the postseason), he officially passed off that title, giving it back to Marty Schottenheimer, whose 205 wins came largely with the Chiefs. Age is just a number. Patrick Mahomes was the youngest player to win the N.F.L.’s Most Valuable Player Award when he took it home last season at 23. He is the youngest quarterback to be named Super Bowl M.V.P., winning it at 24. He does not have many more major awards to win, so he will have to set his sights on being the N.F.L.’s youngest Man of the Year, or its youngest Hall of Famer. If the Chiefs are losing, they are probably winning. Kansas City must have thought winning during the regular season was too easy, because the team turned the difficulty way up in the postseason, reeling off three consecutive victories in which it got down by at least 10 points — setting an N.F.L. record for postseason comebacks. The Chiefs trailed the Houston Texans by 24 points in the divisional round, the Tennessee Titans by 10 points in the A.F.C. championship game, and were down 10 points to San Francisco with less than seven minutes left in the fourth quarter. “We’re something special,” said wide receiver Tyreek Hill. Speed kills (eventually). The 49ers defense had limited the Chiefs offense to mostly a series of dinks and dunks, which appeared to have Kansas City on its heels for a third-and-15 play with 7:13 left in the game. Mahomes stayed cool in the pocket despite pressure by DeForest Buckner, as Hill raced his way into an open area. Mahomes then launched an absolute bomb, finding Hill for a game-changing 44-yard reception. According to the N.F.L.’s NextGen Stats, the pass traveled 57.1 yards in the air, which was Mahomes’s longest completion by air yardage this season. Kyle Shanahan does not like fourth quarters. Shanahan, the 49ers coach, talked all week about the “scars” he had from the Super Bowl following the 2016 season. He was an offensive coordinator when his Atlanta Falcons blew a 28-3 fourth-quarter lead to the New England Patriots. Shanahan watched yet another transcendent quarterback deliver a career-defining performance as his own offense fell apart. He was asked if he had felt comfortable when his team led by 20-10. “No,” he said. “You never feel good until the game is over.” Deebo Samuel picked the wrong day to set a record. The 49ers rookie set a record for wide receivers with 53 yards rushing in a Super Bowl, topping the previous mark of 45 by Percy Harvin of the Seattle Seahawks set in the Super Bowl following the 2014 season. Samuel, Raheem Mostert and Tevin Coleman helped San Francisco generate 6.4 yards a carry, which was a huge reason for the lead, but they were a non-factor on the team’s final four drives, which resulted in a combined total of 49 yards with two punts, a turnover on downs and an interception. Damien Williams picked a great day to shine. The Chiefs running back was largely written off in the buildup to the game. Mahomes led the team in rushing in both of Kansas City’s playoff wins and the Chiefs preferred to pass. For much of this game, Williams was the only thing working for Kansas City. He finished with a team-leading 133 yards from scrimmage, putting the Chiefs ahead with a 5-yard touchdown reception and sealing the victory with a 38-yard touchdown run. As compiled by the Elias Sports Bureau.

I wanted to bring it home, the one that has our founder’s name on it. I wanted to bring it to this family and this organization. And the second most important thing was to get Coach Reid a Super Bowl trophy.” — Patrick Mahomes, Chiefs quarterback “I hate losing. I hate losing, period. It’s going to sting for a while, but I’m going to have to put it behind me and get ready for next year.” — Kwon Alexander, 49ers linebacker “We’re like Golden State in their prime, baby. We do what it do. Sack Nation.” — Chris Jones, Chiefs defensive tackle, comparing his team’s defensive line to the Stephen Curry-led Warriors “We’ll lick our wounds and we’ll get over this.

2020,Opinion | What We Still Don’t Get About George Washington,"There continue to be ways to look with fresh eyes at our founding-est founding father. Ms. Coe is the author of “You Never Forget Your First: A Biography of George Washington.” Years into writing a book on George Washington, I noticed something curious about my collection of the popular biographies already written about our first president: All of them were written by white men. I’d gotten used to a certain male skew, but I hadn’t quite realized how persistent it was until I ran my observation by experts at Mount Vernon, Washington’s historic home, and the University of Virginia’s George Washington papers: No woman had written a biography of George Washington for adults in more than 40 years, and no woman trained as a historian had written one in far longer. For nearly two and a half centuries, most of the stories Americans have told themselves about their country’s past have been by and for white men — and it shows, particularly when it comes to presidential history. When female historians have managed to elbow their way in, however, they often remind us that we don’t always know what we think we know. My own preoccupation with Washington began with an attempt to read between the lines of his major biographies. All of his biographers are obsessed with his body; Ron Chernow’s “Washington: A Life,” to take just one example, sometimes reads like a romance novel: Washington, Mr. Chernow writes, was “powerfully rough-hewn and endowed with matchless strength. When he clenched his jaw, his cheek and jaw muscles seemed to ripple right through his skin.” After a while, I began to wonder: Why did Washington’s biographers spend so much time on something that did so little to break the first president out of his marble mold — their own stated intention? And if they focused so much on this, had their Great Man worship influenced their interpretation of other aspects of the life of our founding-est founding father? When I dug into the primary sources, I found myself immediately vexed. Lawrence Washington, the president’s half-brother, is always presented as his god, for example, and Mary, his mother, as his scourge. Lawrence, according to Mr. Chernow, “concocted a plan to spring fourteen-year-old George from his mother’s domination and launch him on a promising career in the Royal Navy.” She doesn’t consent, and Mr. Chernow’s takeaway is that “she seemed to measure her son’s worth not by what he might accomplish elsewhere but by what he could do for her, even if it meant thwarting his career.” It’s a strange read. Lawrence’s own letters home from service had been harrowing, and Lawrence was an officer. George would be a midshipman, a low-ranking position. About a third of recruits around his age did not survive their first two years. Mary’s refusal set him on a better, safer path: By age 17, George, who loved the outdoors and was good at math, was the youngest surveyor in Culpeper County, and by age 18, he owned thousands of acres of land. The same thing happened when I looked into his final act. The way his biographers tell it, you’d think that George Washington, who held hundreds of people enslaved at the time of his death, had a change of heart during the Revolution, which led him to free his slaves in his will — a generous read that allows for a redemptive conclusion. It’s true that the Marquis de Lafayette, a French aristocrat Washington met during the Revolution, spent the rest of his life proposing various ways Washington could free his slaves during his lifetime, setting a powerful example for the infant nation. Instead, Washington freed one man, Billy Lee, upon his death. The 123 other people had to wait until Martha Washington either died or chose to free them — which they were aware of, because Washington’s will was published. Martha, who wrote things like “Blacks are so bad in thair nature that they have not the least Gratatude for the kindness that may be shewed to them,” was terrified, and she signed a deed of manumission a year later. Washington’s story — all of it, in its entirety — is full of victory and triumph, inhumanity and catastrophe, often on a grand scale. During the Civil War, Confederate and Union soldiers carved their initials into the walls of the vault he was buried in. Both sides, the South and the North, the slave-owning and the free, viewed him as their inspiration. And both were right. They were just starting to learn his story, and in some ways, more than 100 years later, so are we. Since 2014, the woods near Washington’s vault have been undergoing excavation. In these woods sits a cemetery for the people he enslaved, full of unmarked graves. The area is never mentioned in the thousands of documents Washington left behind, which he protected and readied to be studied. There’s always new information to discover and share, whether it’s found in accepted texts or archives, or well outside of them. That’s how a legacy, like a democracy, avoids corruption and decay.

2020,"Opinion | What We, the Taliban, Want","I am convinced that the killing and the maiming must stop, the deputy leader of the Taliban writes. Mr. Haqqani is the deputy leader of the Taliban. When our representatives started negotiating with the United States in 2018, our confidence that the talks would yield results was close to zero. We did not trust American intentions after 18 years of war and several previous attempts at negotiation that had proved futile. Nevertheless, we decided to try once more. The long war has exacted a terrible cost from everyone. We thought it unwise to dismiss any potential opportunity for peace no matter how meager the prospects of its success. For more than four decades, precious Afghan lives have been lost every day. Everyone has lost somebody they loved. Everyone is tired of war. I am convinced that the killing and the maiming must stop. We did not choose our war with the foreign coalition led by the United States. We were forced to defend ourselves. The withdrawal of foreign forces has been our first and foremost demand. That we today stand at the threshold of a peace agreement with the United States is no small milestone. Our negotiation team, led by my colleagues Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar and Sher Mohammed Abas Stanekzai, has worked tirelessly for the past 18 months with the American negotiators to make an agreement possible. We stuck with the talks despite recurring disquiet and upset within our ranks over the intensified bombing campaign against our villages by the United States and the flip-flopping and ever-moving goal posts of the American side. Even when President Trump called off the talks, we kept the door to peace open because we Afghans suffer the most from the continuation of the war. No peace agreement, following on the heels of such intensive talks, comes without mutual compromises. That we stuck with such turbulent talks with the enemy we have fought bitterly for two decades, even as death rained from the sky, testifies to our commitment to ending the hostilities and bringing peace to our country. We are aware of the concerns and questions in and outside Afghanistan about the kind of government we would have after the foreign troops withdraw. My response to such concerns is that it will depend on a consensus among Afghans. We should not let our worries get in the way of a process of genuine discussion and deliberation free for the first time from foreign domination and interference. It is important that no one front-loads this process with predetermined outcomes and preconditions. We are committed to working with other parties in a consultative manner of genuine respect to agree on a new, inclusive political system in which the voice of every Afghan is reflected and where no Afghan feels excluded. I am confident that, liberated from foreign domination and interference, we together will find a way to build an Islamic system in which all Afghans have equal rights, where the rights of women that are granted by Islam — from the right to education to the right to work — are protected, and where merit is the basis for equal opportunity. We are also aware of concerns about the potential of Afghanistan being used by disruptive groups to threaten regional and world security. But these concerns are inflated: Reports about foreign groups in Afghanistan are politically motivated exaggerations by the warmongering players on all sides of the war. It is not in the interest of any Afghan to allow such groups to hijack our country and turn it into a battleground. We have already suffered enough from foreign interventions. We will take all measures in partnership with other Afghans to make sure the new Afghanistan is a bastion of stability and that nobody feels threatened on our soil. We are conscious of the immense challenges ahead. Perhaps our biggest challenge is to ensure that various Afghan groups work hard and sincerely toward defining our common future. I am confident that it is possible. If we can reach an agreement with a foreign enemy, we must be able to resolve intra-Afghan disagreements through talks. Another challenge will be keeping the international community interested and positively engaged during the transition to peace and after the withdrawal of foreign troops. The support of the international community will be crucial to stabilizing and developing Afghanistan. We are ready to work on the basis of mutual respect with our international partners on long-term peace-building and reconstruction. After the United States withdraws its troops, it can play a constructive role in the postwar development and reconstruction of Afghanistan. We acknowledge the importance of maintaining friendly relations with all countries and take their concerns seriously. Afghanistan cannot afford to live in isolation. The new Afghanistan will be a responsible member of the international community. We will remain committed to all international conventions as long as they are compatible with Islamic principles. And we expect other countries to respect the sovereignty and stability of our country and consider it as a ground for cooperation rather than competition and conflict. More immediately, there will be the challenge of putting into effect our agreement with the United States. A degree of trust has been built through our talks with the American negotiators in Doha, Qatar, but just as the United States does not trust us completely, we too are very far from fully trusting it. We are about to sign an agreement with the United States and we are fully committed to carrying out its every single provision, in letter and spirit. Achieving the potential of the agreement, ensuring its success and earning lasting peace will depend on an equally scrupulous observance by the United States of each of its commitments. Only then can we have complete trust and lay the foundation for cooperation — or even a partnership — in the future. My fellow Afghans will soon celebrate this historic agreement. Once it is entirely fulfilled, Afghans will see the departure of all foreign troops. As we arrive at this milestone, I believe it is not a distant dream that we will soon see the day when we will come together with all our Afghan brothers and sisters, start moving toward lasting peace and lay the foundation of a new Afghanistan. We would then celebrate a new beginning that invites all our compatriots to return from their exile to our country — to our shared home where everybody would have the right to live with dignity, in peace.

2020,Joe Biden in Iowa: What Went Wrong in the Caucuses,"His placement behind his leading rivals in the caucuses on Monday dealt a damaging blow to his campaign. Some party officials say it was a long time in the works. DES MOINES — Maybe it was the threat of bad weather. Maybe it was a seating assignment debacle. Maybe it was a struggling campaign organization that still hadn’t found its footing. But as Joseph R. Biden Jr. spoke at a major Iowa Democratic Party dinner in November, one thing was clear: His support appeared tepid compared with the vocal cheering sections of top rivals. The reception angered Mr. Biden and his top aides — and it left little doubt about his standing, three months before the nominating process in the Democratic presidential race would begin: The former vice president was in deep trouble in Iowa. Two days after the dinner, Mr. Biden ripped into his campaign chairman, Steve Ricchetti, according to a person familiar with the conversation. And at the Biden headquarters in Philadelphia, senior officials sternly told staff members they needed to step up their performance. The dinner’s damaging optics marked the beginning of a flurry of changes: Trusted aides were deployed to Iowa sooner than anticipated. Mr. Biden rescheduled time with donors to make space for a bus tour in Iowa. Former Gov. Tom Vilsack of Iowa and his wife, Christie Vilsack, major players in Iowa Democratic politics, announced their Biden endorsements. It was too late. Mr. Biden’s performance in the Iowa caucuses on Monday dealt a damaging blow to the former vice president; with well over 90 percent of the results counted by Wednesday night, he trailed Pete Buttigieg and Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, with Senator Amy Klobuchar not far behind. “I am not going to sugarcoat it,” Mr. Biden said Wednesday as he campaigned in New Hampshire. “We took a gut punch in Iowa.” Certainly over the past year, Mr. Biden has proved far more resilient than many expected. He has led national polls for months despite verbal gaffes, scrutiny of his long and sometimes controversial record in Washington, and a relentless assault from Republicans over his son’s dealings in Ukraine. The slow drip of vote totals in Iowa — and a swirl of other major news events — may blunt the attention on Mr. Biden’s challenges. And Iowa is an overwhelmingly white state, while Mr. Biden’s biggest political strength is with black voters, whom he is counting on for support in later-voting, more diverse states. But he now faces jittery donors, an uncertain landscape in upcoming Democratic contests and a sharp challenge to the central argument of his campaign message: that he is the party’s strongest candidate to win a general election. Interviews with more than a dozen advisers, allies and Iowa strategists show that Mr. Biden was late in focusing on Iowa, put together an organization there that fell well short of his top rivals’ and that his core pitch about electability and experience wasn’t enough to persuade voters who wanted a fresh face or more boldly progressive ideas. Mr. Biden was also a less-than-inspiring presence on the trail, according to some voters, struggling at times in the homestretch to deliver crisp, energetic, on-message performances. When Mr. Biden announced his candidacy on April 25, some of his chief rivals had already been running for months. His late start had long-lasting consequences, according to some of his supporters. “He could have been here sooner and more aggressively,” said Mr. Vilsack, who became Mr. Biden’s top surrogate in the state. “Because this is all about relationships.” “It was frustrating that they weren’t seeming to reach more people,” added Susan Judkins, a member of the Clive City Council. “Some of the other campaigns had been getting momentum. They had hired staffers who are known to Iowans, who had an ability to influence.” When he did get to the state over the summer and into the fall, Mr. Biden’s team produced carefully managed events. He traveled with a phalanx of staff, sometimes used teleprompters and typically spoke from behind rope lines. None of that prevented a spree of verbal stumbles in Iowa in August — but according to some of his allies, it did keep Mr. Biden from showing off his biggest strength: his retail politicking skills. “I’ve had that conversation at least since the end of May, beginning part of the summer, that Joe would do better and has always done better meeting with people,” said State Representative Bruce Hunter, a staunch Biden ally who said he made that case to Mr. Biden’s state campaign leadership. “He needed to get out more, talk to smaller groups of people, listen to them, give his vision one-on-one to people.” Yet no amount of glad-handing could remedy an organization that even his supporters here found frustrating. “His campaign is not a good campaign,” Roxanna Moritz, the Scott County auditor and a Biden supporter, said late last month. “They’re not embedding loyalty to the organization, he doesn’t do groundwork.” She said that the campaign was “not returning phone calls, no follow through.” “It’s kind of sad because I really do think he is the right person,” she added. By the fall, Mr. Biden’s advisers felt that their campaign organization in Iowa had steadied — but events in Washington took him down a detour that no one could have foreseen, or prevented. On Sept. 21, more than 1,000 Biden supporters assembled at the Polk County Steak Fry, featuring the kind of chummy interaction in which Mr. Biden is at his best. But their efforts were overshadowed by news that President Trump had asked Ukraine to investigate Mr. Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, a story that would consume the campaign for months. That night, a Des Moines Register poll revealed that Mr. Biden had slipped from first place in Iowa, overtaken by Ms. Warren of Massachusetts. Mr. Biden spent the next weeks grappling with the best way to respond to the Ukraine controversy. And party officials continued to describe his Iowa organization as scattershot, an issue thrown into sharp relief at the party dinner in November, the Liberty and Justice Celebration. Mr. Biden’s team said that it had around 1,200 people in the arena, many of whom went on to become precinct captains and dedicated volunteers. But the empty seats and the smaller and less boisterous Biden sections spread throughout the arena cut a sharp contrast with the loud, unified crowds of Ms. Warren and Mr. Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., in a major test of organizational strength. More damaging than the evident differences in crowd strength was what many Iowa Democrats were seeing for the first time in person: a once-fiery candidate who was looking his age compared with a number of his younger rivals. Mr. Biden’s campaign could do little to alter the presentation of a candidate who was given to meandering into verbal cul-de-sacs even in his prime. But they concluded that they needed to better display Mr. Biden’s strong interpersonal skills, and to connect with more moderate voters who live in rural areas. Mr. Vilsack, the former governor, had long advocated that approach, joining with his wife to advise their old friend to spend time in small towns during a private conversation last spring. After spending months meeting with candidates, the Vilsacks — who supported Mr. Biden in his first presidential campaign, in 1987 — informed Mr. Biden in a phone call that they would endorse him, impressed with his rural policy proposal, his empathy and his “capacity to take a punch.” Behind the scenes, they offered the campaign leadership two major pieces of advice. “One, you need to be out there in all parts of the state,” Mr. Vilsack said. “And two, you need to spend time with voters in a way that they will get to know you.” After Thanksgiving, the Vilsacks joined Mr. Biden on a bus trip, called the “No Malarkey” tour, across rural parts of the state where the Biden campaign saw chances to accrue delegates. The trip revealed strategic openings for the campaign, officials said. They spotted an opportunity with Latino voters in Storm Lake and were reminded to accentuate Mr. Biden’s advantage with Catholics in Dubuque. The problem: Those lessons were arriving with just weeks to capitalize on them. Other candidates had already spent many months trying to win over the state’s Democratic caucusgoers. “Had he done the ‘No Malarkey’ tour in the summertime, you may never have seen that Elizabeth Warren bounce,” said Representative Ami Bera, Democrat of California, who supports Mr. Biden. Jesse Harris, a senior Biden Iowa adviser, said the timing was designed to coincide with when caucusgoers intensified their focus on the race. “The vice president did spend quite a bit of time in the state,” he said. “Obviously, he got into the race a bit later than the other candidates, so two or three months behind when he first visited the state compared to others. But we were actively here in Iowa.” “The bus tour,” he added, “was a very visible extension of what we were already doing.” As 2020 arrived, there were some encouraging developments, building on what the campaign saw as post-bus tour momentum. On Jan. 2, Representative Abby Finkenauer, a Democrat who in 2018 had flipped an eastern Iowa district, endorsed Mr. Biden, signaling that candidates in the toughest races believed Mr. Biden was their safest bet at the top of the ticket. Representative Cindy Axne, a Democrat from another competitive Iowa district, later followed suit. And tensions with Iran propelled national security matters into the spotlight, playing into Mr. Biden’s message of experience. Yet even as he continued to land high-profile endorsements, Mr. Sanders of Vermont was on the rise, expanding his progressive support and seeking to cut into Mr. Biden’s base of blue-collar workers by attacking his record on Social Security, pointing out that he had occasionally entertained freezes to the program. The specter of a possible conflict with Iran allowed Mr. Sanders to continually remind voters that Mr. Biden had approved the use of force in Iraq. A New York Times/Siena College poll released late last month found that even in eastern Iowa — home to many white working-class voters with whom Mr. Biden expected to be strong — he was struggling. Ahead of the 2016 campaign, David Plouffe, Barack Obama’s former campaign manager, had warned Mr. Biden, according to an article in The Atlantic, “Do you really want it to end in a hotel room in Des Moines, coming in third to Bernie Sanders?” In the final weeks before the 2020 Iowa caucuses, Mr. Plouffe’s warning was starting to sound prescient. Recognizing the need to win new supporters, Mr. Biden’s Iowa director, Jake Braun, floated a deal over dinner in Des Moines with an adviser to Ms. Klobuchar of Minnesota. The two moderate Democrats should form an alliance, Mr. Braun suggested a week before the vote, and urge their supporters to back the other if one of them did not advance to the final round in a precinct. Ms. Klobuchar’s camp quickly shot down the prospect when the story leaked, and Mr. Braun, who had already been marginalized by Mr. Biden’s national campaign, found himself isolated by his enraged superiors, who had warned him not to freelance, according to a person familiar with internal discussions. Sue Dvorsky, a former Iowa Democratic chair, had backed Senator Kamala Harris of California. After Ms. Harris dropped out, Ms. Dvorsky said she was inclined to support Mr. Biden, whom she and her husband had met when he ran for president in 1987. But Ms. Dvorsky was appalled at the state of Mr. Biden’s organization, which was lacking precinct captains even in her own heavily Democratic community. Last week she endorsed Ms. Warren. “This has been a sloppy effort that was always aimed at a general election,” she said of Mr. Biden’s organization, deeming it worse than his first two Iowa campaigns. “Right now, they’re bringing in hundreds of people from out of state — not to be canvassers but to be precinct captains.” Even some of Mr. Biden’s high-profile supporters were perplexed by the campaign’s choices, which included dispatching a number of his former Senate colleagues, all of them white men over 70, to stump for him in the Iowa campaign’s final days. On the Saturday before the caucuses, Ms. Judkins had an uneasy feeling about the decision her state was about to make. She had spent the day knocking on doors with a host of prominent Biden supporters from across the country. She came away impressed by what her colleagues had told her — that Mr. Biden had more support and organizational strength in later-voting states. She wished they had come to Iowa sooner. “I said to my husband, ‘I feel like all of these people from around the country are coming in to try to save us from ourselves,’” she said when they went out that evening. “Here we are, going out dancing. Kind of like the Titanic, the ship going down.” Updated Feb. 29, 2020",The New York Times
2020,Opinion | What Will Finally Defeat Donald Trump?,"He can do whatever it takes to win re-election, and the Republican Party will have his back. The editorial board is a group of opinion journalists whose views are informed by expertise, research, debate and certain longstanding values. It is separate from the newsroom. On Tuesday night, President Trump delivered the most harshly partisan State of the Union speech in memory. He was not wrong about everything, as when he boasted about the overall strength of the economy or praised the selflessness of American troops. But when he was wrong, as he often was, he was poisonously wrong. He grotesquely caricatured the criminality of undocumented immigrants, rewrote the history of his assaults on Americans’ health care and drastically inflated the number of jobs expected to be created by the new trade bill. Worse than the distortions and deceptions, which Americans have come to expect from this president, Mr. Trump hijacked the House chamber, turning what should be a unifying moment, or at least an attempt at a unifying moment, into a campaign rally, corrupting the role presidents have played there as representing the whole nation. Republicans put the Senate chamber to similarly political use on Wednesday. With the lonely exception of Mitt Romney, who voted to convict Mr. Trump of abuse of power, all Republican senators voted to acquit Mr. Trump of extorting a foreign government in an effort to rig the 2020 election, and then obstructing Congress’s efforts to investigate him — the charges contained in the two articles of impeachment approved by the House of Representatives in December. By the end, many Republicans had conceded that Mr. Trump did the things he was accused of. Some agreed that they were “improper,” “inappropriate” or even “wrong.” Yet rather than try to get to the bottom of his behavior, they joined the White House in covering up as much about it as they could. Reasonable Americans may have concluded — after a full airing of the documents the White House has bottled up, of the witnesses it has smothered — that removal from office was too extreme a punishment. But the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, turned out to have too little regard for Mr. Trump’s ethics, or for the American people’s sense of justice, or perhaps both, to take that chance. Under Mr. McConnell’s guidance, the impeachment trial in the Senate was a joke at the Constitution’s expense. Anyone hoping for a demonstration of responsible governance or the vindication of the separation of powers could only be dismayed. It did illustrate, however, how beholden Republicans are to Mr. Trump and his destructive approach to leadership. In that sense, the trial provided an important service to Americans, clarifying the stakes in the coming election. Against all evidence to the contrary, some Republicans claim Mr. Trump has been chastened by his impeachment. He will be “much more cautious,” said Senator Susan Collins, adding that she hopes the president has “learned from this.” Indeed he has, but not the lessons that Ms. Collins seemed to think. Listen to Rudy Giuliani, the president’s personal lawyer and Ukraine whisperer. “Absolutely; 100 percent,” Mr. Giuliani told NPR when asked whether Mr. Trump would continue to push for more foreign “investigations” into Joe Biden, a Democratic front-runner. “I would have no problem with him doing it. In fact, I’d have a problem with him not doing it.” Even before the acquittal, the State of the Union address made clear that Mr. Trump — enabled, as in his business life, by his exceptional shamelessness — intends to deploy every power available to a president in pursuit of his re-election. If there remained any doubts on that score, they were dispelled when Melania Trump hung the Presidential Medal of Freedom around Rush Limbaugh’s neck. The speech also demonstrated that Mr. Trump, unlike the Democratic Party, has a simple, powerful message: In three short years, he has brought America back from the disaster he claimed it was in and set it on a path to a glorious new future. From the “American carnage” he spoke of in his Inaugural Address, now, “America’s future is blazing bright.” Given the dishonesty, if not downright absurdity, of some passages in the speech, it was perhaps a human reaction on the part of the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, to tear it to shreds. It was still disappointing to see her stoop to the kind of stunt the president himself would pull, and, as she certainly knows as well as anyone, a gesture like that won’t defeat the president’s argument. So what will? Not the incoherent, if not to say chaotic, display the Democratic Party has mustered to date. A series of overcrowded debates has failed to clarify the choices confronting voters. The decision to stage the first vote in monochromatic Iowa was a bad idea even before the Iowa Democratic Party had a meltdown on live television. A recent poll found that 45 percent of the supporters of the leading progressive candidate, Senator Bernie Sanders, said they weren’t sure they’d vote for any other Democratic nominee. Meanwhile, over in the party’s centrist camp, Michael Bloomberg appears to be trying to buy the nomination. Given the stakes, anxiety is rightly running high. Yes, the Democratic voters can and should narrow the field over the next several weeks. But the fact that they’ll eventually pick a nominee isn’t enough. It matters how they get there. The 2016 election is a cautionary tale — too many Democrats felt so little allegiance to the nominee that they chose to vote for a third-party candidate, or not to vote at all. The task ahead for party leaders is ensuring that voters appreciate that the best chance to beat Mr. Trump is a unity of effort from political tribes that share far more in common than what divides them. That’s important, because the November election is a critical opportunity to defend the Republic through the straightforward expedient of voting Mr. Trump from office and thereby issuing an essential rebuke to the leaders of today’s Republican Party. Republican officials in Washington and across the country have for years refused to acknowledge the legitimacy of political opponents, and have thus justified taking any and all measures to keep them out of power, or to nullify their power when they hold it. The G.O.P.’s internal corrosion also made it ripe for takeover by an authoritarian like Mr. Trump, under whom it is morphing into a cult of personality. Don’t take it from us; take it from conscientious conservatives and former Republicans, including top advisers to the last two Republican presidential nominees before Mr. Trump. Take it from Joe Walsh, the former representative from Illinois and conservative radio talk-show host who is running in the Republican primary. On Twitter, Mr. Walsh described telling a crowd of thousands of Iowa Republicans that Americans deserve a president who is decent, who tells the truth and who doesn’t care only about himself. The crowd booed. But the clearest measure of how far the Republican Party has strayed from good governance may be Mr. Romney’s explanation for his vote — the first time in history that a senator has voted to convict a president of his own party. Mr. Trump’s behavior in relation to Ukraine “was a flagrant assault on our electoral rights, our national security, and our fundamental values,” Mr. Romney said Wednesday on the Senate floor. “Corrupting an election to keep oneself in office is perhaps the most abusive and destructive violation of one’s oath of office that I can imagine.” Given these facts, sticking with the other Republicans and voting to acquit “would, I fear, expose my character to history’s rebuke and the censure of my own conscience.” Just eight years ago, Mr. Romney was the Republican nominee for president; today, his vote will cast him as a pariah. This election is about more, of course, than restoring sanity to the Republican Party, essential as that is. Mr. Trump’s speech was a fantasy. America is not thriving under his leadership. Far from “stronger than ever before,” the union is faltering under his divisive, corrupting politics. The chants of “four more years” that resounded from only one side of the House chamber on Tuesday night should ring as an alarm for all Americans who want their children to live in an even greater nation.

2020,Opinion | What Will the Next Decade Bring? The 1920s Offer an Answer,"It has been a long time since the winter of 1920, but the old fault lines are still visible. Dr. Widmer is a distinguished lecturer at Macaulay Honors College, City University of New York. A year ago, The Times introduced a series of essays about the transformative year 1919, beginning with F. Scott Fitzgerald’s observation, in his essay “The Crack-Up,” that a first-rate intelligence could hold two opposed ideas at the same time. That seemed a fitting way to assess the United States at a pivotal moment, with half the country rushing headlong into the Jazz Age and the other half trying to turn back the clock toward simpler times. As it turned out, Fitzgerald did not crack up, at least for some time. As the 1920s got underway, the world was his oyster. He became the voice of “a new generation … grown up to find all Gods dead, all wars fought.” But for one of those gods — Fitzgerald’s fellow Princetonian Woodrow Wilson — the world was indeed falling apart as the new decade began. A year earlier, Wilson had been the people’s champion, striving to complete peace talks with Germany and make the world safe for democracy via “self-determination.” But the negotiations had been difficult, and the resulting Treaty of Versailles was an imperfect vehicle, favoring some peoples over others. To make matters worse, Wilson’s own people rejected it, through a series of Senate votes. Even as the League of Nations was coming into existence, in the second week of January, Wilson was clinging to hopes that the Senate might reverse itself. It was not to be, in part because Wilson was no longer the bold leader he once was. The man who had done more than any other to evangelize for the new order was a shell of his former self. He had suffered a series of debilitating strokes during his fall campaign to raise support for the treaty. Afterward, inside the White House, he saw almost no one, barely able to speak, with the left side of his body paralyzed, his mouth slack. He had lost much of his vision and could barely read a sentence. A wheelchair was needed for even the simplest trip from one part of the house to another. A friend, the journalist Ray Stannard Baker, described a visit in late November. “It was dreadful,” he wrote, “a broken, ruined old man, shuffling along, his left arm inert, the fingers drawn up like a claw, the left side of his face sagging frightfully. His voice is not human: it gurgles in his throat, sounds like that of an automaton.” Yet these facts were kept secret from the American people, a form of deception that did not exactly vindicate Wilson’s vision of a new world of “open covenants, openly arrived at.” His wife, Edith, became a gatekeeper to his sickroom, and in effect a co-president during the final 16 months of his presidency. She may have wielded more power than any woman to that point in American history (or since), though that was not the way progress was supposed to happen. If Wilson’s body seemed to be struggling against itself, the same could be said of the country at large, deeply divided as the new decade began. The long year of 1919 had unleashed a tremendous energy, as the doughboys came home and young people began to plot out their futures. But in spite of a universal patriotism, if often felt as if two different versions of America were jousting at each other. In the cities, particularly in the East, the Midwest and the Northwest, Americans embraced modernity. In the South, large sections of the West and rural areas, they resisted it. That created the strange spectacle of a country that was both for racial progress and against it; proud of America’s enlarged role in the world and resentful of it; enlightened on the progress of women and determined to keep women in their place. Even when there were victories — the 19th Amendment, for example, which granted female suffrage — it was usually possible to blunt their impact. Mississippi finally ratified the amendment … in 1984. Nor was The New York Times always on the right side of history. On Jan. 13, 1920, its editors issued a withering critique of the recent experiments in rocketry by Robert Goddard and predicted that it was foolish to think of someday reaching the moon. Fifty years later, after men had done just that, it would retract the error, with one of its all-time most famous corrections. The ’20s began with more of a whimper than a roar, to judge from January’s headlines. Prohibition went into effect on Jan. 17, to the amazement of many, caught flat-footed by such a radical experiment in social control. Wilson’s secretary of the interior, Franklin Lane, complained in his diary, “The whole world is skew-jee, awry, distorted and altogether perverse.” By the end of the decade, the campaign against sin would have achieved none of its goals. Instead, as any reader of Fitzgerald knew, a tidal wave of cocktails was just beginning, along with the criminal syndicates ready to supply them. On Jan. 29, 1920, The New York Times reported that an influenza pandemic seemed to be spreading, only a year after the one that had killed roughly 50 million people around the world. In New York City alone, 5,589 cases were reported in a single day, with 67 dead from influenza and 118 from complications of pneumonia. Fortunately, this virus turned out to be a milder strain than its predecessor. But in other ways, the problems of 1919 lingered. To a degree, these divisions could be papered over as veterans raced to build the American Century, freed from wartime exigencies. Two young men who befriended each other in France were Walt Disney and Ray Kroc. A billion hamburgers later, it’s obvious that something special was in the air as they returned to a country ready to embrace its appetites. As Disney understood, they were ready for new story lines as well. A specific way in which the military rules were relaxed related to the emerging technology of wireless communication. Both sides had quickly learned the effectiveness of radio, and in the United States, the Navy was especially visionary in pursuing new lines of research for ships and submarines seeking to communicate across long distances. But to protect this new domain, the government had restricted amateur activity. (Some historians have speculated that if radio had come along a few months earlier, it might have spared Woodrow Wilson the need to canvass across the country — and perhaps spared his life as well.) As 1920 began, that was all changing. After the restrictions were removed, thousands of amateur radio operators began to tinker at home with new sets, and a new company sprang into existence, ready to harness the wireless. On Jan. 5, The Times announced the creation of the Radio Corporation of America; within a few short years, radio would transform the country. Ironically, it would empower both sides of the cultural divide, from jazz listeners to fundamentalists, the latter quite adept at putting this modern tool to work in the fight against modernity. For a time, the full extent of radio’s power remained unclear, as various pioneers wandered in the ether. A Times headline on Jan. 29 revealed that one of them, Guglielmo Marconi, was picking up strange signals and wondered if Mars was trying to communicate with Earth. In the utopian dawn, a leading American businessman and government official, Herbert Hoover, tried to argue that radio communication should be kept free of advertising, as a kind of public service. In 1922, he said it was “inconceivable that we should allow so great a possibility for service … to be drowned in advertising chatter.” Later that year, the first radio ad ran, sponsored by a real estate developer. As thousands of Americans bought home sets, it became clear that this new device would transform politics as well. A pioneer station in Pittsburgh, KDKA, would be the first to cover a presidential election, in November 1920. Even in the dark days of winter, a hundred years ago, there were stirrings as both Democrats and Republicans schemed to replace the sick man in the White House. Wealthy men like William Randolph Hearst and Henry Ford were said to have their eye on the grand residence, but most of the action was inside party circles, as B-list candidates tried to step up their game. At the beginning of the year, one of the least likely was a Republican senator from Ohio, Warren Harding, who needed to run for higher office because of a strong chance that he would not be re-elected to Congress. Harding’s private life was a mess — he had legions of affairs and had impregnated one of his girlfriends, a young woman named Nan Britton. When her daughter was born in 1919 (confirmed to be Harding’s by DNA testing in 2015), it might have ended most presidential careers. But Harding had a talent for coming up with bland phrases that spoke to the country’s desire to begin a new era, less complicated. One was “normalcy,” an invented word that perfectly encapsulated what many Americans longed for. Another was “America First.” Throughout 1920, this anti-Wilson would rise up as the original wasted away. Still, commentators worried about what it meant to retreat so quickly from the world, with no plan. Harding seemed to have no ideas about anything. One of America’s shrewdest observers was the journalist H.L. Mencken, the so-called Sage of Baltimore. From that city, close to Washington but not of it, Mencken could ridicule both sides of the widening divide, and did, skewering fundamentalists and Eastern eggheads alike. But he worried about the transparent incapacity of a man like Harding. Mencken could be cruel and predicted that if the trend continued of electing candidates with no clear qualification, the White House would soon be “adorned by a complete moron.” As it turned out, “normalcy” meant an administration that would be ruined by scandal and greed, much of it tied to another powerful new force, Big Oil, engorged with money and influence after helping the war effort. But there would always be boats against the current, as Fitzgerald put it; that is the nature of American politics. The excesses of one side inevitably lead to the rise of the other, and back again, with tidal regularity. As the Republican wave was cresting, a young Democrat was trying to position himself as a candidate for higher office, and on Feb. 1, he gave an immodest speech, boasting of his wartime achievements. In fact, they were considerable. Franklin Roosevelt had not served in the war, but as assistant secretary of the Navy, he had been quite close to the development of radio during the war; he would profit from the radio again, later in his career. It has been a long time since the winter of 1920, but the old fault lines are still visible, not only in the United States but around the world. In Turkey, neo-Ottoman ambitions are emerging as the country seeks to enlarge its influence in Libya and everywhere else the sultans once held sway. In Russia, a new czar is all too happy to undermine the West’s quaint belief in Wilsonian self-determination. Should the United States try to solve these and all of the other vexing problems out there? It has become fashionable to denounce Wilson’s idealism in the century since his crack-up. Obviously, he tried too much, too fast and destroyed himself in the process. But to inhabit a world with no ideals of any kind seems like an invitation to a different kind of crack-up and a return to the earlier history that we were delighted to escape from in 1919. In the long century since, Americans faced a dizzying array of problems, new and old. When they worked together, they generally solved them. When they retreated into ideological extremes, they generally did not. In “The Crack-Up,” Fitzgerald diagnosed the problem, then offered a formula. If enough readers could “see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise,” then there was always a chance for a new decade to live up to its glittering potential.

2020,What Would a Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. Mean for Schools?,"Districts have infectious disease protocols. But few have detailed plans to teach online if schools were closed for long periods. Get an informed guide to the global outbreak with our daily Coronavirus
 newsletter.
 Schools in the United States prepare for all manner of disasters and threats, whether hurricanes, mass shooters, tornadoes, influenza or head lice. But this week, a stark new order came from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Get ready for the coronavirus. Around the nation, school officials and parents were flummoxed by the sudden warning that if a coronavirus epidemic hit the United States, school buildings could be shut down for long periods of time, leaving children sequestered at home. In alerting that the coronavirus will almost certainly spread in the United States, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said she had contacted her own local school superintendent this week and asked if the district was prepared. She advised parents to do the same. And she suggested that a temporary system of “internet-based teleschooling” could replace traditional schools. It was not clear how such a system would work. The obstacles to teaching remotely were evident: American children have uneven access to home computers and broadband internet. Schools have limited expertise in providing instruction online on a large scale. And parents would be forced to juggle their own work responsibilities with what could amount to “a vast unplanned experiment in mass home-schooling,” said Kevin Carey, vice president for education policy at New America, a think tank. Across the country, as federal authorities announced that 60 people in the United States had been infected with the virus, mainly from travel abroad, families were grappling with the new alarm raised over the virus and how a possible outbreak could play out in their own communities. In Denver, Meg Conley’s 11-year-old daughter, Margaret, interrupted breakfast on Wednesday morning with a worried question. She told her mother that her elementary school classmates were gripped by fears about the coronavirus, and she asked when it was coming and how many people it would kill. “I had no idea,” Ms. Conley, 35, a freelance writer, said of the children’s anxieties. “Apparently it’s all the kids are talking about on the playground.” Schools are hastily making their own plans, or updating those drafted during previous scares over viruses like H1N1 and Ebola. The Washington State health department held a webinar for about 250 school superintendents on Tuesday to discuss coronavirus preparations, including plans to close schools and allow students to continue to do schoolwork at home. Updated Feb. 29, 2020 Dennis Kosuth, a nurse for Chicago Public Schools, said his district’s ability to handle an outbreak could be compromised by circumstances like families who could not afford child care costs to keep sick children at home. Nursing shortages are a concern, too, he said. Mr. Kosuth said he was responsible for nursing care at four schools. Some Chicago schools also lack rooms dedicated to health needs, Mr. Kosuth said. In one school where many students and staff members became ill with an ordinary infection last semester, “Patient Zero was sitting in the main office coughing and sneezing all over the place” as the sick child waited to be picked up, he said. On a more positive note, Mr. Kosuth said that evidence from China suggested that children were more resilient to the coronavirus than adults were. In Miami-Dade County, Fla., Alberto M. Carvalho, superintendent of one of the nation’s largest school districts, said his system’s preparation for hurricanes put it at an advantage in preparing for the coronavirus. The district has provided laptops, tablets and smartphones for some students to take home, as well as internet connectivity for some low-income students. Teachers would be asked to assign work remotely and could even teach some high school courses live online. “I was a bit surprised that it took this long to offer national guidance specifically to school districts,” Mr. Carvalho said of the C.D.C. statement this week. Many districts have already sent home letters about the coronavirus, asking parents to keep sick children away from school and to remember basic prevention measures such as hand washing, cough covering and vaccination against the flu. They have highlighted C.D.C. advice issued early this month, calling for all travelers returning from China to “self-quarantine” for 14 days. School officials have often tried to ratchet down panic among parents, reminding families that face masks are not broadly recommended and that the overall risk of infection is low. But few districts have publicly addressed what would happen to classes in the case of widespread infection and school closings like those that have taken place in China, Italy and Bahrain. [Read: Japan shocks parents by moving to close all schools in response to coronavirus.] The vast majority of districts have access to broadband internet, but they do not necessarily have expertise in how to effectively organize and teach classes online when schools are shuttered. Further complicating matters, not all families have home computers and high-speed internet. While 90 percent of households with children under 18 had broadband access in 2016, according to federal data, gaps remained along the lines of income, race and education level. Less affluent families were more likely to depend on smartphones but to lack computers or tablets, which are often needed to fully participate in online learning. While school districts may not be ready for widespread remote learning, many of the larger districts have had plans for the possibility of pandemics for years, according to Chris Dorn, a school safety consultant with the nonprofit Safe Havens International. Districts without such plans will need to work with local health agencies to come up with protocols, he said. Among the questions to tackle: Should students at risk for coronavirus who show symptoms at school be transported immediately to hospitals or should they be kept on school grounds until a parent or caretaker can pick them up? In the San José Unified School District in California, Melinda Landau, who manages school nursing, said the district’s response to flu season would also help in the case of a coronavirus outbreak. It has ordered additional thermometers and hand-washing lesson kits, which allow nurses to sprinkle powder that glows when exposed to ultraviolet light, demonstrating how thoroughly students have washed their hands and how important simple personal-hygiene measures can be. The district also asks parents who call their children in sick to describe symptoms. Schools with clusters of sick students are cleaned more deeply with disinfecting products. There have been no confirmed cases of the coronavirus in the district, Ms. Landau said. Two students returned from trips to China in late January. Their parents voluntarily kept them home from school for a time to monitor their health. Going forward, the district is waiting to see how the coronavirus progresses, Ms. Landau said. She added, “We don’t quite know where to move yet.” Closing schools may not be the best option, especially since children appear to be at lower risk of infection, said Amy Acton, the director of Ohio’s health department. Beyond contingency plans for closing, she said, schools need to consider lining up substitute teachers and planning for absences of other staff members, like cafeteria workers. And Dr. Acton said schools can also play another, more traditional, role: science and health education. “Schools can be telling families what they can be doing to stay healthy, and we can teach about viruses, and what is a zoonotic disease? Why is it important to get a flu vaccine?” Dr. Acton said. “This is a teachable moment.” Jack Healy, Amy Harmon and Sarah Mervosh contributed reporting.",The New York Times
2020,What Would a Fashion Music Festival Look Like?,"Moncler has orchestrated a happening at Milan Fashion Week. It’s quite a scene. MILAN — The Moncler Genius 2020 presentation could be seen and heard blocks away, all thumping music and strobing lights. A crowd hovered around the exterior gate, a sea of craned necks trying to catch a glimpse of whatever was unfolding inside the warehouse — occasionally parting to make way for a stream of invited guests: the editors, influencers, buyers and executives known in this particular part of the world at this particular time of year as “fashion week people.” Parked outside, cradled in smoke-machine fog, was a black matte minimalist tour bus made in collaboration with Rick Owens. On the exterior, it was clearly a scene. On the inside, that was an understatement. The cavernous warehouse showcased 12 designer collaborations with Moncler, each given its own room or installation. The British designer Jonathan Anderson, who had his own room, compared the whole thing to a music festival. 265 Photos View Slide Show › While several other designers at the warehouse had produced Moncler Genius collaborations before, this was Mr. Anderson’s first collection with the brand. His was an all-black space, where models walked a continuous loop among several inflatable air dancers — fashionable versions of the flailing tube figures often placed outside suburban car dealerships to entrance potential buyers. The models wore pieces from the JW Anderson archives that had been inflated in the Moncler puffer style. There were puffy scarves decorated with spikes, and large metallic puffed-up chains, attached to weekender bags, dragging on the floor. Mr. Anderson said he had tried to make puffers before but hadn’t been able to get it right. Giving Moncler the technical reins allowed his vision to be realized; and presenting at this wild, sensory-overload warehouse allowed him to have a little fun. “This leaves you with a different type of feeling of what fashion can be and how we can evolve,” he said. Mr. Anderson wasn’t the only Moncler Genius designer fresh off a fall collection show during London Fashion Week. In Simone Rocha’s moody screening room, mannequins were dressed in puffer-and-tulle versions of her dramatic, whimsical, oversize designs. She said she was inspired by dance, creating a “little play in my mind”; she worked with the artist Petra Collins to produce a short film about a ballerina’s bad dream, which was playing on a screen in the red-draped room. One whitewashed room had people in Moncler Grenoble ski wear walking horizontally along the walls. The set for Richard Quinn’s show — a few rooms over — looked like a mod spaceship. Models wore puffer dresses and coats in 1960s-inspired patterns, with black or white feather headdresses encircling their faces. Like the entire warehouse experience (which opens to the public on Sunday), it was a lot of things at once: futuristic, sporty, loud, impressively crafted and often gorgeous — though not exactly practical. “I always find collaborations successful when they’re polar opposites,” Mr. Quinn said.",The New York Times
2020,What Would a ‘Recanvass’ in Iowa Look Like?,"Here’s what would probably happen if the Iowa Democrats bowed to the demand by the Democratic National Committee’s chairman to double-check the results from the caucuses. Tom Perez, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, demanded on Thursday that Iowa Democrats double-check votes from Monday’s caucuses after a meltdown in reporting results. Mr. Perez mentioned a “recanvass.” There is also the possibility of a “recount.” What’s the difference? In short: A recanvass involves checking the math on 1,756 precinct work sheets. A recount would require the hand-counting of about 180,000 preference cards from caucusgoers across the state and around the world. Here’s how we got to this point, and what would most likely happen if a recanvass or recount occurs. On Monday night, each precinct’s volunteer leaders filled out a work sheet that recorded the total attendees, the number who supported given candidates and a mathematical calculation of the state delegates that each candidate had earned. Caucus organizers also collected “presidential preference cards” on which caucusgoers wrote a first, and if necessary, a second choice. The results that the state party has reported so far are based on the work sheets, Troy Price, the Iowa Democratic Party chairman, told members of his central committee on a conference call on Wednesday night. Packets of the preference cards, meant as a backup, have been collected from nearly every precinct and are stored “in a secure location,” he said. On Thursday, Mr. Price issued a statement saying that the state party would comply with any candidate’s request for a recanvass that was “in compliance with the Iowa Delegate Selection Plan.” Party rules set a 48-hour deadline for the party to respond to a written request for a recanvass signed by a candidate. “Any request for recanvass must include the scope and credible explanation of the reasons of the request,” the rules state. Under a recanvass, the precinct work sheets would undergo a “hand audit” to “ensure that they were tallied and reported in the telephone intake sheets and caucus reporting application correctly,” according to the party. Under a recount — a closer level of scrutiny — party officials would conduct a “hand count and audit of Presidential Preference Cards to ensure that caucus votes were tallied and reported correctly in the caucus work sheets and reporting forms,” the party explains. Mr. Price said on the call, referring to the caucus chairs: “Our guidance to folks was: Everyone needs to hand in their preference cards on caucus evening. We trained folks to do just that.” A recount based on the cards, if it comes to that, might not be definitive in a razor-close race, as now exists between Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind. This is the first caucus in which cards were used, intended to act as a paper trail after criticism that the caucuses lacked transparency. Caucusgoers wrote their first choice on one side of the card, and if that candidate did not reach a threshold of support and was knocked out, the caucusgoer could flip the card over and write in a second choice. The cards were supposed to be turned in to the caucus administrators. But in interviews this week, a number of caucus chairs said that there were undercounts in the cards they submitted to the state party and the number of people who voted. In other words, not everyone turned in a card. “We collected 186 cards; four people left without turning in a card,” said Pat Loeffler, who helped run a caucus in Linn County. His precinct, Cedar Rapids 39, reported 190 votes on the work sheet submitted to the party. Mr. Loeffler’s job was to stand at the door. “I was basically asking if they turned in their card or not,” he said, adding that it had been easy for people in a hurry to dart past him.

2020,What a Man Wants … to Wear,"Notes on the Culture Gabriela Hearst joins a select group of women who, in addition to designing for their fellow women, are dreaming up clothes for men.

Styled by Alex Tudela Gabriela Hearst likes to say that she wouldn’t be a fashion designer if she didn’t understand the subtle ways in which a female body can shape-shift over the course of a day — how a woman’s waist, for example, can fluctuate in size between morning and evening. That may sound like a surprisingly unglamorous concern for a luxury clothing brand, but Hearst’s namesake label, which she founded in New York City in 2015, is remarkable not only for its attention to high-level craft and luxurious materials — including merino wool sheared from sheep reared on the 17,000-acre ranch she inherited in 2011 from her father in her native Uruguay — but also for her minute focus on how her clothes, whether a figure-skimming, graphic-printed knit dress or an ankle-length trench, make women feel. As Hearst, 43, sees it, “It’s an upside to be a woman designing for women.” How, then, does she approach her latest undertaking — designing clothes for men? In May of last year, Hearst presented a small pre-fall men’s collection of chunky speckled wool sweaters and slate gray tailoring, and in July, she followed with a 23-style resort offering of lightweight powder-blue and putty-colored suiting, as well as crew-neck knits in off-kilter pastel shades like faded butter yellow or dusty lilac. Though many of the pieces are crafted by a family-owned tailoring company in Parma, Italy, and though there are sporty elements (an ivory cashmere polo shirt, a suede bomber jacket the color of wet sand), they don’t fall neatly into either of the two major categories that define contemporary men’s clothing: streetwear and suiting. Rather, Hearst’s collections offer considered, well-crafted everyday clothes for modern professional men — a niche filled by Jil Sander in the late 1990s and rarely since. A collaborator in the venture is the British graphic designer Peter Miles, whom Hearst has been working with since he created the brand’s logo six years ago, and whose personal style she has long admired. “There’s an ease to the way he dresses — and an elegance, but it’s not pompous or ostentatious,” Hearst says. Still, though Miles provides occasional knowledge of the technical details of men’s clothing (he has been a client of the same Spitalfields tailor since 1993) and can offer feedback from a wearer’s perspective, Hearst relies heavily on her imagination. Designing garments for someone unlike yourself — “it’s a different psychology,” Hearst says — turns out to be a more complex exercise in empathy. This is of course very nearly the same imaginative leap that myriad male designers who create clothes for women have been making for the past century. Women may be relied upon to do much of the handwork in ateliers, but the majority of people who have really determined the way we dress — with major exceptions, including Coco Chanel, Miuccia Prada, Donatella Versace and Rei Kawakubo — have been men: Cristóbal Balenciaga, Christian Dior, Yves Saint Laurent, Christian Lacroix, Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren, Tom Ford, Giorgio Armani, Marc Jacobs, Nicolas Ghesquière, Riccardo Tisci and Karl Lagerfeld among them. It’s a persistent disparity. In 2017, 85 percent of the students enrolled at New York’s Fashion Institute of Technology were female, but in 2015, only 14 percent of major clothing brands had a woman at their head, according to a Business of Fashion survey. Though fashion, like so many industries, is beginning to reckon with the consequences of longstanding and deep-rooted gender imbalance, female designers are still in the minority, and women making clothes for men are a rarity. Yet Hearst is not the only female designer at the head of an established women’s wear label to have delved into the male psyche — Stella McCartney, Isabel Marant and Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen of the Row launched men’s lines in 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively. Clare Waight Keller, the artistic director at Givenchy — which has done men’s ready-to-wear since 1969 — introduced men’s looks to the brand’s couture collections in 2018. These designers join a group of women who began their careers in men’s wear, among them Grace Wales Bonner and Emily Bode, and one could argue that, between the lot of them, much of what a certain sort of man most wants to wear now is being designed by women. This shift comes at a time when people are especially aware of how rigid notions of gender can prove harmful, making the question: How, in 2020, can we create clothes for men that feel timeless without reinforcing regressive ideals of masculinity? Hearst often envisions she’s designing for someone who is part wind-swept gaucho and part well-heeled urban journalist — a blend of her rancher father and her husband’s father, the New York newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst Jr. — but also someone whose self-regard is not impervious. In a 2005 article in The New York Times, Tom Ford was quoted as saying, “Of course there are many more gay male designers. I think we are more objective. We don’t come with the baggage of hating certain parts of our bodies.” Hearst, on the other hand, feels strongly that insecurity is not an affliction unique to women. “I hope they make him feel good and confident,” she says of how she wants her garments to comfort their wearer, adding, “because we know what an insecure man is.” While Savile Row tailors traditionally stitch buttons inside the waistband of trousers to allow a wearer to adjust their size, Hearst learned from her husband, the media executive Austin Hearst (who was also the brand’s first male fit model), that belt loops enable a more flattering cinch. “He told me the belt acts like a girdle for men,” she says. She also landed on a high rise on her flat-front wool formal pants so as to flatter the waist, and she likes to temper the stern lines of a suit with a midnight blue pullover or navy knit polo shirt. This sort of thinking suggests that the very act of a woman offering up a fantasy of manhood in an arena dominated by male fantasies of women can be a revelatory gesture. If men’s ideas about how a woman should dress have at times felt constrictive — “He doesn’t dress women, he upholsters them,” Coco Chanel once said of Christian Dior, whose postwar wasp-waisted New Look shapes heralded a return to more traditional female silhouettes after the liberating advent of women’s trousers — the impulses of the women currently at the forefront of men’s wear are by contrast generous and freeing. Waight Keller’s couture collections use finishes long associated with women’s wear (sequins, delicate floral embroidery) that encourage men to experiment with new identities, and at the Row, the Olsen sisters are creating men’s suiting so sublimely minimal it is almost self-effacing, as though its wearer has more cerebral concerns than tailoring. Similarly, Hearst says that her ideal customer is, above all, a man with “a modern brain,” someone who is engaged with the issues of our time, such as climate change — the brand exclusively uses biodegradable packaging — and dissolving gender lines altogether. If men have historically designed for women as they think they ought to be, these women are designing for men as they hope they might be.

2020,What a Party in Japan May Tell Us About the Coronavirus’s Spread,"Will the virus spiral beyond China? Public health experts are closely studying cluster cases in other Asian countries. Get an informed guide to the global outbreak with our daily Coronavirus
 newsletter.
 Rain was falling on the night of Jan. 18, so the windows of the Tokyo party boat were shut. Inside were about 90 guests of a local taxi association who were celebrating the new year as the vessel floated down the Sumida River. Also on board, unbeknown to them, was a coronavirus capable of spreading ferociously. It did just that. A driver in his 70s soon fell ill with fever; he later tested positive. The same day as his diagnosis, his mother-in-law died; she also was infected. Officials then discovered that 10 others from the boat were, too, including an employee who had served passengers from Wuhan, China. Still more who did not attend the party caught the virus after coming into contact with those who did. As public health officials look for clues to one of the biggest uncertainties about the new coronavirus epidemic — whether it will eventually expand rapidly beyond its center in China — they are closely studying clusters of cases that have emerged recently in Japan. [Update: Japan shocks parents by moving to close all schools in response to coronavirus.] The issue has taken on more urgency as passengers have begun walking off a contaminated cruise ship in Yokohama where 634 people have tested positive for the virus and two later died. Experts fear that some who were cleared to leave an onboard quarantine could later test positive, spreading infections on land in the same way that the party boat has done. Alarmed officials are rushing to learn more about how the virus is transmitted, including how many of those infected experience mild symptoms or none at all, and whether it can be spread by people who are symptom-free. Katsunobu Kato, Japan’s health minister, said the country had entered “another phase” in its fight against the coronavirus. “Doctors at the medical institutes share the recognition that the numbers of infection cases will increase in the future and that it’s necessary to take firm measures,” he said at a news conference on Sunday. The government announced a $139 million package of urgent measures to contain the outbreak, including strengthening its testing and quarantining capacity. Concern about the transmission of the virus has grown with cluster cases in Japan, which has reported 94 infections outside the cruise ship, as well as in Singapore, where 84 infections have been confirmed, and in South Korea, which has had 156. China has reported more than 75,000 cases and more than 2,200 deaths. The figure in South Korea has nearly tripled over the course of three days, and officials tied 77 cases to a church in the city of Daegu. In Singapore, the government has identified five clusters and is investigating the connections within them. The virus has been detected in at least 25 other countries, with most infections involving people who had traveled from China. Updated Feb. 26, 2020 “What we are worried about is sustained transmission in the community in countries outside China,” said Raina MacIntyre, head of the biosecurity program at the Kirby Institute of the University of New South Wales in Sydney. “Because once it becomes widespread and there’s transmission happening in two continents, that means it’s a pandemic.” Public health experts say most viral clusters are hard to investigate, and that is especially true with the current coronavirus outbreak, in which many infected people say they have no symptoms. If asymptomatic people can spread the virus, it will be much harder to slow its spread, as carriers transmit it unwittingly. “There are ongoing silent transmissions” because of the very nature of the virus, Shigeru Omi, regional director emeritus of the World Health Organization’s Western Pacific region, said in a news conference on Monday. David Heymann, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said there was no definitive evidence yet that people who are asymptomatic can pass on infections. He said experts who are trying to understand the virus are waiting for information from countries outside China that are closely documenting cases. “China has such an overwhelming number of patients that they are not able to do it meticulously,” said Dr. Heymann, a former chief of communicable diseases at the World Health Organization. “How easily does it transmit from person to person?” he said. “We don’t know that yet.” Virologists see two likely explanations for the spread of clusters. In one, a “superspreader” — a person who has the propensity to spew more germs than others — transmits the virus to a large group of people. Some of these superspreaders have no symptoms and feel well enough to go out, or they encounter a group of people with low resistance. During the outbreak of SARS in 2002-03, the biggest reported superspreader was a 26-year-old airport worker admitted to Prince of Wales Hospital in Hong Kong. He infected 112 people, including every doctor and nurse who treated him. Alternatively, people can independently catch a virus from contaminated surfaces. It is unclear how long the new coronavirus can survive on surfaces, but studies of other such viruses have found they can stay active for a week or more. Outside the Diamond Princess cruise ship, the largest human-to-human cluster in Japan involves the Tokyo party boat. Four days after the river cruise, on Jan. 22, the mother-in-law of the taxi driver in his 70s said she felt fatigued. Six days later, the woman, who was in her 80s, sought medical help but was told to monitor her condition. On Feb. 1, she was hospitalized after being given a diagnosis of pneumonia. Her respiratory condition worsened, and she was moved to another hospital on Feb. 6. She was given the coronavirus test on Feb. 12. A day later, she died, and the results of her test soon came back positive. Her death was the first from the virus in Japan. After health officials in Tokyo discovered that the infected taxi driver was the son-in-law of the woman who had died, they started tracing his contacts. They discovered that he had attended the boat party, and tested everyone who had been there. Seven others who were confirmed infected said they had no symptoms. Others, like a female employee of the taxi drivers association who did not attend the party, contracted the virus after having casual interactions with those who did. In yet another case, a doctor in his 60s tested positive after dining with a nurse — the wife of a taxi driver — who had been at the party. He, too, did not have symptoms. Another cluster of cases in Japan has occurred in Wakayama Prefecture, where a surgeon in a hospital, a colleague of his, the colleague’s wife and their child tested positive for the virus, as well as two patients who visited the hospital. One of them was a farmer in his 70s who went to the hospital after the first doctor had stopped working. The mother, wife and younger brother of a patient in his 60s from the same hospital also came down with the coronavirus, as did a nurse in his 30s who had temporarily worked on the Diamond Princess as part of the disaster response. Yoshinobu Nisaka, the prefecture’s governor, said he could not rule out the possibility that infections had occurred within the hospital. “We’re having trouble tracking down how these people were infected,” he said at a news conference on Saturday. In another cluster in Japan, four people from Aichi Prefecture were found to be infected: a couple who had traveled back from Hawaii and their friends. Takaji Wakita, the head of Japan’s National Institute of Infectious Diseases, said that while it would be difficult to stop the transmission of the virus, the outbreak could be contained. He urged people during a news conference to consider telecommuting and to refrain from having meetings that are not urgent. Dominic Dwyer, a medical virologist at the University of Sydney in Australia, said it was reassuring that governments were identifying clusters, because that was a sign that their public health surveillance was working. “I suppose what one is concerned about is, are there other clusters going on that they haven’t recognized?” he said. “Identifying clusters is a sign of good laboratory investigation. But as for how good that is, time will tell.”",The New York Times
2020,Opinion | What a Trump Rally Looks Like From the Inside,"The president was in New Hampshire too, and so were his admirers. Mr. Winter is a staff photographer on assignment in Opinion. Ms. Lockwood is a fellow in the Times Opinion section. MANCHESTER, N.H. — President Trump spoke for an hour to an enthusiastic crowd of more than 11,000 at the Southern New Hampshire University Arena on Monday night under banners that read “Promises Made” and “Promises Kept.” Two nights earlier, this same venue hosted the New Hampshire Democratic Party’s 100 Club dinner. “We have more in this arena than all the other candidates in the Democratic Party,” Mr. Trump said. “One candidate today had 104 people.” The crowd laughed. “I see them campaigning down the street. It’s really boring stuff,” Mr. Trump added. “We are going to defeat the radical, socialist democrats. We are going to win New Hampshire in a landslide.” To this, the crowd chanted: “U.S.A.! U.S.A.!” Kimberly Guilfoyle, Donald Trump Jr. and Vice President Mike Pence warmed up for the president. “Tomorrow there is a group of self-proclaimed and closeted socialists running against Donald Trump,” Ms. Guilfoyle said, which prompted loud booing from the crowd. “In my next life I want to come back as the son of a Democrat because you can do anything you want. If I did what Hunter did, I would be in jail right now,” Donald Trump Jr. said. “Nancy Pelosi can rip up all of my father’s accomplishments,” he added, “but she can’t rip up your spirit. And under my father, America will never be a socialist country.” Mr. Pence came from a “Cops for Trump” event at the Sheraton Portsmouth Harborside. “Cops are for Trump because Trump is for cops,” Mr. Pence told the Manchester crowd. For some attendees, this was their first Trump rally. Shane Stocker, a 45-year-old jet engine maker for G.E. Aviation from Lebanon, N.H., waited in line for an hour. [Read: ‘America loves India,’ Trump declares at rally with Modi.] “I do think he’s one of the best presidents we’ve had in a while,” he said, citing tax cuts, loosening regulation and “lots more jobs.” Mr. Stocker voted for Trump in 2016. “After the job Obama was doing, we needed a different direction,” he said. “He was breaking the law left and right and nobody was paying attention to it.” “With Trump you don’t have to worry about it,” Mr. Stocker added. “He’s the most vetted president in our country’s history. Since he announced he was running for president they’ve been doing nothing but investigating him.” The president “is not prim or proper,” he said. “I like that. He doesn’t sugar coat things for people. And if you don’t like it, too bad.” José Rojas, a 38-year-old truck driver from Nashua, N.H., arrived in a shirt that read: “My rights don’t end where your feelings begin.” “Everybody here, they’re all on the same page,’’ Mr. Rojas said. “It’s good energy.” Diane Aubin, 63, is a retired manager who worked at the Department of Developmental Services in Hathorne, Mass., and now lives in Litchfield, N.H. This is the fourth rally she has attended since 2016 and her second at this arena. “I love his message. I love what he has done,” Ms. Aubin said. “He’s for the people. He’s for all of us. He doesn’t brainwash me. I get freedom of thought. I get to choose.” After she waited in line for four hours, someone brought a Dunkin’ Donuts Box O’ Joe to share. “These are good people,” she said. Pamela Tucker, 56, the vice chairman of New Hampshire Republican Party, came to the rally from Rye. She said that there were still 3,000 people outside who couldn’t get in the doors after 5:45 p.m. “I love freedom and liberty and I’m trying to keep that in America,” Ms. Tucker said. “I’m really happy with how the economy is doing. “I believe in the individual and he’s helping that,” she added. “The economy is booming and we see it. He is helping people.” Mike Thibodeau, a 53-year-old retired machinist, carpenter, glass blower and warehouse worker from Hartford, Vt., was attending his first rally. “I voted Democrat almost all my life, until Trump,” he said. “Democrats have slowly slid farther and farther left. The left has gone so far left that they’ve lost their minds.’’ Mr. Thibodeau is not on board with all of Mr. Trump’s policies, but for him this is not crucial. “You can’t get change if you keep electing the same people over and over,” he said. “That’s why I voted for him the first time, because he wasn’t a career politician. He’s never had any political power at any level and look at the job he’s doing.” “He might be one of the two greatest presidents in my lifetime,” Mr. Thibodeau said, citing Ronald Reagan as the other. In his speech, Mr. Trump referred to his impeachment acquittal. “The radical left’s partisan crusade has completely failed and completely backfired,” he said. “As we keep on winning, Washington Democrats are losing their minds.” “I’m trying to figure out who is their weakest candidate,” Mr. Trump said. “They are all weak.” “They don’t know what they’re doing,” he added. “They can’t even count their votes.” As he left the stage, Mr. Trump held his hands up to every corner of the hockey arena, turning to applaud his supporters and pump his fists in their direction. “We have so much more enthusiasm than them,” Mr. Trump said. “It’s not even close.” The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

2020,Highlights From the Campaign Trail One Day Before S.C. Primary,"COLUMBIA, S.C. — Pete Buttigieg will have a Sunday morning visit with former President Jimmy Carter the day after the South Carolina primary, the former South Bend, Ind., mayor’s campaign announced Friday night. Mr. Buttigieg will have breakfast with Mr. Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, on Sunday in their hometown Plains, Ga. The 39th president teaches a Sunday school class that has become a regular stop for presidential candidates and political tourists alike. Mr. Buttigieg has already visited Mr. Carter, so has Senator Amy Klobuchar, Senator Cory Booker, Senator Bernie Sanders and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. In recent elections, Mr. Carter has not endorsed in Democratic primaries until after Georgia’s primary, which will take place on March 24 this year. Mr. Carter’s views of the 2020 race are known in part. In September he said he didn’t think he could perform the duties of the president if he was in his late 70s, the age of Mr. Sanders, Mr. Biden and Michael R. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York. But in May 2016, Mr. Carter revealed that he voted for Mr. Sanders over Hillary Clinton in that year’s primary contest.",The New York Times
2020,Near Tie Between Pete Buttigieg and Bernie Sanders in Iowa,"The Iowa Democratic Party put out a series of incremental updates on the caucus results on Wednesday, none of which really moved the overall picture — until last night. Now, Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg are nearly tied in the state delegate count, a measure Mr. Buttigieg previously led by a small but seemingly stable margin. Helping Mr. Sanders close the gap were results from satellite caucuses, sites set up both in Iowa and in far-flung locations — places like Florida and the former Soviet republic of Georgia — to make the caucus process somewhat more accessible. With the latest results included, Mr. Buttigieg and Mr. Sanders are now separated by just three state delegates out of 2,098 allocated so far, with Mr. Buttigieg ahead. With a batch of caucus results still outstanding, the race is clearly too close to call by the delegate measure, the traditional metric for determining a winner in Iowa. What has remained consistent, however, is Mr. Sanders’s lead in both the first and final alignments of caucusing — effectively a measure of the popular vote. He is ahead of Mr. Buttigieg by 1.5 percentage points in the final raw-vote total and a margin of about 2,500 votes, a lead that is highly unlikely to disappear in the last rounds of reporting. Also unchanged has been the order of finish among the rest of the candidates: Elizabeth Warren has maintained her position in third place, by both delegate and popular-vote measures, followed by Joseph R. Biden Jr. and then Amy Klobuchar.",The New York Times
2020,What if Brexit Works?,"Britain is remaking itself again. The shape of its society and economy, and its place in the world, are very much up for grabs. LONDON — Britain’s departure from the European Union on Friday drew a mournful reaction from many people who have long viewed Brexit as consigning their country, once the vanguard of Europe, to a future of economic mediocrity and geopolitical irrelevance. But there are many others who view Brexit as a day of liberation, when Britain, unshackled from the bureaucracy of Brussels, will stride into a future of economic innovation and vigorous, cleareyed politics — a “moment of real national renewal,” in the words of Prime Minister Boris Johnson. That positive case for Brexit will now be tested, and it is prompting even those who ardently opposed it to wrestle with a question they had mostly dismissed during three and a half years of debate: What if it works? “Disruptive change can be beneficial for a country,” said Tony Travers, a professor of politics at the London School of Economics. “That is, in a sense, what Brexit has accomplished.” Britain is no stranger to disruptive change, of course. After the end of World War II, it adjusted to the end of empire by embedding itself in an Atlantic alliance and building a European-style welfare state. In the early 1980s, Margaret Thatcher led a free-market revolution that dismantled parts of that state and nurtured a British nationalism that fully flowered in the wrenching debate over Brexit. Now, Britain is remaking itself yet again, cast off from Europe and facing an uncertain future in which the shape of its society and economy, and its place in the world, are still very much up for grabs. By giving the Brexiteers a chance to put their ideas into action, Professor Travers said, British politics could be reinvigorated. With the country shorn of its links to the European Union, Mr. Johnson and his aides will not be able to blame Britain’s shortcomings on anyone else. British voters will get to hold their leaders accountable. The economic case for Brexit is harder to make. Most experts said Britain’s decision to leave the bloc was likely to deprive the country of significant additional growth over the next decade or so. But the warnings of catastrophe are probably overstated, and it is hard for people to miss what they never had. Britain, experts said, is likely to grow in line with the rest of Europe over the next several years — a growth rate that is hardly sparkling, but likely to be a shade higher than those of Germany or France. If that happens, and Britain is able to establish a stable trading relationship with the European Union, Brexit’s champions may claim a measure of vindication. That is even more likely if, as many experts predict, the bloc enters a bumpy stretch economically. “Boris Johnson’s argument is that 10, 15, or 20 years from now, we’ll look back and say, ‘Getting out was in our national interest,’” said Mujtaba Rahman, a managing director at the political risk consultancy Eurasia Group. “The jury is out on that, but if he can pull this off, there are reasons to think Britain will prosper.” The Brexiteers are far less guarded. They speak of a “global Britain,” bursting with technological innovation, unencumbered by regulations — an agile free agent, ready to do business with the world. Britain, they said, would strike lucrative trade deals and become a magnet for foreign investment. “It starts with free trade,” said Patrick Minford, an economist at Cardiff University. “Everyone talks about the E.U. as if it is a bastion of free trade, but it’s not. We want to trade freely with everybody, especially the United States.” Professor Minford contends that Britain could add 8 percent to its gross domestic product over the next decade if it is able to strike down all trade barriers, and 4 percent if it is able only to eliminate a portion of them. There could be further gains from technological innovations in industries like artificial intelligence, he said. Most mainstream studies, though, predict Brexit will cut the rate of Britain’s growth by depriving it of gains to gross domestic product it would otherwise have had. Those lost gains could amount to between 1.2 percent and 4.5 percent of its gross domestic product, depending on the terms of Britain’s exit from the European Union. Having taken back control of their affairs from the unelected bureaucrats in Brussels, the British people will be able to enact rules that suit them, not 27 other countries. They will be rule makers, not rule takers, in a popular phrase often used by Brexiteers. That, they said, is a stirring victory for sovereignty. “The elemental case for Brexit is the democratic one,” said Daniel Hannan, who just stepped down as a Conservative member of the European Parliament. “Having got power back from Brussels, we should not let it fester in Whitehall. This requires not just leaving the E.U. but reviving our domestic democracy.” Even some of those who lobbied to stay in the European Union acknowledge that in the post-Brexit era, the debates in Parliament could become more rational — focused on what kind of society and economy Britain now wants to have. They also concede that Britain’s membership in the European Union was deeply unsatisfying. Because it refused to join the monetary union, Britain was always going to feel left out of Europe’s innermost councils. After the adoption of the Maastricht Treaty in 1993 — which formally established the European Union — Europe became as a much a political union as an economic club, something that many in Britain never accepted. “We opted out of bits and pieces of it, so we were never at the top table,” said Jonathan Powell, who was a chief of staff to former Prime Minister Tony Blair. “If you’re going to be a halfhearted partner, then there’s no point to being in it at all.” Still, Mr. Powell said, it was fanciful to assume that by leaving the European Union, Britain would be able to discard the bloc’s rules and regulations. Other nonmembers, like Norway or Switzerland, adhere to European standards as a condition of trading with it. That will be particularly true in Northern Ireland, which will stay closely aligned with a maze of European rules and regulations. Britain, the critics say, will continue to be a rule taker. It just will no longer have a seat at the table where those rules are drafted. Despite his landslide election victory last December, Mr. Johnson has not really articulated the pro-Brexit case. He has spoken in general terms about reunifying and reviving the country but has yet to lay out an agenda for how Britain plans to exploit its independence for economic or political gain. Partly that may reflect Mr. Johnson’s determination not to be triumphalist after a debate that divided the country. Partly, his critics say, it reflects the prime minister’s lack of fixed convictions. He used Brexit more as a vehicle to amass power, they said, than to impose a particular worldview. Mr. Johnson must also balance the different parts of his Brexit coalition. Voters in the Midlands and the North of England, where many districts abandoned the Labour Party to embrace Mr. Johnson’s promise to “get Brexit done,” have a very different vision of what Brexit means from the free-market evangelists in London, who want to remake Britain as a kind of Singapore-on-Thames — an enclave with little regulation and low taxes. “The pain will be felt differentially,” said Mr. Powell, the former chief of staff to Mr. Blair. “Sunderland and other places that voted for Brexit will be hardest hit,” he said, referring to the industrial city in northern England where the early returns from the June 2016 referendum foretold that the country would vote to leave the union. With Britain likely to hammer out some sort of trade agreement with the European Union, the most alarmist predictions about Brexit — food shortages, trucks lined up for miles at ports — are not likely to happen. Rather than a triumph or a tragedy for the country, Brexit may end up being a long twilight. “We’re not going to go off a cliff,” Mr. Powell said. “It will be more of a glide path. Britain is going to have to come to terms with being a small country.”",The New York Times
2020,What if Trump Wins? Europeans Fear a More Permanent Shift Against Them,"Many sense the potential for a real parting of ways should the American president get a second term. MUNICH — There was a lot for diplomats and policymakers to consider when they gathered at a recent global security conference in Munich: China rising, Russia meddling, Germany weakening. But the inescapable question — the one that might change the world most immediately for Europe — was whether President Trump would win re-election in November. Rightly or wrongly, the consensus among European diplomats and analysts is that Mr. Trump is likely to get a second term. But there was also consensus that such an event would be a significant part of a drastic, and potentially permanent, shift in global affairs for which Europe remains woefully unprepared. Mr. Trump’s re-election would represent a fundamental change, said François Heisbourg, a French analyst. “Eight years in political terms is an era, not an error. And it would undermine the reality of American democracy.” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s admonishment to the Europeans to accept American leadership and “reality” was met at the conference with stony silence. Traditional American allies were far from assured that they would be able to depend on the United States in another Trump term. More than that, they sense the potential for a real parting of ways, given policy differences on issues as varied as climate change, Iran, trade and allowing the Chinese company Huawei to build next-generation wireless networks. Many expect that divide will only widen if Mr. Trump remains in office. Wolfgang Ischinger, the director of the conference and a former German ambassador to Washington, noted Mr. Trump’s hostility to European allies, asking, “Why do we currently appear to live on different planets?” A second term could leave Mr. Trump feeling ever freer and more empowered to pursue his every whim in global affairs, diplomats and analysts said. That could include what some consider to be the very real possibility of withdrawing the United States from the NATO alliance that has kept peace in Europe for more than 70 years. “Trust in the United States would be abysmally low, and his re-election would undermine the alliance in two ways,” Mr. Heisbourg said. “First, he doesn’t believe in alliances, but he is also very unpredictable. No one, including Trump, has any idea where he will take any of this, and the unpredictability increases the unreliability.” Many anticipate a collapse in the already eroding trust in American leadership and credibility. “Trump’s re-election would be deeply consequential,” said a senior European official who asked not to be identified, fearing retribution on his country. “If the U.S. re-elects him, knowing everything about him, that will change things here.” A second Trump term “will be more of the same and yet worse,” said Amanda Sloat, a former State Department official now at the Brookings Institution. Mr. Trump has questioned the American commitment to NATO. “That has been corrosive to the underlying trust among allies,” Ms. Sloat said. “That might be reversible after one term, but eight years of Trump would be deeply damaging.” Europeans saw Mr. Trump’s election, by such a narrow margin, as “maybe a blip,” said Daniel S. Hamilton, a professor at the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins. “If Americans re-elect him, it’s a strategic decision,” Mr. Hamilton said. “But it’s hard to know what the Europeans would actually do about it.” Even though European officials generally agree that the change in global affairs could hurt them, how they can respond is another matter. There is already widespread talk of European “strategic autonomy” and of the need to develop what the European Union’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell Fontelles, calls “an appetite for power.” A second Trump term “will be four more years of ‘America First,’” said Robin Niblett, director of the international affairs think tank Chatham House. “Europe would realize more than before that it has to fend for itself.” At the Munich conference, President Emmanuel Macron of France essentially pleaded for Europeans to see challenges like Russia and China with a European lens, not a trans-Atlantic one, and to do more to create a serious culture of security and self-reliance. Even the German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, while criticizing his own country’s moral sanctimony, blasted Mr. Trump’s unilateralism as deeply damaging to the alliance. “‘Great again,’ even at the expense of neighbors and partners,” Mr. Steinmeier said, referring to the campaign slogan that propelled Mr. Trump to the presidency. “Thinking and acting this way hurts us all,” he said, adding that it produced “more mistrust, more armament, less security.” Many expect the Europeans to heighten talk of independence, but to have trouble creating a credible security alternative, and thus, in the end, they would find ways to get along with Mr. Trump — or get around him — rather than confront him openly. “There are a lot of voices saying that ‘we have to do more for strategic autonomy,’ cloaked in emancipatory rhetoric,” Mr. Hamilton said. “But there’s no consensus on what their own interests are. They may do just enough to annoy the Americans, but not enough to be serious.” Dmitri Trenin, director of the Carnegie Moscow Center, said that re-election “will enhance and consolidate the direction of U.S. foreign policy and make it impossible for a successor to change it in a big way.” Those changes would affect the United States’ allies more than its enemies, he said. “Europe really has nowhere to go. It can’t stand on its own feet and won’t be a superpower, so it will have to accept the new terms Trump is laying down.” Not everyone is unhappy at the prospect of more of Mr. Trump. Central Europeans who have a history of occupation by the Soviet Union tend to be his strongest supporters. But they, too, worry about Mr. Trump’s apparent ambivalence toward NATO and his seeming admiration of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. If Mr. Trump completely alienates Europe, it could hurt the United States, too, said R. Nicholas Burns, a former senior American official supporting Joseph R. Biden Jr. for the Democratic presidential nomination. “His belief that allies weaken the U.S., rather than strengthen it, is one of his greatest failings, while he will continue to embrace autocrats, rather than our true friends, like Macron and Merkel,” Mr. Burns said. The danger “is that Europe might begin to see itself as a third pole in global politics between China and the U.S.,” he added. “That would be a major strategic loss for the U.S. in power and influence.” Ivo Daalder, a former American ambassador to NATO and president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, noted that Europeans thought at first that they could wait out Mr. Trump. “But if Trump is re-elected,” Mr. Daalder said, “They won’t wait any more, but will more openly reject him.” Europeans, he said, might band together more effectively to try to balance the United States, as Mr. Macron is urging, or they might “choose another side,” moving closer to Moscow and Beijing, fearing loss of exports and instability in the Middle East. That policy might suit France, Germany, Italy and Spain, he said, but it would add pressure on Mr. Trump’s backers in Central Europe. European leadership remains weak and divided, noted Sophia Besch, an analyst in the Berlin office of the Center for European Reform. “We talk a lot about U.S. leadership but not enough about European leadership,” she said. Claudia Major, a defense expert with the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, said that much would depend “on what kind of Europe Trump meets.” It could be a strengthened one or a divided one that would allow bigger powers to take control. “There are so many European answers,” she said, “because there are so many different countries and interests.” Updated Feb. 29, 2020",The New York Times
2020,What if You Could Live in All Your Parallel Universes at Once?,"Fiction When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. “I liked the neatness of those times,” says Prof. Garrett Adams, the ruminative protagonist of Laurel Brett’s clever debut novel, “The Schrödinger Girl.” Those times are the 1950s, a decade Garrett admits had its problems, but he nonetheless longs for the containment of its routines, its boundaries. Unlike the confusing ’60s, its music, fashion, the youth. He doesn’t get what is so revolutionary about the now. Yet all this is about to change, when he meets the right girl. And Daphne is a girl, he notices immediately, of approximately 16. But Brett smartly veers her story away from the expected one, despite the allusions to “Alice in Wonderland” and Ovid’s “Metamorphoses.” In a manifestation of the theoretical hypothesis of parallel universes, Daphne soon becomes four Daphnes, each with her own personality and interests. The first is a top student, the others a high school dropout, a political activist, a bohemian artist’s muse. Each Daphne interacts with Garrett on a discrete timeline. So much for the bygone order of the ’50s. Garrett’s academic studies ground his personal conundrum in a scientific one: that of Schrödinger’s cat. In 1935, the Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger conducted an experiment that proposed a dual reality in which a single cat could be at once dead and alive. Two decades later, the physicist Hugh Everett similarly postulated, in his “Many-Worlds Interpretation,” that “all possible future histories are real.” Unobserved, a Daphne could be one of many hypothetical entities, but once Garrett observes a particular iteration of her, the other possibilities collapse. According to the parallel-universe paradox, two Daphnes cannot meet. But whether they know of each other is, enticingly, unclear. Brett’s novel is a rare page turner that avoids the obvious traps. These girls are their decade personified, multifaceted and difficult, but then so is Garrett, with his troubled past, his acid-fueled musings, his ambient lust — all woven together effortlessly, without excessive mysticism or nostalgia. In fact we’re so immersed in his adventure that we go long stretches without encountering a single Daphne. In these gaps I found myself taking stock of that era in American history: As hopeless as it all seems to us now, in hindsight — the assassinations, Vietnam, the riots — people were still buoyant with hope, for realities other than theirs. Perhaps “what-ifs” are the root of change. While spellbound by Brett’s clean prose and obvious intellect, I finished the book wondering if the follow-through was as masterful as the setup. Or had I simply become one of Garrett’s students? Bored with his “prosaic,” “stifling” syllabus, he presents the four-Daphnes problem to his psychology class as a way of exploring “consciousness expansion,” and suddenly, the book reads as a smitten teacher’s stimulating thought exercise that can have no satisfactory outcome. I could have done without many of the metaphors for the Schrödinger girls — “each in her own perfect, iridescent-transparent bubble,” each “a refracted ray of light,” each one of “the many phases of the moon” — their differences gratuitously reiterated when I already knew them well. The prose at times struck me as whimsical (“Art, myth and science presided over the mystery together. Are they really different?”), if not logically faulty (wouldn’t Garrett have known that nothing in quantum mechanics scales beyond the size of the atom?). But perhaps any more rigor would ruin the story’s essence, one that starts with Garrett in a bookstore, listening to a mother read Lewis Carroll’s chapter “Down the Rabbit-Hole.” So why not let Garrett indulge a little? His pursuit is maddening, because it should be. But the more impossible his reality becomes, the greater the potential for, as the professor says, “transcendence.”",The New York Times

The Senate will convene on Tuesday to allow more senators to give speeches about their positions on the impeachment trial. But the focus will likely be on President Trump’s delivery of the State of the Union address — scheduled for tomorrow at 9 p.m. Eastern — as well as reactions to the results of the Iowa caucuses Monday night.

2020,What the Heck Is That?,"words to know A look at one of the entries from last week’s puzzles that stumped our solvers. The XFL is a professional football league that was started in 2001 by the World Wrestling Federation and NBC. It was intended to be an alternative to the N.F.L., with a fun and “fans first” spirit. It lasted only one season before being shuttered, but was resurrected in 2019. Vince McMahon, chairman and C.E.O. of World Wrestling Entertainment, spearheaded the original league and retained control of the XFL brand after it failed. McMahon is the driving force behind the revamped league. The XFL says that it will focus on increased on-field action, and that gameplay will be “faster, with more plays, less stall, fewer interruptions and no gimmicks.” The new XFL teams are the D.C. Defenders, Dallas Renegades, Houston Roughnecks, Los Angeles Wildcats, New York Guardians, St. Louis BattleHawks, Seattle Dragons and Tampa Bay Vipers. Mr. McMahon has drawn fire from some on social media because of new behavioral rules that players are expected to follow. “Taking a knee” in protest is not allowed, and players will not be hired if they have a criminal background. The first season of the new XFL began in February 2020. “Sports org. with the New York Guardians and Seattle Dragons,” “Defunct gridiron org.,” “2001 sports flop, for short,” “Bygone sports org. for which Minnesota governor Jesse Ventura was a TV analyst,” “Former sports org. with the teams Hitmen and Rage”",The New York Times
2020,What the Heck Is That?,"words to know A look at one of the entries from last week’s puzzles that stumped our solvers. An odeon (sometimes spelled “odeum”) was a building used for musical or poetry performances in ancient Greece and Rome. The word comes from the Greek “ōideion,” which is derived from “ōidē,” or “ode.” Odeon has appeared in the New York Times Crossword 154 times, clued primarily as the ancient theater.

2020,2020 California Primary: Deadlines for Mail-In Ballots and Registration,"California today Monday: Voters who requested a mail-in ballot should find one at their doorstep soon. Also: The latest updates on the coronavirus epidemic. Good morning. (If you don’t already get California Today delivered to your inbox, here’s the sign-up.) It’s voting day in California! Well, sort of. Today is the day county officials will start sending out mail-in ballots to voters who have requested them. So, if you’ve already asked for a mail-in ballot, you should find it at your doorstep by the end of this week. And that means the political fun is just beginning. Presidential hopefuls are already blanketing television airwaves, and campaign mailers are arriving by the dozens. But expect that to only increase in the lead-up to the official voting day in California, also known as Super Tuesday, on March 3. Tonight is also the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucuses and what happens there will inevitably affect what happens in California. Pay attention especially to how well Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Bernie Sanders do tonight. If either manages to win both Iowa and New Hampshire, which votes next week, it may spell the beginning of the end to primary season. But California is something of a firewall for both campaigns, and if the results are more mixed, both candidates will most likely devote far more attention to the state. And if Elizabeth Warren or Pete Buttigieg surge tonight? Expect them to come stomping here, too. And while the rest of the candidates focus on Iowa, Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City, is making his way through California today to boost his unconventional campaign. Just as we’ve done for the last several months, we’ll be here to guide you through the process and report on the ground in California, which has more delegates than any other state in the nation. Are there issues you’re still confused about? Details you want to know? Get in touch, and we’ll bring you the answers. (And send tips, too.) Now, some deadlines California voters need to know: Still want a mail-in ballot for the primary? You have until Feb. 25 to request one through your county’s registrar of voters. (Unsure? Check your voter registration status here.) Looking to register as a Republican to vote in the closed primary? Do so by Feb. 18. Feb. 18 is also the deadline to register to vote. But if you procrastinate and blow past that deadline, do not fret. California now allows for same-day voter registration, which means any would-be voter can show up at a local polling place on March 3, register to vote and cast a ballot. The same goes for mailing in ballots — as long as they are postmarked by March 3 and received by March 6, they will be counted in the election. Which brings us to another important point: Just because the primary is March 3 does not mean one candidate will be able to declare victory in California. Election Day is when we cast our ballots, but it is not necessarily when we find out who wins. With voting laws to encourage more participation, the Secretary of State is cautioning, as it has for years, that it may take several days to count all the ballots. That, officials say, is a feature of the system, not a flaw. In 2018, the results of some congressional races were unclear for several days — so much so that it was unclear which candidate should attend the freshman orientation in the House of Representatives. The big question on primary night is which presidential hopeful secures the biggest share of California’s 415 Democratic delegates — 10 times the number of Iowa. When we know the answer to that question could depend on just how many of the state’s voters cast their ballots before March 3. We often link to sites that limit access for nonsubscribers.

2020,What The Sprint-T-Mobile Merger Means for You,"Here’s how the deal is likely to affect 100 million customers. Everybody has one. Well, almost everybody. The Pew Research Center reported last year that 96 percent of Americans had a cellphone or smartphone. Which means the merger of T-Mobile and Sprint — a deal that moved significantly closer to completion on Tuesday — will have a ripple effect across the country. A United States District Court judge batted away the last significant challenge to the planned merger when he ruled against a lawsuit filed by state attorneys general who argued that the deal would hurt consumers. Now the millions of people who receive bills from Sprint or T-Mobile are wondering what happens next. T-Mobile and Sprint have said they will try to close the deal as early as April 1, creating a supersize carrier (called, wait for it, T-Mobile) with more than 100 million customers. The two companies still have one last hurdle to clear: the California Public Utilities Commission, which is still reviewing the merger. When (or if) the deal closes, T-Mobile customers will remain with the service. It is unclear what, if anything, will change for them. For Sprint customers, it’s a little more complicated. The majority will transfer to T-Mobile plans as the brand is absorbed. But users of Sprint’s prepaid brands, including Boost Mobile, Virgin Mobile and Sprint prepaid, will become customers of Dish Network, a satellite TV company based in Colorado. As T-Mobile and Sprint executives were seeking the approval of federal regulators over the last two years, they agreed to a concession: selling off multiple assets, including Sprint’s prepaid phone business, to Dish. Before it builds out its own telecommunications infrastructure, Dish will rent networking services from T-Mobile in the coming years. Eventually, the company would become the fourth-largest wireless carrier in the country. At least, that’s the plan. Dish has shown serious interest in going into the phone business before: It made a bid for Sprint in 2013. T-Mobile and Sprint have both said they do not plan to raise prices for customers in the short term. In a statement on Tuesday, T-Mobile said it would deliver existing plans “at the same or better prices for three years.” After that, who knows. Critics of the deal have argued that it would result in less competition among telecommunications giants, which would lead to higher cellphone bills. Back in 2013, T-Mobile won millions of customers from AT&T and Verizon when it discontinued traditional two-year contracts, got rid of early termination fees and made international roaming free. Then its prices began to rise again. It now offers unlimited data plans starting at $60 a month for one line. T-Mobile and Sprint have continually promised that a deal between them would result in wider, better services and an accelerated rollout of a new fifth-generation cellular network, known as 5G, which will let people download entire movies in seconds. In December, T-Mobile launched the first phase of its nationwide 5G network, covering 200 million people and more than a million square miles, and said a merger would help it build on this framework. It has said its 5G will be available at no extra cost. The companies said in a statement on Tuesday that their full 5G network would reach speeds up to five times faster than the current network in a few years, and 15 times faster by 2024. They also promised to deploy “a higher quality and more robust network for rural America,” and to deliver the network to 99 percent of the United States within six years. AT&T and Verizon have said their 5G networks will be accessible nationwide this year. The majority of consumers have phones that work on 4G. They would need to upgrade to 5G-compatible handsets. Those looking to leave the new T-Mobile will be left with two main choices: AT&T or Verizon. When those carriers have one competitor fewer, they may raise prices, too. Brian X.

2020,D.N.C. Leader Now Calls for ‘Surgical’ Recanvass in Iowa,"Less than 10 hours after announcing that he was “calling on the Iowa Democratic Party to immediately begin a recanvass,” Tom Perez, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said he had actually been calling only for isolated recanvassing of areas where irregularities had been reported in the caucus results. In an interview with Rachel Maddow on MSNBC late Thursday, Mr. Perez pointed to “questions raised” about the tabulations in specific precincts, such as one in Black Hawk County where some state delegate equivalents were mistakenly awarded to Deval Patrick. “We have a shared interest in making sure we had accuracy, so what we did today is asking to make sure that if people need a recanvass in this precinct or that precinct, that it’s done,” he said. In response to a follow-up question from Ms. Maddow, he confirmed that he was not calling for a full, statewide recanvass. “Assuming no candidate files a request, it will be surgical, surgical,” Mr. Perez said. “Because we want to make sure if somebody raises a question, we have an opportunity to answer that question.”",The New York Times
2020,Highlights From the Nevada Caucuses: Bernie Sanders Is Declared the Winner,"Officials with the Nevada Democratic Party and the Democratic National Committee stressed all week that they had gone to school on lessons learned from the bungled Iowa caucuses, when a smartphone app for reporting results crashed and phone lines to report results were jammed for hours. But by 11:00 p.m. Eastern time — more than seven hours after Nevada’s caucuses began, and four hours after most of them closed — Nevada Democrats still have only reported results from about 23 percent of the state’s precincts. The tardiness stems from new caucus rules mandated by the D.N.C. that require the state party to collect more than 100 data points from each of Nevada’s 2,097 precincts. The state party also installed a duplicative reporting system to try to prevent Iowa-style mishaps that led to a litany of mathematical errors that had to be corrected later. Nevada’s protracted vote-counting served to rob several Democratic candidates who had hoped to claim a second-place finish on Saturday night and position themselves as the moderate alternative to Bernie Sanders, who won what appears to be a commanding victory in Nevada.",The New York Times
2020,What the ‘Parasite’ Landslide Says About the Oscars: Our Critics Weigh In,"“Parasite” seemed like a surprise, but look at it from another angle and it just may be the ideal movie for the academy. The morning after the Oscars and the historic best-picture win for Bong Joon Ho’s “Parasite,” the first South Korean film to take that prize in 92 years of competition, we asked Manohla Dargis and A.O. Scott, our co-chief film critics, and Wesley Morris, a critic at large, to discuss their reactions and what it means, if anything, for the academy, specifically, and Hollywood in general. Here’s what they said. MANOHLA DARGIS Well, that was fun, and delightfully unexpected. I spent much of last night steeling myself to be disappointed, fully expecting that this morning we’d be sighing over the American weakness for British accents (“1917”), parsing the triumph of nihilism (“Joker”) and sighing over a cute Holocaust movie (“Jojo Rabbit”). What I didn’t expect is that a brilliantly directed South Korean story of haves and have-nots would conquer the academy — except of course its members belong to their own profoundly, unfairly hierarchical world, so perhaps game recognizes game? The success of “Parasite” makes me wonder if the best picture win for a middlebrow nothing like “Green Book” last year was more anomalous than it seemed — that it represented more of a last gasp than a serious retrenchment. In the last decade, the academy has reliably frustrated us, but it’s also embraced new American visionaries like Barry Jenkins (“Moonlight”) and original filmmakers from abroad, including the Three Amigos, as they call themselves (Guillermo del Toro, Alfonso Cuarón, Alejandro G. Iñárritu). The love in the room last night for Bong Joon Ho was palpable, which was exciting and also makes me hope it will bring a lasting shift in how the white mainstream regards Asian film artists. A.O. SCOTT Last night’s Bongslide — best director, original screenplay, international feature and best picture — is one of those things that seems impossible until it happens, when it suddenly looks inevitable. It’s also the kind of contingent occurrence that instantly takes on enormous significance. A predictable night at the Dolby Theater, with a reasonably lively no-host show, turned historic in its final act, partly because it recovered and extended Hollywood’s history of internationalism. Back in its classical era, American movies built their glamour with the labor of émigré artists from fascist Europe. Over the past decade, the directing category has been at the vanguard of cosmopolitanism (though in the rear guard when it comes to gender equality): Cuarón and Iñárritu each won twice; del Toro, Ang Lee and Michel Hazanavicius have also won. Of course the triumph of “Parasite” goes beyond those precedents, but in other ways it’s an almost ideal Oscar movie. Admired by critics and adored by audiences. A box office hit all over the world. A wonderfully entertaining movie that tackles serious issues. It was fitting that Bong accepted his directing Oscar from Spike Lee and quoted Martin Scorsese in his acceptance speech, because, like them, he embodied the ideal of the filmmaker as popular artist, with equal emphasis on both of those words. WESLEY MORRIS You guys — the Bongslide! I’m still giddy. It makes no sense. It makes all the sense in the world. It makes no sense. Manohla, you just reminded me why I love the Oscars as a process. The winners are the result of passion, politics and math — and despite there being no surprises among the acting nominees — there really should be no predicting what the process does. Never mind that the problem with the modern process (the season, as it’s called) is that it makes the movies, their makers and stars seem processed. “Oscar movie” is practically a genre now, one that undermines good movies and politicizes innocent ones. Manohla, don’t kill me, but I like “1917,” despite its romanticization of war and its glancing backward. It’s just too well made to shrug off. But there was something about its seeming to be the academy’s preferred movie that didn’t thrill me because … it also reeks of Oscar. And I think what’s happened in the last 10 years, even with something like “12 Years a Slave” winning best picture — a rough, imaginative American movie, directed by an Englishman — is that there’s a real churning about what else an Oscar movie can be. The real question is, what does it mean for the movies going forward? For American movies, in particular? Are there executives who’ll see this and not only want to produce more original scripts but will also want to market those movies and really stand behind them, to stand by people like Jordan Peele, Greta Gerwig, Trey Edward Shults and Ari Aster. Not to make Oscar movies but new, original movies at all. DARGIS I don’t have much faith that a “Parasite” win will have a significant impact on the American movie industry, which at the major studio level remains dedicated to recycling formulas, as all those Disney ads last night reminded us. The best we can hope for in the wake of “Parasite,” I think, is some kind of cultural shift in the kinds of movies that are taken seriously, including by the mainstream media. Every year there’s one foreign-language movie that seems to break through — last year it was Netflix’s “Roma” — but there’s a whole wonderful world of exciting cinema to discover, from Asia to Africa and beyond. So, while I’m thrilled for Bong, the other most deeply moving thing about its multiple wins is that a movie with subtitles won two of the highest honors from the academy, a body that at least this morning looks nearly radical when compared to the industry’s corporate leadership. The academy has been busily diversifying its ranks, and that effort paid off in meaningful ways. Notably, these folks clearly don’t mind reading subtitles, though it’s worth noting that apparently Neon, which distributed “Parasite” in the States, didn’t send out screeners until later in the awards race, which was smart. It tried to get voters to watch “Parasite” in theaters, where it could keep you delightfully captive (unlike at home, where it was too easy to turn off “The Irishman”). SCOTT Maybe it’s the Bong hangover, but on this morning after, when I was fully expecting to endorse Wesley’s thoughts of breaking up with the academy and propose that we all sleep in next year, I’m thinking that “Parasite” may actually have rescued the Oscars, or at least thrown the ceremonies a lifeline. Part of the identity crisis that has afflicted the awards in recent years is the sense that they serve too many incompatible constituencies. An industry that likes continuity and tradition, a global audience that wants a big spectacle, younger voters interested in aesthetic risk and social awareness, a domestic public that somehow both hates politics and insists on politicizing everything. The broadcasts of recent years have exposed some of the contradictions between Hollywood’s universalist aspirations and its parochial realities. How can the show continue to attract a global audience? By focusing on the big-budget, IP-driven franchise movies that are Hollywood’s leading global export? That has been an obvious, dreary answer for quite some time, but “Parasite” suggests a different one. There’s a whole world of movies out there — exciting, surprising, popular movies — that deserve audiences and accolades in America. MORRIS You’re both pointing out two possible outcomes in the wake of “Parasite.” First that the enormous skepticism (within the industry and in the average living room) of the Netflix way alters the company’s relationship to movies. They’ll still make them, of course, because we want them (Martin Scorsese’s and Tyler Perry’s). But, frankly, I’m tired of the jokes about “The Irishman” as a TV show, even the funny ones (like Chris Rock’s during the ceremony). That was supposed to be the appeal of “1917,” too — it’s a theatrical experience. Fewer people saw “The Irishman” the old way but maybe in a theater more people took it seriously. “Joker” felt like it was treated with far more reverence. (Going into Sunday night, it led the nomination field.) Or maybe it’s just a matter of “Roma” and “The Irishman” being bellwethers of an experience that certain people resent right now but that won’t be so exasperating to future movie audiences. Either way, we’re deep in the creases of an industrial pivot. Second, Tony, you’re right. This win does feel like a lifeline. And, obviously, a turning apart from the milestones of Ang Lee and the Three Amigos. I was thinking last night about all the movies made by great directors who once would have stood no chance at the Oscars. Great, non-American filmmakers who make big, challenging movies that used to represent a major artery of the North American cinematic circulatory system. Does this win reinstate those moviegoing and movie-distribution priorities? Bong Joon Ho operates in an increasingly less unique class. Like the Mexicans, he’s a regionalist, an internationalist and an entertainer. He does as much quoting as Quentin Tarantino and can take big, polemical ideas and do so many funny and suspenseful and strange and audacious things with them. I left his hit “Snowpiercer” convinced that that would be the movie that took him to the Oscars. (This is why you don’t take predictions from me.) But that was a grand, conceptual production with a multinational cast and Bong’s reliably downbeat worries about capitalism, ecology and human nature. I’m happy it’s “Parasite” the academy noticed in such a major way. It’s “Snowpiercer” writ smaller, intimately. He wasn’t aiming to conquer the planet with this one. He was listening to himself, thinking out loud. And we all heard him.",The New York Times
2020,What to Cook (Grill!) This Weekend,"What to Cook Good morning. I hope you’ll be getting first tracks at Mt. Hood in Oregon this weekend, pushing out of Timberline to hit Thunder to Phlox to Wingle’s Wiggle, then back up Pucci, en route Magic Mile. I hope you’ll greet sunrise at the edge of the Everglades, push down toward the Lostmans River, Watson’s Place, Shadow Country, and cast to rolling tarpon or hidden snook. I hope you’ll get out into Acadia for a few hours if you live Down East, hike the Witch Hole Pond Loop, warm up with some hot chocolate afterward. I hope you’ll end the day at Grandview, in Encinitas, Southern California, ripping swells that developed hundreds of miles to the west. Not me. I’ll be looking out into the mealy-mouthed winter of New York circa 2020 and thinking about my grill. Live-fire cooking, after all, is an activity that can unite the nation, even if some of us will be cooking in layered wool, and others in flip-flops. (This time of year, if you visit the public park grills at Jacob Riis Park, in Queens, you’ll see how some combine those looks.) What I’d like to cook, what maybe you could cook yourself: Momofuku’s bo ssam (above), but on the grill and not in the oven, the heat opposite the protein, with lots of wood chips to flavor the smoke. (Yes, of course, you can make the dish in your oven instead of going outside and firing up the grill. That’s how the recipe is written. But the fantasist takes it outdoors!) What a Saturday night that would be, along with a few dozen oysters on the half shell. Though maybe a whole day of smoke-roasting is not in the cards for you? I get it. I’m wired differently. If you’d still like to grill, though: How about this awesome and speedy charred broccoli situation I learned to make from the chef Joe Carroll’s book, “Feeding the Fire”? You could pair that with some grilled sausages and radicchio, from Melissa Clark. Or her sweet and spicy grilled chicken breasts. Back inside in your actual kitchen, you might cook some crisp-fried pork chops with buttered radishes, an Alison Roman jam of some distinction. I like one of the notes on the recipe from a subscriber called Discerning1: “At Step 1 spread a little mayo on both sides of the chop and then dip in panko. Panko adheres nicely. Good with fish fillets too.” Creamy braised white beans could be nice this weekend. Likewise this vegan mushroom étouffée. Mango pie? Chocolate whiskey cake? Even if you’re not grilling or skiing or surfing or fishing, even if you’re just going to sit on the couch for most of the weekend reading “Three Women” by Lisa Taddeo, the world is your topneck clam.

2020,What to Cook This Week,"What to Cook Good morning. Sundays in winter are maybe the best time to make chocolate chip cookies, whiling away the afternoon in the warmth of the stove while you batch out your favorite recipe: plain Jane Toll House cookies, for instance; or giant crinkly ones. Some like Nigella Lawson’s recipe for salty peanut chocolate chip cookies. Others the rye-cranberry chocolate-chunk cookies popularized by the restaurant Mokonuts, in the 11th Arrondissement of Paris. Thick and gooey? Thin and crisp? Oh, I hear you. There are vegans in the house now, or a long study of the matter has led you to go gluten free. NYT Cooking cares. We had our Erin Jeanne McDowell come up with a chocolate chip cookie that has no animal products in it, and another that’s devoid of gluten (above). Give one or more of those recipes a shot today, and it’ll be like bringing summer into your home wherever you’re at and whatever you’re feeling about the news of the day. Then, for dinner tonight, I’m thinking you could make this recipe for the chicken curry I learned from Meera Sodha, and which pairs nicely with chutney and a dollop of yogurt. Cookies for dessert, obviously! Monday? How about Alexa Weibel’s new recipe for creamy white bean soup with spicy paprika oil? (Or saag tofu, from Martha Rose Shulman?) On Tuesday, I think, your best bet may be this baked skillet pasta with Cheddar and spiced onions, from Melissa Clark. (Here’s a good tip gleaned from the notes readers left on the recipe: Unless you have a really big skillet, make the dish in a Dutch oven, so it doesn’t overflow.) For Wednesday night, try my freestyle (and fast) fish chowder, from our growing narrative no-recipe recipe playbook. “Really out of my comfort zone to just ‘make it up’ LOL,” wrote lizhobbins in a note on the recipe, “but this was delicious.” That it is! Thursday, you could make Yewande Komolafe’s recipe for roasted squash with turmeric-ginger chickpeas. And then you could round out the week with these veal chops in cherry-pepper sauce, or, if you prefer, pork chops in cherry-pepper sauce. (Or just make the sauce and drizzle it over some roasted tofu!) Many thousands more recipes to cook this week are on display and in the backroom coffers of NYT Cooking. You do need a subscription to access them, yes. In return, though, we’ll give you a recipe box and the ability to save recipes to it, even recipes that don’t come from NYT Cooking. We’ll let you organize them, and rate them, and leave notes on them. We’ll even teach you how to make pizza! You can watch our videos on YouTube.

Now, it’s nothing to do with recipes, but why don’t you watch Florence Pugh’s mukbang video for Vogue, in which she eats a 12-course celebration of British cuisine? For Esquire, Kate Storey went long on “Page Six” in The New York Post, and that’s a worthwhile read if you like gossip about gossip, which I do. Here’s Molly Langmuir on Naomi Klein, in Elle. And I’m excited to read “Amnesty,” by Aravind Adiga, which Juan Gabriel Vásquez reviewed for The Times. See you tomorrow!",The New York Times
2020,What to Cook This Week,"What to Cook Good morning. We’ll get to a plan for the week soon enough. But I want to start with today, and how you might use it to make Dorie Greenspan’s latest recipe for The Times, for these vanilla marshmallows (above) she learned to make from Christine Moore, of the Little Flower Candy Co. in Pasadena, Calif. “Handmade marshmallows are sensuous,” Dorie writes in a marvelous column that accompanies the recipe, “and so much of the delight is in their texture, which is soft and lithe, almost like custard. They’re sweet — they’re meant to be — but oddly, they’re not all that sweet.” Marshmallows are also not that hard to make, requiring only a stand mixer and enough time to watch the transformation of sugar syrup and gelatin into billowing clouds. So get to it today, and enjoy the fruits of your labor after dinner. Which might be, let’s say, pan-roasted chicken in cream sauce? The recipe calls for morels to stud the sauce, but really any combination of wild or cultivated mushrooms will do, so don’t worry here about seasonality. It’s a fantastic meal, super-French, school-night fantastic, a great date for the Oscars ceremony tonight. Though, as one of our readers pointed out in a note on the recipe, it’s also kinda American, recalling for him a grown-up version of a classic of the Brady Bunch era — a cut-up chicken baked with cream of mushroom soup and a cup of dry sherry. Tomato tomato, as Natasha Lyonne says in “Russian Doll.” You’ll love it. Then on Monday night? Make Lidey Heuck’s new recipe for white beans au vin, in which you won’t miss the chicken at all. I like that with crusty bread, salted butter, a chilled red wine. Tuesday, I’m thinking, you could make Melissa Clark’s pearl couscous with creamy feta and chickpeas, which I like to serve on a bed of raw baby spinach or kale. (The leaves wilt in the heat.) On Wednesday night, another new recipe, this one from Ali Slagle, for red coconut curry baked rice with chicken, another one-pot meal. Thursday’s for Alison Roman’s crisp-fried pork chops with buttered radishes, a dish that looks and tastes so elegant, no one would know you could shop for it in the worst supermarket in town. It could be Exhibit A in any discussion of why people love Alison unreservedly. And then on Friday? That Brady Bunch reference got me thinking about Sam the butcher and his relationship with Alice, the Bradys’ housekeeper. Accordingly, here’s an amazing new recipe for a ketchup-glazed meatloaf from Kay Chun. There are thousands and thousands more recipes to cook this week waiting for you on NYT Cooking, at least once you have a subscription to our site and apps. (You do have one, right? Pass the word. Tell a friend! We want to keep doing this, and subscriptions are what make that possible.) We are on Instagram, naturally, as all visually driven creators of journalism must be.

Now, it’s nothing to do with hummus or tacos, but I liked this Stefan Collini review of Alexander Zevin’s new book, “Liberalism at Large: The World According to ‘The Economist,’” in the London Review of Books. I don’t know if this new hotel is good news or bad for downtown Anchorage, but I’ll never not stay at the Captain Cook. Did you see that the Martha’s Vineyard Striped Bass and Bluefish Derby will eliminate striped bass from the competition this year? That’s very good news for a super-stressed fishery. I don’t CrossFit, but the Murph workout is on my radar: 1-mile run, 100 pull-ups, 200 push-ups, 300 squats, 1-mile run. Apparently, you can break those body-weight movements into smaller circuits. That seems wise. Finally, you know you’ve arrived when The New Yorker’s “Daily Shouts” column makes fun of you. Here’s Krithika Varagur cracking wise on “Ottolenghi’s Easiest Recipes Ever.” See you tomorrow!",The New York Times
2020,What to Cook This Week,"What to Cook Good morning. I have a piece in The New York Times Magazine this week, a manifesto about how cooking dinner can change your life. It’s adapted from my new book, “See You on Sunday: A Cookbook for Family and Friends,” which I hope you’ll see stacked next to the cat in the front window of your local independent bookstore on Tuesday, which is publication day. There’s a recipe to go along with the story, of course. It’s for beef Stroganoff (above), a meal that I think makes for an excellent first step in what I hope will be years of regular service for you, on whatever evening you choose to gather family and friends in the embrace of good food and conversation. Think of these meals as a weekly Thanksgiving, and you’ll start to reap the benefits from the very first one you serve. So maybe that could be dinner tonight, the Stroganoff? (As a variant, take a look at my recipe for a meatloaf Stroganoff, which is outrageously rich. Or go the opposite direction entirely, and make Samin Nosrat’s eggplant and tomato stew, which is one of her 10 essential Persian recipes. You’ll end up with good eats, whichever you choose.) On Monday, I think, I could go for this cauliflower adobo from Ali Slagle, which I’d really like to try with Filipino palm vinegar, if I can find any at the market. (It occasionally shows up at Walmart.) Tuesday, Melissa Clark’s recipe for baked fish, with the best fillet I can find, super simple, with lemon juice for flair, alongside a farro salad. For Wednesday, a different vibe entirely. If I can (though I probably can’t!) I’ll sneak home at lunchtime and pile everything into the slow cooker to make Ali’s new recipe for barbecued pork and beans. (More likely, I’ll do what I usually do and try a pressure-cooker version. Ali has a Dutch oven version of the recipe already.) No lie: I want to eat pork and beans for dinner with white toast and have an ice-cream bar for dessert. Please join me. I like the idea of Priya Krishna’s recipe for Indian-ish nachos with black beans and chutney for Thursday dinner, mostly because they’re delicious and impart such delight. It’s also an easy dish to put together, which means I won’t be exhausted with cooking on Friday and can cook the meal I want to eat at the end of the week: the sticky-sweet caramelized pork that Michael Bao Huynh taught our pal Dana Bowen to make way back in 2006. That and some white rice? That’s a nice way to go into the weekend. Thousands and thousands and thousands more recipes to cook this week are stacked up at NYT Cooking, just like containers down at the port. Yes, you need a subscription to access them.

You can write me to yell: foodeditor@nytimes.com.) Now, here’s our Ligaya Mishan on the rise of Palestinian food, in T. Ligaya is a beautiful writer. In case you missed it, here’s Besha Rodell from South Australia, where she traveled to write about a huge and very strange building modeled on a Rubik’s Cube, in which there is a very good restaurant. (The accompanying slide show is awesome.) It’s nothing to do with peas or carrots, but Tina Brown is remarkably candid in this interview she did with The Times recently, and her language throughout is top-notch Tatler-style fun. (Disclosure: She was once my boss.) Here’s a short film you may find of interest, “The Last Green Thread,” about three friends on a journey down the headwaters of the Florida Everglades. Finally, Adrienne Miller has a memoir out, “In the Land of Men,” about her run as an editor at men’s magazines in the 1990s and her working relationship with David Foster Wallace. (Lucinda Rosenfeld reviewed it for The Times.) You read that, you’ll have a lot to talk about at dinner. See you tomorrow!",The New York Times
2020,What to Cook This Week,"What to Cook Good morning. Here’s what you ought to make today, even if dinner’s going to be bacon-wrapped jalapeño poppers, fully loaded queso (above) and a half-rack of jerk ribs: blender-made chocolate mousse. Tejal Rao wrote about the dessert for The Times this week. It’s an old Junior League recipe that’s made the rounds of restaurant kitchens and been tweaked and tweaked into easily prepared deliciousness. You may wish to put yours in chilled ramekins as if you were serving them at a country club (no judgment!), but Tejal suggests something larger and more communal: “a big bowl going around, again and again, the portions never uniform or predetermined.” Pass the Super Bowl, kid! For Monday, I’m thinking, you could make takeout-style sesame noodles, with extra peanuts strewn across the top for protein and crunch, and extra cucumber, too. Serve with very, very cold yellow beer, and pretend it’s August somewhere. On Tuesday, you should set up this mushroom-Parmesan tart so you can take it for lunch on Wednesday. No? At least make this Grecian chicken stew with cauliflower and olives for dinner. (Follow the crowd of readers who noted they roast the cauliflower first — bigger flavor!) Wednesday night seems like a good one for pork cutlets with lemon and capers. It’s not a precisely unsplattery dish to make, but it’s not difficult, doesn’t take long and is powerfully delicious. I like Ali Slagle recipes on Thursday nights, so maybe this new one for a baked pasta Alfredo with broccoli rabe and lemon, just to keep up the citrusy vibe? Or, failing that, try this new one for stuffed shells, a classic of the Italian-American kitchen. And then I’ll round out the week with family choice: a pot of bo kho, the Vietnamese braised beef stew; or one of Trini-style chana and aloo, a chickpea and potato curry. Many thousands more recipes to cook this week are waiting for you on NYT Cooking. It is true that you need a subscription to access them. But you get a lot in return: the recipes, of course, and the ability to save and organize them, to send yourself grocery lists, to learn how to make pizza. Please visit us on Facebook some time.

I enjoyed this Guardian dive into what fonts writers use to write. (Me, I’m 12-point Times New Roman, ride or die.) My pal Sam Sanders hipped me to the Paradise Cove trailer park in Malibu, Calif., and this awesome kitchen and backyard situation there. Finally, if you missed it on the Grammys last week — viewership was down — here’s Tyler, the Creator to play us off, “Earfquake/New Magic Wand.” I’ll be back tomorrow.",The New York Times
2020,What to Cook This Weekend,"What to Cook Good morning. I was tooling around the Hollywood Farmers’ Market last weekend, talking with Gillian Ferguson of KCRW’s “Good Food.” (You can hear her report on Saturday’s broadcast, she told me. Stream it here.) We wandered through incredible produce amid devoted market regulars talking politics and gluten-free scones as they loaded delicate strawberries and beautiful lettuces into their tote bags, and I riffed about what we might make for dinner. I came up with a menu on the fly, pointing out ingredients left and right, and, if it was all super-improvisatory, I think a lot of it could be made with NYT Cooking recipes, and not simply with glorious vegetables from the organic farms outside Los Angeles. Some of our ideas raise supermarket ingredients high. And so here’s a Sunday supper for you, starting with Samin Nosrat’s recipe for the greenest green salad (above). For an entree to follow, try an adaptation of Nancy Silverton’s recipe for roasted chicken thighs with lemon, thyme and rosemary, served on top of or next to braised leeks, with sheet-pan roasted potatoes. (I’d toss those potatoes in duck fat before roasting them if I had any in the refrigerator, and I do.) And for dessert: oranges, peeled and segmented and served with yogurt for dipping or cold and candied, after the teachings of Gabrielle Hamilton. You’ll go back to work, school or your regularly scheduled weekday operations with a smile on your face, no doubt. Other things to cook this weekend: hot breakfast. Have you tried Genevieve Ko’s recipe for migas breakfast tacos? Or Daniela Galarza’s investigation of Japanese soufflé pancakes? I’d like some orange-currant scones, myself. I know a few teens who’d prefer double-chocolate pancakes. (With salted caramel sauce, if you really want to bring the noise.) And it’s never ever a bad weekend day that begins with a classic diner breakfast, the American retort to the full English. Will you bake? How about these blueberry pie bars that, truth be told, come out better when you use the frozen variety from the store? Or cheesecake pudding? (Either would be keen on a Saturday night, to follow vegetarian enchiladas with beans and cheese or, maybe, huli huli chicken.) There are thousands and thousands more ideas for weekend cooking waiting for you on NYT Cooking. Yes, you do need a subscription to access them.

Now, it’s nothing to do with parsnips or cloves of garlic, but “Better Call Saul” has returned to AMC. (Here’s Mike Hale’s not-too-spoilerish review for The Times.) Here’s David Brooks in The Atlantic, making a big claim: “The Nuclear Family Was a Mistake.” You’ll want to talk about that, I imagine. I think you’ll also want to read this first-person account of 10 days at sea in a wrecked sailboat, struggling to survive, in Outside. Finally, go-go music was signed into law recently as the official music of the District of Columbia. Here’s E.U., featuring Sugar Bear and Ju Ju, live at the 9:30 Club, and you ought to listen loud while you’re cooking this weekend. See you on Sunday.",The New York Times
2020,What to Cook This Weekend,"What to Cook Good morning. This could be a good weekend for cooking if you’re not, like me, spending it on a plane eating Bam’s beef jerky and pounding water against the headaches of cross-country travel. If I were in your shoes, I’d make Ali Slagle’s killer new recipe for braised pork all’arrabbiata (above) and serve it over penne on Saturday night, with red velvet crinkle cookies for dessert, a feast for a red wedding, comfort squared. And on Sunday, I’d follow Gabrielle Hamilton’s latest column for The Times, and make her recipe for gravlax for consumption next weekend, when the fish is ready. “It’s exciting to watch a raw slab of salmon transform from oily, flabby orange to translucent, dense persimmon red under the influence of just sugar and salt and time in the fridge,” Gabrielle writes. “It’s a great starter for a dinner party — nothing pairs with an icy vodka martini quite like it; just rinse the glasses with aquavit instead of vermouth! — but even better in a brunch spread, with pumpernickel bread and dill butter.” Of this I’ll dream — my seat un-reclined, to be sure — as I fly. (Make sure when you get to it to spread that dill butter wall to wall on the bread!) I would love to make chicken paprikash this weekend as well, and these baked eggs with kale, bacon and cornbread crumbs. I’d revel in a Sunday night dinner of fish tacos. Or this awesome cucumber salad with roasted peanuts and chile, in front of a platter of orange beef, with enough rice to leave leftovers I can freeze against a bowl of vegetable fried rice later in the week. Speaking of, a weekend coconut layer cake should leave enough for some crazy-delicious breakfast snacking on Monday, when it comes. No-knead bread? Yogurt? A fresh batch of booch? That too! Thousands and thousands more recipes you could cook this weekend are lined up for your inspection on NYT Cooking, at least once you’ve taken out a subscription to our site and apps.

Now, it’s a long strand of spaghetti from anything to do with food or drink, but if you’ve followed my recommendations and read Joe Ide’s previous novels about Isaiah Quintabe, a neighborhood investigator from Long Beach, Calif., you should pick up his latest, “Hi Five.” Even if you’re not in New York, you should spend a little time with “Dorothea Lange: Words & Pictures,” at the Museum of Modern Art. (Arthur Lubow reviewed the show for The Times.) It’s been a week since I dove into it, but it really is the gift that keeps on giving: Vulture’s ranking of “The 100 Best Emo Songs of All Time.” Noodle around in that for a while. I cried.

2020,What to Cook This Weekend,"What to Cook Good morning. It’s Valentine’s Day and I believe in romance, but the cards the children made us in preschool are the only thing that has ever made the holiday even remotely heartwarming, thank you for coming to my TED Talk. (I’m not a monster. Here are some excellent recipes for the holiday, if the holiday is important to you. As close readers know, I’m all about Gabrielle Hamilton’s caviar sandwich: roses, diamonds and Champagne in a single bite.) What I’m really excited about today: our cool new collection of recipes devoted to the pleasures of the single-vessel meal in all its sheet-pan, skillet, big-pot glory. I hope you’ll check that feature out right now and luxuriate in the print edition we’re sending out to home-delivery subscribers tomorrow. (It’ll be on newsstands on Sunday.) It’s really good and fun, requires less pot-washing and, if it leads you to want to experiment, great: Take a look at Melissa Clark’s invaluable guide, “How to Make a Sheet-Pan Dinner,” before you head to the store. What else to make this weekend? I love Melissa’s video recipe for an anchovy martini and could very well enjoy the drink on Saturday night. Which could be a Melissa dinner again, come to think of it: I want to try this recipe for lablabi, the Tunisian chickpea stew (above), that she adapted from Joe Yonan’s new cookbook, “Cool Beans.” Or maybe chicken enchiladas? Cauliflower adobo? Barbecued shrimp? I could imagine a big bowl of creamy white beans with herb oil hitting the table this weekend, and everyone around it cheering. Will you bake this weekend? I’d like to. Maybe vegan brownies with tahini and halvah? Or an olive oil cake? Giant crinkled chocolate chip cookies? It’s been a while since I’ve cooked Christina Tosi’s crockpot cake.

Now, here’s a remarkable Reddit post from a home cook on lockdown in China that, as my friend Andrew Scrivani says, brilliantly connects the comforts of food to the hardships of fear and boredom. It bounces all over the place, yes. But it is absolutely worth a read. (And this dry-pot situation the guy developed, with sizzling pork and peppers served on flour tortillas with soft Oaxacan cheese? Brilliant.) Two great restaurant reviews for you: the first of Tavern by WS here in New York City, by Pete Wells; and the second of Nari in San Francisco, by Tejal Rao. It has nothing to do with pork bellies or lager, but this Nori Onishi profile of the French pedophile Gabriel Matzneff, now hiding out on the Italian Riviera, is really strong, and beautifully written.

But what to do? Here are a few suggestions on how best to spend your day off. Yes, yes, you’re busy, I’m busy, we’re busy-ing ourselves to exhaustion. But if you have today off, take a conscious stand against all this busyness. Being busy — if we even are busy — is rarely the status indicator we’ve come to believe it is. Nonetheless, the impact is real, and instances of burnout, anxiety disorders and stress-related diseases are on the rise.

2020,What to Expect Ahead of Trump’s State of the Union Address,"President Trump will speak in front of a joint session of Congress the day before the Senate is expected to acquit him in the impeachment trial. Surreal will be the word of the evening as President Trump marches into the same House chamber where he was impeached just seven weeks ago to address the nation even as he is on trial for high crimes and misdemeanors on the other side of the Capitol. The president’s annual address on Tuesday comes after two weeks of arguments on the Senate floor about whether he should be removed from office and a day before a scheduled final vote. With acquittal virtually assured, Mr. Trump will use his speech to set the terms for the remainder of the year as he heads toward the November election in search of a second term. What we’re expecting to see: Mr. Trump will deliver his third State of the Union address and his fourth speech to a joint session of Congress in the House chamber. When we’re likely to see it: The speech will begin around 9 p.m. Eastern and will be followed by responses by two Democrats, one in English and one in Spanish. How to follow it: The New York Times’s White House and congressional teams will be following all of the developments of the day around Washington and providing real-time analysis during the speech. Visit nytimes.com for coverage throughout the day and a live stream of the address in the evening. [Read more about the guests at Trump’s 2020 State of the Union.] While tempted to show up at his Senate trial to defend himself, Mr. Trump deferred to lawyers and advisers who warned against it. But in effect, the defendant will now appear in the Capitol in a different format to offer the best case for his presidency, all without having to worry about cross-examination. Many inside and outside the chamber will be watching to see how or if he directly addresses the constitutional showdown that has been playing out for months. Mr. Trump had hoped to have the trial behind him by now so he could use the nationally televised appearance as a show of victory, but senators delayed a final vote until Wednesday to give speeches explaining their decisions. As a result, during the day on Tuesday, senators will rise one after another on their side of the Capitol to announce whether they support conviction or acquittal on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress stemming from Mr. Trump’s efforts to pressure Ukraine to help him tarnish Democratic rivals. Then, after dark, the same president they are judging will make his way down the House aisle, shaking hands with lawmakers and laying out his agenda for the year. If Mr. Trump does address the trial in his speech, it may be less bombastic than his usual fare. While he has been outspoken denouncing what he calls a “hoax” and “witch hunt” against him, the president traditionally has been more measured and less confrontational during his State of the Union addresses, carefully following the texts prepared for him. He will not be the first president to deliver his State of the Union address in the middle of a Senate impeachment trial. President Bill Clinton gave his annual message to Congress while being tried on perjury and obstruction of justice charges stemming from a sexual harassment lawsuit, but he made a point of not saying a word about it during the speech. Mr. Trump will use the speech and the biggest television audience he will have all year to frame the re-election campaign ahead of him, asserting that he has rebuilt the United States and accusing his Democratic opponents of favoring socialist policies that will reverse the progress. White House officials said the theme of the speech will be “the great American comeback,” highlighting his record on the economy, increased military spending and the appointment of conservative judges. The president will talk about future priorities like lowering health care costs, giving parents more choice in schools, undercutting so-called sanctuary cities that protect illegal immigrants and cutting taxes further. The economy has been Mr. Trump’s strongest political selling point in polls, with unemployment at 3.5 percent, the lowest it has been in more than a half-century, and markets far higher than when he took office. But growth slowed in the last quarter to 2.1 percent, half as much as Mr. Trump promised, manufacturing is in recession and investors are worried that the suspension of travel to China because of the coronavirus outbreak could take a toll on the economy. Mr. Trump, who opened his presidency with a dystopian depiction of “American carnage,” will take a more positive, upbeat approach on Tuesday night, according to aides, who said “optimistic” would be the right adjective to summarize the address. To respond to the president, the Democrats chose one of their party’s rising stars straight from a presidential battleground. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, who won her office in 2018 with a convincing 10-point victory over Mr. Trump’s favored candidate in a state he won in 2016, presents what party leaders consider the archetype for a successful candidate in the Trump era. Rather than focusing on the president’s Twitter feed, she has positioned herself as a get-things-done pragmatist who will work with Republicans on bread-and-butter issues like lowering the cost of prescription drugs, improving the economy for those left behind, expanding Medicaid coverage and “fixing the damn roads,” as she puts it. But she has chided Mr. Trump for his divisiveness even without naming him. “Unfortunately, we’ve also seen an uptick in hateful, harmful language in Michigan and across the country,” she said in her State of the State speech. “A lot of it starts in Washington, D.C., and now it feels like it’s working its way to Lansing.” To deliver the party’s Spanish-language response to the State of the Union address, Democratic leaders picked Representative Veronica Escobar of Texas, who declined to join Mr. Trump when he visited El Paso last August after a mass shooting by a gunman warning of a “Hispanic invasion.” Ms. Escobar faulted Mr. Trump for his anti-immigrant language, saying he should “acknowledge the power of his words, apologize for them and take them back.”",The New York Times

2020,Prop 13 in California: Assessing the Pros and Cons,"California Today Wednesday: No, not that Proposition 13. Also: Disney’s chief executive steps down. Good morning. (Here’s the sign-up, if you don’t already get California Today by email.) On Tuesday, voters across California will be asked to make a weighty decision about the way the state gets money for the things it needs. The question on their ballots will be labeled “Proposition 13.” But it is important to know that this is not, nor does it have any real bearing on, that Proposition 13 — the landmark 1978 initiative that cut property taxes, transformed the state’s finances and has since become a “third rail” in California politics. In fact, for supporters of this Proposition 13, the one on next week’s ballot, it’s a sort of unfortunate accident of fate that they have the same name. The proposition that’s on ballots this time is actually a $15 billion bond for public schools — from K-12 all the way through four-year universities — to improve decaying buildings or to construct desperately needed new ones. Recently, I called the experts at the Public Policy Institute of California, the nonpartisan nonprofit organization, to tell me about the measure. Here’s what you need to know: Why is this on the ballot now? How did it get there? There’s been talk for a long time about the fact that many California schools need improvements, Mark Baldassare, the institute’s president and chief executive, told me. But the question was how to get the money. It was possible that the effort could’ve been broken into separate bond measures — say, one for elementary schools and a separate one for universities. But Mr. Baldassare said legislators were able to strike a deal to get the measure on the ballot this March. What would it do? At its core, the bond would allow the state to borrow money to pay for a lot of school improvements. Of the $15 billion, $9 billion would go to public schools, mostly for renovation projects, and $6 billion will go to public higher education facilities. That’d be split evenly between community colleges, the California State University and the University of California. The measure would change rules in order to make more state money available to poorer districts and make health- and life-safety-related renovation projects the highest priority for funding. Right now, requests for funding are “first come first served.” It would also make it possible for local districts to borrow more money, as long as local voters give their signoff. What are the arguments for and against it? The arguments are pretty straightforward. Julien Lafortune, a research fellow with the institute who specializes in education, said that, like a lot of public infrastructure, California’s schools — many of which were built during big population booms in the 1950s and ’60s, and again in the 1980s and ’90s — are “quite old.” Kids don’t learn as well in aging schools riddled with asbestos or with ancient plumbing in the bathrooms. And children that are most hurt by the lack of funding for upgrades are in lower-income communities of color. Mr. Lafortune said proponents cite the changes to the state matching and project prioritization rules as ways of helping narrow those divides. Opponents like the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association — which, incidentally, for our purposes today, has its roots in passing the first Proposition 13 — argue that the cost of paying off the bonds would be an extra drain on the state’s general fund. (According to the Legislative Analyst’s Office, it’d cost about $740 million per year over 35 years.) It would also make it easier for local governments to sell bonds, which could in turn, cost local taxpayers. Additionally, the association argued that a provision of the measure that would prioritize projects that will use union construction labor would drive up project costs. Is it likely to pass? Unlike initiatives placed on the ballot by voters, which tend attract a lot of outside money from interested parties, Mr. Baldassare said there didn’t seem to be much money pouring into this contest, most likely in part because it was placed on the ballot by lawmakers. “That’s what proponents are looking for: No drama,” he said. He said it’s notable that Proposition 13 is the only bond on the ballot, so it’s not competing with any other big asks that might make voters feel as if they’re piling up bills. Furthermore, Mr. Baldassare added, “It’s quite remarkable that they were able to put something joint together on the ballot that ranges from preschool to K-12 to college,” which adds to an existing sense of consensus around the issue. Finally, he said the fact that the measure would be appearing on the same ballot as the Democratic primary gives it a boost. According to the institute’s most recent statewide survey, just more than half of likely voters, 51 percent, supported the measure, while 42 percent opposed it. But among Democrats, 69 percent said they would vote yes. [Read more about how public bond financing works in California.] We often link to sites that limit access for nonsubscribers.

2020,What to Know About the Harvey Weinstein Verdict,"California Today Tuesday: The announcement marks a watershed moment, but Mr. Weinstein still faces charges in Los Angeles. Also: Tributes to Kobe Bryant. Good morning. (Here’s the sign-up, if you don’t already get California Today by email.) On Monday, Harvey Weinstein was convicted of rape and criminal sexual assault, following a trial in which six women testified that he sexually assaulted them. He faces up to 29 years behind bars, though he was acquitted of the two most serious charges, predatory sexual assault. After the verdict was read, he was taken to the hospital before he was set to be taken to jail, where he’ll wait to be sentenced. The announcement capped the latest chapter in the Hollywood mogul’s slow downfall, a result of what my colleagues reported in 2017 was a decades-long pattern of sexual misconduct and abuse in a series of articles that led to a global movement. Mr. Weinstein still faces separate charges in Los Angeles. In an unusual move, the authorities unveiled that case just as his trial in New York began. According to The Los Angeles Times, the verdict in Manhattan will most likely help prosecutors’ case in California. The verdict was a watershed moment. “For so long these women believed that he was untouchable and could never be held responsible, but now the criminal justice system has found him guilty,” said Tarana Burke, the founder of the #MeToo movement. “That sends a powerful message.” Here’s what else to read to help put it into context: An analysis by Megan Twohey and Jodi Kantor, who first told the stories of Mr. Weinstein’s accusers. They wrote that many of the women braced themselves for an acquittal. But the conviction suggests that accountability for sexual misconduct under the law could be aligning more with the court of public opinion.

2020,What to Know About the Plastic Bag Ban,"New York Today [Want to get New York Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.] It’s Friday. Weather: Windy and mostly sunny, with a high in the low 40s. Expect similar conditions this weekend. Alternate-side parking: In effect until March 10 (Purim). New York residents use 23 billion plastic bags each year. That habit is about to change, starting Sunday. Last March, lawmakers agreed to impose a statewide ban on the single-use plastic bags frequently given out at bodegas, supermarkets and other stores. While some New Yorkers have celebrated the decision, citing the benefits to the environment, others have wondered how the law will affect their daily routine. People have told The Times they reuse plastic bags to hold trash or recyclables, or to bring lunch to work, allowing them to save money. [Get ready, New York: The plastic bag ban is starting.] Here are five things to know before the ban goes into effect: On Sunday, most businesses will stop handing out thin, single-use plastic bags. The state is encouraging shoppers to carry reusable bags through a public education campaign called #BYOBagNY, and many stores have posted signs to alert customers to the change. The ban will not be aggressively enforced right away, but merchants could eventually face penalties — $250 for a first violation and $500 for a repeat. Stores can give out single-use plastic bags for certain items, including uncooked meat, sliced or prepared food and prescription drugs. Restaurants can provide the bags for takeout. Newspaper bags, garment bags and bags sold in bulk, such as trash or recycling bags, are also exempt from the ban. Counties and cities can decide if they want stores to charge for paper bags. So far, New York City, Suffolk County, Tompkins County and Ulster County have announced a 5-cent fee per paper bag. Local governments that require a paper bag fee will keep 2 cents per bag to spend on programs aimed at distributing reusable bags. The remaining 3 cents will go to the state’s Environmental Protection Fund. California became the first state to ban single-use plastic bags, in 2016, and Oregon put in place a ban last month. In Hawaii, all counties forbid the bags. Connecticut started charging 10 cents for plastic grocery bags in August. Several towns in New Jersey have restricted single-use plastic bags, but an effort to pass a statewide ban died last month in the Assembly.

They are the alligators that supposedly infest New York City’s sewer system, slithering through the bowels just under the street level, feeding on rats and rubbish and terrorizing sewer workers who arm themselves with guns for self-defense. These gators may be the city’s most entrenched urban myth, one that has permeated pop culture and has become a recurring theme in books, television shows and movies. That century-old myth has spawned hoaxes and art projects. It has even become an official quasi-holiday in the city: Alligator in the Sewer Day is in February. But the tales are sort of true. The city rescues several alligators a year, typically former pets that have been abandoned after having outgrown their cute phase. (It is illegal under both state and city law to buy, sell or own alligators without a permit.) This week, we created a timeline of New York’s history with these reptiles from 1907 to the present.

But that phase was brief — 1968-1972. Salvo was first and last a painter, as attested by this gorgeous show of 14 paintings from 1980 to 2009. They are small and tautly composed, with radiant colors and chiseled forms; the word “gems” applies with an unusual, unhackneyed precision. Although celebrated in Europe, Salvo the painter has had only two gallery solos in New York, at Gladstone in 1986 and Ierimonti in 2016. Unafraid of the past, Salvo (born Salvatore Mangione) copied Early and High Renaissance masters and mythological scenes. The paintings at Gladstone, which have boxy houses, curvaceous clouds and cotton candy trees, draw on the simplified forms of the early-20th-century paintings of Giorgio de Chirico and Carlo Carrà and Kazimir Malevich’s topsy-turvy Cubo-Futurist experiments, although nothing moves except the light. Salvo’s surfaces are smooth, his edges crisp, his palette borderline fluorescent. Weirdly, this extreme artifice seems geared to make the light look real. We watch it fade into different colors, like the pink to yellow to lavender transition of the carefully sculpted clouds of “Aprile” (“April”). It will be great to learn about Salvo’s other paintings, but those here are exquisitely timed for a moment when many painters are mining early Modernist styles for ways to fuel their new faith in representation. ROBERTA SMITH Through Feb. 29. Miyako Yoshinaga, 24 East 64th Street, Manhattan; 212-268-7132, miyakoyoshinaga.com. Americans’ visions of Japan too often extend to the remarkable and the unique — temples and cherry blossoms, ultrafast trains and ultraweird nightclubs — but for Issei Suda, the country was a wellspring of the ordinary. In precise yet modest photographs, he pictured the archipelago as a string of mundane details in awkward suspension that crystallized the everyday into ghostly portraits of self and nation. This first American exhibition since his death last year, at age 78, includes two dozens prints from a series that Suda shot across Japan mostly in the 1970s and 1980s. Immediately you see a country in an economic boom: contrast a photo of a run-down, low-rent Kyoto neighborhood with a Tokyo scene of a construction site traversed by a fat concrete pouring tube. But with their sparse, halting details, these photographs dwell more in the realm of poetry than economics. Men sit on benches, faces shadowed by wide-brimmed hats; a woman in Kyoto stares into the distance, her hair ever so slightly out of place. Flowers are everywhere: a lover in Tokyo crosses the street with a bouquet of peonies, and petals scatter on the river in Fukuoka. What blossoms, withers, and is more beautiful for that. For fans of a grittier tradition of Japanese photography — Daido Moriyama’s grainy prints of lowlife Tokyo, or Nobuyoshi Araki’s louche portraits of well-knotted models — Suda’s informality can take some adjustment. Yet when the world’s great metropolises can feel like a succession of Instagram backdrops, these pictures of lived-in cities feel not just handsome but restorative. JASON FARAGO Through March 1. Reena Spaulings, 165 East Broadway, Manhattan; 212-477-5006, reenaspaulings.com. Merlin Carpenter didn’t paint the canvases in “Paint-It-Yourself” at Reena Spaulings, but he might as well have. Instead, Mr. Carpenter sent a box of already-opened tubes of paint from his studio in London and instructed the gallery to install blank canvases, stretched and primed to his usual specifications. At the opening, which Mr. Carpenter didn’t attend, visitors applied pigment directly out of the tubes. (Brushes weren’t provided.) What you see here are the results. The paintings have the feel of Mr. Carpenter’s own creations, however. One work ironically reads, “Banks are Cool,” in the vein of a painting Mr. Carpenter made at an opening at Reena Spaulings in 2007, and which reads “Die Collector Scum.” Artists have always employed assistants to help with (or make) their paintings. The German painter Martin Kippenberger, whom Mr. Carpenter assisted in his youth, even hired a sign painter to create his series “Dear Painter, Paint for Me.” What’s interesting here is how, in an age of outsourcing and artificial intelligence and what is now called “surrogate humanity,” artists can create a signature style and “brand,” as Mr. Carpenter has, while convincing the participants (worker-functionaries) that they’re painting it themselves. The only glitch here is a foot-wide strip of blank white space at the top of every canvas. Mr. Carpenter is tall enough to reach it. The anonymous “artists” who painted this show for him couldn’t paint that high. MARTHA SCHWENDENER Through March 8. Bureau, 178 Norfolk Street, Manhattan; 212-227-2783, bureau-inc.com. A row of green and orange structures stand in the middle of the Dutch painter Rene Daniels’s oil “Kades-Kaden.” They’re buildings, but they’ve been simplified enough to pass for books, too. Floating above them, written on a pale blue sky, are “Blauwe Reiger” (“blue heron”) and “de Zon” (“the sun”). Not everything in “Beauty Can Be the Opposite of a Number” at Bureau Gallery, a beguiling group show curated by the gallery owner, Gabrielle Giattino, has writing in it. There are two luscious animal photos by Peter Hujar, a video by Uri Aran and Quintessa Matranga’s painting “Black Butter Champagne,” which shows three alcoholic drinks, each doubled as if by drunkenness, against an upturned table. But Libby Rothfeld surrounds the numerals 2 and 5 with industrial-beige tile in a pair of sculptures, Rochelle Feinstein’s painting “Wrong Wrong” features comic-strip style word balloons, and a wonderful painting by Martin Wong spells out its title as trompe-l’oeil chalk drawings of hands signing in A.S.L.: “Man Carries Unborn Twin Inside His Head 21 Years.” By encoding this phrase in a form that viewers can’t easily read, Mr. Wong reveals the evocative musical beauty it can have as an abstract pattern. But you still want to know what it means, and in a looser way, that’s the effect of the show as a whole. It feels like an important message which, once you’ve seen it, won’t let go till you’ve gotten to the bottom of it. WILL HEINRICH Through March 14. Victori + Mo, 242 West 22nd Street, Manhattan; 973-978-1447, victorimo.com. The first artwork you see upon entering Adrienne Elise Tarver’s third solo show at Victori + Mo is a painting of a woman’s lower body under water. Her white bathing suit and brown legs float amid ripples of navy, grayish blue, and aquamarine. The piece, “Head Above Water” (2018), suggests glamorous freedom — but by the time I encountered it again on my way out, I understood it differently. The exhibition plays on two meanings of its title, “Escape”: a vacation getaway and breaking free of bondage. Ms. Tarver connects them via the tropics, a frequent subject of hers and a region where idyllic beaches can mask histories of colonialism. In a series of small collages, she frames historical images of enslaved people and plantation workers within advertisements for cruise lines. They are cutting. The highlights, though, are Ms. Tarver’s paintings, which are capacious enough to evoke ideas of voyeurism and exoticization alongside beauty. “Three Graces” (2019) is a life-size depiction, based on found photographs, of three women who were kept in 19th-century human zoos. Posing amid lush foliage, they look forlorn yet dignified. I thought of them when I returned to “Head Above Water.” Now, instead of seeing a scene of luxury, I imagined one of the women swimming to freedom. JILLIAN STEINHAUER",The New York Times
2020,What to See Right Now in New York Art Galleries,"Art Reviews Daniel Rios Rodriguez’s spiral assemblages; Hannah Levy’s perspective-altering sculptures; Anne Minich’s enigmatic paintings; Pieter Hugo’s portraits from the edge. Through March 1. Nicelle Beauchene, 327 Broome Street, Manhattan; 212-375-8043, nicellebeauchene.com. Spirals are everywhere in Daniel Rios Rodriguez’s paintings in “Semper Virens” at Nicelle Beauchene. They’re a motif that reflects the exhibition’s Latin title — “evergreen” or “always flourishing” — but also feels in keeping with the moment as spirals are overtaking modernist grids in popularity. “Angelitos Negros” (2019-20) has a spiral laid out with a rope at its center, while “Agua” (2019-20) has small stone rectangles shaped into a snakelike spiral and “Early Life” (2020) suggests a nautilus structure. Other works here include abstracted suns or moons and relate to life cycles and natural and cosmic regeneration. Mr. Rodriguez’s paintings, which are more like chunky constructions with idiosyncratic homemade frames, include many found objects he collected while walking in the river valley near his home in San Antonio, Texas. There is a distinct folk-art feel to the show. Some works even conjure the vapid, cheery paintings you’d find in hotel rooms or at a local cafe. The precision and structure of these works — as well as nods to artists like Marsden Hartley — are a giveaway, however: Mr. Rodriguez has an M.F.A. in painting from Yale. In other words, this is folk art threaded through the needle of studied composition and artistry rather than curios fashioned by a self-taught savant. What we’re seeing is Mr. Rodriguez discarding the rules of Western art history, pushing “high” painting toward craft and coaxing us to follow. MARTHA SCHWENDENER Through Feb. 29. Casey Kaplan, 121 West 27th Street, Manhattan; 212-645-7335, caseykaplangallery.com. An oversize pinkish asparagus drooping over a nickel-plated sconce ought to be funny. And the young New York sculptor Hannah Levy’s new show at Casey Kaplan, “Pendulous Picnic,” has half a dozen of them, as well as several larger pieces that also revolve around the uncomfortable contrast of silicone and steel. There are three large chandelier-like forms made of curvy bars ending in points or skeletal hands. One is draped with casts of little squashes; another, girdled in a taut membrane with the texture of ostrich skin; a third filled with a single, multipart inflatable cushion. The cushion’s gaskets are pink, like nipples, and the phallic little squash have enough bumps to evoke a life of sexual excess. There’s also an unusable trampoline — the frame’s legs press right up into the middle of the membrane. None of this is quite funny, but that’s what makes it compelling. It’s not grotesque, either, and it’s certainly not sexy. Instead, it’s a treatment of sexuality so dispassionate as to be nearly inhuman, which is genuinely perspective altering. It feels like stumbling into the laboratory of some extraterrestrial research ship. WILL HEINRICH Through March 7. White Columns, 91 Horatio Street, Manhattan; 212-924-4212, whitecolumns.org. The mainstream art world may ignore artists for many reasons, including their ethnicity or gender. Often, though, it’s because their work doesn’t fit into prescribed categories. Such is the case with Anne Minich, an octogenarian who’s been making art for over five decades and is only now having her fourth solo show in New York City. This presentation at White Columns provides a welcome introduction to Ms. Minich’s strange and magnetic work. She creates highly detailed, realistic images, but in fragments. She uses decorative elements such as found seashells and painted fleurs-de-lis, but maintains a muted palette. Her paintings are also wood constructions, referring to altarpieces, fireplaces, and in one case — the poignant and funny “Seatpiece” (2018) — a cushion. Sexual innuendos abound, as in “Touch/Touch” (2015), which features a mandorla-shaped bolt at its center, flanked by the titular words. Some works are memorials to dead friends, like “The Flight of the Blue Heart” (1992-99), in which the shape of a house seems to float away, while two red hands reach out into the gray void. One can find artistic associations for Ms. Minich’s art — Symbolism and Surrealism, the sculptor Diane Simpson and feminist artist May Stevens — but no easy meanings. Her work’s closest analogue might be riddles, in that there’s something enigmatic about it, and also something profound. JILLIAN STEINHAUER Through Feb. 29. Yossi Milo Gallery, 245 Tenth Avenue, Manhattan, 212-414-0370, yossimilo.com The South African photographer Pieter Hugo made multiple visits to Mexico during the past two years, first prompted by an invitation to contribute to an exhibition there, then by an urge to roam farther throughout the country. Soaked in sunlight and working the edges of allegory and voyeurism, the images in his show “La Cucaracha,” at Yossi Milo Gallery, were made from the southern state of Chiapas to the border city of Tijuana in the north. They are mostly portraits, and, as usual for Mr. Hugo, present people on society’s margins: three older muxes, third-gender people in Zapotec culture; a dwarf couple dressed as Emiliano Zapata and an Adelita, a female soldier in the Mexican Revolution; and a bride cradling an iguana. From images of men handling hyenas in Lagos to his duo portraits of victims and perpetrators of the Rwanda genocide, Mr. Hugo has often drawn criticism for his exoticizing gaze. Still, he designs his portraits collaboratively with his subjects, and the strong color and crisp shooting mostly honor them, especially the close-up frames that dispense with dreamlike stagings. (The three muxes are particularly moving.) There are art-history winks — one image refers to the famous 16th-century French painting, “Gabrielle d’Estrees and One of Her Sisters,” which shows a woman pinching the other’s nipple; in another, a Oaxaca theater troupe recreates a pose from a David Alfaro Siqueiros mural. But it’s Mr. Hugo’s digressions from portraiture, like the 2018 still-life “Making Pigments, San Agustin Etla” that suggest an alternative sensibility; more of this would offer a searching look at Mexico, rather than indulge in its purported mysteries.

2020,What to See Right Now in New York Art Galleries,"Art Reviews Gladys Nilsson’s “Honk! Fifty Years of Painting”; Edgar Heap of Birds and the power of text-based art; Loretta Fahrenholz’s Elsa dolls. Through March 14. Garth Greenan Gallery, 545 West 20th Street, Manhattan; 212-929-1351, garthgreenan.com. Through April 18. Matthew Marks Gallery, 523 West 24th Street, Manhattan; 212-243-0200, matthewmarks.com. If I had just one word to sum up the art of Gladys Nilsson, who’s been painting for more than 50 years, it would be “exuberant.” Her work contains relentless energy and, by extension, optimism. Abounding with wacky figures of different sizes cavorting and contorting in brightly colored scenes, her oeuvre feels like a celebration of being alive. Ms. Nilsson got her start in the mid-1960s, when she and five fellow graduates of the School of the Art Institute of Chicago began exhibiting together as the Hairy Who. They were part of a larger movement, the Chicago Imagists, whose graphic, irreverent art drew on pop culture and reflected an absurdist sense of humor and an often unglamorous interest in the body. In the past decade, the group started to receive its due outside its home city, but individual members remain underappreciated, especially (and not surprisingly) the women. Ms. Nilsson’s current doubleheader, “Honk! Fifty Years of Painting,” at Matthew Marks Gallery, which is showing work made from 1963 to 1980, and Garth Greenan Gallery, where recent paintings are on view, is the largest presentation of her art to date, accompanied by the publication of her most comprehensive catalog. It is in no way large enough and doesn’t include any watercolors on paper, her primary medium. But it’s a start. The earliest pieces are mostly small, intensely colored and surreal, with faceless characters cast in enigmatic situations. By the end of the 1960s, Ms. Nilsson was painting backward on the reverse of Plexiglas, a line-driven technique that generated thrillingly chaotic images dominated by large, lumpy figures, usually in pairs, with smaller ones climbing on and around them. A standout, “Very Worldly” (1967), swirls with so much visual input your eyes hardly know where to land — a perfect representation of contemporary media overload, made 53 years ago. In the 1970s Ms. Nilsson returned to canvas, and her creatures lost most of their features — just curvy human-animal hybrids (though some look like potatoes with arms and legs) frolicking in landscapes filled with tubular vegetation. These works, including the sublime two-panel “Dipped Dick: Adam and Eve After Cranach” (1971), are boldly pleasurable explorations of color, pattern and perspective. The exhibition skips over several decades to the present day, when Ms. Nilsson has taken to painting outsize women who manage to be both bulbous and graceful as they observe the world around them. Whether sketching, posing, or studying, these giantesses do what they want. The protagonist of “Gleefully Askew” (2019) gives us a knowing stare while wearing only a ruffly mini apron and dabbing at a picture held aloft by two men. This is a notable change from the blank-faced high-kicker of a 1964 painting or the caricatures of big-haired ladies on Plexiglas. The recent figures are in complete possession of their identities, with presences so large the frames can barely contain them. Women have long been prominent in Ms. Nilsson’s art, but in their older age they’ve found a new kind of liberation. JILLIAN STEINHAUER Through March 7. Fort Gansevoort, 5 Ninth Avenue, Manhattan; 917-639-3113, fortgansevoort.com. Edgar Heap of Birds, whose Cheyenne name is Hock E Aye Vi, has been an important figure in contemporary American art, including Native American art, for some 40 years. “Standing Rock Awakens the World,” his stirring show at Fort Gansevoort, isn’t exactly the career survey we’ve been waiting for — that will require the resources of a major New York museum — but it gives a good sense of the span and variety of his work. Much of it has been, and still is, text-based, and no artist better understands the political weight and expressive velocity of language. The show’s earliest piece, “American Policy II” from 1987, is a mural-like ensemble of 15 pastel drawings composed of English-language phrases evoking the colonial stresses imposed on Native American life. “Know Young Death” one panel reads. “Relocate Destroy” another says. Drawn with feathered lines and in coded colors, the words are individual images that collectively form a chantlike piece of concrete poetry. In the show’s similarly monumental 2019 title work, “Standing Rock Awakens the World,” made of dozens of monoprints, the palette is reduced to mostly shades of red-brown and the words are specific in their historical reference. With phrases like “Stop Settler Terror,” and “Water Is Our First Medicine,” written in stark white and in some cases on blood-red ground, the prints read like a wall of placards carried by an invisible army of resisters at the 2016 Dakota Access pipeline protests. Installed throughout the show are abstract paintings from the artist’s “Neuf Series” (examples here date from 1996 to 2019). A set of steel signs installed in the gallery’s courtyard suggest a Native American claim to that world, or part of it, namely the New York land underfoot. Although the signs indicate that Indigenous stakeholders have granted us access to that land, history tells us that we have done everything not to earn their welcome. HOLLAND COTTER Through March 22. Baby Company, 73 Allen Street, Manhattan; 646-756-4547, companygallery.us. Loretta Fahrenholz’s hilarious and exhilarating video “Mashes of the Afternoon” (2018) was created from YouTube videos of people remaking Maya Deren and Alexander Hammid’s landmark experimental film, “Meshes of the Afternoon” (1943). Ms. Fahrenholz’s film is being shown alongside a series of new photographs and sculptures based on the Elsa doll from Disney’s “Frozen” in the exhibition “Rubber Breasts Willing to Bring Teacups and Roll Away Fire and Bombs” at Baby Company. (The show’s title is cobbled from lines in Sylvia Plath’s “The Applicant,” an unsettling poem describing a woman as a “living doll.”) Seeing Deren and Hammid’s Surrealist-inspired masterpiece — which includes Freud-101 objects like keys, knives and mirrors — re-enacted by people of various races, ethnicities and genders is a reminder of how art can be generative, inspiring artists and amateurs to copy and reinterpret it for themselves. The photographs of the Elsa doll, pieced together in three horizontal sections and also sourced from images from the internet, are OK. Over time, however, the proliferation of uncanny doll-images in art has lost its impact for me. Having watched “Meshes of the Afternoon” many times, however — and taught it for years to undergraduates in art history courses — I take pleasure in seeing Deren joyfully appropriated and hijacked by new generations, clearly galvanized by her work.

2020,What to See Right Now in New York Art Galleries,"Art Reviews Treasures ‘Acquired on eBay’; Duchamp portraits in a farewell show; Madeline Hollander’s headlight installation; and Yun Hyong-keun’s mysterious monochromes. Through Feb. 23. Mitchell Algus, 132 Delancey Street, 2nd Floor, Manhattan; 516-639-4918; mitchellalgusgallery.com “Acquired on eBay (and from other surrogate sources)” comes on like a magnetic cornucopia of paintings and drawings by dozens of mostly midcentury artists, many now obscure, contextualized by sundry photographs and books. It mirrors the narrowness of established taste, the fickleness of the art market and the friendships forged among artists that help them survive. The effect is alternately informative, sobering and weirdly optimistic and ineffably touching. A parting wisdom: Collecting art is less about money than about passion, curiosity and persistence. If you truly love art for itself, not for status or investment, you will find things you can afford. Few people are better equipped to organize this show than Mitchell Algus, a longtime advocate for forgotten or overlooked artists, with an abiding interest in late Surrealism, both European and American. Many of the works were purchased by him or other lenders for not much money on eBay. Some pieces surfaced in antique stores, out-of-the-way auctions or artists’ estates. A few were artists’ gifts to or trades with Mr. Algus — once an artist himself. Note the bold abstraction by Edward Avedisian, whose 1960s canvases Mr. Algus resurrected in the 1990s. Some names here are well known, including the artists Elaine de Kooning, Hans Bellmer and Pavel Tchelitchew; the filmmaker Hollis Frampton and the composer Virgil Thomson. Others ring few bells. These include Darrel Austin (1907-1994), who is represented by the robustly painted “Wiley Fox,” from 1970; and Karl Priebe (1914-1976), the creator of four dreamy fantasy portraits of large-eyed beauties. Yet in the mid-1940s, each artist was the subject of a Life Magazine feature. A large lacy ink drawing of a country house is by one Elie Lascaux (1888-1968), who exhibited with Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler, Picasso’s art dealer. Don’t miss a small enticing undated painting of onions by Mary Meigs (1917-2002), described in Mr. Algus’s checklist as “a writer, artist and L.G.B.T. standard-bearer” and the inspiration for Dolly Lamb, a frustrated artist, in Mary McCarthy’s novel “A Charmed Life.” Said book is displayed nearby with a photograph of McCarthy by Charles Henri Ford, editor of the art magazine View. And next to an image by an unknown photographer of the artist Jack Smith and the actress Maria Antoinette Rogers on the train to Coney Island hangs a fine 1965 drawing that depicts Smith’s name carved in looming rock, à la Mount Rushmore. It is by John Hawkins, about whom Mr. Algus knows nearly nothing. As of yet. ROBERTA SMITH Through Feb 28. Francis M. Naumann Fine Art, 24 West 57th Street, Suite 305, Manhattan; 212-582-3201, francisnaumann.com. Beyond the Chelsea galleries, away from the new made-for-Instagram art amusements, New York is still home to scholarly, specialist dealers whose reappraisals and rediscoveries keep art history moving. A leading figure among them is Francis M. Naumann, who has presented all sorts of Dada delights for two decades in his Midtown Manhattan gallery, and who is this city’s most fervent guardian of the flame of Marcel Duchamp. But these days, art galleries operate on margins that the French-born artist would call “inframince” (infrathin, barely perceptible). Mr. Naumann is closing his Midtown space this month, and his business will function as a private concern. His touching farewell show, “Depicting Duchamp,” includes a century’s worth of portraits, by more than 50 artists, of the gallery’s patron saint. Jasper Johns, by cutting a stencil board, and Ai Weiwei, with a bent wire hanger, both crafted silhouettes of Duchamp that make a signature of his trademark aquiline nose. The Japanese photographer Yasumasa Morimura crosses lines of race and gender to pose as Rrose Sélavy, Duchamp’s alter ego. There are photographic portraits by Irving Penn and Man Ray, and depictions by all three of Duchamp’s artist siblings: Raymond Duchamp-Villon, Jacques Villon and Suzanne Duchamp. It’s a classically Duchampian irony that, even as all artists now work in the shadow of his bicycle wheel and upturned urinal, he inspired so much of the figurative painting he knocked as “retinal” art. (Doesn’t hurt that the last century’s most enduringly influential artist was also one of its most handsome.) Some of the weirdest and greatest came about in 1977, on the occasion of the Duchamp retrospective that inaugurated the Centre Pompidou in Paris — for which the illustrator André Raffray painted a dozen touching gouaches of the young Duchamp buying his bottle rack or carrying his “Nude Descending a Staircase.” Seeing them here, in Mr. Naumann’s final show, left me desperately nostalgic for a New York still open to figures who made their whole life into art. JASON FARAGO Through Feb. 21 at Bortolami, 55 Walker Street, Manhattan; 212-727-2050; bortolamigallery.com. Madeline Hollander identifies as a choreographer but she works at the outer edges of dance — and not always with humans. A performance she created on the beach at Far Rockaway, Queens, included a sand-cleaning truck; another featured office chairs moving around a gallery. She also developed movement sequences for Jordan Peele’s horror film “Us” (2019). For “Heads/Tails,” her new show at Bortolami, Ms. Hollander has mounted dozens of used car headlights and taillights on the gallery walls and synced them with the traffic signal at the nearby intersection of Broadway and Walker Street. The gentle on-off rhythm of red and white lights in the gallery is controlled by an interface programmed from data that tracks the movement of drivers in that area. Part of Ms. Hollander’s work was the arduous process of obtaining permission to have access to this system from the city’s Traffic Management Center at the Transportation Department. There’s an eerie disconnect here between quiet gallery and noisy street, as well as technologically “programmed” versus artistically “choreographed.” Ms. Hollander burrows into these fissures. The private contemplation of art becomes tied to hoards of strangers moving throughout the city. In today’s world, everything is connected, networked and interfaced. Ms. Hollander highlights this phenomenon but also glimpses into the post-human future, where links between programmed apparatuses and humans will be, presumably, even more prevalent and profound. MARTHA SCHWENDENER Through March 7. David Zwirner, 537 West 20th Street, Manhattan; 212-517-8677, davidzwirner.com. Since I saw some of them at David Zwirner last week, I’ve been struggling to understand why Yun Hyong-keun’s paintings from the late 1980s and early ’90s are so enthralling. A Korean who became famous as part of the postwar dansaekhwa movement, Yun spent decades, before he died in 2007, painting simple stripes and blocks with thin, overlapping layers of burnt umber and ultramarine. Dansaekhwa literally means “monochrome,” but the dansaekhwa group were artists who found a bridge between Western-style modern art and Korean aesthetic traditions, not necessarily with strict monochrome, but in an overall focus on material surfaces and minimal elegance. There’s the color, of course. Ultramarine and burnt umber combine into a distinctly sweet and mysterious black. You register both tones at once but can’t distinguish them. This feels like a spiritual experience — it pits an intuitive certainty against the inadequacy of your own conscious perceptions. Then there’s the confidence of those smoky but unmistakable edges with their occasional halos of brownish static. Set against the densely textured raw linen Yun painted on, these assertive lines are another appealing certainty, one unshaken by emptiness all around them. But in the end, I think what fascinates me is the way that every black rectangle, whether tall and narrow or one of several, echoes the shape of the canvas it’s painted on. It makes them into paintings within paintings, or like shadows peeled up off the ground and reattached to the objects that cast them. WILL HEINRICH",The New York Times
2020,What to See and Experience in New York City This Spring,"SPRING PREVIEW Broadway shows, Davóne Tines’s arias, Davido’s Afrobeats, Oona Doherty’s solos: what our critics and writers are looking forward to this season. ‘HANGMEN’ Feeling the need for a caffeinated jolt of stylish suspense, the kind that has your nails carving crescents into your palms? It’s been a while since Broadway has seen such gratifying, Hitchcockian fare. But that vacuum will be filled when Martin McDonagh’s “Hangmen” opens on March 19 at the Golden Theater. A master of corkscrew plotting and chilling wit, McDonagh (“The Beauty Queen of Leenane,” the film “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri”) here considers the troubling, unexpected aftermath of one of Britain’s last executions. I first caught this play in London and then again when it made its New York debut Off Broadway at the Atlantic Theater Company. I look forward to being properly unnerved all over again with this latest incarnation, directed by Matthew Dunster and featuring Dan Stevens (“Downton Abbey”) as one very sinister seducer. BEN BRANTLEY ‘FLYING OVER SUNSET’ Sometimes what’s most exciting is what’s least known. And few shows have arrived on Broadway as little known as “Flying Over Sunset,” which opens at the Vivian Beaumont Theater on April 16. Not only is it a new musical but it’s also an entirely original one, with no precursor movie, novel, cartoon or play to give it shape and curb appeal. Whatever it is, it will have to succeed on its own. Which is not to say it has no names attached; it’s dripping with names. You may have heard of its three main characters, for instance, all hanging around Hollywood in the mid-1950s: Cary Grant, debonair movie star; Clare Boothe Luce, ambassador and congresswoman; Aldous Huxley, British intellectual. Or the three inside-Broadway actors who play them: Tony Yazbeck (“On the Town”) as Grant, Carmen Cusack (“Bright Star”) as Luce, Harry Hadden-Paton (“My Fair Lady”) as Huxley. Then there are the names backstage. The music is by Tom Kitt (“Next to Normal”), the lyrics by Michael Korie (“Grey Gardens”), the book and direction by James Lapine (“Sunday in the Park With George”). I am sure the prop master is illustrious, too. So what are all these promising names promising? I’m happy not to know much more than that the three main characters, each of whom experimented with LSD at the time, in Lapine’s fictional world share trips together. The characters sing only when they’re high; with any luck, that’s how they’ll leave the audience, too. JESSE GREEN ‘CAROLINE, OR CHANGE’ When “Caroline, or Change” opened at the Public Theater in 2003, it was a musical out of the blue. It had no source material beyond the childhood of Tony Kushner, who wrote the book. Like the boy Noah Gellman in “Caroline,” Kushner grew up in an artistic Jewish home in Louisiana whose major players included not only his musician parents but the family maid, a woman he thought he knew but didn’t. The musical that grew from these seeds — with a gorgeous score by Jeanine Tesori — came out of the blue in another sense: It was steeped in sadness. There’s the sadness of Noah, whose mother has died, but also the sadness of Caroline, the maid, a single black mother with four children she can hardly support on $30 a week. The connection between these two lonely people, made up of necessity that becomes a kind of grudging love and then an expression of cruelty, suggests a national sadness, one that in 1963, when the musical is set, was just beginning to crack into upheaval. That the original Broadway production, in 2004, was not a financial success — despite a brilliant production by George C. Wolfe and a towering central performance by Tonya Pinkins — seemed to deliver an additional sting of injustice. Some critics found it dour and didactic and some audiences apparently found its sadness off-putting. Sixteen years later, the theatrical and political ground having shifted around it, “Caroline, or Change,” imported from London by the Roundabout Theater Company with its star, Sharon D. Clarke, may have found a time to match its thesis: that change is always needful, always painful. JESSE GREEN ‘HOW I LEARNED TO DRIVE’ The laughs might be different this time, but the comedy was always surprising in Paula Vogel’s breathtaking beauty of a memory play, never more so than in the 1997 premiere, which starred Mary-Louise Parker and David Morse in a story of sexual abuse that shifts ever backward, to its beginning. The Pulitzer Prize-winning play’s Broadway debut — starting previews on March 27 at the Samuel J. Friedman Theater — reunites the original director, Mark Brokaw, with Parker as Li’l Bit, a girl whose fatherlessness leaves her vulnerable, and Morse as Peck, the charismatic uncle who lavishes her with attention. Preying incrementally on Li’l Bit, he grooms her for more. In the decades since Vogel wrote “How I Learned to Drive,” mainstream culture has learned much about predation and trauma — from child sexual-abuse scandals and from the #MeToo movement, which has made the methodical nature of abuse starkly clear. What’s staggering as the play returns is to see how deeply it has always understood the nature of that targeting: as systematic as a driving manual, and couched in secrecy. The pitch-perfect original production — which won Obie Awards for Vogel, Brokaw, Parker and Morse — was surprising, and uncomfortable, for its capacious empathy and the well-matched allure of its stars. But in the landscape of Vogel’s keen-eyed drama, neither memory nor emotion is uncomplicated, even when the harm is plain. It will be fascinating, in our black-and-white world, to see how that lands with audiences now. LAURA COLLINS-HUGHES ‘THE BEDWETTER’ Sarah Silverman sings! Well, she already has, hasn’t she — most memorably when she performed a graphic song about her carnal relationship with Matt Damon to bait her boyfriend at the time, Jimmy Kimmel. But in this case, other performers will be giving melodious voice to the always arresting musings of this take-no-prisoners comedian. The occasion is the musical adaptation of “The Bedwetter: Stories of Courage, Redemption, and Pee,” Silverman’s best-selling 2010 memoir of a urine-soaked childhood in New Hampshire, during which she showed an uncanny precocity for bad taste and blue humor. (As Dave Itzkoff’s wrote of the book in the Times, “Not even an early bomb — a failed joke about the accidental death of her baby brother, Jeffrey — could discourage Ms. Silverman’s youthful showmanship.”) The Atlantic Theater Company’s stage version, opening in April, features a book by Silverman and the seriously funny playwright Josh Harmon (“Bad Jews,” “Admissions""), with music by the pop composer Adam Schlesinger, late of Fountains of Wayne. (Remember “Stacy’s Mom,” the 2003 hit about teenage lust?) The adventurous Anne Kauffman (“Mary Jane,” “Marjorie Prime”) directs a cast that includes the Tony-winning musical theater eminences Stephanie J. Block (“The Cher Show,” “Falsettos”) and Linda Lavin (“The Tale of the Allergist’s Wife,” “The Lyons”). It is perhaps of particular interest that Silverman is collaborating with Schlesinger on the lyrics. Let the speculation begin on possible rhymes for the ripe, Anglo-Saxon words that are a staple of the Silverman vocabulary. BEN BRANTLEY ‘LUNGS’ You may know them better as the Windsors — the lovely young monarch and her dashing consort in the first two seasons of the Netflix series “The Crown.” So sparky was the chemistry between Claire Foy, as Queen Elizabeth II, and Matt Smith, as Prince Philip, that it made you hope the real royals once had something like that, too. Their casting, then, is the principal reason for excitement about Duncan Macmillan’s “Lungs” coming to the Brooklyn Academy of Music in late March. Directed by the Tony Award winner Matthew Warchus (“Matilda the Musical”), Foy and Smith play a middle-class couple contemplating parenthood and the future of a warming planet. It was a hit last fall at the Old Vic in London, where Matt Wolf, reviewing for The New York Times, called Foy and Smith “irresistible,” and even higher-wattage live than on TV. And a spare set by Rob Howell (a Tony winner for “The Ferryman”) puts the focus squarely on the acting — exactly where we want it to be. LAURA COLLINS-HUGHES ‘NOLLYWOOD DREAMS’ Funny plays are hard to write, in short supply and desperately needed. That’s why I’ve been waiting impatiently for Jocelyn Bioh’s “Nollywood Dreams” — which opens on April 13 — ever since seeing her 2017 breakthrough, “School Girls; or the African Mean Girls Play.” That comedy, which was also an MCC Theater production, adapted the “Mean Girls” template to a high school in Ghana, where the catty, competitive tropes of the genre turned into something fresh. Biting, too; what might have been silly in a contest of blondes cut much deeper when colorism was at the heart of the matter. Yet Bioh, whose other career as an actor informs her highly performable playwriting, looks at her subjects through a comedy lens. You won’t find what she calls “poverty porn” in her depictions of Africa. “Nollywood Dreams” (directed by Saheem Ali) is set in the Nigerian film industry in the 1990s, as it is aiming to cross over into Western success. When one of the industry’s hottest directors holds open auditions for his latest movie, ingénues, heartthrobs and spurned divas get tangled in the plot. If that outline sounds familiar, so did the one for “Mean Girls”; familiarity is part of what makes Bioh’s writing so efficient. She lets the genre do a lot of the work while digging behind it to see what treasure it hides. The laughs are so plentiful you hardly know you’ve been taken somewhere new. JESSE GREEN ‘GNIT’ and ‘THE FRE’ Iconoclasts blowing up the classics are an everyday occurrence in theater. But the process acquires an extra cachet when the demolition experts are as inventive and celebrated as Will Eno and Taylor Mac, both finalists for the Pulitzer Prize for drama. A master of the anxious ellipsis, Eno (“Thom Pain,” “The Realistic Joneses”) will be reinterpreting — and shrinking — the sprawling, five-act study in evolving identity that is Henrik Ibsen’s “Peer Gynt.” Eno’s version is called “Gnit,” with a seeming typographical capriciousness that suits a portrait of the randomness of human personality. This Theater for a New Audience production opens in March at the Polonsky Shakespeare Center in Brooklyn. Oliver Butler (“What the Constitution Means to Me”) directs a presumably very busy six-member cast, led by Joe Curnutte as the egocentric title character. The one-person extravaganza who is Taylor Mac has already run the gamut in reimagining classics — from the marathon performance piece “A 24-Decade History of Popular Music” to the bawdy, bloody “Gary,” a riff on Shakespeare’s “Titus Andronicus,” seen on Broadway last year. Now Mac looks back — way back — to ancient Greek comedy with “The Fre,” which is inspired by Aristophanes’ “The Frogs.” Opening far Off Broadway at the Flea Theater in TriBeCa this month, “The Fre” will be staged, if you please, in a ball pit. Niegel Smith directs this excavation of the great swamplands of a culturally divided America. In a dizzy confluence of zoological nomenclature, the Bats (the Flea’s resident acting company) will portray the latter-day descendants of Aristophanes’ frogs. BEN BRANTLEY ‘BEES AND HONEY’ Every once in a while, a play comes along with characters so rounded and sympathetic that you wish you could follow them into their future, find out how things go, whether they’ll be OK. That’s how I felt after a moving, very funny reading of Guadalís Del Carmen’s “Bees and Honey,” part of Labyrinth Theater Company’s Barn Series back in January. I had never encountered Del Carmen’s work before, but I instantly fell for her voice. Making its world premiere in a Labyrinth production at the Cherry Lane Theater on April 6, “Bees and Honey” is a love story set in Washington Heights. Johaira, a lawyer, has been with Manuel, a mechanic, for eight years, and they’re sexy-sweet together, even if they come from very different places in the city’s Dominican culture, and even if her feminism has yet to tame his macho tendencies. Sean Carvajal — whose ability to find the helplessness within posturing masculinity won him a 2018 Obie Award for Stephen Adly Guirgis’s “Jesus Hopped the ‘A’ Train” — stars as Manuel, opposite Maribel Martinez as Johaira. Melissa Crespo directs. Del Carmen, a current member of Ars Nova’s Play Group, has rooted her play as firmly in Dominican New York as in the sexual politics of our time. This is a romantic dramedy that wrestles with complexity. LAURA COLLINS-HUGHES ‘ASSASSINS’ I used to think there was never a good moment for “Assassins.” The Off Broadway premiere of the musical about nine would-be president-killers opened in December 1990, just as the Persian Gulf war erupted. Was it too unpatriotic at a time of foreign battle? In any case, it disappeared far quicker than might be expected from a brilliant new work by Stephen Sondheim (music and lyrics) and Jerome Weidman (book). Eleven years later, in anticipation of the show’s Broadway debut, final auditions were about to be held — on Sept. 11, 2001. The production was canceled. Was it too provocative at a time of homeland crisis? Another three years on, Broadway was apparently willing to handle the eerie musical in which, among other time-bending fantasias, John Wilkes Booth goads Lee Harvey Oswald to make his mark by shooting John F. Kennedy. Joe Mantello’s carny-nightmare production was what finally convinced me that I’d had it backward. There’s never not a good moment for “Assassins.” Certainly not this moment: A major Off Broadway revival at Classic Stage Company opens on April 16. A luxury cast from top to bottom — starting with Steven Pasquale as Booth and Ethan Slater as Oswald — it is directed by John Doyle, whose aesthetic is the opposite of luxurious. Playing against the richness of the music and mise-en-scène, he is more apt to reveal, as a deep cut reveals bone, the conditions of inequity that create, in Sondheim’s memorable phrase, “another national anthem.” That’s the one urging America’s losers to take whatever desperate shot they can. JESSE GREEN ‘THREE SISTERS’ For months and months, New York Theater Workshop let slip only a few specifics about its revival of this Chekhov play. As enticement, they were more than enough — the show’s director, Sam Gold, whose radical Broadway rethink of “The Glass Menagerie” was simply shattering; and two stars: Greta Gerwig, notable lately for her big-screen foray, Louisa May Alcott’s “Little Women”; and Oscar Isaac, who won raves in the title role of Gold’s “Hamlet” at the Public Theater three seasons ago. Then came further details, and what looked like a hot ticket for downtown connoisseurs morphed with lightning speed into a must-see for its May-July run. The adaptation? It’s by Clare Barron, of “Dance Nation.” Appearing alongside Gerwig’s Masha and Isaac’s Vershinin? Quincy Tyler Bernstine (“Marys Seacole”) as Olga, the eldest sister; Emily Davis (“Is This A Room”) as Natasha, the sister-in-law; and as Chebutykin, the doctor, Steve Buscemi — who hasn’t done a play since “The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui” with Al Pacino in 2002. If it were just star-casting, that would be one thing. This is dream-casting. Let’s abandon, caution, shall we? Let’s get our hopes way up. LAURA COLLINS-HUGHES NEW YORK CITY BALLET What do the choreographers Jamar Roberts and Pam Tanowitz have in common? (Aside from their obsession with modern dance, that is.) When Mr. Roberts was in middle school and watching dance videos, nearly everything he saw was of New York City Ballet. Ms. Tanowitz has done the same thing for years, camping out for hours at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts and studying the works of two of her heroes, George Balanchine and Jerome Robbins. This spring, City Ballet has commissioned works by both Mr. Roberts, the resident choreographer and a veteran member of Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, and Ms. Tanowitz. These promise to be welcome, refreshing additions to the repertory, but even better is how each choreographer — despite being an outsider — will approach the City Ballet stage from a place of love. This will be Ms. Tanowitz’s second piece for the company. Following up on her “Bartok Ballet” of last year, Ms. Tanowitz will braid her inventive footwork and crisp musicality in a new work, premiering April 24 and set to Ted Hearne’s “Law of Mosaics.” Ms. Tanowitz sees her commission as an experiment. In an email interview, she said, “How do you change the governing principles of creating a work in an environment that has its own history and at the same time stay true to yourself?” Her ballet will feature 14 dancers, lighting by Brandon Stirling Baker, as well as costumes by Tome, which lent a previous work of hers, for the Martha Graham company, a magisterial elegance. The women, she said, will dance on point. And she has many steps up her sleeve for couples. “All my notes are spatial patterns and puzzles until I get in the room,” she said. “I have a version that starts with full cast onstage and leave one by one and then I have the reverse.” As for Mr. Roberts, his first work for City Ballet — “Three Encounters at the End of Some World,” opening May 7 — is in part a response to a quotation by Balanchine: “Dancers are instruments, like a piano the choreographer plays.” He has previously created two urgent, sweeping dances for the Ailey company. Here, he wants to explore his cast — three men and three women — as individuals. “What about finding the beauty and the flaws in something that is actually human?” Mr. Roberts said. “I just want to know who they are, and I want to find that out through the work.” The springboard for “Three Encounters,” set to music by Kyle Preston, is the notion of science fiction and fantasy — and how they relates to storied ballets like “Swan Lake” and “The Nutcracker,” which require the suspension of disbelief. Mr. Roberts described the mood of his premiere as dire, imbued by a sense of desperation. “It’s an X-ray being put on these little private dramas backlit by something that feels really epic,” he said. “Like the feeling of it being the end of the world: how we continue to love in the midst of duress.” GIA KOURLAS OONA DOHERTY A car pulls up to the curb of a city street, blasting house music. The driver gets out, opens the trunk — or in Northern Irish parlance, the boot — and out stumbles the dancer and choreographer Oona Doherty, like a fighter ready for a match. This is the beginning of “Hope Hunt and Lazarus and the Birds of Paradise,” a compilation of solos that Ms. Doherty, who grew up and lives in Belfast, will bring to the Harkness Dance Festival at the 92nd Street Y on March 6 and 7. It should be a welcome shock to the Y’s tame stretch of Lexington Avenue on the Upper East Side. And yet this maneuver — the prelude to a performance inside in the intimate Buttenweiser Hall — is not so shocking in the context of Ms. Doherty’s work, which exudes toughness and pushes the body to often perilous extremes. A daredevil darling of contemporary dance in Europe, she has spent less time in the United States; this rare, too-brief appearance is not to be missed. In Ms. Doherty’s solos of the past several years, her body has become a conduit for expressions of working-class, Northern Irish masculinity, a subject she approaches with candor and compassion. In “Lazarus and the Birds of Paradise” from her four-part “Hard to be Soft: A Belfast Prayer,” she oscillates between aggressive posturing and more fragile, uncertain states. Her work for the Y culminates in a 30-minute D.J. set by her collaborator Joss Carter — perhaps a way to release the tension Ms. Doherty builds up, or to revel in it. SIOBHAN BURKE FLAMENCO FESTIVAL NEW YORK Working in a tradition where authenticity is revered — and often signaled by antique costumes and genealogical claims — flamenco artists who yearn to be contemporary are tempted to rebel. The insurgent archangel of the flamenco avant-garde is Israel Galván; and in his “Fla.co.men” (at N.Y.U. Skirball on March 13 as part of the 20th Flamenco Festival New York), he goes further out than ever, making absurd gestures and astonishing rhythms in concert with a band of subversives. Dancing in a corset or barefoot on a pile of coins, or just banging his head against a drum, Mr. Galván is always unpredictable. Such uninhibited invention can delight — and can easily tip over into tiresome self-indulgence. But the rest of the flamenco festival, spread across three weeks and 20 venues, looks arranged to vary the ratio of reverence and innovation nicely. In her “Caída del Cielo” (“Fallen From Heaven”), which takes place March 27 at New York City Center, the magnetic Rocío Molina may dance to thrashing electric guitars and roll on the floor. She may even leave tracks with a bloody dress and eat potato chips from her dominatrix harness. But her fall from a false ideal of perfection is nevertheless likely to be a genuinely flamenco dive into the soul. Other admirable artists take smaller steps away from the standard: Compañía Patricia Guerrero (March 13-14 at Baryshnikov Arts Center); Leonor Leal (March 14 at Le Poisson Rouge); Sara Cano (March 20-21 at the 92nd Street Y). But Compañía Manuel Liñán’s “¡Viva!” (April 3 at City Center) is a downright throwback. Six flamenco divas in traditional dress dance in a production that might have been made a century ago — except that here all the women are played, lovingly, by men. BRIAN SEIBERT DAVIDO As music’s borders grow ever more permeable, the Nigerian pop known as Afrobeats has been drawing an ever-expanding audience. Davido — David Adedeji Adeleke, who was born in Atlanta but built his career in Lagos, Nigeria, for the past decade — is a major figure in the movement; his 2019 album, “A Good Time,” featured American collaborators including Summer Walker, A Boogie Wit da Hoodie and Gunna. He is touring large clubs across North America this spring, including Terminal 5 in New York City on March 27. Afrobeats isn’t a particular rhythm, like dancehall or dembow. It’s more like a magnet, drawing on and realigning possibilities from across Africa and the African diaspora with a Nigerian sensibility. Davido’s songs have elements that are familiar to American audiences: crisp programmed drum-machine sounds, computer-processed vocals, guest rappers and R&B singers. Like rappers and reggaeton artists, he devotes most of his songs to bragging and romancing. But in Davido’s music, the programmed beats also mesh with African percussion, twisty guitar and keyboard lines and rhythms from across Africa and the Caribbean. Lyrics in English share space with African languages. And even with Auto-Tune, the personality in Davido’s voice still comes through. His Afrobeats is world music with an African aesthetic of smooth omnivorousness and calm mastery. JON PARELES STAGECOACH Of the many mainstream country music festivals that pepper the United States each spring and summer, Stagecoach has historically been the least preoccupied with orthodoxy. In part, that’s because of where it’s held — the Empire Polo Club in Indio, Calif., the same field that hosts Coachella — and who throws it: the Coachella promoter Goldenvoice, which isn’t unreasonably beholden to Nashville’s illuminati. But also, in recent years, country has been loosening up at the fringes, a movement well captured by the 14th iteration of this festival, which runs from April 24 to 26. At the superstar level, it offers an unlikely blend: the soaring Carrie Underwood and the swaggering Alan Jackson, the snarling Eric Church and the genial Thomas Rhett. But the middle section of the bill is most intriguing — the Southern rock titans ZZ Top; the soft-rock crooner Brett Young and also the hip-hop-conversant LoCash; the unerringly sincere Dan + Shay and the pitch-perfect ironists Midland. Stagecoach also showcases an impressive array of female singers: Gabby Barrett, Ingrid Andress, the Haden Triplets, RaeLynn, Nikki Lane, and naturally, Tanya Tucker, still collecting her flowers. And finally there are the outliers, acts that might not be booked at any other country festival, but make plenty of sense nonetheless, like the D.J.-producer carpetbagger Diplo and the queer country performance artist Orville Peck. And also the viral country-rap phenom Lil Nas X, who is a pop star though maybe not a country star (or for that matter, a rap star), but makes complete sense at a festival that’s an open-eared revue of the genre and the directions in which it may someday venture. JON CARAMANICA AMBROSE AKINMUSIRE Nowadays, young jazz musicians rarely have a chance for on-the-job training from their elders; the music is typically passed from one generation to the next in the classroom, not onstage. The trumpeter Ambrose Akinmusire, 37, is a product of this generation, but he’s not partisan to it. Like many of his academically trained peers, his compositions are obstacle courses, often driven by a conceptual conceit — but they also feel more directly affecting, more melodic, more subtly bound to tradition than most improvised music today. He would attribute that, in part, to his early years working under such bandleaders as Billy Higgins, Joe Henderson and Steve Coleman — though he also benefited from jazz-education programs. “I’ve never had beef with any type of academia. I just know that there are certain things that you have to experience,” he said recently. With “Banyan,” his latest project, which will have its New York debut March 27-28 at Jazz at Lincoln Center, Mr. Akinmusire wants to reinsert intergenerational exchange into the performance process. He interviewed some of his mentors, including Wayne Shorter and Henry Threadgill, and then wrote a suite for a 16-piece big band, to be performed in conversation with clips from the interviews. Joining the band onstage will be a parade of elder guest musicians: the saxophonist Gary Bartz, the trumpeter Tom Harrell and the drummer Jack DeJohnette. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO DAVÓNE TINES At just 33, the immensely gifted American bass-baritone Davóne Tines has won acclaim, and advanced the field of classical music, through frequent associations with living composers. In recent years he sang in the premiere of John Adams’s “Girls of the Golden West,” Matthew Aucoin’s “Crossing,” Terence Blanchard’s “Fire Shut Up in My Bones” and more, including the American premiere of Kaija Saariaho’s “Only the Sound Remains.” Working with the composer Michael Schachter, he adapted Langston Hughes’s 1931 poem “The Black Clown” into a teeming work of music theater and dance, winning raves for his ferocious performance. Mr. Tines may be most drawn to new, recent and overlooked pieces. But he still performs some standard repertory; it would be a loss if an artist like Mr. Tines’s didn’t. Both sides of his career will be on display when he performs on April 3 at Weill Recital Hall, as part of Carnegie Hall’s Evenings of Song series. His program is a model of adventurousness and a personal exploration. Joined by the pianist Adam Nielsen, he will sing arias from Bach cantatas and selections from “St. Matthew Passion,” alongside traditional spirituals and a diverse selection of songs by Margaret Bonds, a pioneering 20th-century black composer; Caroline Shaw, who has written a new work for Mr. Tines; Tyshawn Sorey, the drummer and composer who has excelled in jazz and contemporary classical idioms; and Julius Eastman, who died in 1990 and whose visionary work is now being rediscovered. The same night as this recital, the Philadelphia Orchestra is presenting Beethoven Symphonies in Carnegie’s main auditorium. But in the smaller Weill space, Mr. Tines’s program may have more to say about the future of classical music. ANTHONY TOMMASINI ‘KAT’A KABANOVA’ After sustained, brilliant advocacy over the past 60 years or so, the Czech composer Leos Janacek’s position in the operatic repertory is secure. But while his major works have advanced to the every-few-years stage at important companies, they deserve annual presences. Musically fresh, agile and impassioned, somehow sumptuously bristling, his scores are as dramatically taut as anything in opera: headlong, kitchen-sink dramas that evoke the plays of Arthur Miller. Janacek’s characters are always richly humane, even when they’re over 300 years old (“The Makropulos Case”) or animals (“The Cunning Little Vixen,” still absent at the Metropolitan Opera). In “Kat’a Kabanova,” from 1921, a young woman in the Russian countryside, trapped in a loveless marriage, strays to a lover — with tragic consequences. The Met is presenting just three performances of this bleak yet stirring piece, starting May 2, in its return to the company after 15 years. Janacek hasn’t been absent from the Met in the interim, with revivals of “Jenufa,” “Makropulos” and “From the House of the Dead.” But the sinewy longing of “Kat’a Kabanova,” in Jonathan Miller’s ominously spare Victorian staging, has been missed. Lothar Koenigs, who conducts with dramatic acuity, leads a revival starring, in the title role, the sympathetic soprano Susanna Phillips; she can seem mired as Musetta in endless runs of “La Bohème,” but has the opportunity here for a new path at the Met. The stalwart mezzo-soprano Dolora Zajick, her voice still potent, sings Kabanicha, Kat’a’s forbidding mother-in-law. Another superb veteran, the bass John Tomlinson, is Dikoj; the mezzo Daniela Mack and an excellent trio of tenors — Paul Appelby, Stefan Margita and, in his company debut, Pavel Cernoch — round out the cast in this exciting finale to the Met’s season. ZACHARY WOOLFE ‘DER RING DES NIBELUNGEN’ Last spring, the hot ticket for opera-lovers in New York City was the four-part “Ring” cycle at the Metropolitan Opera. This year, its stars have scattered around the world in new productions that could keep any Wagner pilgrim satisfied for months. First is a “Ring” à la française — “Das Rheingold” rendered as “L’Or du Rhin” — with the premiere of Calixto Bieito’s new production for the Paris Opera, opening April 2. (“Die Walküre” follows in May, then “Siegfried,” “Götterdämmerung” and the full cycle in the fall.) Mr. Bieito hasn’t shared the details of his staging; but he has never been a director of modest ideas. Philippe Jordan, who led the Met’s “Ring,” will conduct. Other Wagner veterans abound, including Jonas Kaufmann and Eva-Maria Westbroek, reunited as Siegmund and Sieglinde in “Die Walküre.” David Pountney’s “Ring” for Lyric Opera of Chicago comes to its conclusion with three cycles beginning April 13, 20 and 27. This staging is like a theater troupe’s show, Wotan’s schemes literalized as puppeteering. Christine Goerke, celebrated as a blazing Brünnhilde last year, will reprise the role here. If there’s a “Ring” as anticipated as Mr. Bieito’s, it’s Stefan Herheim’s for the Deutsche Oper in Berlin, beginning with “Das Rheingold” on June 12, conducted by Donald Runnicles. Again, details are scant; but Mr. Herheim’s credit alone is reason to see it. The most exclusive “Ring” may be where it was first presented in the 1870s: Bayreuth. While some details about the festival’s new staging, opening July 27, are alarming — the director, Valentin Schwarz, was hired only last year — the cast is anything but. Günther Groissböck will unveil his Wotan; Andreas Schager is a proven Siegfried; and Lise Davidsen, who had an astonishing Bayreuth debut in “Tannhäuser” last summer, will add Sieglinde to her repertoire there. JOSHUA BARONE LONG PLAY and BIG EARS FESTIVAL Bang on a Can’s 12-hour (or longer) marathon concerts loom large in New York City music history. From 1987 to 2018, they proved a consistent delight — and were often free. They were where seemingly incompatible composers could meet on a program, if not in person, and where adventurous pop and jazz artists could be welcomed into the once cordoned-off environment of contemporary classical music. Those Bang on a Can marathons are now on hold until further notice. The organizers, after losing their regular space, started a new initiative, called LOUD Weekend, at MASS MoCA, last year — skipping New York entirely. This spring, they’re back in town, with a festival they’ve named Long Play. Over 50 acts will fan out around 10 Brooklyn locations, May 1-3. The Art Ensemble of Chicago will headline one evening. Steve Reich’s piece for rock ensemble, “2x5,” will be played completely live by two groups (instead of against a backing track). Electronic music by Éliane Radigue will share space with a summit by two leading piano improvers, Kris Davis and Craig Taborn. Long Play, however, won’t be free. An all-weekend ticket runs $195; V.I.P. passes, at $350, allow you to skip the line at each venue. If that setup looks familiar, perhaps you’ve encountered it at one of the world’s greatest music bashes: the Big Ears Festival in Knoxville, Tenn., March 26-29 this year. The Long Play organizers have been regular participants at various editions of Big Ears — and have tipped their cap to it. Any sense of a competition between the festivals is a friendly one: The Bang on a Can All-Stars will appear with Meredith Monk at both events. SETH COLTER WALLS",The New York Times
2020,What to Stream on Valentine’s Day,"Whether you’re sentimental or rom-com averse, our culture writers offer suggestions for a range of interests. ‘The Thomas Crown Affair’ | YouTube, Amazon Prime Video, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu Make sure you watch the 1968 version, not the 1999 remake. While the newer film is fine enough, the original is a textbook example of classic Hollywood at its sexiest. Steve McQueen plays a millionaire who robs banks for fun, and Faye Dunaway is the insurance investigator on his tail. There is something downright intoxicating about the two stars’ charisma, and their chemistry feels as inexorable as tectonic plates moving toward each other. When they engage in a game of chess — a real one, though the metaphorical aspect is also there — you might have to fan yourself. Michel Legrand’s alternately lush and driving score is a gem of its own. ELISABETH VINCENTELLI ‘Atlantic City’ | YouTube, Amazon Prime, Google Play, Vudu, iTunes, Hulu When Burt Lancaster and Susan Sarandon appeared in Louis Malle’s 1980 heartbreaker, he was almost twice her age. Yet after his rueful character, a small-time hood named Lou, takes a shine to Sally (Sarandon), a struggling oyster-bar waitress, their connection develops a melancholy magic. Blending romance and crime caper, Malle has crafted a dreamy, atmospheric study of a man, and a city, in decline, and Lancaster plays him with so much tattered heart that we easily understand Sally’s surrender to Lou’s quiet courtship. Watching him spy on her each night as she stands gloriously naked in her kitchen window, rubbing lemons on her skin to banish the odor of a job she detests, there is something innocent and inoffensive in his peeking. To him, she represents all he has lost — and all he might yet salvage. JEANNETTE CATSOULIS ‘Brief Encounter’ | Criterion Channel, Amazon Prime Video, iTunes It’s not a spoiler to say that the love affair in “Brief Encounter” does not last: The title is pretty clear on that point. Yet you will hope against hope that Laura (Celia Johnson) and Alec (Trevor Howard) somehow find a way to end up together. The enduring appeal of David Lean’s 1945 romantic masterpiece lies in the push and pull between two people’s mutual attraction and their sense of honor and duty. (They are both married to other people.) The film gently suggests the all-encompassing power of love with characters who maintain a stiff upper lip. Slight gestures and sideways glances resonate like deflagrations of unabashed desire in this context, and the effect is devastatingly emotional. ELISABETH VINCENTELLI ‘My Bloody Valentine’ | Shudder, Crackle, YouTube, Amazon Prime, Google Play, Vudu, iTunes This Valentine’s Day, do like many horror fans do: Fire up the streaming service Shudder and snuggle up with your boo. Start with “My Bloody Valentine,” a 1981 Canadian slasher film about a mining town besieged on Valentine’s Day by a killer with a pickax. It’s gory and deranged, but also a strangely nostalgic slasher classic. Follow that with the new Shudder podcast “Horror Noire: Uncut,” a fascinating six-episode valentine to African-American film buffs’ love-hate romance with horror cinema, based on Shudder’s acclaimed 2019 documentary. The podcast is also available on Apple Podcasts and other platforms. ERIK PIEPENBURG ‘Dude, Where’s My Car?’ | YouTube, iTunes, Google Play, Vudu, Amazon Prime Video, Cinemax “Dude, where’s my car?” “Where’s your car, dude?” Were more romantic words ever spoken? Ashton Kutcher and Seann William Scott still make a dynamic couple in this 20-year-old stoner comedy that takes repetition to a place of absurdist enlightenment. The premise is simple: Two friends, Jesse and Chester, wake up and can’t remember the night before, including the whereabouts of said car. Yes, much of the laughs come from a puerile place, but there’s some genuine heart amid the gags. And the chemistry between these bros is palatable, from their shirtless tussle while trying to figure out what the new tattoos on their backs say to a one-upmanship showdown they have with Fabio that results in Jesse and Chester making out with each other. Sweet! MEKADO MURPHY ‘San Junipero’ (‘Black Mirror’ Season 3) | Netflix The British series “Black Mirror” is famously bleak, but the Season 3 episode “San Junipero” has what passes as a happy ending in the show’s universe. Make no mistake, though: Tears will flow, prompted by a love that defies time, space, physical reality and even death itself. Mackenzie Davis’s shy, nerdy Yorkie finds herself pulled into the orbit of Gugu Mbatha-Raw’s extroverted, magnetic Kelly. The story jumps around the space-time continuum but is mostly set in 1987 America — if only, you may suspect, so it could put Belinda Carlisle’s “Heaven Is a Place on Earth” and Robbie Nevil’s “C’est la Vie” to memorable use. While technology tends to be a nihilistic force in the series, it comes to the aid of love in “San Junipero.” Imagine that. ELISABETH VINCENTELLI In Mati Diop’s feature debut, two lovers, Ada (Mama Sané) and Souleiman (Ibrahima Traoré), are separated by forces beyond their control. Although Ada is betrothed to a wealthy man, Omar (Babacar Sylla), her affections remain with Souleiman, a suave but less prosperous suitor who leaves their coastal town in Senegal in hopes of finding steady work in Spain. Strange things begin to happen back in Senegal after Souleiman is feared dead, including a mysterious fire that disrupts Ada’s wedding celebration. Diop and the cinematographer Claire Mathon (who also worked on “Portrait of a Lady on Fire,” back in theaters this week) frame Ada and Souleiman’s enduring love as an epic romance, a passion that reverberates through Fatima Al Qadiri’s haunting score. MONICA CASTILLO ‘Eames: The Architect and the Painter’ | Amazon Prime, YouTube, Google Play Movies & TV, iTunes It all started with a chair. When Charles Eames met Ray Kaiser, they were both at the height of their fields (architecture for him, abstract art for her). In his love letters, he dreamed of a future together. He destroyed her letters. After all, he was married, with a daughter. Yet their connection sparked a professional partnership that helped define design and consumer culture. The film paints the picture of a love rooted in work and a shared joy in making things. Which is to say it manages to make the business of furniture and experimental filmmaking seem terribly romantic. Charles and Ray, who eventually married, are seen smiling together in archival photos from the 1940s, ’50s and beyond, look like a pair of delightful, delighted oddballs, fussing over designs that would eventually make their way into homes across the country. Their bond flourishes as they find success, is buffeted by industry criticism, the era’s sexism, and even infidelity. Still, they forged ahead, leaving their mark on just about everything they touched. #Goals. KWAME OPAM ‘Broadcast News’ | Amazon, iTunes, Vudu, YouTube, Google Play One of the great love-triangle movies of all time, James L. Brooks’s comedy-drama (set in the world of network television news) finds Holly Hunter, in her breakthrough role, as a high-strung producer torn between two potential partners: Albert Brooks (as a reporter with a great mind but no physical spark) and William Hurt (as the hotshot new anchor with a killer bod and an empty head). They’re all playing recognizable types, and dig the expected laughs out of those personalities (and their interpersonal dynamics). But Brooks’s witty, sophisticated screenplay doesn’t treat them like stock characters; these people are all both likable and deeply flawed, and the film’s refreshing lack of clear choices makes Hunter’s romantic predicament all the more poignant. JASON BAILEY ‘Jodhaa Akbar’ | Netflix Some love stories end in weddings; others begin with one. In the Bollywood historical romance “Jodhaa Akbar,” the Mughal emperor Akbar marries the Hindu princess Jodhaa as part of a peace arrangement with the king of a rival province. Jodhaa resents being used as a political pawn and forced into a stranger’s home, but Akbar’s acceptance of her independence and religion slowly wins her over. Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and Hrithik Roshan are resplendently charismatic as the lead royals: the scene in which, armed with swords, they duel it out to resolve a lover’s quarrel is one of the sexiest moments ever committed to screen. The director Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s knack for swooning romance and political intrigue — and the stunningly designed set — make the film worth every minute of its three-and-a-half-hour run time. DEVIKA GIRISH ‘The Thin Man’ | YouTube, Amazon Prime Video, iTunes, Google Play, Vudu Who ever said marriage killed romance? Not Nick and Nora Charles, for whom life is a euphoric succession of dry martinis and drier banter, seasoned with a little detective action here and there. The first (and best) in what would become a successful franchise, “The Thin Man” (1934) is Hollywood screwball comedy at its most sophisticated: Everybody looks great in evening wear, cracks wise, and downs staggering amounts of alcohol while keeping their wits about them. But the key to the movie’s enduring appeal is its portrayal of an enviably liberated modern couple, played by William Powell and Myrna Loy. Partners in crime-solving and sly sex appeal, Nick and Nora don’t just love each other — they absolutely delight in each other’s company. ELISABETH VINCENTELLI ‘Crossing Delancey’ | Amazon, iTunes, Vudu, YouTube, Google Play Opposites attract, in spite of all attempts to stifle said attraction, in this bewitching 1988 romantic comedy from the director Joan Micklin Silver. Amy Irving stars as Izzy, a downtown woman who’s moved uptown and fancies herself a sophisticate. So she dismisses her grandmother’s attempt to find her a husband via a matchmaker — especially when the suitor is the neighborhood pickle vendor (Peter Riegert). “I don’t live down here, I live uptown,” she assures him, and refuses to admit her obvious attraction, because of the backward step a romance with him seems to represent. Susan Sandler’s complex screenplay (based on her play) hits the expected will-they-or-won’t-they rom-com beats, but underscores them with complicated dynamics of cultural assimilation; the result is an sparkling, dizzy New York romance in the “Moonstruck” tradition. JASON BAILEY ‘Heartbreaker’ | YouTube, Google Play, iTunes, Amazon Prime Video This French charmer may remind you of the romantic-caper style that flourished in Hollywood from the late 1950s to the mid-60s. It is so sneakily funny and charming that it can shoulder such references as “To Catch a Thief,” whose Riviera setting this 2010 film echoes. Alex (Romain Duris) has a very special profession: Anxious friends and parents pay him to break up mismatched couples by seducing the woman. Things go south after Alex is hired to wreck the impending nuptials of Juliette (Vanessa Paradis) and Jonathan (a pre-“Walking Dead” Andrew Lincoln), and he finds himself actually drawn to his target. As with the best rom-coms, the romance feels ineluctable, no matter how hard the two leads fight it — but what fun it is to watch Duris and Paradis spar. ELISABETH VINCENTELLI ‘The Souvenir’ | YouTube, Google Play, Vudu, Amazon Prime Video The best rule of love is to love yourself. It’s a lesson that the film student Julie (Honor Swinton Byrne) learns the hard way as she falls under the spell of a dashing and charming older man, Anthony (Tom Burke). He’s not quite what he seems: As his drug addiction gradually strains the relationship, they engage in a vicious cycle of breakups and reconciliations. As much as this movie is about a bad romance, it’s also about what happens after Julie walks away. Based on her own youthful heartache, the director Joanna Hogg reimagines her experience in a gorgeous work of art, one that wrestles with the messy feelings of a toxic love affair. MONICA CASTILLO ‘Bull Durham’ | YouTube, Google Play, Amazon Prime Video, iTunes, Vudu, Hulu ‘Tin Cup’ | YouTube, Amazon Prime Video, iTunes, Google Play, Vudu With two sportsmance classics under their belt, the director Ron Shelton and his star, Kevin Costner, are the rightful masters of this subgenre. In “Bull Durham” (1988), Costner portrays a woeful Minor Leaguer courting baseball-crazy Susan Sarandon; in “Tin Cup” (1996), his self-sabotaging golfer becomes entangled with a psychologist played by Rene Russo. What’s great about these movies is that they show adults figuring things out, rather than, as has been the case with too many recent rom-coms, leaving characters stuck in arrested development. While the sports action can feel a little hokey — but then, that’s exactly how we like sports action — the human element has a wonderfully genuine lived-in quality. And, in “Bull Durham,” when Costner’s Crash lists “long, slow, deep, soft, wet kisses that last three days” as one of the things he believes in — well, game over. ELISABETH VINCENTELLI ‘Phoenix’ | Criterion Channel, YouTube, Amazon Prime Video, iTunes, Google Play ‘Transit’ | Vudu, YouTube, Google Play, Amazon Prime Video In “Phoenix,” by the German director Christian Petzold, a Holocaust survivor, Nelly, is recruited by her husband — who fails to recognize her after her facial reconstruction surgery — to pretend to be his “dead” wife so he can obtain her inheritance. Nelly, clinging to the charade of the love that she’s lost forever, plays along with his “Vertigo”-esque scheme even after his betrayals become slowly evident. Keep the tissues handy for Petzold’s “Transit,” about a Jewish refugee in Marseilles who is mistaken for and then starts impersonating a dead writer, and becomes enamored with the writer’s wife. Shot in a seductive, minimalist style, both movies (strange doppelgängers of each other) beautifully capture the tragic desire to become someone else — someone new — through love.

2020,What to Watch For as Michael Bloomberg Debates,"New York Today [Want to get New York Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.] It’s Wednesday. Weather: Bright and breezy, with a high in the mid-40s. Alternate-side parking: In effect until Feb. 26 (Ash Wednesday). Michael Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor and current presidential candidate, seems to have put a campaign ad on every television channel, radio station and website in recent weeks. Tonight, voters will hear from him directly as he joins five other Democratic candidates for a debate in Nevada. [Michael Bloomberg surged in polls and qualified for the Democratic debate in Las Vegas.] This is Mr. Bloomberg’s first political debate in more than a decade; his last one, as a candidate for mayor, was in 2009. He will get questions about his lavish campaign spending — $400 million so far — and is likely to have a ready answer. In mayoral debates, he defended this spending, much of it on wall-to-wall ads, by saying he was simply offering voters a chance to hear his record. And Mr. Bloomberg has said in his ads that by self-financing his campaign, he is not doing the bidding of any donors — playing to voters who worry about politicians beholden to special-interest groups. When he first ran for mayor, in 2001, Mr. Bloomberg looked bored, rolling his eyes and sighing as his opponent spoke at one of two debates in the general election. In his 2005 and 2009 debates, Mr. Bloomberg kept those gestures to a minimum. Mr. Bloomberg recently apologized for comments he made in 2015 about stop-and-frisk, the policing strategy that was found to be unconstitutional in the way it was practiced in New York City during his tenure. He will be asked about those comments and other remarks he’s made over the years. In a 2001 debate, Mr. Bloomberg was asked about quotes attributed to him, including one that characterized domestic violence as a quality-of-life crime. Mr. Bloomberg, visibly upset, responded by saying the words “were certainly said, but out of context.” Over the years, he has responded more calmly to such questions. For example, in 2005, he was asked about having said poor people get better health care than rich people. “Do you honestly believe those words?” his debate opponent asked. Mr. Bloomberg took a breath and gave his original comment a different spin. “What I was saying is I cannot tell you how proud I am of the progress our public hospitals, our 11 public hospitals, have made.” The first Democratic politician to debate Mr. Bloomberg — then a Republican — was Mark Green. At the time, he was the New York City public advocate, and they squared off in the 2001 mayoral general election. “Halfway through the debate I remember explicitly saying to myself, ‘Wait, he’s hanging in there,’” Mr. Green told The Times this week. Mr. Green’s debate prep did not include the customary tactic of sparring with a mock opponent. Why not? Mr. Green chalked it up to “overconfidence,” because Mr. Bloomberg “was far behind and he had a very small public record at that time. And it was stupid.” Tonight, Mr. Green will be watching whether Mr. Bloomberg “maintains his poise under pressure.” He called the former three-term mayor a “quick study” and a “disciplined” student of government. “He’ll likely be able to fill 90 seconds of time in response to any question or criticism,” he said. ‘Hi Haters’: Why New Jersey’s Twitter Account Is Like No Other Weinstein’s Lawyer Wrote an Article Addressing Jurors.

They had met the president and dean, but these were the people, her mother explained, who would truly be taking care of her. Ms. Casteel recalled being shy, but her mother was right: The first person she approached, a baker named Betty, became a surrogate parent. “She cooked me Sunday meals, would bring me birthday cakes,” she said. Nearly a decade later, they still talk on the phone. “There’s really something magical that can happen when you take that risk,” Ms. Casteel said. This particular alchemy, the kind that begins with a nervous hello and transforms strangers into family, lies at the core of Ms. Casteel’s practice. “Within Reach,” her first institutional show in New York — an exhibition of nearly 40 canvases spanning seven years — opens at the New Museum today. Nearly 31, she has attracted widespread acclaim for colossal portraits of friends and neighbors, works celebrated for their tenderness, keen social commentary and technical brio. In recent series, she has portrayed her undergraduate students at Rutgers University, Newark, where she is an art professor, as well as street vendors and business owners in Harlem, where she lives with her partner, the photographer David Schulze. Ms. Casteel, who exclusively paints people of color, is passionate about exalting members of her community who might not otherwise see themselves on the walls of art museums. “I knew I wanted to use this opportunity to place my mom and I in the art historical canon,” said Emmanuel Amoakohene, one of Ms. Casteel’s students, who posed with his mother in 2019. The scale of the radiant, seven-foot canvas, he said, “makes me feel like I matter.” It’s Wednesday — take that risk.

2020,Kobe Bryant’s Public Memorial Service Is Today,"“A Celebration of Life for Kobe and Gianna Bryant” is expected to run on Monday from about 10 a.m. to 12:30 p.m., Pacific time. LOS ANGELES — For the bulk of his career with the Lakers, Kobe Bryant turned Staples Center into his stage, fashioning basketball into performance art. He soared and scowled, endearing himself to fans who celebrated his competitive drive. It is not often that an athlete becomes synonymous with an arena, but Staples Center seemed to belong to Bryant in a singular way. “He helped build this arena,” said Lee Zeidman, the president of Staples Center since it opened in 1999. In the wake of Bryant’s death last month, there was some discussion among family members, including his wife, Vanessa, and city officials about the site of a public memorial service, Zeidman said. An outdoor venue like the Rose Bowl, the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum or Dodger Stadium would have been able to accommodate the most people. “A lot of people were weighing in,” Zeidman said in an interview last week. “But for the men and women who work at Staples Center, we felt that this was the place to do it. He put five championship banners on the walls here. Both of his numbers are retired here. And we’re very proud and humbled that Vanessa chose to do it here.” On Monday morning, about 20,000 people — celebrities, athletes, family members, fans and friends — will fill Staples Center to honor Bryant and his 13-year-old daughter, Gianna, who were among nine people killed in a helicopter crash on Jan. 26 near Calabasas, Calif. The public memorial, called “A Celebration of Life for Kobe and Gianna Bryant,” is expected to run from about 10 a.m. to 12:30 p.m., Pacific time, Zeidman said, followed by several invitation-only receptions. An undisclosed number of tickets were sold to the general public through a lottery. Those who were unable to purchase tickets will not be permitted access to L.A. Live, the entertainment complex adjacent to Staples Center. Officials are discouraging people from trying to congregate near the arena. But in a fitting tribute to Bryant, the memorial service will be bracketed by basketball: The Lakers played the Boston Celtics on Sunday at the arena, and the Clippers will face the Memphis Grizzlies there on Monday night. Staples Center has hosted public memorial events in the past, including one for Michael Jackson in 2009 and another for Nipsey Hussle last year. “We’re accustomed to doing these big types of events,” Zeidman said. But Bryant had a unique relationship with Staples Center as the arena’s most magnetic draw for 17 consecutive years — and he formed ties to many who still work there. Andy Bernstein, the longtime photographer for the Lakers who collaborated with Bryant on Bryant’s 2018 book, “The Mamba Mentality: How I Play,” was invited to attend Monday’s event as a guest. But Bernstein declined so he could work at the event in his usual role, as a photographer. It was what Bryant would have wanted him to do, he said. “Part of the ‘Mamba mentality’ was strength,” Bernstein said in a telephone interview. “The strength to overcome. The strength to get through stuff. I think about Kobe and what he would be saying in this moment. He would be saying, ‘You’ve got to do what you’ve got to do.’” Entering the weekend, Zeidman said the list of invited guests, speakers and performers was still “very fluid.” The Lakers and the Bryant family were coordinating the program, Zeidman said, and few details had been disclosed. Zeidman said he was not privy to many of them. “There’s been virtually no information outside of instructions to save all of our dressing rooms,” he said. A number of celebrities and athletes are expected to be on hand, including members of the Lakers and the Clippers, and former N.B.A. stars like Shaquille O’Neal and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, the league’s career leading scorer. Stephen Curry of the Golden State Warriors and Luka Doncic of the Dallas Mavericks are among the current players who have said they will attend, along with Luke Walton, a Lakers teammate of Bryant’s who now coaches the Sacramento Kings. Sabrina Ionescu, a guard for the University of Oregon women’s basketball team, told the Pac-12 Network that she was among those who had been invited to speak. Ionescu had grown close to Bryant, a vocal advocate for women’s sports in recent years, and to Gianna, who had dreamed of playing in the W.N.B.A. “Just there to honor them and everything that they’ve done for me,” said Ionescu, who plans to rejoin her teammates in time for a game at Stanford on Monday night. Players from the N.H.L.’s Los Angeles Kings and the W.N.B.A.’s Los Angeles Sparks will also attend the memorial, Zeidman said. The Kings and the Sparks play their home games at Staples Center, and both hang their various championship banners not far from those that Bryant helped win for the Lakers. Zeidman said the Sparks’ banners had taken on added significance for him. When Bryant was courtside with Gianna to watch the Lakers play the Mavericks in December, he noticed that the Sparks’ banners were not illuminated. Bryant told Rob Pelinka, the Lakers’ vice president for basketball operations, to tell Zeidman that it bothered him, going so far as to call it an “injustice.” “That was the last thing I heard from him,” Zeidman said. “So I’m going to figure out how to light those banners during Lakers games and other events that are here.” In the week after the accident, Zeidman said, 250,000 to 350,000 people visited the plaza outside Staples Center to pay their respects to Bryant and the other victims. They shared their grief by leaving 1,300 basketballs, 500 handwritten notes, 350 pairs of sneakers and more flower bouquets than anyone could count. The flowers will be turned into mulch that will be spread around L.A. Live in the next two weeks, Zeidman said. The rest of the offerings — all the sneakers and photographs and jerseys and stuffed animals — were cataloged and stored in 37 shipping containers. “We saved all of it,” Zeidman said. “We’re just waiting for direction from the Bryant family and from the Lakers on what they’d like to do with it all.” Ahead of Monday’s memorial event, Zeidman has found himself reminiscing. He recalled Bryant’s final game for the Lakers, in 2016, when luminaries such as Jack Nicholson, Jay-Z, Snoop Dogg and Kanye West turned out at Staples Center. They watched Bryant miss his first five shots. Zeidman turned to Tim Harris, an executive with the Lakers. “Man, this is not starting well,” Zeidman recalled telling Harris. But Bryant, as usual, was undeterred. He kept shooting — and shooting. He finished with 60 points on 50 shots in a narrow win, ensuring that he went out in style. A few days after Bryant died, Zeidman watched a replay of the game. He cried, he said, every time the camera panned to Bryant’s wife and daughters. “The city is going to mourn for a long time,” Zeidman said, “and I believe the N.B.A. will mourn for a long time. Will this event give us some closure? Yes. But you have five families that lost loved ones — young children — and it’s going to take some time to get past this. It’s just a tragedy.” Marc Stein contributed reporting.",The New York Times
2020,Highlights From the Nevada Caucuses: Bernie Sanders Is Declared the Winner,"Officials with the Nevada Democratic Party and the Democratic National Committee stressed all week that they had gone to school on lessons learned from the bungled Iowa caucuses, when a smartphone app for reporting results crashed and phone lines to report results were jammed for hours. But by 11:00 p.m. Eastern time — more than seven hours after Nevada’s caucuses began, and four hours after most of them closed — Nevada Democrats still have only reported results from about 23 percent of the state’s precincts. The tardiness stems from new caucus rules mandated by the D.N.C. that require the state party to collect more than 100 data points from each of Nevada’s 2,097 precincts. The state party also installed a duplicative reporting system to try to prevent Iowa-style mishaps that led to a litany of mathematical errors that had to be corrected later. Nevada’s protracted vote-counting served to rob several Democratic candidates who had hoped to claim a second-place finish on Saturday night and position themselves as the moderate alternative to Bernie Sanders, who won what appears to be a commanding victory in Nevada.",The New York Times
2020,Highlights From South Carolina: CNN Town Halls and Clyburn’s Endorsement,"Elizabeth Warren reiterated on Tuesday that she would be open to staying in the presidential primary even if someone else had amassed an insurmountable plurality — but not a majority — of pledged delegates. That was the position of every other Democrat on the debate stage in Las Vegas last week besides Senator Bernie Sanders — who, as the current front-runner, appears to be the most likely candidate to wind up in the lead in such a situation. “You do know that that was Bernie’s position in 2016?” Ms. Warren said, pushing back on a Sanders supporter in the audience at a CNN town hall who had asked about the issue. She said Mr. Sanders’s “last play” in that race was to win over the party’s so-called superdelegates. She said she would stick to the rules outlined by the Democratic National Committee. “Bernie had a big role in writing the rules. I didn’t,” Warren said. “I don’t see how come you get to change it just because you see an advantage.” Tyson Brody, an adviser to Mr. Sanders, responded to Ms. Warren’s remarks on Twitter. “So the plan isn’t to win then,” he wrote, before deleting the tweet.",The New York Times
2020,Near Tie Between Pete Buttigieg and Bernie Sanders in Iowa,"The Iowa Democratic Party put out a series of incremental updates on the caucus results on Wednesday, none of which really moved the overall picture — until last night. Now, Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg are nearly tied in the state delegate count, a measure Mr. Buttigieg previously led by a small but seemingly stable margin. Helping Mr. Sanders close the gap were results from satellite caucuses, sites set up both in Iowa and in far-flung locations — places like Florida and the former Soviet republic of Georgia — to make the caucus process somewhat more accessible. With the latest results included, Mr. Buttigieg and Mr. Sanders are now separated by just three state delegates out of 2,098 allocated so far, with Mr. Buttigieg ahead. With a batch of caucus results still outstanding, the race is clearly too close to call by the delegate measure, the traditional metric for determining a winner in Iowa. What has remained consistent, however, is Mr. Sanders’s lead in both the first and final alignments of caucusing — effectively a measure of the popular vote. He is ahead of Mr. Buttigieg by 1.5 percentage points in the final raw-vote total and a margin of about 2,500 votes, a lead that is highly unlikely to disappear in the last rounds of reporting. Also unchanged has been the order of finish among the rest of the candidates: Elizabeth Warren has maintained her position in third place, by both delegate and popular-vote measures, followed by Joseph R. Biden Jr. and then Amy Klobuchar.",The New York Times
2020,D.N.C. Leader Now Calls for ‘Surgical’ Recanvass in Iowa,"Less than 10 hours after announcing that he was “calling on the Iowa Democratic Party to immediately begin a recanvass,” Tom Perez, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said he had actually been calling only for isolated recanvassing of areas where irregularities had been reported in the caucus results. In an interview with Rachel Maddow on MSNBC late Thursday, Mr. Perez pointed to “questions raised” about the tabulations in specific precincts, such as one in Black Hawk County where some state delegate equivalents were mistakenly awarded to Deval Patrick. “We have a shared interest in making sure we had accuracy, so what we did today is asking to make sure that if people need a recanvass in this precinct or that precinct, that it’s done,” he said. In response to a follow-up question from Ms. Maddow, he confirmed that he was not calling for a full, statewide recanvass. “Assuming no candidate files a request, it will be surgical, surgical,” Mr. Perez said. “Because we want to make sure if somebody raises a question, we have an opportunity to answer that question.”",The New York Times
2020,What ‘Medicare for All’ Means After a Six-Year Strike for Health Benefits,"To understand how union members in Las Vegas are thinking about Bernie Sanders, it helps to remember a picket line in the 1990s. LAS VEGAS — They each remember that moment, just after dawn on a September day in 1991, when they walked out of the Frontier Hotel and Casino. There was music and singing — “Solidarity forever,” went the song. That first day, the atmosphere was more like a celebration than a work protest. But the strike would go on to last six years, four months and 10 days — one of the longest labor disputes in American history. There were fights along the picket line, with tourists throwing water and food at the strikers, who were more than willing to fight back. There were dozens of arrests. So much time went by that 107 babies were born to pickets and 17 people died during the strike. They were fighting for wages, job security, pensions — and health care. In many ways those are the same key issues in the presidential campaign that comes on Saturday to Nevada, where health care has taken center stage in the contest, with Bernie Sanders forcefully pushing for a “Medicare for All” plan that would effectively eliminate private health care insurance. And in Las Vegas, talking about health care means talking about the Culinary Workers Union, the largest and most powerful union in the state. The roughly 60,000 members of the union’s Local 226 rarely pay out of pocket for routine medical care. They can undergo surgery without receiving a hefty surprise bill months later. They can visit the same one-stop medical clinic for urgent care, vision, dental and the pharmacy. The clinic was a regular stop for many of the 2020 candidates. So one way to understand why the leadership of the Culinary Union is fighting so hard against Medicare-for-all proposals is to look back to the 1990s. The Frontier, one of the first casinos on what is now simply known as the Strip, had recently been sold to new owners. The Western-themed casino was popular for made-from-scratch baked goods and food. Gloria Hernandez knew it best for something else: Working there meant she could become a member of the Culinary Union, which would give her medical benefits that were far better than what her husband had through his job. “You knew immediately that when you started working there that you would get health insurance because this was a union hotel,” Ms. Hernandez said. She knew what it was like to be a member of a union in Mexico, where she was part of the government workers’ union. Today, Frontier strikers have an almost mythic presence within the Culinary Union here — seen as exemplars of people who know how to fight effectively. Ms. Hernandez is now an organizer for the union. But while she comes down enthusiastically on the side of keeping their current health insurance plan, some of her fellow pickets have reached the opposite conclusion. Terry Lemley, 59, has not one but two Sanders lawn signs in front of her house. During the strike, Ms. Lemley’s job was taking attendance on the line, helping to track that there were enough people to keep it going around the clock. Any Frontier employee who showed up at the picket line for 30 hours a week received $200 in strike pay. That was not enough to make ends meet, so most people found second jobs. “I would do it again in a heartbeat,” Ms. Lemley said, sitting at her kitchen table one afternoon this past week. “But what we fought for, everybody should have. I don’t know why I would not want to give it to everybody.” Once the strike ended in 1998, Ms. Lemley returned to her job as a cocktail waitress, a position she kept until the hotel shut down a decade later. She briefly had health insurance through Obamacare, she said, but has been uninsured for the past several years. “I’ve seen both. I know what it is to do without,” she said. “Why would anyone in the union wish that on anyone else?” Sonja Washington, 58, marched alongside Ms. Lemley for years, initially bringing her own children to the picket line. After getting arrested on the line, however, Ms. Washington said she decided to leave her children at home. Those children, who are now adults, spent their childhood with health care provided by the culinary health insurance program, Ms. Washington said. And Ms. Washington treasures her care. “It’s terrific, but why I am going to stop there?” she said, sitting in Ms. Lemley’s kitchen. “The union taught me how to fight. So I want to be out there fighting for everybody.” As a union organizer on the Strip, Elodia Muniz also views her work as fighting for more than just herself. “We are still over there and when we’re fighting, we’re not fighting for just us,” Ms. Muniz said in an interview at the Culinary Union headquarters this past week. But Ms. Muniz is loath to view health insurance the same way as Ms. Lemley and Ms. Washington. When Mr. Sanders came to speak to the union late last year, Ms. Muniz stood up and forcefully asked how he would protect their insurance. Mr. Sanders replied by suggesting that members would have more money in their paychecks if they were not negotiating with employers over health care. Ms. Muniz was unimpressed. “We like to keep what we have, what is real, what is true,” she said. “Not what we don’t know what it will be — it’s like a wish.” Ms. Muniz and Ms. Hernandez raised children together on the picket line; Ms. Hernandez’s youngest son was born just days after the strike began. As the children grew, they would frequently visit the picket line, learning the union songs and crossing the street to ride in an elevator for entertainment. “It was 24 hours a day, seven days a week, no matter what the weather was,” Ms. Hernandez recalled. “We have to be over there.” The choices they gave the owners were sign, sell or shut down, Ms. Hernandez recalled. “We wanted to have respect,” she said. “We knew we can have power together. We want to understand that.” Though she feels lucky to have stayed healthy, Ms. Hernandez has watched other members of her family struggle with their health care needs. Her mother had Medicaid, and Ms. Hernandez watched with alarm as she struggled to find doctors and visit specialists. “I don’t want that, no,” she said. “I want to have a choice. It’s like someone gives you a choice of the car — you want a Lexus or you want something less than that? Of course you want the nicer thing. It’s a big difference. You bet I will do anything I can to keep this because it’s a big difference.” Ms. Lemley links her passion over the Sanders campaign directly to her time on the picket line. It was the union, she said, that taught her how to collectively fight for others. Having already cast her ballot in the early caucus, Ms. Lemley was planning to enjoy this weekend as a kind of honeymoon. On Friday, she married the man she met on the picket line decades ago.

2020,What’s Better Than One Family Home in New Zealand? Three of Them,"Julian Robertson’s three new homes on New Zealand’s North Island are a matter of practicality. The co-founder, chairman and chief executive of the investment firm Tiger Management needs the residences for his growing family, which now includes his three sons, their wives and his nine grandchildren. When Mr. Robertson first built a vacation house on North Island more than a decade ago, he imagined his clan all staying there together under one roof whenever they visited. “It’s a destination I’ve long loved and enjoying sharing with my loved ones,” he said. That first home, along with the new ones, are on the same 6,000 acres of farmland in the Bay of Islands as Mr. Robertson’s upscale hotel, the Lodge at Kauri Cliffs. The property is part of Robertson Lodges, a trio of hotels in New Zealand that also includes the Farm at Cape Kidnappers near Napier and Matakauri Lodge, on the South Island. As the Robertson family grew, however, it was clear that the two-bedroom residence was too small. The family trips usually coincided over the December holidays and in March, when his grandchildren of school age had spring break. Mr. Robertson’s middle son, Jay, the chief executive of Robertson Lodges, recalled the moment several years ago at a family dinner at Kauri Cliffs when the idea for the three new residences was born. “We were in the middle of the meal when someone brought up how it might make more sense for each son and his family to have their own place,” he said. At the time, Mr. Robertson had already hired an architect based in Lakeland, Fla., Wade Setliff, who had worked on that initial residence, as well as on The Lodge at Kauri Cliffs, to design a home big enough for his family, grandchildren and all. “Dad had this vision of us together, but he realized that this was a better, more realistic option,” Jay Robertson said. “We changed course and told Wade that we wanted three homes, instead, that had to be identical. Dad wanted the same setup for all of us, so it didn’t seem like one family had something better or different than another.” With large windows that have sweeping panoramas of the Pacific Ocean and the Cavalli Islands, the single-story, four-bedroom residences are built with native timber weatherboards. Each home is almost 4,000 square feet. The family declined to say how much each house cost to build. Mr. Setliff described them as not overly contemporary but not old-fashioned, either. “The aesthetic is clean and about maximizing the views,” he said. “They’re inspired by the colonial workers’ cottages that were all over New Zealand in the 19th and 20th centuries.” And they definitely have children in mind. “When I was designing them, I visualized the Robertson grandkids running around inside and outside and having many happy times,” Mr. Setliff said. Among his design features are high ceilings, blond oak floors, large kitchens with islands, sliding doors that lead to outdoor spaces for lounging and dining, and a 25-foot-long saltwater pool. Each home has a small room near the kitchen with hooks and baskets where the Robertsons can throw their pool towels and wet shoes as soon as they come inside. For the décor and furnishings, the family looked to another past relationship: Virginia Fisher, an Auckland-based interior designer who had worked on The Lodge at Kauri Cliffs in collaboration with Mr. Robertson’s wife, Josie Robertson, who died in 2010. “I’ve had a long and happy relationship with the family, and I jumped at the chance to work with them again,” Ms. Fisher said. She wanted the homes to be relaxed and comfortable. “The idea was that you should be able to put your feet up and not worry about anything breaking,” she said. To achieve that, she made sure the family rooms and outdoor spaces were filled with oversize couches and lounge chairs in beige tones — the pieces were mostly from furniture makers in New Zealand. Accents like pillows and handmade rugs from India and Tibet are brighter but still in soft colors, such as muted blues, grays and greens. More unique touches include the hanging brass lights over the kitchen islands that are originally from ships in India in the last century. “I had them repolished,” Ms. Fisher said. Every home also has a series of 19th-century lithographs featuring canoes and other small vessels that convey a sense of the area’s maritime history. Since the Robertsons all live in the United States and usually visit New Zealand a few times a year for a few weeks at a time, Mr. Robertson said, he plans to rent the homes whenever they’re not there for $89,000, or 139,000 New Zealand dollars, per home per week. (The first two houses are complete, and the third will be done this year.) “They’re for my family, but I want to share them with families who travel to New Zealand and want a house to stay in where they can relax and have happy memories,” Mr. Robertson said.",The New York Times
2020,Opinion | What’s Better Than Planting a Trillion Trees?,"Protecting the forests while we are at it. Contributing Opinion Writer NASHVILLE — After what seemed like 100 years of impeachments hearings, anything uttered on Capitol Hill now sounds to my ear like the voice of Charlie Brown’s teacher. Nevertheless, a few words from President Trump’s State of the Union address managed to break through the wah-wahs last week: “To protect the environment, days ago, I announced the United States will join the One Trillion Trees Initiative, an ambitious effort to bring together government and the private sector to plant new trees in America and around the world,” he said. Could it really be true? You will forgive me for thinking there’s no way it could be true. The whole point of the World Economic Forum’s One Trillion Trees initiative is to reduce carbon in the environment and slow the rate of climate change by growing and preserving a trillion trees, worldwide, by 2050. But instead of addressing climate change, the Trump administration has rolled back or weakened 95 environmental protections already on the books. The burning of fossil fuels is the leading cause of climate change, but much of this administration’s hostility to environmental protections is a result of its commitment to promoting the fossil fuel industry: allowing drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and other public lands, approving construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline, encouraging more offshore drilling in the Atlantic. The Trump administration has even gutted the popular Endangered Species Act, which was passed with strong bipartisan support at a time in history when the word “bipartisan” was not an oxymoron. Is it any surprise that the Environmental Protection Agency is now widely known among conservationists as the Environmental Destruction Agency? I’m trying to figure out how this business with trees might be different. Did the president experience a Scrooge-like conversion at the World Economic Forum in Davos last month, with the brilliant Jane Goodall, who supports the One Trillion Trees initiative, playing the role of Marley? If so, it would be a conversion narrative more potent than any since St. Paul was struck down by a blinding light on the road to Damascus. Paul went from persecuting Christians to becoming the faith’s most famous evangelist, responsible for the spread of Christianity around the ancient Western world. Donald Trump’s conversion to environmental sanity could be the start of saving the world itself. Nothing would give me greater joy than a conversion story in which the Republican Party recognizes and addresses the climate calamity that is already here, but redemption is hardly at hand. More likely: The president has concluded that planting trees will allow him to continue his wrecking-ball policies while simultaneously posing as an environmentalist. Call it an arboreal cap-and-trade arrangement in which there are no caps and virtually no trades — the continued pillaging and polluting of the environment in exchange for planting a trillion trees. For countries whose leaders recognize the dystopia we are headed toward if significant emissions-reducing measures aren’t taken immediately, the One Trillion Trees initiative is a brilliant arrow in the quiver of climate-change policy. Leaves absorb carbon, wood sequesters carbon and roots stabilize soil so that the carbon already trapped there stays there. Moreover, some 80 percent of terrestrial biodiversity occurs in forests. Protecting trees is a way of protecting much of what makes life on earth life on earth. And planting trees is a tangible way to address climate change that can be done on both a micro and a macro scale. Got a sunny spot in your yard? Plant a tree. Got a country where logging or development or agriculture has mowed down whole forests? Plant millions of trees. Unfortunately, the math is more complicated than that line in the State of the Union address implies. Planting a seedling is better than doing nothing, it’s true, but it takes decades for a seedling to replace a tree, and that’s if the seedling survives at all: In China’s Great Green Wall reforestation program, up to 85 percent of the plantings fail over time, according to Yale Environment 360. For large-scale reforestation to succeed, the right trees have to be planted in the right places — a variety of species, not a monoculture, all native to the ecosystem at hand — and they have to be cared for until the roots are well-enough established to survive the temperature extremes, storms, floods and droughts that are the hallmark of climate change. It can be done, but it can’t be done without effort. Reforestation is a crucial goal, but even more crucial is the other goal of the One Trillion Trees initiative: preserving the trees we already have. So far we’re doing a terrible job of it. Here in the United States, we’re losing 36 million trees a year in metropolitan areas alone. In Canada, the ancient boreal forest is being mowed down for the sake of toilet tissue. In South America, the rainforest is being burned down for the sake of cheeseburgers. Here in Nashville, we are losing trees to development at a rate that would take your breath away: 918 acres of canopy from 2008 to 2016, and development has continued unabated since that last census was taken. In my neighborhood alone, just during the past two months, builders clearing three lots have taken down nearly two dozen mature shade trees and more ornamentals than I could keep track of. A beautiful magnolia, a whole stand of towering pines where the neighborhood crows roosted at night, several hackberries that provided food for migratory birds and local species alike. It’s possible to save big, old trees during construction, but these developers didn’t even try. Last summer, Nashville passed legislation that requires commercial developers to plant more trees — increasing tree density from 14 to 22 per acre — and offers incentives to preserve “heritage” trees. It’s an important first step, but it doesn’t impose any penalties on builders who choose not to preserve those heritage trees, and it doesn’t apply to single-family homes and duplexes at all. The bulldozers on my street aren’t going anywhere until the next round of legislation is negotiated. I have hope for a next round. “We’re not set up to be a very tree-minded city,” Councilwoman Angie Henderson, the lead sponsor of the new bill (and my former student), told The Tennessean last summer. “I am looking at this as a series of tree-related regulations.” The president of the United States should look at the One Trillion Trees initiative the same way. It’s a start. If it stops there, it will accomplish nothing at all. Margaret Renkl is a contributing opinion writer who covers flora, fauna, politics and culture in the American South.

2020,What’s Driving the Millennial Political Takeover?,"nonfiction When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. THE ONES WE’VE BEEN WAITING FOR How a New Generation of Leaders Will Transform AmericaBy Charlotte Alter The first wave of millennials — tech savvy and type-A, thanks to hovering boomer parents — is on the cusp of holding real political power. The number elected to Congress jumped from 6 to 26 in 2018, and mayoral offices and city councils are suddenly filled with them. More than one is running for president. How this generation will wield power to change America — when it fully acquires that power — is the question Charlotte Alter, a national correspondent for Time, sets out to answer in “The Ones We’ve Been Waiting For.” To examine the issue, Alter retraces the careers of 10 elected millennials, weaving their voices together to describe the defining moments that unite this generation, from Sept. 11 to the election of Donald Trump in 2016. We see the progressive icon and Democratic representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and her family deal with the aftermath of the 2008 crash; the presidential candidate and former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg pondering “generational purpose” while staring at a cloudless sky as a Harvard undergraduate on Sept. 11; and the Republican representative Dan Crenshaw losing his eye in Afghanistan. We also meet some less well-known, up-and-coming leaders, like Svante Myrick, who at the age of 24 became the youngest and first person of color to be elected mayor of Ithaca, N.Y., and Braxton Winston, a 30-something Charlotte, N.C., City Council member who ran for office after protesting police shootings of black people. Saddled with student debt, freaked out by climate change and school shootings, and driven by a sense that their parents aren’t going to fix any of these problems, millennials, Alter suggests, are ready to harness their political potential. She does an excellent job detailing — with persuasive data — what has shaped and motivated this young generation so far. The recession is “an invisible postscript” that explains how millennials have been economically disadvantaged. The low salaries and scarcity of jobs that confronted many of us upon graduating from college meant it took us much longer than previous generations to find our way in the world, to say nothing of repaying loans we took out for our very expensive degrees. By the time jobs began to come back, in 2012, Alter writes, employers were looking for younger, cheaper graduates, leaving some of us stuck in underemployment. The “forever war” has inextricably colored how we view American foreign policy: Millennials are far less likely than boomers to think the United States should get involved in the affairs of other countries. And how we use technology has transformed the way we organize politically. As Alter points out, movements like Occupy Wall Street and Black Lives Matter began on the internet. (We also learn that Buttigieg’s early internet use in college consisted mostly of “just logging on to WNDU.com to look at a grainy picture of South Bend,” a detail that will stay with me for a long time.) Alter is upfront about the fact that we don’t yet know what a millennial political revolution might look like, writing that “by learning where they’ve been, we can get a sense of where we’re going.” The great millennial takeover is very much a work in progress; the average age of our congressional leaders still hovers in the 70s, and Senator Bernie Sanders (age 78) continues to poll highly among young voters in the Democratic primary — far higher than Buttigieg, who remains unpopular with voters under 35. Alter’s story is moving faster than she can write it. She depicts the young Republican representative Elise Stefanik, of New York, for instance, as trying to keep Trump at a safe distance but not be out of step with her party. However, with Trump’s impeachment, Stefanik has transformed into one of Trump’s biggest defenders and has raised considerable money for her re-election campaign because of it. “The Ones We’ve Been Waiting For” takes its name from a speech by Barack Obama during his 2008, millennial-galvanizing campaign, and it’s apt; it took us a little while to realize that boomers were not going to save the world and that any significant change would be up to us. Already, members of Generation Z, some of whom may be voting in their first presidential election this fall, have figured out how to engage in political activism at a much younger age than we did — think March for Our Lives or Greta Thunberg — but thanks to Alter’s timely book we can have a better understanding of why an entire generation was set back and what’s driving it now.

Here are 6 Key Facts.” To see all previously published Stat Nuggets with links to their graphs, go to this index. LOG (LOGARITHMIC) SCALE A logarithmic scale, or log scale for short, is a scale of measurement where the position of the values on the original scale are converted to their logarithmic values. (The logarithm of a number is the power to which 10 must be raised to get a value equal to that number. For example, the log of 100 is 2 since 10 raised to the second power equals 100.) Log scales are often used on graphs when the data values have a huge range. On a log scale, the length of the axes’ intervals change in a particular pattern. This is in contrast to a typical linear scale in which the length of the intervals do not change. An example of the use of a log scale is for the amplitude (or wiggle) of earthquakes. The amplitudes are converted to log values (the Richter scale) and then plotted on a log scale. For logs, each whole number increase in magnitude represents a tenfold increase in measured amplitude. In the virus graph, the vertical y-axis scale is a log scale. The scale is compressed into smaller intervals to make the variation between less-deadly diseases easier to see but to still have the most deadly diseases on the graph. Diseases near the top of the graph are much deadlier than those in the middle. Here, the distance from 0 to 0.1 is the same as the distance from 1 to 10, or from 10 to 100. SCATTER PLOT A scatter plot is a graph that is used to display the relationship between two quantitative variables and is described by the direction, strength and form of the relationship, and unusual observations. Direction: A positive direction means that the y-variable tends to increase as the x-variable increases (or an uphill trend). A negative direction means that the y-variable tends to decrease as the x-variable increases (or a downhill trend). Relationships between quantitative variables are said to have no direction when there is no consistent positive or negative pattern in the scatter plot. Strength: Relationships between two quantitative variables run from strong, if the points fall in a “tight” pattern, to weak, if they are spread out. Form: The form of a relationship is determined by the pattern of the points in the scatter plot. The most common forms are linear and curved. If there is no apparent pattern in the scatter plot, the form is sometimes referred to as scattered. Unusual observations: Unusual points that do not fit the general pattern in the scatter plot are called outliers. In the virus graph, the quantitative variables are the average number of people infected by each sick person and the fatality rate. There is no direction or description of strength because the form of the graph is scattered. The most unusual disease is measles since a person with measles infects, on average, 15 people. People with other diseases infect only one to five others, on average. _________ The graphs for “What’s Going On in This Graph?” are selected in partnership with Sharon Hessney.

Updated Feb. 6 2020 For Valentine’s Day, we may buy our loved ones cards and candy. But, for a most serious commitment, we may buy an engagement ring. How much do we spend on this commitment? Based on a poll of 1,640 adults by Morning Consult done for the New York Times Upshot, the median amount spent is $1,900, which is about two weeks’ pay. The histogram of how much we spend on engagement rings and the bar chart of what share of income is spent on an engagement ring appeared previously in the New York Times article “Three Months’ Salary for an Engagement Ring? For Most People, It’s More Like Two Weeks.” The bar chart reveals a surprise. Overall, respondents spent less than two weeks pay (about 3 - 4 percent of their annual pay) on a ring, but respondents who were paid the least spent 9.5 weeks of their pay (17 percent of their annual pay) on a ring. Here are some of the headlines that really capture the meaning of these graphs: “Engagement Economy” by Avery of Hoggard High School in Wilmington, North Carolina, “The Rings of Love Become the Rings of Pain” by Mohamed of Academy for Software Engineering, New York, “Engagement Rings, Hand Over 2 Weeks’ Salary” by Riley of Bush, and “The Price of a Promise” by Soren of Eden Prairie, Minnesota. You may want to think critically about these questions. Using the bar chart of what share of income is spent on an engagement ring, calculate the average cost of an engagement ring for each income group. What do you notice? The data that was used to create this histogram and bar chart was collected by polling a nationally representative sample. Below, there is a Stat Nugget for the statistical term “sample.” Samples need to be selected properly so the results are not biased and the findings can be used to describe the population of interest. Knowing this, what questions would you like to ask the pollster, Morning Consult, to determine if the results from this sample can be used to draw a conclusion about the cost of engagement rings for the entire population? Cardi B received an engagement ring from the rapper Offset that she said was worth half a million dollars. If you included the cost of her ring to the graph of ring costs, where would it be on the graph? How would it affect the average ring cost? Search for how much Offset earned last year. What percentage of his income was spent on the ring? How long did he have to work last year to pay for this ring? How does this compare to other income groups in the bar chart?

HISTOGRAM A histogram summarizes the distribution of a quantitative variable by showing the frequency (count) or relative frequency (percentage) of the values that fall in specific intervals. The intervals are along the x-axis. Bars drawn above the corresponding intervals represent the frequency or relative frequency of values falling in each of the intervals. These numbers or percentages are shown on the y-axis. The engagement ring cost graph is a histogram. The quantitative variable displayed in the histogram is the cost of engagement rings. The x-axis is marked in intervals of width $500. The y-axis displays the number of people who purchased rings in each cost interval. BAR CHART A bar chart is a graphical representation of categorical data. Bar charts can be useful in comparing subgroups’ statistics. The bar chart of share of income spent on an engagement ring shows the number of weeks or months worth of income that respondents for each annual income category spent on their rings. The subgroups are the 5 income categories. They are ordered in ascending order by income. NORMAL vs. SKEWED DISTRIBUTION A normal distribution is symmetric (as if reflected in a mirror) with one peak (or unimodal). Some call it a bell curve due to its shape. A skewed distribution is asymmetric (not symmetric) with a longer “tail” in the direction of its skew. The shape of the histogram of engagement ring cost, is not normal. Due to the long tail on the right side of the graph the distribution of ring prices is skewed right. About 80 percent of those polled spent less than $5,000 on a ring. The right tail includes only 20 percent of those polled, half of which spent more than $15,000. SAMPLE A sample is a subset of a population. A sample can be used to make generalizations about the population from which it was selected if the sample is representative of the population. The simplest way to obtain a representative sample is to select the sample randomly from the population.If the sample is not randomly selected from the population, the resulting statistics may be biased and may lead to incorrect conclusions about the population. The larger the random sample, the more sure we can be that the sample will give good information about the population. In the engagement ring sample, the population of interest is all people who have bought engagement rings. The sample consists of the 1,640 adults that were surveyed. We are told that the poll of 1,640 adults is nationally representative, but we have no further details about how this sample was selected. . However, the sample size is large and if this large sample was selected randomly we can use the data from this sample to draw conclusions about how much all purchasers of engagement rings spent (on average) to express their commitment. _________ The graphs for “What’s Going On in This Graph?” are selected in partnership with Sharon Hessney. Ms. Hessney wrote the “reveal” and Stat Nuggets with Erica Chauvet, a mathematics professor at Waynesburg University in Pennsylvania, and moderates online with Jennifer Mueller, high school mathematics teacher at Parkway North High School in Creve Coeur, Missouri and adjunct professor of mathematics at the University of Missouri St. Louis.",The New York Times

Updated Feb. 6 2020 For Valentine’s Day, we may buy our loved ones cards and candy. But, for a most serious commitment, we may buy an engagement ring. How much do we spend on this commitment? Based on a poll of 1,640 adults by Morning Consult done for the New York Times Upshot, the median amount spent is $1,900, which is about two weeks’ pay. The histogram of how much we spend on engagement rings and the bar chart of what share of income is spent on an engagement ring appeared previously in the New York Times article “Three Months’ Salary for an Engagement Ring? For Most People, It’s More Like Two Weeks.” The bar chart reveals a surprise. Overall, respondents spent less than two weeks pay (about 3 - 4 percent of their annual pay) on a ring, but respondents who were paid the least spent 9.5 weeks of their pay (17 percent of their annual pay) on a ring. Here are some of the headlines that really capture the meaning of these graphs: “Engagement Economy” by Avery of Hoggard High School in Wilmington, North Carolina, “The Rings of Love Become the Rings of Pain” by Mohamed of Academy for Software Engineering, New York, “Engagement Rings, Hand Over 2 Weeks’ Salary” by Riley of Bush, and “The Price of a Promise” by Soren of Eden Prairie, Minnesota. You may want to think critically about these questions. Using the bar chart of what share of income is spent on an engagement ring, calculate the average cost of an engagement ring for each income group. What do you notice? The data that was used to create this histogram and bar chart was collected by polling a nationally representative sample. Below, there is a Stat Nugget for the statistical term “sample.” Samples need to be selected properly so the results are not biased and the findings can be used to describe the population of interest. Knowing this, what questions would you like to ask the pollster, Morning Consult, to determine if the results from this sample can be used to draw a conclusion about the cost of engagement rings for the entire population? Cardi B received an engagement ring from the rapper Offset that she said was worth half a million dollars. If you included the cost of her ring to the graph of ring costs, where would it be on the graph? How would it affect the average ring cost? Search for how much Offset earned last year. What percentage of his income was spent on the ring? How long did he have to work last year to pay for this ring? How does this compare to other income groups in the bar chart? Below in the Stat Nuggets, we define and explain mathematical terms that apply to the graphs. Thank you for participating in “What’s Going On in This Graph?” which is intended to help you think more critically about graphs and the underlying data. Critical thinking is an essential element of statistics, the science of learning from data. Keep noticing and wondering. We continue to welcome your responses.

And how does this pandemic compare to other infectious diseases? This week’s graph from the New York Times article “How Bad Will the Coronavirus Outbreak Get? Here are 6 Key Factors.” uses the variables average number of people infected by each sick person and fatality rate. See how it compares to the most deadly 1918 Spanish flu and the recent Ebola pandemics. See how it compares to the measles and the common cold. With this information, how do you think the coronavirus might be contained? Search online for the most recent information on the coronavirus. Here are some of the headlines that really capture the main ideas of this graph: “Coronavirus and the Potential for Destruction or Not?” by Jude of Pasadena, CA, “The Dangerous Range of Disease” by Gracie of Western Guilford High School in Greensboro, NC, “Coronavirus Chaos” by Lauren of Academy of Saint Elizabeth in Morristown, NJ, “Can the Coronavirus Go Up Against These Other Big Dog Diseases?” by Chanse Davis of Academy for Software Engineering, New York City and “Frequent and Fatal Diseases“ by Kiersten of St. John the Apostle School, Clark, NJ. You may want to think critically about these questions. Complete these sentences and give evidence from this week’s graph: ___________ is the most infectious disease because ____________. ___________ is the most deadly disease because ____________. Of these two diseases, which are you most afraid of? Explain your answer. The New York Times graph uses a log scale on the vertical y-axis. After reading about log scales in the Stat Nugget below, examine this graph that does not use a log scale. Both graphs display the same information, except this graph only has data as of 2014. The new coronavirus is not included. Determine where it would be on the graph. Both graphs are mathematically correct, but they represent the information differently. Which one is better for comparison of how contagious diseases are? Explain your answer. There are six other graphical displays in the New York Times article, including two infographics that show how far in feet the virus can spread and how many people could become infected in five cycles of transmission. Examine any of the graphs. Combined with what you have noticed and wondered about the other graphs, what other insights do you have about the new coronavirus? You may want to read the New York Times opinion article “We’re Reading the Coronavirus Numbers Wrong” by John Allen Paulos. Here, Paulos explains the inconsistencies in data collected on diseases. This, in part, explains why this graph shows a rectangular region for the coronavirus’ deadliness. Stay tuned for a revised graph.

Here are 6 Key Facts.” To see all previously published Stat Nuggets with links to their graphs, go to this index. LOG (LOGARITHMIC) SCALE A logarithmic scale, or log scale for short, is a scale of measurement where the position of the values on the original scale are converted to their logarithmic values. (The logarithm of a number is the power to which 10 must be raised to get a value equal to that number. For example, the log of 100 is 2 since 10 raised to the second power equals 100.) Log scales are often used on graphs when the data values have a huge range. On a log scale, the length of the axes’ intervals change in a particular pattern. This is in contrast to a typical linear scale in which the length of the intervals do not change. An example of the use of a log scale is for the amplitude (or wiggle) of earthquakes. The amplitudes are converted to log values (the Richter scale) and then plotted on a log scale. For logs, each whole number increase in magnitude represents a tenfold increase in measured amplitude. In the virus graph, the vertical y-axis scale is a log scale. The scale is compressed into smaller intervals to make the variation between less-deadly diseases easier to see but to still have the most deadly diseases on the graph. Diseases near the top of the graph are much deadlier than those in the middle. Here, the distance from 0 to 0.1 is the same as the distance from 1 to 10, or from 10 to 100. SCATTER PLOT A scatter plot is a graph that is used to display the relationship between two quantitative variables and is described by the direction, strength and form of the relationship, and unusual observations. Direction: A positive direction means that the y-variable tends to increase as the x-variable increases (or an uphill trend). A negative direction means that the y-variable tends to decrease as the x-variable increases (or a downhill trend). Relationships between quantitative variables are said to have no direction when there is no consistent positive or negative pattern in the scatter plot. Strength: Relationships between two quantitative variables run from strong, if the points fall in a “tight” pattern, to weak, if they are spread out. Form: The form of a relationship is determined by the pattern of the points in the scatter plot. The most common forms are linear and curved. If there is no apparent pattern in the scatter plot, the form is sometimes referred to as scattered. Unusual observations: Unusual points that do not fit the general pattern in the scatter plot are called outliers. In the virus graph, the quantitative variables are the average number of people infected by each sick person and the fatality rate. There is no direction or description of strength because the form of the graph is scattered. The most unusual disease is measles since a person with measles infects, on average, 15 people. People with other diseases infect only one to five others, on average. _________ The graphs for “What’s Going On in This Graph?” are selected in partnership with Sharon Hessney.

2020,PG&E Bankruptcy Update: The Debate Over Restructuring ,"California Today Tuesday: An update on efforts to wrest the state’s largest utility from investors’ hands. Also: Kobe Bryant and the Lakers. Good morning. (Here’s the sign-up, if you don’t already get California Today delivered to your inbox.) Today, we’re starting with an update on debates over the future of the state’s biggest utility, from my colleague Ivan Penn, who’s been covering the saga. Here’s his dispatch: Calls to wrest Pacific Gas & Electric from investors’ hands have grown louder, amplified by a state bill that would allow cities to carve up PG&E territory into government-run utilities. That’s the vision of Mayor London Breed and other San Francisco city officials, who last week announced a campaign called “Our City, Our Power,” aimed at acquiring the local PG&E power grid and shifting it to local control. “We don’t think PG&E is the right entity to provide service in San Francisco,” said Barbara Hale, assistant general manager for power at the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission. It has been more than a year since PG&E filed for bankruptcy protection, overwhelmed by billions of dollars in liabilities from wildfires traced to its equipment. To tap a $20 billion state fund to cover future fire losses, it must emerge from bankruptcy by June 30 — and it has yet to satisfy Gov. Gavin Newsom’s conditions regarding financing, governance and safety measures. [Read more about Mr. Newsom’s back-and-forth with PG&E.] Scott Wiener, the state senator from San Francisco, has introduced legislation that would foster municipal control of utilities, which has long been the case in Los Angeles and Sacramento. To that end, San Francisco has offered $2.5 billion for PG&E assets that include poles, wires and substations within the city. The San Francisco Public Utilities Commission and the Board of Supervisors have given conditional approval for a bond issue to finance the takeover. But unions representing the utility’s workers oppose a breakup because of concerns about loss of benefits like pension credits. “What San Francisco is talking about is taking our members and forcing them into other unions,” said Tom Dalzell, business manager for the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 1245, which represents about 12,000 PG&E employees. “They would have to start all over in a whole new pension system.” Mr. Dalzell also questioned San Francisco’s ability to run a more effective and efficient electricity system when it has struggled with its water services and transit system. [Read about how, leading up to the state’s deadliest blaze, PG&E chose profits over safety.] “We believe in the status quo,” Mr. Dalzell said about the investor-owned utility model. “The change is difficult for workers.” Ms. Hale replied that as a strong union town, San Francisco supported maintaining the pensions and other benefits of PG&E workers, and that they might fare even better under city control. For its part, PG&E said a shift to a community-run power company would increase taxpayer liability while decreasing the tax revenue that the company provides. “While recent proposals for state or municipal ownership of PG&E’s infrastructure are not new concepts, we don’t agree that the outcomes of this type of framework will benefit customers, taxpayers, local communities, the state or our economy,” Brandi Merlo, a PG&E spokeswoman. A different kind of takeover has been proposed by Mayor Sam Liccardo of San Jose: a customer-owned utility that would include PG&E’s entire service area. He says PG&E’s own plan would protect investors while leaving the company steeped in debt. [Read about Mr. Liccardo’s proposal.] “The company’s proposal is likely to result in a utility that will emerge from bankruptcy that will be a junk bond company,” Mr. Liccardo said. Although the electrical workers’ union favors PG&E’s traditional structure, Mr. Dalzell said the union preferred Mr. Liccardo’s plan to other takeover proposals because it would keep the utility intact. Mr. Liccardo said that in the end, he believes some version of a public takeover or customer-owned cooperative would be necessary. “We do not see a viable path for the current plan,” he said. “We are waiting by the rim for the rebound.” We often link to sites that limit access for nonsubscribers.

2020,What’s It Like for an Author to See Her Story Turned Into TV?,"Inside the List ADAPTATION People go to readings for many reasons, including the occasional free cookie and a chance to ask an author for advice about how to get published. So Celeste Ng knew something was afoot when she started visiting bookstores to talk about her second novel, “Little Fires Everywhere,” and found rows of folding chairs filled with enthusiasts who had already read the book. She says, “It had only been out for a week. I thought, Maybe this story is going to resonate.” She was right. “Little Fires Everywhere” spent 48 weeks on the hardcover fiction best-seller list and is now approaching its 40th week on the paperback list. And, on March 18, Ng’s tale of race, class and belonging will make its debut as an eight-episode Hulu series starring Kerry Washington and Reese Witherspoon. The book grew out of Ng’s desire to locate a story in her hometown, Shaker Heights, Ohio: “I’d been away for about 10 years and I recognized both the weirdness of growing up in this community that was very socially oriented and race-conscious, yet still had blind spots. It shaped me into an idealist and a person who believes you can have an impact on the world. I was thinking about how I could personify this place with its wonderful aspects and its faults.” Watching her story come alive in its newest incarnation has been a rewarding experience for Ng. She explains, “When you’re a writer, you control everything. You write the dialogue, you are the actors, you decide what everyone looks like and what the scenery is. Screenwriters think about structure and plot in a whole different way; you can’t have a character sit there and remember something and have an epiphany.” The Hulu team included Ng at every stage — from scripting to character development to driving around Los Angeles to find houses that looked as if they could fit into the neighborhood she envisioned. They even made a letter jacket that looks like the ones Ng remembers from Shaker Heights High School. Still, there are differences between page and screen. Ng says, “It’s been a joy to watch somebody else take the story and run with it. I’ve been really happy they decided to bring the racial elements up to the surface in a way I didn’t. The analogy I keep coming back to is a cover song; my favorites are always the ones that have a new spin.”",The New York Times
2020,What’s It Like to Be an Emergency Goalie in an N.H.L. Game?,"After the Carolina Hurricanes lost two goaltenders to injury in a game against the Toronto Maple Leafs, David Ayres, 42, stepped in and got the win. One of the eccentricities of the N.H.L. is what happens when a team runs out of goalies. Most teams list two on their rosters. In case of the unlikely event that both get hurt, home teams are required to designate an “emergency goalie” for each game: someone who can fill in for the rest of the game, for either team. Generally these are rec league guys or former college players who help out at practice, and get to pick up a few bucks and meet some N.H.L. stars. Once in a rare while, they actually get in the game. On Saturday night in Toronto, starting goalie James Reimer of the Carolina Hurricanes was injured in a collision. That brought in Petr Mrazek. Then Mrazek got hurt in a collision of his own. With that, 42-year-old David Ayres stepped in between the pipes for the Hurricanes, up, 3-1, midway through the second period. The affable Ayres sat for an interview at the N.H.L. offices in New York on Monday. His next stop will be Raleigh, N.C., where the Hurricanes will honor him on Tuesday night. And why not? The Hurricanes beat the Maple Leafs, 6-3, and Ayres made eight saves. This interview was condensed and edited for clarity. I’ve heard you described as a Zamboni driver, or maybe a former Zamboni driver. What is your current Zamboni status? Five years ago I was a full-time Zamboni driver for the [A.H.L.] Toronto Marlies. Then I went to work at an athletics center, where I’m an operations manager. So that’s not my only job, to be on the Zamboni. But I do it when I can. How often are you the emergency goalie in Toronto? I’ve done it for three years. Last season I did every home game. This season I opted to do half of them, which ended up turning into more than half. When you don’t get into the game — as was always the case until Saturday — what’s that experience like? My wife and I stand up in the standing-room section and just watch the game from the same spot. It can be boring. I like doing the practice stuff — I’m on the ice for practice sometimes — more than standing in the stands for the game. The other day I said to my wife, “I don’t know if I’m going to do this next year.” Then, boom, I got in a game. What’s your background as a player? I played in Junior B, which is like second or third level down. I kind of gave up on it. Then I had a kidney transplant, and I thought that would be the end of my hockey career. So this was your first game situation in many years? Probably four or five. I played some Senior A hockey. But practicing with Toronto was way more fun. Where were you when you heard about the first injury, to Reimer? I was standing in my section, and I saw him go down. Then I got the call: Come on down, bring your gear, get dressed. When Mrazek was hurt, I was in the media room. Had you ever gotten to that first stage before, when there’s one injury and you get dressed? That was the fourth time. Was it awkward to compete against the Leafs when you work with them and you’re a fan? It’s a little different. At first you kind of try to figure where guys are going to shoot, you’re worried about where each shot’s going to go instead of just playing your game. If I didn’t know the guys on the other team I wouldn’t worry about where they’re potentially going to shoot, I’d just worry about playing my game. It runs through your mind, but you’ve got to block it out and try to make a save. What was it like when you got that second call and you went on the ice to play? The guys were waiting for me and cheering me on. Everyone starts to scream and it starts to hit you. You’ve got to try to focus after that. That’s the tough part. What’s the biggest crowd you had played in front of before? Not a very big one. Probably a few hundred. So what was different from what you expected? I always thought if I went out there, I’d be perfectly calm, no problem. I play with these guys all the time, I’m used to the shots, I’m used to the speed, no problem, this is easy. Then you step on there, and the crowd’s there and the place is lit up and they drop the puck. And the players are going so much faster in the game than they were going in practice. I think that’s the part that gets you. The look of the game when you’re standing on the ice is totally different than when you’re in the building. The Leafs scored a couple of goals on you quickly, but then you made eight saves. Did you feel more confident as you went along? I had a little jitters on the first one. I probably could have had it if I’d stayed square in my position. The second one, I didn’t have much of an option. It was off a guy’s shin pad right onto their stick and it was in the net. But after that, I kind of settled in, made a save, made another save, and I started feeling more comfortable. What’s it been like since the game? My phone hasn’t stopped, and I’ve been awake for most of it. It’s been fun. I’d never been to New York. I’ve never been to Raleigh. Are you going to keep doing it? You’re 1-0, a 1.000 winning percentage. That record can never be broken. Are you willing to put that record on the line? One hundred percent. I’m the emergency goalie next Saturday for the Leafs. If I can get out on the ice again, I won’t be as nervous.",The New York Times
2020,What’s New in Ski Country This Season,"Update Resorts in the Western United States are upgrading lifts, technology and now renting outerwear. It’s not just the snow that is plentiful in ski country this season, so, too, are the offerings from an industry that is hustling to attract millennials and Gen Xers who have proven to be less interested in skiing and snowboarding than their parents. Mid-way through the season, here are some of the newest developments affecting skiers and riders in the western United States. Many old chairlifts are being replaced, and new ones are opening up fresh territory. In Colorado alone, said Chris Linsmayer, a spokesman for the nonprofit trade group Colorado Ski Country USA, 11 lifts have been installed or replaced since the start of the 2018-19 season. “Guests have come to expect quick lift times and comfort, and the ski areas are spending with that sort of capital investment,” said Adrienne Saia Isaac, director of marketing and communications for the National Ski Areas Association. A new $15 million gondola at the Steamboat Ski Resort in Colorado moves people from the base nearly 38 percent faster than the old one, said the resort’s spokeswoman, Loryn Duke. In California, the new $11 million Treeline Cirque quad chairlift at Alpine Meadows has a mid-station where the previous lift ended, and then continues with a 1,300-foot extension. Woodward Park City in Utah opened in December, offering year-round sports and activities, and a “humanpowered” backcountry ski area opened in Northern Colorado this month. At Bluebird Backcountry at Peak Ranch, people pay $50 for access to 300 acres of open and gladed terrain. (Another 1,200 acres can be accessed by hiring a guide.) Ticket-holders skin up, but have the amenities of a traditional ski area with rentals, lessons, ski patrol and a warming hut. It will be open just 15 days (mostly weekends) between Feb. 15 and March 15. It’s also easier to get to some areas, and to get outfitted once there. American Airlines has started nonstop service on Saturdays from Philadelphia International Airport to Colorado’s Eagle County Regional Airport for the winter, making it more convenient for some travelers to get to Vail, Beaver Creek and other places. Taos Air charter service now flies to Taos, N.M., from California’s Hawthorne-Los Angeles and Carlsbad-San Diego airports. Colorado’s new Snowstang bus service on winter weekends offers an affordable way to get from downtown Denver to Loveland Ski Area, Arapahoe Basin and Steamboat. Alta, Solitude and Brighton joined Snowbird in Utah on an app called R.I.D.E. (Reducing Individual Driving for the Environment) to encourage car-pooling by offering incentives. And winter outerwear is now available for rent at Big Sky Resort in Montana and dozens of other resorts. That makes it easier for those who don’t want to haul suitcases, or invest in expensive outerwear. At the base of Peak 9 in Breckenridge, Colo., the new Gravity Haus hotel and social club recently opened “for the modern adventurer.” It has 60 rooms, a co-working space, a trampoline and a Japanese-inspired bathhouse. In Jackson Hole, Wyo., the extreme-sports filmmaker Teton Gravity Research moved into the travel industry with the debut of the T.G.R.-branded Continuum hotel. There’s also a lot happening in Aspen, Colo., where a new W hotel and the Snow Lodge pop-up restaurant — open until April and backed by the owners of the Surf Lodge in Montauk, N.Y. — both ooze a party vibe. The W is the city’s first luxury hotel in 25 years. The slope-side property has 88 guest rooms, ranging from a two-bedroom suite with a circular bed and D.J. booth to rooms with bunk beds sleeping up to eight people. An underground cocktail bar is decorated to commemorate Aspen’s former Red Light district, and the roof deck, open year round, boasts a heated pool, fire pits, dance floor and another D.J. booth. Utah’s Deer Valley Resort and Cooper in Colorado are among the recent converts to R.F.I.D. technology, a change that allows a guest to keep their lift ticket in their pocket, rather than have it scanned. The technology can help reduce lift-line bottlenecks and allows a single pass to be used at multiple resorts, said Oliver Suter, head of marketing and sales for Axess AG, a provider of ticket and access management systems. It also collects data. That’s useful for resorts, and tracking the stats can be fun for skiers and riders; so much so that it has started to gamify skiing and snowboarding. EpicMix allows Epic Pass holders to earn pins for a range of challenges at 15 resorts. Credit is awarded for vertical feet, chairlift sequences, days on the slopes and more. Not to be outdone, this season Ikon Pass introduced its app, which tracks lifts, trails, distance, hours, altitude and more, as well as comparing the stats of the user against a leader board of the top 25 guests for each of the 41 Ikon Pass destinations.

2020,"After New Hampshire, What Comes Next for Elizabeth Warren?","She said she did not want to “burn down the rest of the party” in order to triumph. And then she lost in New Hampshire. MANCHESTER, N.H. — It was 24 hours before the biggest contest of her political life. Senator Elizabeth Warren didn’t want to talk about it that way. She was making the media rounds ahead of the New Hampshire primary when she dialed into a progressive SiriusXM radio show, Signal Boost. A voter asked her a straightforward enough question: Who did she see as her biggest 2020 competitor — and why was she better than them? Ms. Warren demurred. “I know there’s only going to be one winner,” Ms. Warren said. “I’m not — I’m not turning away from that. But I am turning away from the idea of seeing each other as if I win, you lose. You know, if you win, I lose.” The next day, they won. She lost. How Ms. Warren ended up as a fourth-place finisher in New Hampshire now at risk of receding from the national political conversation — her primary-night speech was not carried live by any of the major cable networks — is the story of a candidate who spent the past crucial week unbending to the realities of a competitive primary happening around her. She evinced little sense of urgency after a third-place showing in Iowa that was a disappointment even as it left her a contender. She resisted calls by allies to confront her opponents and their weaknesses head on. She spoke relatively little at a turning-point debate on Friday after she had dominated airtime at such gatherings last year. When she did speak — be it onstage, to voters or to reporters — she mostly stuck to her familiar and comfortable script of “big, structural change” that powered her rise but has not prevented her subsequent fall. Some people around Ms. Warren were talking about being at peace with how the campaign had been run. transcript So we finally have actual election results from the state of New Hampshire. They are clear, and they are authoritative and they are a little bit complicated. “Hello, America.” “We are here to stay.” “Our campaign is built for the long haul.” “We’re going to Nevada. We’re going to South Carolina. We’re going to win those states as well.” Bernie Sanders has won the state by a little bit. Two other candidates who had quite a strong night — Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar. Not such a good night for Joe Biden or for Elizabeth Warren or for anybody else. “New Hampshire.” “New Hampshire.” “New Hampshire.” “We’re here together.” “New Hampshire.” “You all up here in New Hampshire.” After the debacle in Iowa, national attention has focused even more intensely on New Hampshire as the first real clean test of political momentum in this race. “People are still undecided.” “Uh, Bernie.” “Bernie Sanders, all the way.” “Mayor Pete.” “Amy Klobuchar.” “Oh, Joe Biden.” “I’ll just probably decide Tuesday, five minutes before I go in to vote.” New Hampshire is a classic swing state. “Ronald Reagan is the winner in the state of New Hampshire.” “Bill Clinton won it.” “It’s neck and neck.” “New Hampshire goes to Obama.” In 2016, Hillary Clinton prevailed over Donald Trump, but by a tiny margin. It’s a state that’s very much in play for 2020. “Four more, Trump. Four more years!” New Hampshire might gauge whether a candidate is able to appeal to certain other constituencies they will need in the general election. We have seen over the last week a real rivalry emerge between Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg. “Hot, fresh and vegan. Get your Bernie-on-a-stick.” New Hampshire is really home turf for Bernie Sanders. He comes from right next door in Vermont. And he also drew strong support, as he did in 2016, from younger voters and more liberal voters. “Young voters want Bernie because he’s fighting for their future. He’s not fighting for his future. He’s in his future.” [cheering] Bernie Sanders came into New Hampshire claiming momentum out of Iowa, based on his lead in the popular vote. “Finally, the votes were counted in Iowa. Took them a little while. We won the vote by 6,000 votes.” He has been somewhat more aggressive with his primary opponents here … “We don’t have a Super PAC.” … talking about the difference between himself … “We don’t want billionaires’ money.” … and candidates in the race, like Pete Buttigieg, who take money from billionaires and other big donors. “We are running a campaign for working people, funded by working people. And that is why we are going to win here in New Hampshire and all over this country.” [cheering] The biggest thing this might mean for Bernie Sanders is that he has clearly reasserted himself as the dominant leader on the left wing of the Democratic Party. And then there’s Pete Buttigieg. “Back in the Obama campaign, we called it ‘no drama Obama,’ and I haven’t come up with the right rhyme for Buttigieg.” [cheering] Pete Buttigieg has claimed, among the moderate candidates, a sense of momentum in New Hampshire that other folks were not able to take. “We can’t risk dividing Americans further. The idea that you’ve either got to be for a revolution or you got to be for the status quo leaves most of us out.” His message here has been pretty similar to his message in Iowa, but really focused on the idea that he’s the candidate who can win crossover support in the general election. “We need a politics that brings all of us in because all of us need a new and better president.” After finishing at the top in both Iowa and New Hampshire, Buttigieg now has a tremendous opportunity to put himself forward at the national level as the leader of moderate Democrats. Announcer: “Senator Amy Klobuchar!” The word that Amy Klobuchar supporters are using to describe what happened here is ‘Klomentum.’ She came to New Hampshire after a fifth-place finish in Iowa without a whole lot of wind in her sails. “It’s been funny suddenly seeing media come to all of our events.” [laughter] Things just turned around for her dramatically. If Klobuchar had not finished so strong in New Hampshire, it might have been the end of her campaign. “If you are tired of the extremes in our politics, and you are tired of the noise and the nonsense, you have a home with me.” She gets the chance to fight onward to Nevada and South Carolina and Super Tuesday. I would not make any plans that are based on knowing a Democratic nominee anytime soon. Well, I am going to Las Vegas next, so I probably would have a chance to do that. Then, hours before the polls closed, her campaign released a nearly 2,000-word memo on her path ahead, talking delegate accumulation and detailing her rivals’ flaws: Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. was at risk of collapsing, Senator Bernie Sanders had a “ceiling” and former Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who had won the most delegates in Iowa, was in for a struggle as people in more diverse states headed to the polls. “The road to the Democratic nomination is not paved with statewide winner-take-all victories,” the memo stated. By the end of the evening, Mr. Sanders had won in New Hampshire, with Mr. Buttigieg a close second and Senator Amy Klobuchar in third. Mr. Biden, fifth here, has staked his campaign on the support of black voters in South Carolina, where he flew before the race was called Tuesday. Ms. Warren’s campaign cannot say what state it will win next. “My job,” she said on Monday, “is to persist.” Persisting and winning, needless to say, are very different things. The state of the Democratic race remains fluid. Mr. Sanders and Mr. Buttigieg outpaced the fractured field with historically low totals in Iowa and New Hampshire, and Mr. Biden’s campaign is on the ropes. Ms. Warren has more delegates than Ms. Klobuchar or Mr. Biden, she polls higher among nonwhite voters than some rivals, and she maintains an enthusiastic base of supporters and high-profile surrogates. On Wednesday, television stations in South Carolina began reporting cuts to planned advertisements, a possible sign of cash flow difficulties, even as the campaign said it was placing ads in Maine and Nevada. Allies have started to rationalize Tuesday’s defeat as something positive: That losing in stunning fashion is better than a marginal loss, because it will force campaign leadership to make the strategic shake-ups they have long resisted. “I don’t exactly get the game plan other than to try and outlast a number of people and emerge an acceptable choice to progressives and moderates at the same time,” said David Axelrod, a former top strategist for President Barack Obama. “It’s a narrow, narrow path they’re trying to navigate here. And they’re in a race against time and they’re in a race for money and at some point you have to emerge.” Inside Ms. Warren’s operation, the plan has been to position herself as the “unity” candidate, the politician best equipped to pull together the party’s various factions, especially supporters of Mr. Sanders who, if he is not the nominee, may be particularly hard to bring into the party fold. The Warren campaign is readying for a war of attrition, banking on her high favorability ratings, many small donors, and 1,000-strong staff spread across 30 states, including those that vote on Super Tuesday, to survive. From the start, Ms. Warren had bet big and early on putting grass-roots organizers in the community. But the first two results showed a limited dividend. In the end, she was overtaken in New Hampshire by Ms. Klobuchar, who chartered a plane of 20 aides from Iowa to double her staff here just for the final week. On Tuesday, her campaign manager’s memo pitched her as the “consensus choice.” But by night’s end she sat behind an array of candidates in various political lanes: Mr. Sanders among progressives, Mr. Buttigieg among those pitching unity, and Ms. Klobuchar among those looking to elect a woman. If Mr. Biden has demonstrated the challenges of running as the “electable” candidate who loses, Ms. Warren is now facing the task of selling herself as a “consensus” pick after she received less than 10 percent of the vote in New Hampshire. Her performance in the first contests has ignited new scrutiny of the close-knit team of advisers who were almost universally heralded as helming the primary’s most well-run campaign as recently as last summer. After Iowa, Ms. Warren’s staff made virtually no adjustments in New Hampshire to her messaging, other than a small addition to her stump speech about her history of winning “unwinnable fights,” a nod to the difficult political moment she now faces. “I’m surprised that she didn’t choose to engage in New Hampshire,” said Jennifer Palmieri, a former communications director for Hillary Clinton, whose book “Dear Madam President” Ms. Warren has read as she makes her own pioneering run for the White House. “She may either be on a trajectory where she only cares about the ideas or has some other plan.” Among a campaign staff headquartered in Boston, some frustration is beginning to set in. Differences are largely not generational or ideological, but exist among a cadre of midlevel and state staff who feel key decisions are kept to a small inner circle. At her watch party in Manchester Tuesday night, the mood among those gathered turned from joyous to grim. Televisions showing election results were cut off. News traveled, person to person, that Ms. Warren was likely to finish without delegates. Supporters showed a sense of defiance, with some blaming media bias. A frustrated John Tehan, 61, who traveled to the party from Ms. Warren’s home state, Massachusetts, said her finish was “disappointing.” He wished Ms. Warren had fought to speak more in the recent debate. “I don’t know if it was just the debate — but that didn’t help,” Mr. Tehan said. Ms. Warren addressed the crowd almost immediately after polls closed and her standing became clear. She spoke of the respect she had for Mr. Sanders and Mr. Buttigieg, and pointedly congratulated Ms. Klobuchar “for showing just how wrong the pundits can be when they count a woman out.” She sought to reassure supporters that she was up for what she saw as a primary fight ahead. “We’re two states in, with 55 states and territories to go,” she said. “We still have 98 percent of our delegates for our nomination up for grabs, and Americans in every part of the country are going to make their voices heard.” Then she went on to criticize the tone that the rest of the field had taken — the direct attacks in a weekend of sparring when she remained above the fray. “The fight between factions in our party has taken a sharp turn in recent weeks, with ads mocking other candidates and with supporters of some candidates shouting curses about other Democratic candidates,” she said. “These harsh tactics might work if you are willing to burn down the rest of the party in order to be the last man standing.” From the start, Ms. Warren had centered her candidacy on her ideas, and last week she told Time magazine she would even ""lead the parade” for her rivals if they were elected in her stead and adopted her myriad plans. She sought to answer the ever-elusive “electability” question through a blistering pace of policy proposals, including her signature wealth tax aimed at gaining revenue by increasing taxes on the country’s richest individuals and corporations; a proposal to break up big technology companies; and a plan that would cancel most student debt. Ms. Warren also backed progressive ideas such as the Green New Deal to combat climate change, and a “Medicare for all” health care system. She surged ahead in Iowa — leading in a November poll from The New York Times and Siena College. It would not last. In the final months of 2019, moderate rivals began to target her relentlessly, particularly regarding her support for Medicare for all. Mr. Buttigieg called her “extremely evasive.” At a Democratic primary debate in October, even candidates struggling to gain traction found Ms. Warren a welcome target. Ahead of Iowa, with internal data showing about half her support came from 2016 supporters of Mr. Sanders and half from supporters of Mrs. Clinton, the Warren campaign chose to present her as a unifying figure. In New Hampshire, one 30-second ad, entitled “Courage to Unite,” featured testimonials from a former Republican, a Clinton supporter and a Sanders backer. The ex-Sanders supporter was Ron Abramson, who was bracing for defeat in the hours before the polls closed Tuesday. “There’s this tension between being nimble and being reactive,” he said of Ms. Warren. “She’s not going to scream from the rooftops, and sometimes it makes it hard to get attention if you don’t do something dramatic.” He had hoped to see more — yet he was unsure if it would have worked anyway. “I don’t think her skills and her operation were as well-suited to the moment, in terms of raw strategic calculation, as someone else,” Mr. Abramson said. “I also think if she had tried to do it, it would have fallen flat.” Updated Feb. 29, 2020",The New York Times
2020,Opinion | What’s So Great About Fake Roman Temples?,"Opinion A spectacular campaign to elevate the design of federal buildings is under threat from small-minded classicists. Credit...Maria Mavropoulou for The New York Times The editorial board is a group of opinion journalists whose views are informed by expertise, research, debate and certain longstanding values. It is separate from the newsroom. The founders of this country, conscious that they were creating a new form of government, leaned heavily on the available ancient precedents. They dressed their new republic in the architecture of Greece and Rome, asserting its legitimacy with pillars and pediments. Now the United States is nearly 250 years old; it no longer needs to wear borrowed clothes. And modern federal buildings rightly reflect the diversity of this great nation, from the wavy blue glass of the federal courthouse in Miami to the salvaged timber planks in a federal office building in Seattle to the vertiginous white facade of a courthouse annex in Salt Lake City. Those three buildings are among the products of a 30-year-old federal program, little known but highly successful, that encourages excellence in the design of major federal buildings. Beginning with projects like the John Joseph Moakley Courthouse in Boston, which features a curved glass facade that reflects Boston Harbor, the federal program has regularly succeeded in producing buildings embraced and cherished by their occupants and their communities. But a proposed executive order, titled “Making Federal Buildings Beautiful Again,” would shift the style of future federal buildings back to the past. The order, first reported by the magazine Architectural Record, is based on the confounding premise that the United States is experiencing a crisis in civic architecture. “The federal government,” it asserts, “has largely stopped building beautiful buildings that the American people want to look at or work in.” The order is quite clear about the definition of beauty and the necessary solution to this crisis: “In the National Capital Region and for all Federal courthouses, the classical architectural style shall be the preferred and default style.” In other words, federal buildings, most of all federal courthouses, should resemble Roman temples as closely as possible — although presumably without any statues of false gods in the lobby. While the proposal has yet to reach the president’s desk, the agency that oversees the design of federal buildings is already demonstrating a renewed interest in classical architecture. In February 2019, the agency announced a design change just before the start of construction on a federal courthouse in Greenville, S.C. Instead of a 10-story brick tower, designed to resemble other buildings in the downtown area, the government is now constructing a 10-story concrete tower with classical lines. In September, the agency picked a classical design described by the winning architect as “an ode to the past” for a federal courthouse in Anniston, Ala. The new building will closely resemble the current courthouse, built in 1906. The proposed executive order reflects a broader inclination in some parts of American society to substitute an imagined past for the complexities and possibilities of the present. It embodies a belief that diversity is a problem and uniformity is a virtue. It is advocating for an un-American approach to architecture. In the 1962 guidelines that have shaped the design of federal buildings for more than half a century, Daniel Patrick Moynihan wrote that architecture “must provide visual testimony to the dignity, enterprise, vigor, and stability of the American Government.” How can anyone imagine that erecting knockoffs of ancient buildings from other cultures would serve to demonstrate the dignity, enterprise and vigor of our republic? And stability rests on those virtues: We remain strong by growing and changing. There are several thousand federal buildings: some splendid, some quite ugly, and there’s plenty of room for disagreement about which buildings belong in which category. The key point is that neither the successes nor the failures amount to an argument for the end of architecture. They are a testament to the American faith that we are in the process of forming a more perfect union. The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

2020,"‘Urban Legend’ or Authentic Trump Autograph? Either Way, It Sells","The Trump campaign is skeptical that president signed the impeachment report, but authenticators disagree. At least one expert thinks the document could bring six figures at auction. The value of an autograph, auctioneers will tell you, depends largely on four factors: scarcity, demand, authenticity and what it’s signed on. When it comes to presidents, the living ones’ signatures tend to go for less than the dead ones, said Lori Ferber, who runs a presidential memorabilia site. But occasionally the factors align to propel a living, prolific signer into the four- to five-figure zone. Since President Trump took office, the signed objects that have landed there include a book inscribed with: “Dear Carol I will never change the hair” ($3,000); a recalled Newsweek pronouncing Hillary Clinton “Madam President” ($5,435); and Mr. Trump’s sketch of the New York City skyline ($29,184). Now, in the wake of his acquittal by the Senate, one item appears poised to surpass the others: a printout of the House Judiciary Committee’s impeachment report that an auction site says was signed by the president at a rally in Michigan on Dec. 18, just hours before the House voted to impeach him. With more than two weeks of bidding left, the price had already reached $17,000 by Wednesday night. Les Gold, founder of American Jewelry and Loan and star of the TV show “Hardcore Pawn,” told The Detroit News recently that he expected the document to sell for “$100,000 to $500,000.” So how can anyone be sure Mr. Trump signed the report? And how did it end up on a South Jersey-based auction site? A search for answers offers a window into the secretive world of autograph sales and ultimately pivots on the word of a retired competitive eater, once described by MajorLeagueEating.com as “the pride of Dubuque, Iowa, and a lion at the table.” The idea to get the president to sign the report did not come from the competitive eater, however. It came from a veteran dealer, known for providing auctioneers with a steady stream of memorabilia, according to Ken Goldin, founder of Goldin Auctions, which is selling the signed report. Mr. Goldin shared an email he received about six hours before Mr. Trump arrived in Battle Creek, Mich., on Dec. 18. Subject: articles of impeachment. Body: “if u want something beyond remarkable, if all goes well tonight at his” — expletive — “rally in Michigan, Trump will sign a copy of the above — interested?” Mr. Goldin did not require convincing. He once sold a ticket to attend the 1974 Richard M. Nixon impeachment proceedings. (Nixon resigned beforehand.) “It was just a ticket and it went for $900,” he said. The plan to obtain Mr. Trump’s signature on the report proceeded without a hitch, according to a notarized letter posted on Goldin Auctions’ website. A man by the name of Jonathan Moore wrote that he asked the president “to sign the Articles of Impeachment that I handed him,” and Mr. Trump “happily complied.” Mr. Trump’s signature was authenticated by two independent companies. The problem? Not everyone is convinced that this “Jonathan” exists. Among the skeptics is Jeannie Burchfield, chairwoman of the Calhoun County Republican Party, who attended the Dec. 18 rally in Battle Creek. Based on her observation, few were permitted to get close enough to the president to even shake his hand. She knows the active Republicans in the area, she said, and though there’s a Moore and a Jonathan, “there is no such thing as a Jonathan Moore.” If someone did get the president to sign the report that day, she finds it “hilarious,” but “I think it’s an urban legend.” The White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment about the signature’s authenticity. Tim Murtaugh, the director of communications for the Trump campaign, said no one named Jonathan Moore was associated with the campaign. “Based on the description of when and where he claims to have gotten the items signed and the timeline that’s been reported,” Mr. Murtaugh said in an email, “we are highly skeptical that he and the autographed items are authentic as claimed.” Presented with these doubts, Mr. Goldin conceded that Mr. Moore could be a pseudonym. In that case, what exactly was notarized? This is where a retired competitive eater enters this story. There is a second signature on the letter. Unlike Mr. Moore’s, it is not typed out, making it easy to miss. But Mr. Goldin revealed that it belonged to Aaron Osthoff, who had previously worked with “Jonathan” to procure an oath of office that Mr. Trump signed. “I am the intermediary,” Mr. Osthoff said in a phone interview. He also confirmed that he was the same Aaron (the A Train) Osthoff credited with consuming hot dogs with what MajorLeagueEating.com called “the relentless, on-track determination of well-managed railway infrastructure.” Mr. Osthoff, who now works as a safety specialist for a manufacturing company in Iowa, said he did not attend the rally in Michigan. But he said that a friend who works as state campaign manager for Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign did. He would not say which state. “He has access to meet and greets,” Mr. Osthoff said. He declined to say whether “Jonathan Moore” was a pseudonym, stating only that the person did not want his name made public and that was why only Mr. Osthoff’s name was notarized. This means that the only thing that the official stamp on the “notarized letter” proves is that Mr. Osthoff signed a piece of paper in the presence of a notary on Dec. 30. A manager at the credit union where it was notarized confirmed this. A representative for the Iowa secretary of state said that the document should have carried a certificate specifying who was present. Mr. Goldin said that Mr. Moore’s real name is not the point. “All I need to know was that it was signed on the 18th” by Mr. Trump. And on this front, he said, “there’s no doubt in my mind.” He said that he was used to people raising questions about high-profile items and that he offers a money-back guarantee on authenticity. He said he was so convinced because of the timing of the emails he received from the dealer working with Mr. Osthoff and because his authenticators do not like to be embarrassed. Both Beckett Authentication Services and Professional Sports Authenticator, which authenticated Mr. Trump’s signature on the report, employ experts who are intimately familiar with the spacing, flow and rhythm of Mr. Trump’s letters. They have studied not only his signing implements of choice — typically a Sharpie — but also the pressure he is prone to place on the pen. Steve Grad, principal authenticator for Beckett, keeps a file of Mr. Trump’s signature going back to the 1980s for comparison. He said that Mr. Trump had two: one that resembles “a seismogram reading after an earthquake,” and another that is more legible. If “Jonathan” — or whatever his real name is — really works in politics and obtained the signature on Dec. 18, he would not be the only person in that world to sell something autographed by Mr. Trump. “Sometimes it’s the senators and the congressmen that do it,” the president lamented last month, according to USA Today. In June, Mr. Trump was mocked for signing the top corner of a D-Day proclamation, while other world leaders grouped theirs below. But in this case, Mr. Trump’s placement deserves praise, Mr. Goldin said. Even though the impeachment report was signed on a diagonal, “He never goes outside the square!” Nor does his pen interfere with the title: “Impeachment of Donald J. Trump President of the United States.” The auction closes on Feb. 22, the birthday of George Washington, a president whose signature often brings upward of $20,000.

2020,What’s a Quibi? A Way to Amuse Yourself Until You’re Dead,"Screenland Lately the same ad has been following me across the internet: It starts with an Indiana Jones type who’s stuck in quicksand. “How long do I have?” he asks his companion, who tells him he’s got “about a Quibi,” or 10 minutes, max. He throws a smartphone to the explorer, who watches a courtroom reality show starring Chrissy Teigen and chuckles as he sinks. Clever, right? It’s funny because it’s relatable: Like the explorer in quicksand, I am also slowly but inevitably dying, and I am using my finite time to watch videos on my phone. Almost all of us indulge this habit, to one degree or another, and we generally agree it’s bad for us, as individuals and possibly as a society. Quibi would like you to pay a monthly fee to do it more. Quibi is a streaming service designed specifically for mobile phones. Scheduled to debut on April 6, it promises original dramatic series, comedies, news programs, reality shows and even full-length movies serialized into episodes of 10 minutes or less. Unlike most web videos, Quibis will be professionally made and feature recognizable talent: Laurence Fishburne, Bill Murray, Steven Spielberg, Guillermo del Toro and Ridley Scott have all signed deals with the service, which has attracted more than $1 billion in funding from Hollywood studios and other investors. With the industry veterans Meg Whitman and Jeffrey Katzenberg as the company’s C.E.O. and board chairman, Quibi is not betting on a new model of producing entertainment so much as a new model of consuming it. While watching things on television or even a laptop can be a social experience, Quibi’s mobile-only distribution virtually guarantees subscribers will watch alone. In combination with short episodes, this delivery model presumes users will mostly watch when they didn’t plan to: when they are out of the house but waiting, possibly for the bus or takeout food — those short bursts of unscheduled downtime that used to leave us alone with our thoughts but now leave us alone with our phones. Quibi’s competitors are therefore not Netflix and HBO so much as YouTube and Facebook, whose previous competitors were our imaginations and memories. It’s one more thing to do with our phones instead of ever being bored. Framed that way, it sounds like an unnecessary product that may indicate some kind of incipient dystopia, or at least the increasing encroachment of past satire on present reality. In 2006, “30 Rock” imagined a 10-second sitcom made by craven executives for an audience with shattered attention spans. This formerly absurd premise will go on sale this spring. If you find that vaguely nauseating, don’t worry: Quibi seems to agree. The quicksand spot is one of a series of Quibi advertisements that explore the theme of mobile entertainment as an inappropriate way to spend the remaining moments of your life. There’s a spot in which a mustachioed villain ties a cartoon cowboy to the railroad tracks and the cowboy fishes out his phone to watch Quibis as the train approaches. It’s the least disturbing of all the Quibi ads, by virtue of being a cartoon, which puts us at the furthest remove from the finality of death. At the opposite end of this spectrum is the Quibi ad in which a general informs the president that an asteroid is about to strike Earth. “How long do we have?” the president asks grimly. “Two, three Quibis, tops,” the general replies. At this point a staff member breaks out sobbing, and a Secret Service agent closes his eyes, presumably imagining the family that will be incinerated separately from but at the same moment as him. It’s a naturalistic portrayal of anguish and dread, but then everyone takes out a phone and starts chuckling at Quibis. This approach — to ironically acknowledge our worst impulses in hopes of justifying them — has become a recognizable strategy in contemporary advertising. (“Satisfy your craving for zero human contact,” urges one ad for the food-delivery app Seamless.) A rhetorical sleight-of-hand that substitutes naming the problem for reckoning with it, this trope speaks to a culture that has become exasperated with itself but which does not expect to change. Anyone who self-deprecates recognizes the technique. “Good thing I’m not stress-eating!” I say, cleverly, as I eat full-size peanut butter cups straight out of the bag. Such acknowledgments allow me to go on doing the things I know I shouldn’t, because unlike the morons who actually engage in foolish behavior in ways that define their being, I’m doing it knowingly. That makes it different, somehow, for reasons I cannot articulate that are nonetheless critically important. By the same token, it is crucial that we maintain the distinction between our culture, which is amusing itself to death with pocket TVs in a self-aware, ironic way, and the kind of culture that would do that without realizing it. A sincere reckoning with just how much of our lives we spend watching things is probably impossible at this point. We’re not going back, and what addict wants to measure the progress of his addiction? Quibi knows that where willpower has failed, self-deprecation steps in to give our bad habits a patina of sardonic resignation. The subtext of the ads is that, unlike the man sinking in quicksand, the cowboy tied to the tracks or the doomed occupants of the Oval Office, we get that we’re ridiculous. And that ironic distance is just enough to make us feel like we’re not really in this situation. The ads also make it clear that Quibi knows it is unnecessary. With Netflix, Hulu, fuboTV, Philo, HBO Go, CBS All Access, Disney+, ESPN+, Amazon Prime Video and others, the market for streaming entertainment is thoroughly served. Here is the umpteenth iteration of a technology many of us have come to wish had never happened. The last thing we need is another reason to look at the phone, and we know it. The good people at Quibi know we know it. But they are also pretty sure that millions will pay for it anyway, so let’s just admit that, have a laugh and get on with choosing passwords. And then we can start counting down our remaining days. At the time of this writing, I am 2,236,032 Quibis old. I’ve probably only got another two million or so Quibis left. Maybe I could extend that by exercising. Or I could dedicate my remaining Quibis to study and contemplation, to prepare myself for the inevitable Quibi of my death. I could also try to forget myself and devote every waking Quibi to making other people’s Quibis more enjoyable, to alleviate the suffering that comes with our Quibis on Earth. Or I could spend as many Quibis as possible with my son. At 656,352 Quibis old, he is already becoming a man. Soon he will grow up and move out, and every Quibi between now and then is a chance to make a memory he can carry away from me. Or I could watch videos on my phone. Knowing what I know, that would actually be pretty funny.",The New York Times
2020,What’s in President Trump’s Fiscal 2021 Budget?,"Steep cuts to domestic programs and more resources for the military and policing the border with Mexico. WASHINGTON — President Trump has proposed a record $4.8 trillion budget for the 2021 fiscal year, and while Congress decides what to fund, the document provides a window into the White House’s spending priorities. The president’s plan includes about $2 trillion in cuts to safety net programs and student loan initiatives. Those reductions encompass new work requirements for Medicaid, federal housing assistance and food stamp recipients, which are estimated to cut nearly $300 billion in spending from the programs. The budget would also cut spending on federal disability insurance benefits by $70 billion and on student loan programs by $170 billion. Foreign aid, public broadcasting and environmental programs also get cut under Mr. Trump’s proposal. He wants to spend more money on areas like restricting immigration, including an additional $2 billion for his wall along the southern border, and more money to develop state-of-the-art weapons. The administration’s budget once again calls for eliminating subsidized federal student loans and ending the public service loan forgiveness program, an incentive for teachers, police officers, government workers and other public servants that cancels their remaining federal student loans after a decade of payments. Those proposals were in last year’s budget; Congress failed to adopt them. The budget proposes cutting the Education Department’s funding by 7.8 percent, to $66.6 billion. It also calls for reduced work-study funding and the creation of a single income-driven loan repayment program, to replace what has become a confusing jumble of different payment plans. Under the administration’s plan, borrowers would pay 12.5 percent of their discretionary income toward their loans, instead of the 10 percent many currently pay. — Stacy Cowley and Erica L. Green The budget proposes numerous changes to Medicaid that reduce spending on the health program for the poor and the disabled. Combined with a section of the budget devoted to “health care reform vision,” it cuts spending on Medicaid and subsidies for the Affordable Care Act by a combined trillion dollars. The budget specifies changes that would tend to reduce enrollment in Medicaid and that the Congressional Budget Office has estimated would cause some states to reverse their expansions of coverage to childless adults without disabilities as part of the Affordable Care Act. Many Medicaid beneficiaries would be subjected to work requirements and asset tests, and states would be pressed to verify eligibility for the program more often under the budget’s proposals, strategies that have been shown to reduce enrollment even among those who are eligible. States that preserve their Medicaid expansions under the Affordable Care Act would be asked to gradually pay a larger share of the medical bills for those patients. The budget would also reduce the federal share of spending for all Medicaid patients, by changing rules about how states can offer extra payments to certain health care facilities run by state or county governments, a policy that the administration has already proposed as a regulation. It would reduce a funding stream meant for hospitals that serve a “disproportionate share” of uninsured patients. The budget also makes some small expansions of Medicaid coverage: It would allow states the option to cover inpatient care for psychiatric care or drug addiction treatment. — Margot Sanger-Katz For Medicare, which the president has repeatedly pledged to leave untouched, the budget includes more than a dozen proposals to streamline the program and eliminate what the document describes as waste. Altogether, those strategies save around half a trillion dollars over the decade. But the changes do not represent major structural changes to the program that would reduce benefits or limit who would be eligible for the programs. Many of these shifts were included in President Barack Obama’s budgets as well. Among the changes: Doctors would be paid the same price for services, regardless of whether they work for a hospital or a private practice. It also includes an effort to reduce payments to long-term care hospitals for patients after they are discharged from a regular hospital. The budget suggests, for the first time, allowing Americans over 65 to opt out of Medicare entirely if they wish. And it would allow Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in a high-deductible health plan to set aside more tax-free savings for health expenses. It also calls on Congress to pass legislation to reduce the prices paid for prescription drugs. Such legislation, should it be developed and passed, would almost certainly cut spending by Medicare, which is among one of the budget’s costliest items. — Margot Sanger-Katz The president’s budget would cut funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention by 9 percent overall. But it would raise funding levels for the center’s infectious disease activities. The White House budget said its cuts reflect an attempt to “refocus” the CDC on its core mission of preventing and controlling infectious disease and other emerging public health issues, such as opioids.” The budget also targets specific programs meant to fight particular cancers and prevent common chronic diseases, combining them into smaller, combined funding streams. — Margot Sanger-Katz The administration reserved some of its deepest cuts for the Environmental Protection Agency, which would face a 26 percent reduction in funding and the elimination of 50 programs Mr. Trump deemed “wasteful” or duplicative. That’s about the level the administration has moved to cut the E.P.A. in past years, but Congress has typically restored much of the funding. Last year, for example, lawmakers ultimately provided $9.1 billion to the agency, replacing popular programs the administration had tried to eliminate like federal efforts to clean up the Great Lakes and the Chesapeake Bay. According to 2021 budget documents the Trump administration has proposed $6.7 billion in total E.P.A. spending, which would shrink the agency to funding levels it last saw during the 1990s. A budget summary said the administration aims to prioritize “core functions” like addressing lead exposure in water and revitalizing former toxic cleanup sites. On the chopping block are programs the administration deemed “outside of the E.P.A.’s core mission” like beach cleanup. The budget does not mention climate change. It also states misleadingly that air pollutant emissions dropped between 2016 and 2018, and credited the Trump administration with overseeing “some of the cleanest air and water in the world” while eliminating clean air and water regulations. After a decade of improvement in air quality nationally, federal data last year showed that fine particulate pollution has increased in the last two years. At the same time, the budget promotes a fossil fuel “energy boom” in the United States, including an increase in the production of natural gas and crude oil, both of which release carbon dioxide emissions responsible for warming the planet. Republicans in Congress this week are preparing to unveil a climate change agenda that focuses heavily on funding for “innovation” — like the development of carbon capture technology to store the planet-warming carbon dioxide that is released from power plants, or batteries to store solar power during periods of low demand. But under Mr. Trump’s 2021 budget plan, the Department of Energy, which oversees such federal research, would undergo a 29 percent cut to all programs not related to nuclear weapons and defense. — Lisa Friedman The administration once again suggested cutting funds for America’s primary food assistance program and continued an effort to reduce the number of adults who can qualify for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. The budget reduces SNAP funding by about $180 billion between 2021 and 2030. The White House has been making changes to the program on its own, including toughening eligibility requirements and cracking down on states that “misuse” work requirement waivers. In keeping with that approach, the budget proposes one set of work requirements for adults ages 18 to 65 who are able to work, rather than making a distinction on whether those adults have children or not. All adults who are able to work would have to engage in “at least 20 hours or more” of work or training in order to qualify for benefits. The budget also keeps Mr. Trump’s controversial “Harvest Box” proposal in place, continuing to suggest that poor Americans who receive SNAP benefits get a portion of their benefit in a “Harvest Box” full of food preselected for nutritional value and economic benefit to American farmers. The cache of cheaper peanut butter, canned goods, pasta, cereal, “shelf stable” milk and other products would now be selected by the federal government, not by the people eating it. The a White House official said the changes were necessary given that too many Americans remain on public assistance. “Despite significant economic improvement and a strong job market, participation has not yet declined to prerecession levels, and too many people are still missing the opportunity to move from dependence to self-sufficiency,” the budget said. — Lola Fadulu Mr. Trump proposed to again cut funding for the Department of Housing and Urban Development, including programs that help pay for rental assistance for low-income people. The budget proposes a 15.2 percent decrease in gross discretionary funding from 2020 and eliminates several block grant programs. The administration argues that some of the programs, such as the Community Development Block Grant, are not effective and that the funding could be redirected to other priorities, such as national security. The budget eliminates the Choice Neighborhoods Program, which awards grants to neighborhoods with deteriorating public and federally assisted housing, arguing that states and local governments are better able to revitalize neighborhoods. Mr. Trump also requested less money for rental assistance programs, such as Housing Choice Vouchers, and proposed that tenants who are able to work and receive assistance contribute 35 percent of their income to rent instead of 30 percent. — Lola Fadulu The proposed budget slashes discretionary funding for the Commerce Department, which monitors the weather, collects economic data, promotes exports, issues patents and other duties, by more than 37 percent, the largest single cut to any agency. More than half of that decrease, though, was a reflection of decreased spending on the 2020 census, which will not be repeated next year. The budget also pares money for the trade adjustment assistance program, which is run through the Labor Department. The program offers training and support to workers who have lost their jobs as a result of outsourcing, but it has faced criticism that it may actually end up making its recipients worse off, by temporarily taking them out of the work force for training. The Trump administration has proposed refocusing the program more on apprenticeships and on-the-job training. The cuts to the Commerce Department budget also include various reductions to economic development programs, which the administration says are duplicated elsewhere. The budget requests additional funding for investments in areas considered crucial for American competitiveness, particularly advanced technology, including artificial intelligence, quantum computing, advanced manufacturing and 5G telecom networks. The White House has proposed allowing the Commerce Department to auction off more telecom spectrum to private companies, one of the main bottlenecks in the country’s effort to advance 5G. The change would give private companies more access to a scarce resource and generate $670 million over the next 10 years, the administration said. — Ana Swanson Mr. Trump’s budget requests $2 billion to build 82 miles of border wall along the border with Mexico, as the Homeland Security Department rushes to complete 450 miles of barriers by 2021. The administration has completed nearly 120 miles thus far, almost all of it on federal land and in areas where there were sections of dilapidated wall or vehicle barriers. The $2 billion is significantly less than the $5 billion in wall funding that Mr. Trump sought a year ago, which resulted in a five-week government shutdown. While Congress has previously agreed to provide only $1.375 billion for wall construction, Mr. Trump has found a way to secure money for his wall without congressional approval by shifting billions of dollars from military construction projects and programs used to crack down on narcotics activity. The proposal also includes $182 million to hire 750 Border Patrol agents and build processing centers for agents and another $544 million to hire more than 4,600 Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and immigration court prosecutors. The White House budget includes $3.1 billion for a daily average of 60,000 beds in ICE detention centers, an increase from the 54,000 the White House requested last year. The increase in the budget request shows that the administration is likely to keep working to crack down on illegal immigration in the coming year. — Zolan Kanno-Youngs The White House has proposed a $105 billion budget — a 14 percent increase — for Veterans Affairs, including additional funding for suicide prevention, opioid addiction services and health care. Such boosts have become fairly routine and tend to enjoy bipartisan support. However, the White House again proposed changes to cost-of-living calculations, which are used to determine payments for pensions and other compensation. The plan, which would “round down” the money owed to the nearest whole dollar, has sparked pushback from veterans and lawmakers, who say it unfairly robs veterans of money. — Thomas Gibbons-Neff The White House officially proposed moving the Secret Service from the Department of Homeland Security to the Treasury Department. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has been in talks with D.H.S. officials and members of Congress to secure an agreement over legislation that would return Secret Service to Treasury, where it existed ahead of the national security reshuffling that occurred after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. The budget argues that moving it would “create new efficiencies” in the investigation of financial crimes and prepare the United States to face “the threats of tomorrow,” such as the use of cryptocurrencies to finance terrorism. There appears to be bipartisan support for the move, but Mr. Mnuchin’s unwillingness to provide documents ahead of the 2020 election on what it has cost the Secret Service to protect the president and his family has complicated the effort. The Trump administration wants to allocate $2.4 billion to the Secret Service, up from $2.3 billion a year ago. — Alan Rappeport Funding for the State Department and international aid programs would be cut by $3.7 billion, or nearly 8 percent, from current spending levels. It would dramatically reduce or eliminate aid to international organizations, including the United Nations. The overall $44.1 billion spending proposal does away with discretionary funds for unplanned expenses overseas by the United States Agency for International Development and 12 other agencies that work with the State Department. It also eliminates funding for a food aid program that officials described as too slow to meet needs, economic and development accounts that impede direct assistance to specific countries in Europe and Asia, and for the Asia Foundation, a nonprofit that boosts good governance and empowers women. Programs that would receive fewer funds include peacekeeping efforts by the United Nations, which would be cut by $447 million, and the United States’ annual contribution to the world body itself, by $508 million. The Trump administration has long complained that the United States pays 22 percent of the United Nations’ annual budget, more than any other country. In 2018, the administration ended funding to the United Nations agency that helps Palestinian refugees and tried to curb a peacekeeping mission in southern Lebanon — both as Mr. Trump sought to bolster Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ahead of elections in Israel. — Lara Jakes The administration proposes moving the Center for Tobacco Products out of the Food and Drug Administration and into a separate agency under the Department of Health and Human Services. It is not a complete surprise, as Joe Grogan, the White House head of the Domestic Policy Council, said at a news conference in November that he didn’t think the F.D.A. should regulate tobacco. But the proposal is likely to face significant opposition on Capitol Hill. Congress gave the F.D.A. the authority to regulate tobacco and vaping products under the passage of the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act of 2009. It has taken years for the agency to adopt policies for overseeing tobacco and vaping products. During that time, e-cigarettes emerged as an epidemic among teenagers. The current budget for the F.D.A. tobacco center is $662 million, and the president’s budget asks for an additional $100 million. The director of the new agency would require Senate confirmation. — Sheila Kaplan Updated Feb. 29, 2020",The New York Times

Many Medicaid beneficiaries would be subjected to work requirements and asset tests, and states would be pressed to verify eligibility for the program more often under the budget’s proposals, strategies that have been shown to reduce enrollment even among those who are eligible. States that preserve their Medicaid expansions under the Affordable Care Act would be asked to gradually pay a larger share of the medical bills for those patients. The budget would also reduce the federal share of spending for all Medicaid patients, by changing rules about how states can offer extra payments to certain health care facilities run by state or county governments, a policy that the administration has already proposed as a regulation. It would reduce a funding stream meant for hospitals that serve a “disproportionate share” of uninsured patients. The budget also makes some small expansions of Medicaid coverage: It would allow states the option to cover inpatient care for psychiatric care or drug addiction treatment. — Margot Sanger-Katz For Medicare, which the president has repeatedly pledged to leave untouched, the budget includes more than a dozen proposals to streamline the program and eliminate what the document describes as waste. Altogether, those strategies save around half a trillion dollars over the decade. But the changes do not represent major structural changes to the program that would reduce benefits or limit who would be eligible for the programs. Many of these shifts were included in President Barack Obama’s budgets as well. Among the changes: Doctors would be paid the same price for services, regardless of whether they work for a hospital or a private practice. It also includes an effort to reduce payments to long-term care hospitals for patients after they are discharged from a regular hospital. The budget suggests, for the first time, allowing Americans over 65 to opt out of Medicare entirely if they wish. And it would allow Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in a high-deductible health plan to set aside more tax-free savings for health expenses. It also calls on Congress to pass legislation to reduce the prices paid for prescription drugs. Such legislation, should it be developed and passed, would almost certainly cut spending by Medicare, which is among one of the budget’s costliest items. — Margot Sanger-Katz The president’s budget would cut funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention by 9 percent overall. But it would raise funding levels for the center’s infectious disease activities. The White House budget said its cuts reflect an attempt to “refocus” the CDC on its core mission of preventing and controlling infectious disease and other emerging public health issues, such as opioids.” The budget also targets specific programs meant to fight particular cancers and prevent common chronic diseases, combining them into smaller, combined funding streams. — Margot Sanger-Katz The administration reserved some of its deepest cuts for the Environmental Protection Agency, which would face a 26 percent reduction in funding and the elimination of 50 programs Mr. Trump deemed “wasteful” or duplicative. That’s about the level the administration has moved to cut the E.P.A. in past years, but Congress has typically restored much of the funding. Last year, for example, lawmakers ultimately provided $9.1 billion to the agency, replacing popular programs the administration had tried to eliminate like federal efforts to clean up the Great Lakes and the Chesapeake Bay. According to 2021 budget documents the Trump administration has proposed $6.7 billion in total E.P.A. spending, which would shrink the agency to funding levels it last saw during the 1990s. A budget summary said the administration aims to prioritize “core functions” like addressing lead exposure in water and revitalizing former toxic cleanup sites. On the chopping block are programs the administration deemed “outside of the E.P.A.’s core mission” like beach cleanup. The budget does not mention climate change. It also states misleadingly that air pollutant emissions dropped between 2016 and 2018, and credited the Trump administration with overseeing “some of the cleanest air and water in the world” while eliminating clean air and water regulations. After a decade of improvement in air quality nationally, federal data last year showed that fine particulate pollution has increased in the last two years. At the same time, the budget promotes a fossil fuel “energy boom” in the United States, including an increase in the production of natural gas and crude oil, both of which release carbon dioxide emissions responsible for warming the planet. Republicans in Congress this week are preparing to unveil a climate change agenda that focuses heavily on funding for “innovation” — like the development of carbon capture technology to store the planet-warming carbon dioxide that is released from power plants, or batteries to store solar power during periods of low demand. But under Mr. Trump’s 2021 budget plan, the Department of Energy, which oversees such federal research, would undergo a 29 percent cut to all programs not related to nuclear weapons and defense. — Lisa Friedman The administration once again suggested cutting funds for America’s primary food assistance program and continued an effort to reduce the number of adults who can qualify for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. The budget reduces SNAP funding by about $180 billion between 2021 and 2030. The White House has been making changes to the program on its own, including toughening eligibility requirements and cracking down on states that “misuse” work requirement waivers. In keeping with that approach, the budget proposes one set of work requirements for adults ages 18 to 65 who are able to work, rather than making a distinction on whether those adults have children or not. All adults who are able to work would have to engage in “at least 20 hours or more” of work or training in order to qualify for benefits. The budget also keeps Mr. Trump’s controversial “Harvest Box” proposal in place, continuing to suggest that poor Americans who receive SNAP benefits get a portion of their benefit in a “Harvest Box” full of food preselected for nutritional value and economic benefit to American farmers. The cache of cheaper peanut butter, canned goods, pasta, cereal, “shelf stable” milk and other products would now be selected by the federal government, not by the people eating it. The a White House official said the changes were necessary given that too many Americans remain on public assistance. “Despite significant economic improvement and a strong job market, participation has not yet declined to prerecession levels, and too many people are still missing the opportunity to move from dependence to self-sufficiency,” the budget said. — Lola Fadulu Mr. Trump proposed to again cut funding for the Department of Housing and Urban Development, including programs that help pay for rental assistance for low-income people. The budget proposes a 15.2 percent decrease in gross discretionary funding from 2020 and eliminates several block grant programs. The administration argues that some of the programs, such as the Community Development Block Grant, are not effective and that the funding could be redirected to other priorities, such as national security. The budget eliminates the Choice Neighborhoods Program, which awards grants to neighborhoods with deteriorating public and federally assisted housing, arguing that states and local governments are better able to revitalize neighborhoods. Mr. Trump also requested less money for rental assistance programs, such as Housing Choice Vouchers, and proposed that tenants who are able to work and receive assistance contribute 35 percent of their income to rent instead of 30 percent. — Lola Fadulu The proposed budget slashes discretionary funding for the Commerce Department, which monitors the weather, collects economic data, promotes exports, issues patents and other duties, by more than 37 percent, the largest single cut to any agency. More than half of that decrease, though, was a reflection of decreased spending on the 2020 census, which will not be repeated next year. The budget also pares money for the trade adjustment assistance program, which is run through the Labor Department. The program offers training and support to workers who have lost their jobs as a result of outsourcing, but it has faced criticism that it may actually end up making its recipients worse off, by temporarily taking them out of the work force for training. The Trump administration has proposed refocusing the program more on apprenticeships and on-the-job training. The cuts to the Commerce Department budget also include various reductions to economic development programs, which the administration says are duplicated elsewhere. The budget requests additional funding for investments in areas considered crucial for American competitiveness, particularly advanced technology, including artificial intelligence, quantum computing, advanced manufacturing and 5G telecom networks. The White House has proposed allowing the Commerce Department to auction off more telecom spectrum to private companies, one of the main bottlenecks in the country’s effort to advance 5G. The change would give private companies more access to a scarce resource and generate $670 million over the next 10 years, the administration said. — Ana Swanson Mr. Trump’s budget requests $2 billion to build 82 miles of border wall along the border with Mexico, as the Homeland Security Department rushes to complete 450 miles of barriers by 2021. The administration has completed nearly 120 miles thus far, almost all of it on federal land and in areas where there were sections of dilapidated wall or vehicle barriers. The $2 billion is significantly less than the $5 billion in wall funding that Mr. Trump sought a year ago, which resulted in a five-week government shutdown. While Congress has previously agreed to provide only $1.375 billion for wall construction, Mr. Trump has found a way to secure money for his wall without congressional approval by shifting billions of dollars from military construction projects and programs used to crack down on narcotics activity. The proposal also includes $182 million to hire 750 Border Patrol agents and build processing centers for agents and another $544 million to hire more than 4,600 Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and immigration court prosecutors. The White House budget includes $3.1 billion for a daily average of 60,000 beds in ICE detention centers, an increase from the 54,000 the White House requested last year. The increase in the budget request shows that the administration is likely to keep working to crack down on illegal immigration in the coming year. — Zolan Kanno-Youngs The White House has proposed a $105 billion budget — a 14 percent increase — for Veterans Affairs, including additional funding for suicide prevention, opioid addiction services and health care. Such boosts have become fairly routine and tend to enjoy bipartisan support. However, the White House again proposed changes to cost-of-living calculations, which are used to determine payments for pensions and other compensation. The plan, which would “round down” the money owed to the nearest whole dollar, has sparked pushback from veterans and lawmakers, who say it unfairly robs veterans of money. — Thomas Gibbons-Neff The White House officially proposed moving the Secret Service from the Department of Homeland Security to the Treasury Department. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has been in talks with D.H.S. officials and members of Congress to secure an agreement over legislation that would return Secret Service to Treasury, where it existed ahead of the national security reshuffling that occurred after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. The budget argues that moving it would “create new efficiencies” in the investigation of financial crimes and prepare the United States to face “the threats of tomorrow,” such as the use of cryptocurrencies to finance terrorism. There appears to be bipartisan support for the move, but Mr. Mnuchin’s unwillingness to provide documents ahead of the 2020 election on what it has cost the Secret Service to protect the president and his family has complicated the effort. The Trump administration wants to allocate $2.4 billion to the Secret Service, up from $2.3 billion a year ago. — Alan Rappeport Funding for the State Department and international aid programs would be cut by $3.7 billion, or nearly 8 percent, from current spending levels. It would dramatically reduce or eliminate aid to international organizations, including the United Nations. The overall $44.1 billion spending proposal does away with discretionary funds for unplanned expenses overseas by the United States Agency for International Development and 12 other agencies that work with the State Department. It also eliminates funding for a food aid program that officials described as too slow to meet needs, economic and development accounts that impede direct assistance to specific countries in Europe and Asia, and for the Asia Foundation, a nonprofit that boosts good governance and empowers women. Programs that would receive fewer funds include peacekeeping efforts by the United Nations, which would be cut by $447 million, and the United States’ annual contribution to the world body itself, by $508 million. The Trump administration has long complained that the United States pays 22 percent of the United Nations’ annual budget, more than any other country. In 2018, the administration ended funding to the United Nations agency that helps Palestinian refugees and tried to curb a peacekeeping mission in southern Lebanon — both as Mr. Trump sought to bolster Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ahead of elections in Israel. — Lara Jakes The administration proposes moving the Center for Tobacco Products out of the Food and Drug Administration and into a separate agency under the Department of Health and Human Services. It is not a complete surprise, as Joe Grogan, the White House head of the Domestic Policy Council, said at a news conference in November that he didn’t think the F.D.A. should regulate tobacco. But the proposal is likely to face significant opposition on Capitol Hill. Congress gave the F.D.A. the authority to regulate tobacco and vaping products under the passage of the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act of 2009. It has taken years for the agency to adopt policies for overseeing tobacco and vaping products. During that time, e-cigarettes emerged as an epidemic among teenagers. The current budget for the F.D.A. tobacco center is $662 million, and the president’s budget asks for an additional $100 million. The director of the new agency would require Senate confirmation. — Sheila Kaplan Updated Feb. 29, 2020",The New York Times
2020,Highlights From the Nevada Caucuses: Bernie Sanders Is Declared the Winner,"Officials with the Nevada Democratic Party and the Democratic National Committee stressed all week that they had gone to school on lessons learned from the bungled Iowa caucuses, when a smartphone app for reporting results crashed and phone lines to report results were jammed for hours. But by 11:00 p.m. Eastern time — more than seven hours after Nevada’s caucuses began, and four hours after most of them closed — Nevada Democrats still have only reported results from about 23 percent of the state’s precincts. The tardiness stems from new caucus rules mandated by the D.N.C. that require the state party to collect more than 100 data points from each of Nevada’s 2,097 precincts. The state party also installed a duplicative reporting system to try to prevent Iowa-style mishaps that led to a litany of mathematical errors that had to be corrected later. Nevada’s protracted vote-counting served to rob several Democratic candidates who had hoped to claim a second-place finish on Saturday night and position themselves as the moderate alternative to Bernie Sanders, who won what appears to be a commanding victory in Nevada.",The New York Times
2020,What’s on TV Friday: ‘The Kingmaker’ and ‘RuPaul’s Drag Race’,"A documentary from Lauren Greenfield airs on Showtime. And “RuPaul’s Drag Race” returns for a new season on VH1. THE KINGMAKER (2019) 9 p.m. Showtime. Gold and diamonds commingle with political unrest and poverty in “The Kingmaker,” Lauren Greenfield’s documentary portrait of Imelda Marcos, the former first lady of the Philippines. Through interviews — including with Marcos, who speaks here at length — and other footage, Greenfield (“The Queen of Versailles”) examines Marcos’s time as first lady during the 1960s, ’70s and ’80s; her subsequent flight and exile; and her place in contemporary politics. The film ultimately “becomes less about one woman, her malevolent charms and quirks, and develops into an unsettling look at imperial power,” Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The New York Times. “Greenfield trots out the plunder and of course the shoes — those notorious emblems of Marcos’s excess — but also examines the appalling costs of that luxury,” Dargis wrote. “It’s an ugly story shrewdly told, with a sense of humor and also a deeper feeling for history.” RUPAUL’S DRAG RACE 8 p.m. on VH1. “Friday, February 28th, 13 new candidates enter the race.” No, that sentence isn’t pulled from the nightmares of the Democratic presidential candidates bracing themselves for Super Tuesday; it’s from a trailer for the latest season of RuPaul Charles’s flagship drag show, which will kick off its search for “America’s first drag-queen president.” That search will be aided by a collection of celebrity guests peppered throughout the season, including Nicki Minaj, Whoopi Goldberg, Leslie Jones, Chaka Khan and U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. DATELINE 9 p.m. on NBC. In 2013, Karl Holger Karlsen pleaded guilty to murdering his son in order to collect a life insurance policy. Earlier this month, Karlsen was convicted of killing his wife years earlier for the same reason. Those cases are the focus of this week’s edition of NBC’s “Dateline” series, which brings together interviews with those close to the events — including Karlsen himself. THE EDGE OF HEAVEN (2008) Stream on Criterion Channel; rent on Amazon. The writer-director Fatih Akin won the best screenplay award at the Cannes Film Festival for “The Edge of Heaven,” his critically acclaimed look at generational differences and the experience of Turkish immigrants in Germany. As the lives of its disparate characters — mothers and daughters, a father and a son — weave together, “there is a sense of human connections becoming stronger and thicker, of a fragile moral order coalescing beneath the randomness and cruelty of modern life,” A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The Times. “By the end,” he added, “you know the characters in it so well that you can’t believe you’ve seen the movie only once, yet on a second viewing it seems completely new.” ALL THE BRIGHT PLACES (2020) Stream on Netflix.

2020,What’s on TV Friday: ‘The Last Thing He Wanted’ and ‘The Clone Wars’,"A thriller based on a Joan Didion novel debuts on Netflix. And “Star Wars: The Clone Wars” gets revived on Disney Plus. THE LAST THING HE WANTED (2020) Stream on Netflix. The director Dee Rees’s 2017 adaptation of the novel “Mudbound,” about a black family and a white family in rural Mississippi in the 1940s, picked up four Oscar nominations, and Rees was the first black woman to be nominated for the best adapted screenplay Oscar. Like “Mudbound,” Rees’s latest film, “The Last Thing He Wanted,” is also adapted from a novel — but that’s about where the similarities end. Based on Joan Didion’s 1996 book of the same name, “The Last Thing He Wanted” is a geopolitical thriller about a Reagan-era journalist (Elena McMahon, played by Anne Hathaway) who goes to Central America to investigate illicit weapons sales. Its cast also includes Ben Affleck (as an American diplomat) and Willem Dafoe (Elena’s shady father). STAR WARS: THE CLONE WARS Stream on Disney Plus. Disney’s new streaming service had success late last year with “The Mandalorian,” its gritty, Western-inflected live-action “Star Wars” series that birthed the toy-mold-ready Baby Yoda. Its next dispatch from the galaxy that George Lucas built is a new season of “The Clone Wars,” a 3-D animated series that garnered a loyal fan base when it aired on Cartoon Network for several years beginning in 2008. The series, set during the time period covered by Lucas’s 2000s “Star Wars” prequel movies, strikes a lighter tone than its blockbuster counterparts; it’s a good choice for younger viewers, or those curious about creative “Star Wars” set pieces outside the confines of live action. STANDING UP, FALLING DOWN (2020) Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes and Vudu. Ben Schwartz is in the biggest movie in the country right now, but you won’t see his face in it: He voices the digital title creature in “Sonic the Hedgehog.” See Schwartz in the flesh in this indie dramedy, in which he plays a failing Los Angeles stand-up comic who moves back home to Long Island, where he forms an unlikely friendship with his dermatologist (Billy Crystal). THIS WEEK AT THE COMEDY CELLAR 11 p.m. on Comedy Central. Since the main character of “Standing Up, Falling Down” (above) isn’t an A-grade comic, don’t expect to see any superb stand-up sets in it. For that, consider “This Week at the Comedy Cellar,” a series filmed at the Comedy Cellar in New York that features sets from some of the club’s regulars. The show returns for a third season on Friday. Past episodes have featured Chris Gethard, Roy Wood Jr. and Bonnie McFarlane. THE HOURS (2002) 10:30 p.m. on TCM. Nicole Kidman, Julianne Moore and Meryl Streep star in this adaptation of Michael Cunningham’s Pulitzer Prize-winning 1998 novel, about Virginia Woolf (Kidman) and two women whose lives imitate Woolf’s art. Stephen Holden called it “deeply moving” in his review for The New York Times, adding that it is “an amazingly faithful screen adaptation of a novel that would seem an unlikely candidate for a movie.”",The New York Times
2020,What’s on TV Friday: ‘Timmy Failure’ and ‘Mythic Quest’,"A family movie from the director Tom McCarthy debuts on Disney Plus. And a new comedy series hits Apple TV Plus. TIMMY FAILURE: MISTAKES WERE MADE (2020) Stream on Disney Plus. The filmmaker Tom McCarthy’s 2015 investigative journalism nail-biter, “Spotlight,” won an Academy Award for best picture. “Timmy Failure,” his first movie since, is also about professional investigators. One of them is an 11-year-old. The other is a polar bear. Based on a series of children’s books by Stephan Pastis (who wrote the screenplay with McCarthy), “Timmy Failure” centers on a boy (Winslow Fegley) who runs a detective business in Portland, Ore., with the help of a big, hairy Arctic escapee. While the movie is skipping theaters in favor of being released directly on Disney’s streaming service, “it owes more to independent cinema than anything,” McCarthy told The New York Times last year. It is both family-oriented and proudly weird. HONEY BOY (2019) Stream on Amazon. Shia LaBeouf plays a version of his own father in this intense drama, which was written by LaBeouf and directed by Alma Har’el. Telling a fictionalized account of LaBeouf’s early stardom, more recent erratic behavior and rehabilitation, “Honey Boy” splits its story between two time periods: The 1990s, where it focuses on a young child actor, Otis (Noah Jupe), being bullied by his father (LaBeouf), and the 2000s, where it turns to an older Otis (Lucas Hedges), a blockbuster star with an explosive offscreen life. LaBeouf’s “drawling evocation of his own father is a bravura incarnation of resentment,” Glenn Kenny wrote in his review for The Times. But the film at large, Kenny wrote, is “a flex: an assertion of the clout LaBeouf claims, in interviews, to no longer have.” MYTHIC QUEST: RAVEN’S BANQUET Stream on Apple TV Plus. Some of the minds behind “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia” trade that show’s dingy bar lighting for the fluorescent shine of a video game studio in this new comedy series, the latest entry in Apple’s quest to shake up the world of streaming TV. Created by the “It’s Always Sunny” stars and producers Rob McElhenney and Charlie Day along with Megan Ganz, another producer of that show, “Mythic Quest” centers on a fictional video game company headed by a controlling, self-obsessed creative director (McElhenney, whose character does things like bring his own PowerPoint remote to somebody else’s presentation). The employees under his reign are played by a cast that includes Danny Pudi (“Community”), David Hornsby (another “It’s Always Sunny” face), Imani Hakim (“Everybody Hates Chris”) and F. Murray Abraham. THE DEMOCRATIC DEBATE 8 p.m. on ABC. Qualifying candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination will take the stage in New Hampshire on Friday night for their latest debate, capping off a turbulent week that began with Iowa caucuses thrown into disarray by a delay in results. The debate will give candidates a chance to appeal to voters before next week’s New Hampshire primaries. It’s scheduled to last three hours, giving any TV audiences made anxious by the proceedings a chance to decompress with the season-four premiere of HBO’s marijuana-dealer series, HIGH MAINTENANCE, which will air on that network at 11 p.m.",The New York Times
2020,What’s on TV Monday: ‘America’s Got Talent’ and ‘Ashley Garcia’,"“The Champions,” a spinoff talent show, finishes its second season by crowning an ultimate champion. And a new teen series debuts on Netflix. AMERICA’S GOT TALENT: THE CHAMPIONS 8 p.m. on NBC. This spinoff of Simon Cowell’s popular talent show closes out its second season with 10 franchise favorites vying for the title “ultimate champion.” The finalists, all acts that did well on previous seasons of “America’s Got Talent” or international versions of the program, include Alexa Lauenburger, whose dog act won the 2017 German competition, and Marcelito Pomoy, the winner from the Philippines in 2011. The dance group V. Unbeatable, a favorite of the judge Howie Mandel, and Sandou Trio Russian Bar, whose acrobatic performance last week was a standout, are also in contention. THE EXPANDING UNIVERSE OF ASHLEY GARCIA Stream on Netflix. There is no outrunning adolescence, even for science prodigies. Ashley (Paulina Chávez) spent her childhood becoming the “youngest person ever to earn a Ph.D.” but when the 15-year-old moves to California to do robotics work for NASA she finds herself facing the same problems as her peers, especially when it comes to romance. Ashley’s uncle Victor (Jencarlos Canela), a high school sports coach, isn’t prepared to parent a teenager, but her friend Brook (Bella Podaras) is there to pick up the slack, or at least guide her through traditional coming-of-age rituals like spin the bottle. . A QUIET PASSION (2016) Stream on Sundance Now. Rent on Amazon, iTunes, Google Play, Vudu and YouTube. More than 100 years after her death, Emily Dickinson remains an alluring enigma. Her reclusive lifestyle and enigmatic poetry have left plenty of blank space for later generations to fill in on their own. Last year the movie “Wild Nights With Emily” depicted the writer as the “heroine of a romantic comedy,” while “Dickinson,” a new series on Apple TV+, imbued her life with “millennial angst and sexual fluidity.” This Terence Davies film subverts the caricature of Dickinson that has developed over the years a bit more subtly. The director, A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The Times, “possesses a poetic sensibility perfectly suited to his subject.” His Dickinson is “a prickly, funny, freethinking intellectual, whose life is less a chronicle of withdrawal from the world than a series of explosive engagements with the universe.” This complex portrayal, he wrote, traces the poet’s development by paying “scrupulous attention to the milieu that fed it” and the existential dilemmas that both motivated and frustrated it. A FAMILY SUBMERGED (2018) Stream on Mubi. María Alché began her cinematic career in 2004 as an actress in Lucrecia Martel’s “The Holy Girl.” Since then she’s studied directing at ENERC, the highly competitive film school in Buenos Aires and begun making her own work. This film, Alché’s debut feature, tells the story of Marcela (Mercedes Moran), a middle-aged mother who grows close with her daughter’s male friend as she mourns her sister’s death. According to A.O. Scott, it “shows signs of Martel’s influence in its blend of oblique narration and subtle psychological insight,” but also demonstrates Alché’s own “arresting visual sensibility.”",The New York Times

SOME LIKE IT HOT (1959) Stream on the Criterion Channel and Amazon. Rent on Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. Marilyn Monroe shines in this classic romantic comedy by Billy Wilder. She plays Sugar, a performer who catches the eye of two men, Joe (Tony Curtis) and Jerry (Jack Lemmon), when they join her traveling band for its trip to Miami. The problem is that Joe and Jerry have disguised themselves as women in order to escape the gangsters who are pursuing them in Chicago. To keep safe they have to maintain their false identities, but as long as they do, neither can pursue Sugar. Joe tries to get around this issue by reinventing himself as Junior, an heir to an oil fortune. Regarded now as a cinematic treasure for its meticulous construction and timeless laughs, the film is also notable for including several music performances by Monroe. SEX AND THE CITY 2 (2010) Stream on Netflix. Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. New York is arguably as big a character in “Sex and the City” as Carrie, Charlotte, Miranda or Samantha. But for a good chunk of this installment of the franchise, the women leave the Big Apple behind. Their destination: Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates. Samantha, a public relations maven, has a client there who treats her and her friends to an all-expenses-paid trip. Their time in the Middle East includes all cultural faux pas you’d expect, and Aiden, a divisive character from the original series, makes an appearance. BUFFALO ’66 (1998) Stream on Hulu and Amazon.

Soon after being released from prison, Billy (Gallo) kidnaps a tap dancer named Layla (Christina Ricci) and forces her to pose as his wife. After unsuccessfully trying to curry favor with his emotionally distant father (Ben Gazzara) and obsessive mother (Anjelica Huston), Billy and Layla go bowling and check into a motel, where they acknowledge the real connection they’ve developed. But their deepening relationship is threatened by Billy’s desire to take revenge on the man he thinks is responsible for sending him to prison.

2020,What’s on TV Monday: ‘The Great Beauty’ and Iowa Caucus Coverage,"Paolo Sorrentino’s film arrives on the Criterion Channel. And CNN follows the Democratic presidential candidates as they vie for victory. THE GREAT BEAUTY (2013) Stream on the Criterion Channel. Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. In Paolo Sorrentino’s “The New Pope,” a new episode of which airs tonight at 9 p.m. on HBO, the line between the sacred and the profane is vanishingly thin. The Roman Catholic Church, as Sorrentino presents it, is a throbbing tangle of contradictions where spirituality and corruption coexist in flamboyant contradiction, often within its individual members. Desire, he indicates, is omnipresent, but its object takes many different forms. This film covers similar territory in much the same way but on a greater scale. Its protagonist, Jep Gambardella (Toni Servillo), is an aging, hedonistic journalist who undertakes a journey to discover authentic beauty and give up its many alluring counterfeits. THE CABIN IN THE WOODS (2012) Stream on Hulu. Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. Much like “Buffy the Vampire Slayer,” the television series Joss Whedon and Drew Goddard collaborated on, this movie by the pair is a comment on the genres that it draws upon. Its setup is one of horror’s most basic: A group of young people descend on the titular cabin and are soon set upon by a wide variety of terrors. But the youngsters are not alone. Two men ensconced in a mysterious control room (Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford) also appear. “There is a scholarly, nerdy, completist sensibility at work here that is impressive until it becomes exhausting,” A.O.

Eyes will be on the Hawkeye State as voters there take the first step in determining which Democratic candidate will square off against President Trump in November. The coverage on CNN will begin in the afternoon and stretch into the night. Caucusing is complicated. The process begins around 7 p.m. C.S.T. (8 p.m. E.S.T.) at school gymnasiums, public libraries and other locations across Iowa. Over two rounds, voters make their choice by congregating in designated sites. After the first round, anyone whose first-choice candidate received less than 15 percent of the caucus vote have to choose another candidate, try to join forces to muster enough support to a nonviable candidate or remain unaligned. Once this portion is complete, the final tally is made. CREED (2015) 9 p.m. on BET. The director Ryan Coogler reunites with Michael B. Jordan to reinvigorate Sylvester Stallone’s “Rocky” franchise. Jordan plays Adonis, Apollo Creed’s son from an extramarital affair. Apollo Creed, you’ll recall, was a longtime friendly rival of Rocky Balboa’s (Stallone) who was killed in a fight with Ivan Drago in “Rocky IV.” In this sequel/spinoff, Adonis, or Donnie as he’s called, wants Rocky to train him to follow in his father’s footsteps despite Apollo’s sad end. A.O. Scott called the film “a dandy piece of entertainment, soothingly old-fashioned and bracingly up-to-date.”",The New York Times

Here, singers vying for the chance to be on the show — and mentored by Jonas, John Legend, Kelly Clarkson or Blake Shelton — will audition only with their voices. Later stages of the competition include singing battles and rehearsed performances, with the guest artists Dua Lipa, Ella Mai and Bebe Rexha, as well as Kevin and Joe Jonas. BLACK IN SPACE: BREAKING THE COLOR BARRIER 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. on Smithsonian. On Aug. 30, 1983, the astronaut Guion Bluford embarked as a crew member of the Space Shuttle Challenger, making him the first African-American in space. This documentary features him alongside Edward Dwight, an Air Force pilot edged out of a position with NASA, and Frederick Gregory, the first African-American to command a NASA mission, to examine the complications of sending a black man into space during the Cold War. Also included are Arnaldo Tamayo Méndez, the first Cuban astronaut sent into space by the Soviet Union, and Ronald McNair, an African-American pilot who died in the Challenger disaster in 1986. GENTEFIED Stream on Netflix. At the center of this show tackling gentrification is Casimiro (Joaquín Cosío), a struggling Mexican restaurant owner in the Boyle Heights neighborhood of Los Angeles. He’s aided by his grandchildren, who aim to strike a balance between tradition and modernity: Chris (Carlos Santos), an aspiring chef; Ana (Karrie Martin), an ambitious artist; and Erik (J.J. Soria), who helps Casimiro run the restaurant. In his review for The New York Times, James Poniewozik wrote that the series sometimes “wants to be a sharp-elbowed satire.” But “sometimes — more effectively,” he adds, “it’s a working-class family dramedy, conscious of the cascading effects of small financial setbacks and the code-switching involved in moving across cultures.” HUNTERS Stream on Amazon. “The show has us at Al Pacino,” Mike Hale wrote in his review for The Times, noting a star-studded cast in this new series about World War II vigilantes. After the grandmother of 19-year-old Jonah Heidelbaum (Logan Lerman) is killed, he crosses paths with Meyer Offerman (Pacino), a concentration camp survivor who has assembled a group of Nazi hunters. The show takes place in the 1970s, and Meyer has reason to believe the Reich is again attempting world domination; this time, in America. The moral dilemma of the plot is easy enough to predict: Is vigilante killing, even of Nazis, really justified?",The New York Times
2020,What’s on TV Saturday: Whitmer Thomas and the N.A.A.C.P. Image Awards,"Watch a raw comedy special on HBO, or tune into the 51st N.A.A.C.P. Awards on BET. WHITMER THOMAS: THE GOLDEN ONE (2020) 10 p.m. on HBO; stream on HBO platforms. The Los Angeles-based comedian, actor and musician Whitmer Thomas keeps audiences guessing with his unusual, deeply personal sets. Is it appropriate to laugh when he performs his goth-pop song “Partied to Death?” (“My mommy drank herself to death/and I know she tried her very best/But now I can’t party because my mommy partied to death.”) Such painful realizations are sprinkled throughout this new comedy special, filmed at the same Florida bar where Thomas’s mother used to perform with her band. Much of the special is on the lighter side, though. Thomas riffs on his childhood in Alabama and his time in an emo rock band, and performs songs from his upcoming debut record, “Songs From the Golden One.” 51ST N.A.A.C.P. IMAGE AWARDS 8 p.m. on BET. This annual awards show celebrates the work of people of color in film, television, music and literature. Netflix leads going into the show, with nominations for “Dear White People,” “When They See Us” and “American Son,” among others. Lizzo received six nominations, including entertainer of the year, while Beyoncé has eight, including best female artist and documentary, for “Homecoming.” Anthony Anderson returns as host. ALMOST FAMILY 8 p.m. on Fox. This drama series, based on the Australian show “Sisters,” requires that you shut off your critical thinking switch for a moment. Julia (Brittany Snow) learns that she’s not an only child after all when her father, a successful fertility doctor, admits he used his own genetic material to conceive dozens of children over the years. The news unites Julia with two half sisters (played by Megalyn Echikunwoke and Emily Osment), and the three find comfort in their connection. If you’re wondering whether the father faces any repercussions for impregnating all those women, this two-hour season finale follows a trial brought against him in court. THE HIDDEN KINGDOMS OF CHINA 9 p.m. on National Geographic. Michelle Yeoh (“Crazy Rich Asians”) narrates this two-hour special on China’s landscape and diverse wildlife. We get a glimpse of soaring mountains and tropical jungles, and meet animals like the giant panda and the Tibetan fox. MS. PURPLE (2019) Stream on Hulu; rent on Amazon, Google Play, Vudu or YouTube. This melancholic drama from Justin Chon (“Gook”) dissects the reunion of two siblings in Los Angeles’s Koreatown. Kasie (Tiffany Chu), a karaoke hostess, is left reeling after her bedridden father’s live-in nurse quits. With little help in sight, she reaches out to her aimless, estranged brother, Carey (Teddy Lee). Both have yet to recover from their mother's abandonment years ago. Tending to their dying father lays bare their wounds and offers them a chance to regain a sense of family. Jeannette Catsoulis named the movie a Critic’s Pick in her review for The New York Times, calling it “a moody, downbeat drama soaked in color and saturated with sadness.”",The New York Times
2020,What’s on TV Saturday: ‘Horse Girl’ and ‘Ma’,"A new psychological thriller is available on Netflix. And an Octavia Spencer horror film is on HBO. HORSE GIRL Stream on Netflix. Alison Brie — who co-wrote this film with its director, Jeff Baena — plays Sarah, an unassuming and socially awkward arts-and-crafts store employee who doesn’t quite fit in with her Zumba classmates or her roommate. Despite this, she finds comfort in her favorite TV show, “Purgatory,” and in visiting a horse she used to own — both of which seem to protect her from the world’s harsh realities, including her mother’s death and her grandmother’s psychosis. Then, Sarah begins to spiral. In what is a clear mental health decline, Sarah finds herself entangled in a web of amnesia, hallucinations and supernatural experiences. “It would be tactful, at this point, for ‘Horse Girl’ to show how Sarah’s hallucinations are causing her suffering; instead, it indulges them,” Natalia Winkelman wrote in her review for The New York Times. She added, “The more time we spend inside her visions, the more we are invited to enable her, to shrug off our worry in favor of an absorbing paranormal mystery.” THE SECRET LIFE OF WALTER MITTY (1947) Stream on Criterion. “‘The Secret Life of Walter Mitty’ is a big, colorful show and a good one,” a 1947 review in The New York Times said. Walter Mitty, in his most realistic version, is a dull, suburban proofreader. But in his elaborate fantasies, he is a military commander, a surgeon and a Southern gambler, among other roles — all of which pale in comparison with the real-life adventure he finds himself on. Danny Kaye, who plays Mitty, creates a consistently charming adaptation of James Thurber’s 1939 short story of the same title. MA (2019) 8 p.m. on HBO. Octavia Spencer experiments in the horror genre for her role as the title character of “Ma.” The movie, which was directed by Tate Taylor (“The Help”) and written by Scotty Landes (“Get Out”), has similarly complicated undertones, with a plot centered around a lonely woman who provides a party basement for some rowdy teenagers. Things start to get weird when Ma, who to this point has been a comforting presence and a very lax “parental” supervisor, starts showing up in unexpected places and interacting with the children constantly. Eventually, the viewer learns that Ma — whose real name is Sue Ann — went to high school with many of her guests’ parents, and she is now seeking revenge for an unspeakably awful act performed in her past. Spencer delivers in this role, A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The Times, adding, “She’s warm, needy, scary, conspiratorial and witty, overriding any concerns for coherence with the sheer force of her personality.” THE WITNESSES 7 p.m. on Oxygen. Excommunicated members of the Jehovah’s Witnesses — who have been vocal about what they say is the church’s history of child sexual abuse — are interviewed in this two-part documentary. In their conversations with the reporter Trey Bundy, who has covered the topic for several news publications, victims and witnesses describe the lack of support they say they received from the community’s leaders, as well as attempts to hide these allegations from both congregation members and the outside world.",The New York Times

John Mulaney had to postpone a show in Toronto because he was “drafted” to host this episode, Lorne Michaels wrote in an apology to Mulaney’s Canadian fans. (Mulaney weighed in: “I’m afraid of Lorne, so I do what he says.”) This is the comedian’s third time hosting the show. He’s joined by the musical guest David Byrne, the former frontman of Talking Heads, who just wrapped up the first run of his critically acclaimed Broadway show “American Utopia.” (For those who missed the stage run, don’t fret — Byrne will reprise the production in the fall, and Spike Lee has announced that he will direct a film version to be released later this year.) TYLER PERRY’S YOUNG DYLAN 8:30 p.m. on Nickelodeon. Since retiring his Madea character last year, the prolific writer and director Tyler Perry has been preoccupied with several projects.

SEVEN WORLDS, ONE PLANET 9 p.m. on BBC America. The first season finale of this globe-trotting nature show takes us to Africa for a close look at its wildlife, with scenes highlighting hippos in need of water and ferocious battles between giraffes. COLOR OUT OF SPACE (2020) Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes or Vudu. More than 20 years after the director Richard Stanley was fired from the set of “The Island of Dr. Moreau,” he returns to narrative filmmaking with this trippy science fiction horror. The movie, an adaptation of H.P. Lovecraft’s short story, follows a family that has recently traded the city life for a quiet New England Farm. When the father, Nathan (Nicolas Cage), finally manages to reignite the spark missing from his marriage, a meteorite crashes into his front yard. Its crater unleashes a mysterious energy — in the form of a hypnotic, purple hue — that goes after the family in bizarre, bloody ways. Jeannette Catsoulis named the film a Critic’s Pick in her review for The New York Times, writing that “lovers of aberrant, gooey B-movies will be all in.” PAAVO JARVI AND SOL GABETTA 2 p.m. on medici.tv. The Estonian conductor Paavo Jarvi leads Japan’s NHK Symphony Orchestra and the Argentine cellist Sol Gabetta in this live performance from Germany. The program starts with the Emily Dickinson-inspired piece “How Slow the Wind,” by the Japanese composer Toru Takemitsu, followed by a Schumann Cello Concerto and Bruckner’s Seventh Symphony. IN SECRET (2014) Stream on Hulu; Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu or YouTube. Elizabeth Olsen seeks passion in a loveless marriage in this romantic thriller, set in 19th-century Paris.

But as the two spend time together, Sam learns that Harry is also gay, opening up the possibility for romance. The cast is supplemented by Netflix stars Britt Baron and Karamo Brown. SHAFT (2019) 8 p.m. on HBO. This fifth installation of the “Shaft” movies unites three generations of John Shafts: two detectives-gone-rogue and one M.I.T.-educated millennial. The 2019 version finds success in its characters and their dialogues, and the depiction of John Shaft (Samuel L. Jackson) shifts from an action hero to a politically incorrect dad. The Shaft newcomer, JJ (Jessie T. Usher), essentially serves as a reminder of contemporary issues and as a catalyst for shootouts. However, “story coherence has never been the point with Shaft,” A.O. Scott reminds us in his review in The New York Times. He adds: “He’s all about presence and presentation, and the grace and guile required to deal with the bad guys, the Man and of course all those women.” Jackson — who revived the series — stars again, and Richard Roundtree — the original Shaft — returns as JJ’s great-uncle. BECAUSE OF WINN-DIXIE Stream on Disney Plus. Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube.

One day, Opal finds a stray dog wreaking havoc in a grocery store, and she decides to take him home. With the help of her new friend, whom she names Winn-Dixie (after the grocery store), Opal is able to connect with the residents of Naomi and with her closed-off father. In her review for The Times, Anita Gates wrote, “It has old-fashioned and heartwarming written all over it, in heavy black Magic Marker. ” UTOPIA FALLS Stream on Hulu.

When the fourth season of this “Breaking Bad” prequel wrapped up in 2018, The New York Times’s David Segal expressed high hopes for Season 5 in his recap. “All of the major characters are on the verge of becoming even more compelling,” he wrote, “and as ‘Better Call Saul’ merges with the timeline of its chronological successor, it will get only more interesting.” Alas, Season 5 is here, and it opens with the small-time lawyer Jimmy McGill (Bob Odenkirk) settling into his new practice as Saul Goodman — the sleazy lawyer to the guilty we first met in “Breaking Bad.” This episode kicks off with a black-and-white glimpse at the future and then returns to the present, where Saul’s new life proves problematic for his relationship with his girlfriend, Kim (Rhea Seehorn).

Sometime later, they’re out of town on a case, leaving their daughter Judy (Mckenna Grace) in the hands of a teenage babysitter, Mary Ellen (Madison Iseman). Then Mary Ellen’s friend Daniela (Katie Sarife) drops by, pokes around the artifacts room and unlocks the glass case, unleashing the doll’s terrorizing spirit. Havoc ensues. The movie received mixed reviews, the consensus being that it wasn’t as frightening as its predecessors. Yet it may be worthy of a watch for fans of typical haunted house fare.",The New York Times
2020,What’s on TV Sunday: ‘Homeland’ and ‘High Maintenance’,"An acclaimed series airs its final season on Showtime. And a new series of New York vignettes is on HBO. HOMELAND 9 p.m. on Showtime. Carried by Claire Danes as Carrie Mathison, a bipolar C.I.A. officer, and Mandy Patinkin as Saul Berenson, her mentor, this series begins its final run. When the show began in 2011, a decade after the Sept. 11 attacks, Carrie was investigating a POW-turned-al-Qaeda-agent, who later became her lover. In battling the effects of the war in Afghanistan — a conflict that has lasted a generation — “Carrie was a kind of synecdoche for a rattled America,” James Poniewozik wrote in his review for The New York Times. “She both fought the shadow war for us and felt it,” he added. Now, in its eighth season, “Homeland” puts Carrie back in Afghanistan after months of Russian confinement. With the resurfacing of some Season 1 characters, the season places emphasis on Carrie and Saul’s relationship over the years. THE 92ND ACADEMY AWARDS 8 p.m. on ABC. The 2020 Oscars will forgo a host for the second year in a row, citing success from last year’s awards after Kevin Hart became enmeshed in controversy. Several nominees for the best picture title, including “Little Women” and Quentin Tarantino’s “Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood,” are period pieces. Among the nominees for best director are Sam Mendes for “1917” and Bong Joon Ho for “Parasite,” which is the only foreign film nominated in the best picture category. HIGH MAINTENANCE Stream on HBO and Hulu. Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes and YouTube. This narrator-free third-person series, which began on Vimeo before moving to HBO in 2016, is back for its fourth season on the platform. “High Maintenance,” at its most simple, is about a beloved, nameless pot dealer known as The Guy who, as he bikes around New York, is “a temporary friend-shrink-rabbi,” James Poniewozik wrote in his review of Season 1. But in the bigger picture, it’s a show about the lives and neuroses of New Yorkers, threaded together by The Guy with pot as a mere catalyst for their stories. “‘High Maintenance’ has a wide ambit,” Willy Staley wrote for The Times, “and its vignette-­based structure provides it the freedom to depict New York more accurately and fully than anything that has come before it.” GHOST (1990) Stream on Hulu. Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. Molly Jensen’s (Demi Moore) life is shaken when her lover, Sam Wheat (Patrick Swayze), is suddenly killed in a violent mugging.

THE MASKED SINGER 10:30 p.m. on Fox. You may ask yourself two questions while watching this vocal competition: Who’s behind the mask, and how can they breathe in that thing?

2020,What’s on TV Thursday: ‘Briarpatch’ and ‘Tommy’,"A murder-mystery series with Rosario Dawson debuts on USA Network. And Edie Falco stars in a new drama series on CBS. BRIARPATCH 10 p.m. on USA Network. “The thing about homicides, well, most of them are damn simple,” a lawman says in the first episode of this new murder-mystery series. “But every now and then, you’ll get one that’s tricky. Like this one right here.” He’s talking to Allegra Dill (Rosario Dawson), a powerful government staffer who has returned to her fictional, very surreal Texas hometown to investigate her sister’s death. (The sister was blown up by a car bomb.) The killing is at the center of the series, but its heart may lie elsewhere: Andy Greenwald, a former TV critic who wrote the show (it’s based on the Ross Thomas novel of the same name), said in an interview with The New York Times last year that he was influenced by shows like “Twin Peaks” and “Lost.” “They all had a community of characters who you wanted to spend time with and who you’d get excited about whenever they appeared onscreen,” he said. “‘Who did it?’ is kind of the most boring question you can ask. It seems like the most important question, but it’s really just the engine that fuels the deeper dive into the weirder, richer emotional lives of the characters and the community.” KATY KEENE 8 p.m. on the CW. The Archie Comics character Katy Keene ditches the fictional town of Riverdale for the stranger-than-fiction New York City in this new, fashion-forward musical series. A spinoff of “Riverdale,” the show reimagines Katy (Lucy Hale) and a few other Archie Comics characters as young New Yorkers chasing their dreams, which include Broadway stardom and fashion-business success. TOMMY 10 p.m. on CBS. Edie Falco plays a high-ranking New York Police Department officer who ditches New York for Los Angeles in this drama series. Tommy (Falco) has good professional reasons to leave: In the first episode, debuting Thursday, she starts a new gig as Los Angeles’s first female chief of police. Given the stakes of the new job — an early challenge sees her navigating a conflict between the L.A.P.D. and Immigration and Customs Enforcement — she probably isn’t going to have much time to enjoy the weather. MISS AMERICANA (2020) Stream on Netflix. Taylor Swift offers a controlled look at her life and creative process in this new documentary, which highlights the loneliness of being one of the biggest pop stars on the planet. “Miss Americana” shows Swift’s professional life to be filled with pressure and battles with the patriarchy; it tells the story of an artist maturing both as a creator and as a person. “What’s bracing about this film, which Lana Wilson directed, is the way it weds Swift’s loneliness and her arrival at empowerment,” Wesley Morris wrote in his review for The Times. Morris called it “85 minutes of translucence with Taylor Swift.”",The New York Times
2020,What’s on TV Thursday: ‘I Am Not Okay With This’ and ‘Star Trek Beyond’,"A new series about a superpowered Pennsylvania teenager hits Netflix. And “Star Trek Beyond” airs on Syfy. I AM NOT OKAY WITH THIS Stream on Netflix. “I do want you to at least attempt to have a normal high school experience,” a school counselor tells Sydney (Sophia Lillis) in this new series. That’s not likely to happen: Sydney, a teenage girl in Pennsylvania, has superpowers that allow her to destroy objects with her mind. Adapted from a graphic novel by Charles Forsman, the series follows Sydney as she discovers those powers, which she grapples with alongside family tragedy and the awkward slog of high school. Helping her are a best friend (played by Sofia Bryant) and an eccentric young neighbor (Wyatt Oleff). The series “is firmly within both the superhero and teen-angst traditions,” James Poniewozik wrote in his review for The New York Times, “and, fair warning, is not immune to the clichés of either. What distinguishes it, however, beyond a tart voice and a pair of engaging performances, is that it commits as fully to its YA half as to its biff-pow-blam half.” UPGRADE (2018) Stream on HBO platforms. The filmmaker Leigh Whannell is behind the adaptation of H.G. Wells’s “The Invisible Man” that hits theaters this weekend. While many may be most likely to know Whannell as a screenwriter (“Saw” and “Insidious”), he has directed a couple of other movies. The most recent of those, “Upgrade,” is an action-horror romp that stars Logan Marshall-Green as Grey Trace, a man of the near future who has a technology implant that gives him superhuman abilities. He uses them to avenge his wife’s killing. “‘Upgrade’ is an energetic, superficially slick, latter-day B-movie of the ‘but dumb’ category,” Glenn Kenny wrote in his review for The Times. “That is, it’s kind of like ‘RoboCop,’ but dumb, and also like ‘Ex Machina,’ but dumb. In this respect the movie manages to be pretty funny.” BLUEBIRD (2019) Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. Bluebird Cafe, the landmark Nashville venue known as a haven for songwriters, is shown off in this documentary. The movie captures Taylor Swift, Garth Brooks, Maren Morris, Kacey Musgraves, Jason Isbell, Steve Earle and other musicians praising the cafe. STAR TREK BEYOND (2016) 6:30 p.m. on Syfy. After directing “Star Trek” (2009) and “Star Trek Into Darkness” (2013), J.J. Abrams jumped ship to helm “Star Wars: The Force Awakens.” So directing duties for this third entry in the most recent “Star Trek” movie series went to Justin Lin, known for several of the “Fast and the Furious” movies. But “Beyond” brings back the series’s key onscreen players, including James Tiberius Kirk (Chris Pine), Spock (Zachary Quinto), Uhura (Zoe Saldana) and Sulu (John Cho). The villain this time is a warlord played by Idris Elba. “It should have been called ‘Star Trek Within,’” A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The Times, “in honor of its determination to color inside the lines, obeying the ironclad conventions of brand and genre.”",The New York Times
2020,What’s on TV Thursday: ‘Jojo Rabbit’ and ‘On Point’,"Taika Waititi’s Oscar winner is available to rent on many streaming platforms. And a new basketball documentary series is on Crackle. JOJO RABBIT (2019) Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. “Remember that joke Kate Winslet has in ‘Extras,’ where she says you’d better make a Holocaust film if you want an Oscar?” Taika Waititi asked in an interview with The New York Times last year. “People might think that’s kind of true, but there was never in my mind any reality where this film was going to be part of that conversation.” He was talking about “Jojo Rabbit,” the satire he wrote and directed, which had become an unlikely awards-season contender and would win him an Oscar for best adapted screenplay. The movie, based a novel by Christine Leunens, follows Johannes (Roman Griffin Davis), a 10-year-old in Nazi Germany whose imaginary best friend is Adolf Hitler (Waititi) and whose mother, Rosie (Scarlett Johansson), is hiding a Jewish girl (Thomasin McKenzie) in their house. The film “risks going wrong in a dozen different ways,” A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The Times, “and manages to avoid at least half of them.” THE CALL OF THE WILD (1972) Stream on Amazon and Tubi. Harrison Ford returns to theaters this weekend in a new adaptation of “The Call of the Wild,” Jack London’s 1903 novel about an outdoorsman and a dog. This earlier adaptation casts Charlton Heston in the lead role (the human one). Those curious to compare Heston’s and Ford’s takes might revisit it, but beware: Heston once called this film “the worst movie I ever made.” ON POINT Stream on Crackle. Guest appearances by the N.B.A. players Steph Curry, Kevin Durant and Zion Williamson add a bit of celebrity might to this amateur basketball documentary series — but if the young players in the show have their dreams fulfilled, they’ll become stars, too. “On Point” follows high schoolers playing A.A.U. basketball. Reminiscent of shows like “Last Chance U,” it follows them on the court and off. PLAYING FOR KEEPS Stream on Sundance Now. Those who prefer their sports with a side of murder-mystery can turn to this Australian series, which centers on the wives and girlfriends of a group of fictional Australian soccer players. Their flashy lives might be enviable to some — but the death of a player brings unsettling mystery and media scrutiny. THE UPSIDE (2019) 6 p.m. on Showtime 2. The 2012 French dramedy “The Intouchables,” about an unlikely friendship between an uptight aristocrat with paraplegia and an employee, was a box-office sensation overseas. This Hollywood remake stars Bryan Cranston and Kevin Hart. It keeps the main relationship the same (Cranston plays the rich man) but moves the action to New York. “Some squinting will be required to block out the race and class stereotyping, as well as the puddles of sentiment scattered throughout the highly predictable plot,” Jeannette Catsoulis wrote in her review for The Times. “Yet Jon Hartmere’s script has genuinely funny moments and is blessedly short on crassness: even a scene involving catheters and colon hygiene is less cringey than you might expect.”",The New York Times
2020,What’s on TV Thursday: ‘To All the Boys: P.S. I Still Love You’ and ‘Indebted’,"A sequel to “To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before” is on Netflix. And the second episode of “Indebted” with Fran Drescher airs on NBC. TO ALL THE BOYS: P.S. I STILL LOVE YOU (2020) Stream on Netflix. Netflix’s teen romantic comedy “To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before” ended with a kiss on a lacrosse field. This sequel begins with a happy solo dance in front of a mirror. Based on a young adult novel by Jenny Han and heavily inspired by teenage comedies of the 1980s, the movie became a streaming hit when it debuted in 2018. The sequel continues the story of the teenagers Lara Jean (played by Lana Condor) and Peter Kavinsky (Noah Centineo), whose happily-ever-after ends up being complicated by the fact that, well, they’re in high school, and they’re human. “When dealing with a franchise, especially one that was as successful as the first film, you really want to follow up with something that isn’t just exactly what the audience would want,” Centineo said in a recent interview with The New York Times. But they also obviously want the new recipe to spark the same kind of joy that the original did in its devotees. Or, as Centineo put it: “Chicken soup for the soul, baby. That’s what we want.” THE BREAKFAST CLUB (1985) Stream Starz platforms; rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. In her review for The Times, Amy Nicholson wrote that “To All The Boys: P.S. I Still Love You” seems as though it has been “beamed in from a staticky old channel,” and compared it to John Hughes’s 1980s movies. So it’s fitting that one of Hughes’s most famous films, “The Breakfast Club,” is turning 35 years old this month. Revisit it to see five cheeky high-school students (Judd Nelson, Molly Ringwald, Emilio Estevez, Ally Sheedy and Anthony Michael Hall) making conversation and experimenting with marijuana in detention. INTERROGATION Stream on CBS All Access. Peter Sarsgaard and David Strathairn star in this true-crime series, which is based on an actual murder case and built on a novel concept: Viewers can choose the order in which they watch it. Episodes each center on individual interrogations, and are self-contained enough that most of them make sense in any order. (Be sure to save Episode 10, the finale, for last, though.) Don’t like the gimmick? “Any order” includes straight through, if you wish. INDEBTED 9:30 p.m. on NBC. “We’re here, we’re broke, get used to it!” That proclamation is made by Fran Drescher in this new sitcom, which is premised on a rather serious topic: Debt. Drescher and Steven Weber play Debbie and Stew Klein, a boomer couple who go bust and decide to move in with their adult son (played by Adam Pally) and his wife (Abby Elliott). The first episode aired last week; it’s available to stream on NBC platforms and Hulu for those who want to catch up before the second episode, which will air on Thursday.",The New York Times
2020,What’s on TV Tuesday: The Democratic Debate and Pete Davidson,"Democratic presidential candidates face off before the South Carolina primary, and Pete Davidson debuts his first Netflix comedy special. DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE 8 p.m. on CBS. Seven candidates have qualified for this debate in Charleston, S.C.: Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York, former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota; and the billionaire businessman Tom Steyer. A lot is riding on their performances. The debate comes four days before the South Carolina primary and just before the Super Tuesday primaries and caucuses on March 3. Bloomberg may try to redeem himself after scathing attacks on the debate in Las Vegas last week. Warren came out strong with an aggressive performance, while Sanders walked away mostly unharmed, politics reporters for The New York Times wrote in an analysis. GORDON RAMSAY’S 24 HOURS TO HELL AND BACK 8 p.m. on Fox. In this two-hour season finale, the host Gordon Ramsay tries to save a pizza restaurant and a Korean-inspired eatery in Arkansas. The owner of the pizza place is prone to violent outbursts, while the owner of the Korean-inspired joint lacks the industry know-how to run a successful business. AMERICAN MASTERS — MILES DAVIS: BIRTH OF THE COOL (2020) 9 p.m. on PBS (check local listings). This Grammy-nominated documentary from the director Stanley Nelson (“The Black Panthers: Vanguard of the Revolution”) charts Miles Davis’s career, from his early days at Juilliard to his experimental years in the 1970s and ’80s. It’s rife with archival gems and features interviews with a long list of big names, including Quincy Jones, Carlos Santana and Clive Davis. In his review for The Times, Glenn Kenny wrote that while there is no shortage of documentaries on Davis, “Birth of the Cool” is “commendably thorough.” REAL SPORTS WITH BRYANT GUMBEL 10 p.m. on HBO; stream on HBO platforms. This investigative sports program returns with a new heartfelt episode. The host, Bryant Gumbel, sits down with the trainer and family of the boxer Patrick Day, who died in October after a brain injury sustained during a match. PETE DAVIDSON: ALIVE FROM NEW YORK (2020) Stream on Netflix. This year is shaping out to be pretty busy for Pete Davidson. The “Saturday Night Live” cast member stars in Judd Apatow’s upcoming comedy, “The King of Staten Island,” which will debut at the South by Southwest Film Festival on March 13. That same day, he will hit theaters in the Hulu coming-of-age comedy “Big Time Adolescence.” And on Tuesday he showcases his stand-up in this new special, his first for Netflix. Expect some personal, worrying anecdotes: The title may be referring to a troubling Instagram post from late 2018, after his breakup with Ariana Grande. The comedian laughed off the incident on “S.N.L.” soon after, and, more recently, joked about spending time in rehab.",The New York Times
2020,What’s on TV Tuesday: ‘Cherish the Day’ and ‘For Life’,"A new series from Ava DuVernay debuts on OWN, while a legal drama arrives on ABC. CHERISH THE DAY 10 p.m. on OWN. After creating the OWN family drama “Queen Sugar,” Ava DuVernay was invited to bring another show to the network. The result is this new anthology series. The season follows the relationship of a single couple, each episode focusing on a momentous, single day they share together. The premiere stars Xosha Roquemore (“The Mindy Project”) and Alano Miller (“Underground”) as a couple in Los Angeles who, over the course of several years, forge a deep connection and face hurdles that challenge their relationship. ALI & CAVETT: THE TALE OF THE TAPES (2020) 9 p.m. on HBO; stream on HBO platforms. Some might say Muhammad Ali was made for prime-time television. In the 1960s and ’70s, the boxer made more than a dozen appearances on “The Dick Cavett Show.” He was charismatic, witty and, at times, provocative. But as a guest on the show, he also brought light to social injustices against black people at a time when the United States was convulsed by racial tension. This new documentary offers a window into Ali’s mind through clips of those appearances — in which he thoughtfully shared his political, social and religious views — and provides context using interviews with authors, civil rights activists, sports commentators and Cavett himself. FOR LIFE 10 p.m. on ABC. This new legal drama, co-produced by Curtis “50 Cent” Jackson, is loosely inspired by the case of Isaac Wright Jr., a man who was wrongfully convicted of masterminding a drug distribution network in New Jersey in the 1990s. In the series, Aaron (Nicholas Pinnock) is serving a life sentence for a crime he didn’t commit, and believes the only way out is to take on his own case. He devotes several years to studying to become a lawyer and, later, defends other inmates while trying to overturn his own conviction. He treads the complicated and corrupt system with the help of a progressive warden (Indira Varma of “Game of Thrones”) and the motivation to return to his wife and teenage daughter. CAPTAIN UNDERPANTS EPIC CHOICE-O-RAMA Stream on Netflix. Pants or no pants? The quirky children’s superhero returns in this new interactive special, which gives viewers the power to help grade schoolers Harold (voiced by Ramone Hamilton) and George (Jay Gragnani) stop Principal Krupp (Nat Faxon) from destroying their treehouse. Netflix presented this “choose-your-own-adventure” method in an episode of “Black Mirror” in 2018. The stakes may not be as high here, but the beloved cartoon is sure to entertain adults and children alike. BANCROFT Stream on BritBox. If you prefer bad cops over good cops (on television, that is), consider streaming this fast-paced British thriller. Season 1 introduced us to Elizabeth Bancroft (Sarah Parish), a detective who harbors a dangerous secret and steps over many lines to keep a colleague from discovering it. Season 2 picks up after Bancroft gets her promotion, her hands seemingly wiped clean of a murder. Critics have said the show hovers between silly and absurd, which, depending on your taste, can only add to its entertainment value.",The New York Times
2020,What’s on TV Tuesday: ‘Contact’ and the State of the Union,"A film starring Jodie Foster is airing. And President Trump delivers his third State of the Union Address. CONTACT (1997) 7 p.m. on Ovation. Based on the 1985 science-fiction novel of the same title by Carl Sagan, “Contact” yearns to bridge the gap between humanity and technological advancement. Jodie Foster plays Ellie Arroway, a scientist devoted to finding extraterrestrial life, who picks up a radio signal from another planet. This garners national attention, and as Ellie decodes the aliens’ message, she must protect her work from those trying to steal or discount it. Ellie and a young minister named Palmer Joss (Matthew McConaughey) engage in a debate throughout over science and religion — and Palmer also becomes a love interest. “But try as it might to convey a humanist, mystical message and to equate the search for extraterrestrial life with religious faith,” Stephen Holden wrote in his review for The New York Times, “‘Contact’ is much more convincing when worshiping at the cold shrine of technology.” STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS 8 p.m. on CNN; 9 p.m. on CBS, ABC, NBC and FOX. President Trump will deliver his third State of the Union Address — the last of this presidential term. Mr. Trump’s first State of the Union Address focused on immigration policy, and his second — which was rescheduled because of a government shutdown over funding for a border wall — touched on looming Congressional investigations into his conduct. This year, the speech comes a day ahead of a final vote on his impeachment. TOM PAPA: YOU’RE DOING GREAT! Stream on Netflix. The film, TV, radio and podcast comedian Tom Papa makes his Netflix debut with an hourlong routine filmed in his home state, New Jersey. In this special, Papa covers life’s simple pleasures: getting married, having two daughters, and living with the notion of being a parent. With asides about pets, climate change, social media and Staten Island, Papa assures viewers that we’re all just doing our best. BRIDGET JONES’S DIARY (2001) Stream on Hulu. Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. If Bridget Jones just loses 20 pounds and cuts down on alcohol, cigarettes and carbs, she’ll probably find (and land) the man of her dreams. At least, that’s her hope. Luckily, her current suitors — her charming boss, Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant), and her former childhood friend, the earnest Mark Darcy (Colin Firth) — assure our heroine that they like her for exactly who she is. Renée Zellweger, who adopts an unassuming British accent to play Bridget, was nominated for an Academy Award for her role. “Ms. Zellweger accomplishes the small miracle of making Bridget both entirely endearing and utterly real,” Stephen Holden wrote in his review for The Times. The movie’s sequels, BRIDGET JONES: THE EDGE OF REASON (2004) and BRIDGET JONES’S BABY (2016), will also be available for streaming.",The New York Times
2020,What’s on TV Tuesday: “Super 8” and “#TEAMPLUTO”,"A monster movie is available for streaming. And a documentary about the famous dwarf planet is on Discovery. SUPER 8 (2011) Stream on Amazon and Hulu. Rent on Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. Directed by J.J. Abrams and produced by Steven Spielberg, “Super 8” has all the makings of a classic monster movie. It takes place in 1979, in a small Ohio town largely populated by steel workers and their children, including Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney), the story’s protagonist. Joe — who lives with his father, the local sheriff (Kyle Chandler) — is filming a zombie movie with his 11-year-old friends when they witness a train crash, and they investigate. “You know that, in the homestretch, big battles will be fought, lessons will be learned, the elusive monster will be revealed and other loose ends will be tied up,” A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The New York Times. He adds, “You may wish it did not all happen in such a perfunctory, predictable way.” DRIVING MISS DAISY (1989) Stream on Netflix. Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. Morgan Freeman and Jessica Tandy star in this film adaptation of Alfred Uhry’s Pulitzer Prize-winning play. Miss Daisy (Tandy), an affluent Jewish woman in Atlanta, has been deemed no longer fit to operate a vehicle by her son, Boolie (Dan Aykroyd), who instead hires her a driver. He chooses Hoke Calhoun (Freeman) for the job. The 60-year-old widower has an incredible tolerance for Miss Daisy’s stubbornness and the film chronicles a friendship that lasts 25 years. “Miss Daisy and Hoke are as much outsiders for their age and sensibility as for anything else,” Vincent Canby wrote in his review for The Times, adding, “Theirs is the friendship of equals.” #TEAMPLUTO 11:01 p.m. on Discovery. On Feb. 18, 1930, Pluto was discovered at the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Ariz. But in 2006, it was reclassified as a dwarf planet. In this Discovery Channel special on Pluto’s 90th anniversary, scientists return to the Lowell Observatory to discuss the reasoning behind the change and the possibility of its gaining status as a planet once again. AMAZON EMPIRE: THE RISE AND REIGN OF JEFF BEZOS 9 p.m. on PBS. This two-hour special explores Jeff Bezos’s multi-billion-dollar company. In Amazon’s 26-year life span, the company and its founder have faced scrutiny over their wide reach and influence. “Amazon Empire” interviews critics who claim the company is nearing a monopoly status, as well as former executives, government officials and Amazon employees. HOT ONES: THE GAME SHOW 10 p.m. on TruTV. This new half-hour game show combines trivia and hot wings for the chance to win $25,000. In each episode, two teams compete in three rounds of trivia accompanied by chicken wings with increasingly spicy sauces. If the contestants can maintain their cool enough to advance through the rounds, they may earn a soothing milkshake and a cash prize. Sean Evans, an executive producer, also hosts.",The New York Times
2020,What’s on TV Wednesday: ‘Lego Masters’ and ‘Expedition Unknown’,"A Lego competition series debuts on Fox. And “Expedition Unknown” returns for another season on Discovery Channel. LEGO MASTERS 9 p.m. on Fox. Pop quiz: What’s the plural of Lego? That question is addressed at the start of this competition series, which has aired in different forms overseas but is now coming to United States audiences. Will Arnett (known in certain circles as the voice of Lego Batman) hosts the United States version of the show, alongside a pair of Lego designers. The competition pits teams from around the country against one another in a variety of brick-building challenges. The contestants’ first assignment: to create a model theme park. Their time limit? 15 hours. The prize for winning the competition at large is $100,000 — though surely any contestants who make it through without stepping on a brick can be considered successful. MONEYBALL (2011) 6:47 p.m. on Starz. The New York Times’s co-chief film critic Manohla Dargis recently wrote an article arguing that Brad Pitt has been undervalued as a performer. Pitt was nominated for an acting Oscar this year, but that’s a relatively rare thing — the last time he was up for one was toward the beginning of the 2010s, when he was recognized for his performance in this baseball drama. In it, Pitt plays Billy Beane, the Oakland Athletics manager whose innovative methods helped the A’s compete against teams with far higher budgets in the early 2000s. FENCES (2016) 10 p.m. on BET. Baseball also plays a role in “Fences,” August Wilson’s Pulitzer Prize-winning play about love and contention in a 1950s Pittsburgh household. This film adaptation stars Denzel Washington as the protagonist, Troy Maxson, a former Negro Leagues player who might have been a Major League star if he’d been born in a different decade. The plot hinges on Troy’s struggles to accept the athletic potential of his teenage son, Cory (Jovan Adepo), and the sometimes strained relationship between Troy and his wife, Rose (Viola Davis). “If the sound were to suddenly fail — or if the dialogue were dubbed into Martian — the impact of the performances would still be palpable,” A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The Times. EXPEDITION UNKNOWN 8 p.m. on Discovery Channel. Josh Gates has explored many exciting places as the host of this travel series: He’s visited an archaeological dig site in Egypt, a sinkhole in Siberia and Australia’s Shipwreck Coast in his mission to investigate historical mysteries. In the first episode of the new season, debuting Wednesday, he’ll be in Normandy, where he follows historians studying D-Day and tours a newly discovered World War II bunker. Don’t expect him to stay there long, though: By the end of the season, he’ll be in the Bermuda Triangle. McMILLIONS Stream on HBO platforms. The life and death of a scam in six parts, this new documentary series revisits an elaborate real-life scheme that involved a former police officer defrauding McDonald’s out of $24 million. The first episode aired on HBO on Monday; it’s available to stream for those who want to catch up before next week’s episode.",The New York Times
2020,What’s on TV Wednesday: ‘The Chef Show’ and ‘Year of the Rabbit’,"New episodes of “The Chef Show” hit Netflix. And a Victorian comedy series debuts on IFC. THE CHEF SHOW Stream on Netflix. It’s easy to see why Jon Favreau and Roy Choi signed on to host this food travel show. One of the new episodes finds them chomping down smoked fish at Wexler’s Deli in Southern California. (“It looks so good,” Choi marvels.) Another begins with footage of the two sampling red wine given to them by Wolfgang Puck. (Favreau’s conclusion: “It’s good.”) Other highlights from the latest batch of episodes, released Wednesday, include the pair getting a lesson in cooking Peruvian ceviche from the chefs and restaurateurs Susan Feniger and Mary Sue Milliken, and cooking bread and biscuits with the filmmaker Sam Raimi. Raimi seems mildly envious of the pair’s gig: “Boy,” he says while holding a steaming bowl of delicious-looking food, “this is one of the toughest shoots I’ve been on.” JUSTIN BIEBER: SEASONS Stream on YouTube. Last week, Justin Bieber released “Changes,” his first album in a half-decade, in which he attempts to reimagine himself by fully embracing R&B. Accompanying the new album is “Seasons,” a YouTube series that chronicles his return, his music-making process and his struggles with stardom, which include several years of drug abuse. “The first few episodes of ‘Seasons’ are about, loosely, how the sausage gets made,” Jon Caramanica wrote in a recent article in The New York Times. “But the subsequent ones are something else altogether — a picture of how the sausage almost doesn’t get made.” YEAR OF THE RABBIT 10:30 p.m. on IFC. The writer-performer Matt Berry is known overseas for playing a sleazy corporate executive and failed actor in the British sitcoms “The IT Crowd” and “Toast of London,” but domestic audiences are probably most likely to recognize him as one of the vampire roommates in the ongoing “What We Do in the Shadows” TV series. Berry dons a figurative detective’s cap and literal mutton chops in this Victorian spoof, in which he plays a foul-mouthed inspector in 19th-century London. The story sees his character attempting to solve crime alongside two partners, one of them very inexperienced (played by Freddie Fox) and another far more adept than him (Susan Wokoma). NATURE: THE MIGHTY WEASEL 8 p.m. on PBS (check local listings). An orchestral arrangement of “Pop Goes the Weasel” opens this latest entry in PBS’s “Nature” documentary series. The program strikes a playful tone as it educates viewers about the minutiae of weasel life, and the lives of some related mammals. Ana Gasteyer, the actress and former “Saturday Night Live” cast member, narrates. BLACK PATRIOTS: HEROES OF THE REVOLUTION 10 p.m. on History. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar hosts this hourlong documentary, which centers on the experiences of African-Americans during the Revolutionary War. The figures it looks at include the poet Phillis Wheatley, the soldier Peter Salem and Crispus Attucks, whose death during the Boston Massacre helped spark the revolution.",The New York Times
2020,What’s on TV Wednesday: ‘The Farewell’ and ‘Big Cat Country’,"Lulu Wang’s indie hit is streaming on Amazon. And a new nature series debuts on the Smithsonian Channel. THE FAREWELL (2019) Stream on Amazon; rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. While it may not have garnered any Academy Award nominations, this comedic drama from Lulu Wang netted a Golden Globe for its star, Awkwafina, and was among the highest-grossing indie movies of 2019. Based on an experience from Wang’s own life (or, as the film puts it, “based on an actual lie”), “The Farewell” casts Awkwafina as Billi, a young, creative New Yorker who learns that her overseas grandmother (played by Zhao Shuzhen) has a terminal illness. Billi travels with her parents to the northern Chinese city of Changchun, where her grandmother lives, but not before reluctantly agreeing to terms set by the rest of the family: Nobody is permitted to tell the matriarch about her illness. What follows is a bittersweet story that plumbs family relationships and cultural differences. The film “has a loose, anecdotal structure and a tone that balances candor and tact,” A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The New York Times. “Much of the charm and power of this story — about events leading up to a wedding that’s also a fake funeral of sorts — come from the palpable sense that it genuinely happened to someone.” TOY STORY 4 (2019) Stream on Disney Plus; rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. On Sunday, “Toy Story 4” became the second movie in the series to win an Academy Award for best animated feature. (“Toy Story 3” won in 2010; the first two were released before the category existed.) Like its predecessors, “Toy Story 4” assembles Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks), Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) and their plastic cronies for an adventure — this time one that involves a road trip and a spork with a death wish (Forky, voiced by Tony Hale). “The animation is striking, the jokes amusing and the story sweet,” Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The Times, “though this being Pixar, the tale is also melancholic enough that the whole thing feels deeper than it is.” She deemed the movie “great-ish.” BIG CAT COUNTRY 8 p.m. on Smithsonian Channel. This new nature series centers on two prides of lions along the Luangwa River in Zambia, dramatically narrating their hunts and power struggles. (An example: “A herd of buffalo is coming to drink. The herbivores don’t see the lions … Until it’s too late.”) In other words: “Cats” this is not. WATCHMEN (2009) 6:30 p.m. on IFC. Those who watched HBO’s recent, radically reimagined TV riff on Alan Moore’s “Watchmen” graphic novel can see a very different take on the material in this film adaptation, which was directed by Zack Snyder. With a cast that includes Billy Crudup and Carla Gugino, this version adheres more closely to the graphic novel than HBO’s version — but wasn’t nearly as well received by critics.",The New York Times
2020,What’s on TV Wednesday: ‘War for the Planet of the Apes’ and Amy Hoggart,"The most recent “Planet of the Apes” movie airs on FXX. And the comedian Amy Hoggart stars in a new show on TruTV. WAR FOR THE PLANET OF THE APES (2017) 9 p.m. on FXX. The new big-screen adaptation of Jack London’s “The Call of the Wild” shares an actor with “War for the Planet of the Apes,” but you won’t see his face in either movie: He’s Terry Notary, a motion-capture performer whose movements provided the basis for the digital dog that stars opposite Harrison Ford in “The Call of the Wild,” and who played one of Andy Serkis’s chimpanzee companions in the “Planet of the Apes” movies of the 2010s. “War for the Planet of the Apes,” the most recent one of those, completes the story of Caesar, the chimpanzee revolutionary played by Serkis. It hinges on a rivalry between Caesar and an angry human colonel played by Woody Harrelson. (Caesar spends much of the series proving that he has more humanity than the humans in it, who want to wipe out his species.) “The motion-captured, digitally sculpted apes are so natural, so expressive, so beautifully integrated into their environment, that you almost forget to be astonished by the nuances of thought and emotion that flicker across their faces, often seen in close-up,” A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The New York Times. THE LEGEND OF TARZAN (2016) 5:30 p.m. on TNT. More digital apes and human villains can be found in this Tarzan rethink, which casts Alexander Skarsgard as a version of that literary son of nature. Directed by David Yates, this take on the story is built loosely around history: It pairs Skarsgard’s Tarzan with a fictionalized version of the 19th-century American George Washington Williams (Samuel L. Jackson), who publicly denounced the violent colonialism led by King Leopold II of Belgium in Central Africa. The plot pits Tarzan and Williams against Leon Rom (Christoph Waltz), an oppressor in a white suit. IT’S PERSONAL WITH AMY HOGGART 10 p.m. on TBS and TruTV. The sometimes “Full Frontal With Samantha Bee” correspondent Amy Hoggart helps a New York executive develop her sense of humor in the first episode of this new comedy-documentary series, which chronicles Hoggart’s attempts to help people work through common issues. Highlights of the episode include a scene in which an expert breaks down the psychological effects of a goofy knock-knock joke. Its punchline revolves around Sean Connery. WEST SIDE STORY (1961) Stream on Starz platforms; rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. The Times’s dance critic, Gia Kourlas, wrote an article this week about how Jerome Robbins’s choreography is missed in the current production of “West Side Story” on Broadway. “What Robbins created wasn’t just a series of dances, however peerless,” she wrote, “but an overarching view of how, beyond anything else, movement could tell a story.” See some of that choreography in action in this classic film version of the musical, which followed Robbins’s original Broadway production. This isn’t purely Robbins’s vision, though: He was fired before the film was completed, and shares the directing credit with Robert Wise.",The New York Times
2020,Opinion | What’s the Word From Iowa? A Local Reporter Has the Inside Scoop,"A ground-level view of what has happened in the frenzied final days as voters gather to pick a winner. Mr. Leonard is the author of “Deep Midwest: Midwestern Explorations.” KNOXVILLE, Iowa — In the week before the Iowa caucuses, the state becomes a crazy place. Everyone wants to know what’s going on, so they ask people like me. I’m a small-town Iowa radio guy on the wrong side of 60 in suspenders, Carhartts and mud boots. Candidates are everywhere, and media fly in from all over the world to get our stories. For this brief window, every Iowan is an expert. We in the local media draw more attention from our colleagues in the national media because we are paid to pay attention. In the past week or so, I was booked and then bumped by “Hardball” on MSNBC more times than a petty thief in a county jail holding tank. CNN, too. I understand, it goes with the territory. Besides I don’t really like TV that much. I’m a radio guy. I look old, bald and grumpy on TV, and I’m not grumpy. Between candidate interviews, media events, my day job, news alerts rattling my phone, tweets falling like rain and relentless email, I try to make sense of what’s happening as we call a wrap on the 2020 Iowa caucuses. That’s what everyone wants to know. Me, too. I’m lucky to have had long, candid conversations with almost all the candidates — and I’ll especially miss those with Cory Booker, Beto O’Rourke and John Delaney (I do know that they aren’t going to win). But let’s see. Here’s what I worry about: The Ukraine scandal will hurt Joe Biden, and he won’t be able to go toe to toe with President Trump. Pete Buttigieg lacks support among African-Americans. That’s fatal for a Democrat. Bernie Sanders’s scorched-earth campaign in 2016 continues today and will hurt not only him but us all. Most of his supporters are good, well-meaning people, but the “Bernie Bros” are real, pernicious and legion. They carry their litmus tests everywhere they go and harass non-Sanders supporters in real life (and at the events of other candidates), on social media, in their phone calls and in texts. Elizabeth Warren peaked too soon, and Amy Klobuchar is peaking too late. Still, their organizations are strong, and northern Iowa just might surge for Ms. Klobuchar. Other thoughts: Having interviewed and spoken with both Ms. Klobuchar and Ms. Warren numerous times, one thing I’ve learned is to never underestimate them. They are smart, powerful policy wonks. Ms. Warren’s supporters in particular are loyal. Her selfie lines have become legend. At the Liberty and Justice event in Des Moines last fall, I watched as she worked through a line of more than 1,000 people (Mr. Sanders and Mr. Biden didn’t bother to hang around). Ms. Klobuchar is indeed the “girl next door,” and we trust her. Northern Iowa loves her, and her appeal has grown as she has toured our 99 counties. The first time I saw her, she impressed a small crowd in a brewery. The last time, everyone who wanted to see her couldn’t get in. I wish Senators Booker and Kamala Harris had stayed in the race longer because I believe both would have caucused well, and I admire them. Still, that the top tier of candidates in Iowa includes two women, a Jewish man, a gay man and a man of Asian descent is something we can be proud of. And the candidates’ staff members have impressed me — too many to name them all, but I must mention Matt Fidel. He’s from Pittsburgh, a former Booker staff member so beloved across numerous counties in Iowa that I’ve bestowed by the power invested in my suspenders the title of “honorary Iowan.” When the Tree of Life mass shooting in Pittsburgh happened in his community, at the synagogue attended by members of his family and friends, he was with us, and we mourned with him. In recent days, I just about lost track of my life. Take one example from dozens in the past week. I wandered into an event for Tom Steyer in Knoxville, Iowa, looking around for my wife, Annie, and Matt, a friend who’s a farmer. Annie was thinking about caucusing for Mr. Steyer, and Matt was introducing him. Two guys I had never seen before approached me like we were old drinking buddies. One was as big as a linebacker and laden like a pack mule with saddle bags and a big camera over his shoulder. The other looked like middle-aged villain in a James Bond movie — fit, head shaved bald, week-old whiskers, dressed in black. They introduced themselves as a TV crew from Belgium that I had agreed to meet. Huh? I agreed to meet a film crew from Belgium? I had no clue. No memory at all. Zip, zilch, nada. But I wasn’t surprised. Le Monde was here to speak with me Saturday, a Dutch film crew Monday, another Dutch crew Thursday, a Japanese crew at the Climate Parade in Des Moines on Saturday, and somewhere, sometime that I forget, another Japanese crew wanted to connect. I’ll miss the lessons young campaign staff members and embeds teach me. Sam Sergi, an ABC embed and an associate producer of the movie “After Parkland,” is a perfect example. At a Sanders rally in Des Moines that featured the Democratic superstar Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Sam and I went out together to speak with some Trump supporters. A man in his 60s, in a Green Bay Packers jacket, challenged her, pointing at her boots. “Why you wearing those boots — you a farmer?” She replied, “No … I’m not a farmer.” “Then why you wearin’ them?” “Because I like them. Why are you wearing that Green Bay Packer jacket — you play for the Packers?” He snorted, “No, I don’t play for the Packers …” She smiled, and said, “Then why are you wearing that jacket?” “Because I like it?” “See?” said Sam. He retreated and hid behind some older ladies. As we walked away, Sam, who’s from Kansas, said: “He doesn’t know anything about farming. These are Tony Llamas, and I’d never wear them in the field!” That’s another sport for locals in caucus season: I love watching staff members and the press from the big city who tiptoe across farm lots worrying about what they might step in. After stepping in manure, one young women clawed up my back like a cat, screaming a glorious stream of expletives. Another time a woman in capri pants and low shoes was walking very oddly across a field. I asked her what she was doing, and she said she “didn’t like grass touching my ankles.” One young guy spotted a farm dog, and yelled, “Dog!” as a toddler would, and then giggled and touched and petted it like he had only seen them in picture books before, never in real life. At the same farm, a nicely dressed young man asked me to inspect a smudge on his shirt. “What’s this?” he asked. “Dirt,” I replied. He scrunched up his face. “Dirt? Really? That’s dirt?” “Yup. Dirt.” Just a reminder of what awaits the winning Democratic nominee: Last week, I went to the Trump rally in Des Moines. It was brilliant, and he is an extraordinary showman. Over 7,000 people attended, and many more were turned away or watched from a large screen outside, on a 29-degree winter evening. With every gesture he welcomed the crowd into his open arms, applauded them, showed he was with them. Music blasted in a perfect rite of intensification; enemies were identified, trivialized and vanquished — Creepy Joe, Crazy Bernie, Pete BOOT-EDGE-EDGE and more. Mr. Trump wove truth, half-truths, hyperbole, exaggeration and lies seamlessly into a vast swirling reality that swept the audience along in an energizing experience as thrilling as an overtime win at the Super Bowl. And Trump supporters don’t care about impeachment, the lies, any of it — as one man told me in a concession line before the event, he doesn’t care what Trump does, legal or not, because he knows Trump has his back. Anyway, back to the Democrats. With the results of the caucuses, Iowans will offer to America who they believe best has their back. And then the state becomes flyover country once more. As I was leaving the Steyer event the other day, I said goodbye to Adam Brewster of CBS and Maura Barrett with NBC. “See you in four years,” I said. Adam thought for a moment, and then said, “If Iowa is first in the nation in four years!” I thought about it for a moment, and said, “If two old white guys with universal name recognition and high poll numbers before the caucus season even began come out on top in Iowa, maybe we don’t deserve to be first.” I shuffled off, not realizing I had said the quiet part out loud.

2020,What’s the World’s Worst Smell?,"Good Question Some odors are more heinous than others. Then there’s Stench Soup. What is the most universally disgusting smell to humans? — Lizzie in Austin, Texas Smells can be pretty subjective. In 1998, Pamela Dalton, a cognitive psychologist at the Monell Chemical Senses Center, was tasked with developing a stink bomb for the Department of Defense. Her experiments found that people from different backgrounds and different parts of the world, who grew up smelling and eating different things, often completely disagreed about which smells were good or bad. The best candidate Dr. Dalton found for a universally distasteful smell was something called “U.S. Government Standard Bathroom Malodor,” a substance that was designed to mimic the scent of military field latrines, in order to test cleaning products. She chose the aromatic liquid as the base of her stink-bomb recipe. The resulting formula, which she called “Stench Soup,” may well be the worst smell ever created. Mary Roach, a science writer, is one of the few humans who’s tried inhaling Stench Soup. In her 2016 book “Grunt: The Curious Science of Humans at War,” she described the aroma as “Satan on a throne of rotting onions.” Is Stench Soup really the worst smell in the world? That’s hard to say, in part because researching bad smells can be difficult. Chemists tell cautionary tales about a substance called thioacetone, which in 1889 was the subject of experiments in a lab in Freiberg, Germany. One thioacetone reaction produced a smell so bad that it spilled out of the lab and swept through the city, causing widespread panic and evacuation, along with a lot of people being sick in the streets. If there's a science mystery keeping you awake at night, send it to Good Question. Derek Lowe, an industrial chemist who’s written about thioacetone, said it was hard to know for sure what chemicals produced the smell in the 1889 incident. The thioacetone would have been converted into another chemical — he suspected one called gem-dimercaptan — which might have undergone further reactions to create yet more compounds. No one seems eager to repeat the experiments to figure out precisely what molecules are produced. “Pretty much all the compounds you could draw out of thioacetone are going to reek,” Dr. Lowe told me. But exactly how much it would reek is uncertain: “Not a lot of us have smelled a gem-dimercaptan. It could well be intense. I am not minded to find out.” The thioacetone story raises a question: How far can a bad smell spread? The odor from the lab in 1889 reached about half a mile in all directions before it dispersed. Could a smell be so potent that it spread all the way around the world, making the entire planet stink? The strength of aromas is measured by their “odor detection threshold,” which is the amount of the stuff you need to add to the air before average people can smell it. Gasoline has an odor detection threshold of about 100 micrograms per cubic meter. If a gallon of it evaporated into the air from a high place, it would produce enough vapor to make the air smell like gasoline for 600 feet in all directions. There are substances smellier than gasoline. Ethyl mercaptan, the stuff added to natural gas to make gas leaks easier to detect, has an odor detection threshold of just 1 or 2 micrograms per cubic meter. A few pools of ethyl mercaptan the size of the reservoir in the middle of Central Park could, if spread evenly throughout the atmosphere, make the entire planet smell like a gas leak. Methyl mercaptan, which is even smellier, might only take one reservoir to stink up the globe. But not all strong smells are bad. One of the substances with the lowest odor detection threshold is vanillin, the main component of vanilla extract. Estimates vary, but its odor detection threshold is probably around 0.1 or 0.2 micrograms per cubic meter, significantly lower than ethyl or methyl mercaptan. That means that one or two oil tankers full of vanillin could conceivably be used as an air freshener powerful enough to give the entire Earth a slight scent of vanilla. Dr. Lowe said that the worst thing he’d ever smelled in his career as a chemist arose when he inadvertently combined dimethyl sulfide (think farts) with some silicon he was putting through a reaction called a Peterson olefination. Neither odor would smell great on its own, but combined they produced something transcendently foul. “It smelled like what you’d imagine the exhaust of a U.F.O. to smell like,” he said. “It was spectacularly weird and horrible.” In the infinite universe of chemistry, who knows what smells are waiting to be discovered?",The New York Times
2020,D.N.C. Leader Now Calls for ‘Surgical’ Recanvass in Iowa,"Less than 10 hours after announcing that he was “calling on the Iowa Democratic Party to immediately begin a recanvass,” Tom Perez, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said he had actually been calling only for isolated recanvassing of areas where irregularities had been reported in the caucus results. In an interview with Rachel Maddow on MSNBC late Thursday, Mr. Perez pointed to “questions raised” about the tabulations in specific precincts, such as one in Black Hawk County where some state delegate equivalents were mistakenly awarded to Deval Patrick. “We have a shared interest in making sure we had accuracy, so what we did today is asking to make sure that if people need a recanvass in this precinct or that precinct, that it’s done,” he said. In response to a follow-up question from Ms. Maddow, he confirmed that he was not calling for a full, statewide recanvass. “Assuming no candidate files a request, it will be surgical, surgical,” Mr. Perez said. “Because we want to make sure if somebody raises a question, we have an opportunity to answer that question.”",The New York Times
2020,Opinion | When 80-Year-Old Parents Divorce,"I thought their bond was indestructible. Now I’m mourning people who are still alive. Dr. Hobbs is a professor at Stanford. After 60 years, my parents’ marriage is ending. The house where I grew up — our sanctuary for 40 years — is falling apart and will be sold soon. I won’t go back. I’ll remember my bright pink bedroom with curtains that my mom made from Benetton sheets. I’ll remember my dad putting up the volleyball net in the backyard, securing the swing set and carrying home kids who had taken hard falls on the Slip ’N Slide. I wonder if my parents’ marriage would have survived if my sister Sharon hadn’t died from breast cancer at 31 in 1998. When a child dies before a parent, such a loss “defies the expected order of life events,” leading many people to “experience the event as a challenge to basic existential assumptions,” a 2010 study by the National Institutes of Health explained. The study found that 18 years after the death of a child, bereaved parents “were more likely to have experienced a depressive episode and marital disruption” than other parents. After my sister’s death, there were an intolerable number of losses in our family — grandparents, aunts and uncles, cousins — but somehow, my parents pulled through. They seemed to grow even closer as our once large family became smaller and summer family reunions petered out. My sister died one year after my future husband and I graduated from college. Looking back, nine years after our divorce, I wonder, did we ever have a chance? Could a young relationship survive a tragedy like that? What 22-year-old is equipped to help when the pain is so searing and so deep? Flooded by my own sorrow and heartbreak, I found solace in my parents’ marriage: They were unbroken; their bond was indestructible. My parents told the same stories of growing up on the South Side of Chicago hundreds of times. They anticipated the punch lines of jokes that they already knew, sometimes bursting into laughter before the joke was complete. My mom would smile and slowly shake her head and my dad would chuckle fitfully as the words tumbled out. Long after I had fallen asleep, they would sit next to each other in recliners in front of the fireplace, drinking daiquiris and watching the latest family drama on HBO. They seemed to relish sharing the smallest and most mundane moments of life: running errands to the grocery store, the post office, the mall. On road trips to see relatives in Chicago or to our favorite summer vacation spot, my dad would entertain himself by singing along — with the most exaggerated intonations — to the hits of the Commodores, the O’Jays and the Platters. As my mom, my sisters and I drifted off to sleep, he’d croon: “They said someday you’ll find/All who love are blind/Oh-oh when your heart’s on fire/You must realize/Smoke gets in your eyes.” The spectacular collapse of my parents’ marriage has been too much for me. I am undone, untethered, dysfunctional. I am in a small boat, too fatigued to pick up an oar, lost at sea. The lighthouse that never failed to guide me home is now out of service. I knew separate holidays would be unbearable, so I planned a holiday party that I rationalized as our family’s Christmas. I did what I had watched my mother do for years: I hung garlands and big red bows on every doorway. I bought a flocked Christmas tree, just like the ones that my grandmother chose when my father was growing up. I lined the house with outdoor lights and hired a musician to lead the group in caroling. Could a California Christmas with yards of garland, a lively rendition of “Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer” and a signature Christmas cocktail substitute for our traditional New Jersey one? Of course not. I berate myself for such a naïve hope. I am mourning a family and people who are still alive. This is a different type of grief. Its lacerations came without warning. I didn’t have the time or the instinct to soften or parry the blow. I think of my friends whose parents divorced when they were children or teenagers. I am an adult. I don’t have to shuttle between two homes, I won’t have to endure remarriages, I don’t believe that I am at fault. I should be able to stanch the wound, but I can’t. I’m bleeding out. Staggered by this nightmarish new reality, I am grasping for explanations for why my parents can no longer live together. Perhaps the accumulated years of grief after my sister’s death have finally become too much and this separation is the “marital disruption” that the N.I.H. study predicted. Or, perhaps in their mid-80s — after all of the joys, the stories, the sorrows, after all of the life that they have lived together — my parents find this final act too frightening and too disorienting. Is it possible that it might be easier to live without each other by choice, to break that once indestructible bond now, rather than to wait until it is broken cruelly, against their will? A few years ago, my mom began to have impossible expectations of my father. “Stop walking like an old man,” she scolded him. “I am an old man,” he replied with a laugh. But my mother wasn’t joking. Her endless patience was wearing thin, her natural gentleness was hardening, and she seemed uncharacteristically annoyed. The man whom my mom had loved since she was a teenager was now slower, unsteady and aging. My dad, for his part, winced when my mom couldn’t remember a name or asked the same question twice. I’ve been perseverating over my parents’ mortality for years. It must be terrifying for them. I cling to my sister and childhood friends who remember the past. They cry as if these were their own parents. I tell new friends, “I wish you could have known my parents before.” Look at these pictures — look at their high school prom picture — maybe you can understand. Listen to these stories, maybe you can imagine. Maybe you can picture a beautiful and perfect love that lasted 60 years. When my mother left our house in New Jersey, my father made two playlists for her with their favorite songs. Many of the songs are from the road trip playlists. Once in a while, I hear her playing those songs and I wonder what she is thinking. If I close my eyes, I am back in the car, and my head is resting on one of my sisters’ shoulders. The car is cozy and my dad is singing again. This time, he is doing his best imitation of Sam Cooke: “It’s been too hard living, oh my/And I’m afraid to die/’Cause I don’t know what’s up there/Beyond the sky/It’s been a long, a long time coming/But I know a change is gonna come/Oh yes, it will.” The marriage is over now. Another family will live in our house. Just because it is gone doesn’t mean that it never was.

2020,"When All the World’s at War, Only Theater Feels Real","Fiction When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. TYLLBy Daniel KehlmannTranslated by Ross Benjamin Tyll Ulenspiegel first appeared as an impish swindler and tightrope walker at the end of the Middle Ages, became a Protestant hero in the 19th century and lent his name to magazines, films, operas and the first American B.D.S.M. organization in the 20th. In Daniel Kehlmann’s “Tyll,” published in German in 2017 and now appearing in an impeccable English translation by Ross Benjamin, the gaunt trickster navigates the havoc of the Thirty Years’ War, the 17th-century conflict that left Central Europe in ruins. Profoundly enchanting but never sentimental, “Tyll” is a magnificent story of an artist’s transcendence over the petty superstitions, convenient betrayals and widespread brutality of his time. The son of a miller with a dangerous interest in occult magic, Tyll learns to survive early. His is a world in which human life counts for little: “A blade of grass snaps, a bug is stepped on, a flame goes out, a person dies — it’s nothing!” When his father is tortured and executed by Inquisitors looking to make their quota of burned heretics, Tyll leaves his hometown and becomes a traveling entertainer. With his friend Nele and an ever-changing crew of poets and acrobats, he enjoys the freedom of people who belong to no place. “They have no protection,” it is true, but they also “don’t have to string anyone up.” Tyll’s picaresque tale ranges widely over Europe, but Kehlmann juggles his stories with the dexterity of Ulenspiegel himself. He brings us to the stinking, plague-ridden military camp where the “Winter King” Friedrich of Prague, whose ill-advised assumption of the Bohemian throne set off the war, has come to beg for help from a Swedish king with crumbs in his beard. He takes us on a hunt for invisible dragons with the Jesuit polymath Athanasius Kircher and to a performance of “The Tempest” starring an aging William Shakespeare who forgets his lines. Even more gripping are scenes with no wink toward the history books. A pregnant woman’s desperate nighttime walk through a haunted forest feels breath-stoppingly real. In a collapsed shaft under the Siege of Brno, miners sing a ballad to the Reaper, the voices of the dead and the barely living mingling into one. Kehlmann is a master of economical, devastating description. During the calamitous Battle of Zusmarshausen, one man is suddenly “lying in two places: one part to the right of his horse, the other to the left, and the one on the right was still moving.” Equally chilling are his descriptions of a society in which old kindnesses are forgotten under pressure, where truth matters less than the ability to terrify people into confession, where lies scribbled in Latin become history. In such a world, only acting feels honest, only magic feels real: “It was not the theater that was false, no, everything else was pretense, disguise and frippery, everything that was not theater was false.” Art need not be brilliant to be vital. “Tyll” revels in the efforts of second-rate artists doing their best with small talent: a bard whose “poor singing would not be so bad if he could at least play the lute,” a monotonous old woman who can remember long stories without forgetting a line, a count who fills out his memoir with descriptions from other books. Through them, Kehlmann irreverently imagines the birth of modern German literature, as a series of would-be poets struggle to draw beauty out of “a language that sounded like someone struggling not to choke, like a cow having a coughing fit, like a man with beer coming out his nose.” Tyll Ulenspiegel is the genius among them. A juggler, ventriloquist and court fool, he is above all a figure of lightness. When villagers watch him leap on a rope above them, they feel, for a breath, “as if a human body had no weight and life were not sad and hard.” In this exquisitely crafted novel, Kehlmann moves just as nimbly through the grimmest of human experiences. The result is a spellbinding memorial to the nameless souls lost in Europe’s vicious past, whose whispers are best heard in fables. “All this is true,” says one of Kehlmann’s storytellers, “even what has been made up is true.”",The New York Times
2020,"When America’s Oddest Political Couple Fight, Those Sparks Are Real","The public struggles of White House adviser Kellyanne Conway and her husband, George T. Conway III, are not shtick, friends say, and they are not having fun. WASHINGTON — George T. Conway III has described the work of his wife, Kellyanne Conway, for President Trump in terms usually reserved for hostage situations: brainwashed by a cult, suffering from Stockholm syndrome, an overwhelmed mother protecting a destructive man-child. And if you think it’s all shtick, some wink-and-nod act by a couple who fights by day and snuggles by night, planning a payday after Mr. Trump leaves the scene, think again, say some people close to America’s oddest political couple. “Those who think this is a 14-dimensional chess game are mistaken,” said Rick Wilson, who with Mr. Conway and several other Republicans formed the Lincoln Project, an effort to beat Mr. Trump in the 2020 election. Mr. Conway “has taken unequivocal and irreversible actions that have established his bona fides as someone who opposes Donald Trump, and she’s going to be for Donald Trump until the last dog dies,” he said, adding a question that many Americans have asked themselves about the Conways: “Who knows the secrets of the human heart?” In a sense, the passions in the Conway household have come to represent the societal agonies of the Trump era, a couple and a nation deeply divided, unsettled by the storms around the presidency, and asking themselves, when it’s all over, can there be reconciliation? The Conways bring to mind a previous Washington “It” couple: Mary Matalin, who worked for President George Bush, and James Carville, the Democratic strategist who helped engineer President Bill Clinton’s 1992 victory over Mr. Bush. Ms. Matalin and Mr. Carville turned their political dissonance into a lucrative brand, joking about their vast differences. The Conways agree politically on most things because Mr. Conway, for all his anti-Trump activities, remains deeply conservative. But the couple does not appear to be having much fun. “Coming of political age in 1992 is significantly different than coming of age in 2017,” Mr. Carville said. “Trump people have much more of a sense of personal assault or grievance, and the Trump opponents have a high, high dose of doing the right thing for the country. You can hardly even tell jokes about it anymore.” Ms. Conway, 53, Mr. Trump’s senior counselor and 2016 campaign manager, has largely held her tongue about her husband, though she told The Washington Post in 2018 that his sniping “disrespects his wife.” In recent months, Mr. Conway, 56, a constitutional lawyer by trade and Trump opponent by conversion, has become more embittered, and more public. During the presidential impeachment, he took to CNN and Twitter as a commentator, calling Mr. Trump a “criminal,” “pathological liar” and “Idiot-in-Chief.” To mark Mr. Trump’s acquittal by the Senate, Mr. Conway wrote a sarcastic, bitter column, concluding, “I believe the president’s call was perfect. I believe he is deeply concerned about corruption in Ukraine.” Mr. Conway live-tweeted his derision as the president celebrated last week in the East Room of the White House. “Let it out, @realDonaldTrump. Let it all out,” he mocked. For someone who labored in Republican legal vineyards for decades — in the 1990s, he was a lawyer for Paula Jones, who accused Mr. Clinton of sexual misconduct — Mr. Conway did not cut much of a swath in Washington social circles. He rode his wife’s coattails into the nation’s capital. But of late, he has surpassed her on Washington’s party circuit. “She was the superstar for two and a half years, and now George is the superstar,” said Sally Quinn, a journalist, author and Washington hostess who has been inviting Mr. Conway, but not Ms. Conway, to her parties in Georgetown. The Conways met in the summer of 1999, when Mr. Conway was a securities lawyer and partner at the New York firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz and Ms. Conway was a Republican pollster who appeared frequently on television. Mr. Conway told a mutual friend, the conservative commentator Ann Coulter, that he wanted to meet Ms. Conway, known then by her maiden name, Kellyanne Fitzpatrick. The future Ms. Conway drove out to a Hamptons beach house, rented by Ms. Coulter, and the couple remained planted at the house’s kitchen table, chatting for hours. They married in 2001 and moved into a Trump tower in Manhattan. Mr. Conway impressed the future president by taking his side in a condo board battle over removing the name “Trump” from the building, and he introduced Ms. Conway to Mr. Trump. Politics was less bruising then. In 2005, Ms. Conway teamed up with Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster, to write a book about how American women were erasing political lines. By reputation, Ms. Conway was smart and empathetic, the type who remembered birthdays and weddings. The Conways now have four children: the twins, George IV and Claudia, 15; Charlotte, 11; and Vanessa, 10; and a pair of Corgis, Skipper and Bonnie, which Mr. Conway nicknamed Concerned and Troubled after the terms that Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, has used to describe her reaction to Mr. Trump’s behavior. Friends say the Conways are staying together for their children, although the couple is not always in the same city. Mr. Conway spent chunks of time last year in New York before leaving his firm, while Ms. Conway remained in Washington, where the Trump crowd has largely blackballed her husband. In November, Mr. Conway attended a “Resistance” party at the New York apartment of Molly Jong-Fast, an author and daughter of Erica Jong. The comedian Kathy Griffin posted a photograph on Instagram of Mr. Conway hiding coyly behind the liberal journalist Soledad O’Brien. Nearby were E. Jean Carroll, a writer who has accused Mr. Trump of rape, and the Hillary Clinton stalwart Philippe Reines. In Washington, Mr. Conway tends to hole up in his home office, writing opinion pieces and firing away on Twitter. In a July piece titled “Trump Is a Racist President,” he wrote about the first time he heard someone tell his mother, who emigrated from the Philippines, “‘Go back to your country.’” The gulf between the Conways developed slowly before turning into a chasm. After Mr. Trump’s victory, the Conways jumped into Washington with both feet, buying a 15,000-square foot house with eight bedrooms and 11 bathrooms. “Kellyanne Conway Just Bought This $8 Million D.C. Mansion,” blared Town & Country magazine, though Mr. Conway’s legal partnership accounts for most of the couple’s net worth of about $40 million. Mr. Conway wept for joy on election night and called his wife’s achievement “the best thing that ever happened to her.” He turned down two potential posts in the Justice Department, calling the administration “a dumpster fire,” though he told the president at the time that he supported him. In those days, Ms. Conway went out alone, or with Adrienne Arsht, a philanthropist and arts patron with homes in Miami and across the street from the Conways. Ms. Arsht, who calls Ms. Conway “a lovely neighbor, a great mother” and “a fabulous cook,” played down their relationship. “Our garages face each other, so why not go out together to save on emissions?” she asked. Early on, Mr. Conway tweeted his disapproval of the president’s tweets about the travel ban, then hastened to tweet his support for the president and “my wonderful wife.” In February 2019, at a British Embassy party for female members of Congress, Ms. Conway approached Ms. Quinn, the New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd and the NBC News journalist Andrea Mitchell. “It was like, ‘Oh, I love your shoes and what a great bag, blah blah,’” Ms. Quinn recalled, until she asked Ms. Conway about her husband, and Ms. Conway, she said, grew angry that Ms. Quinn had even brought him up. “She just took off on all three of us,’’ Ms. Quinn said. “She really went crazy.” “I said, ‘Kellyanne, you’re married, and you’re working for the president, and he’s writing against the president,’” Ms. Quinn recalled. “‘Guess what? This is a story.’” The next month, the Conway marriage appeared to have become an issue in the White House. Mr. Trump had spent the weekend of March 16 retweeting conspiracy theorists and insulting Senator John McCain when Mr. Conway tweeted, “His condition is getting worse.” The next day, Brad Parscale, who now manages Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign, tweeted that Mr. Conway “hurts his wife because he is jealous of her success.” The president piled on, “A total loser!” Mr. Conway then gave an interview to The Washington Post, saying that he tweets “so I can get it off my chest and move on with my life that day.” He added, referring to his wife, “Frankly, it’s so I don’t end up screaming at her.” Mr. Trump clapped back: “George Conway, often referred to as Mr. Kellyanne Conway by those who know him, is VERY jealous of his wife’s success & angry that I, with her help, didn’t give him the job he so desperately wanted. I barely know him but just take a look, a stone cold LOSER & husband from hell!” It fell to Ms. Conway to spin Mr. Trump’s attacks on her spouse. “He left it alone for months out of respect for me,” Ms. Conway said of the president in an interview with Politico. “But you think he shouldn’t respond when somebody, a nonmedical professional, accuses him of having a mental disorder?” Mr. Conway has not let up. In October, he used clinical terms in The Atlantic to say Mr. Trump’s narcissism made him unfit for office. At Ms. Quinn’s home recently, Mr. Conway and William F. Weld, the former Massachusetts governor and Mr. Trump’s long-shot 2020 primary challenger, embraced like lost brothers, then posed for a photo with the former Democratic presidential candidate and self-help author Marianne Williamson. Mr. Conway “was one of the last to leave,” Ms. Quinn recalled. “He was just glowing, you know?” Kitty Bennett contributed research. Updated Feb. 29, 2020",The New York Times
2020,When Do You Become an Adult?,"student opinion What are the responsibilities and privileges that you associate with being an adult? Find all our Student Opinion questions here. Do you think there is a certain age when someone becomes an adult? How can you know what that age is? What are the privileges associated with adulthood in your state or country? What are the responsibilities? What about within your family? Are you expected to do certain “adult” things by a certain age? In “When Are You Really an Adult?,” Maria Cramer writes about a Vermont senator, John Rodgers, who proposed a bill to outlaw cellphone use by anyone under 21 to make a point about a Vermont law that banned the sale of firearms to most people under that same age: “There are all these pushes around some parts of the country for 16-year-olds to vote but we’re saying they’re not mature enough to smoke or purchase a gun. So which is it?” said Mr. Rodgers. “When are you really an adult?” It is a question that has possessed both poets and lawmakers. But there is not much clarity in state laws. In Alaska, teenagers as young as 14 can get married with a court order. Only a handful of states allow drinking under 21 and that is under strict circumstances, like when a parent or legal guardian is present. Eighteen-year-old adults can run for office, go to strip clubs, be sentenced to life in prison, and volunteer to go to war or be drafted, but as of last December, they cannot vape or smoke tobacco products. And since 1984, when states began raising the legal age of drinking to 21 from 18 in exchange for federal highway funds — in some cases barely a decade after lowering it — they have not been able to buy a beer at a bar in most of the United States, a restriction that has infuriated college students ever since. “If 18-year-olds are burdened with the responsibility of adulthood, they should be afforded some of its privileges,” said Charlotte Lawson, a 21-year-old fourth-year student at the University of Virginia who wrote an opinion piece in the campus paper in 2018 calling for the drinking age to be lowered from 21. “It’s interesting these are people who work full-time jobs, pay their own rent, pay taxes and are eligible to vote,” she said. “Yet none of this constitutes adequate proof that a person is responsible enough to drink.” The article looks at the history of the changing drinking age throughout the 20th century: After the end of Prohibition in 1933, most states set the drinking age at 21, which was also the minimum voting age at the time. Lawmakers reasoned that if you were old enough to vote, you were old enough to drink, Mr. Parent said. That philosophy continued in 1971, when Congress lowered the voting age to 18 in response to fury over the draft during the Vietnam War, which conscripted thousands of men between 18 and 21 into war. States, in turn, lowered the drinking age to 18, Mr. Parent said. But in 1984, President Ronald Reagan began pushing hard for states to raise their drinking age, citing what he called a “great national problem” of drinking and driving by teenagers. In July of that year, Congress passed the National Minimum Drinking Age Act, which required states to raise the age of drinking to 21 or risk a 10 percent cut in their federal highway funds. Scientists are also trying to answer this question by looking at brain development: The scientific consensus that most brains do not fully develop until age 25 has led to a host of reforms in the criminal justice system and reexaminations about how society should punish young adults. But it has also fed the confusion over what young adults should be allowed to do when scientists know that they use less restraint and discipline than older people, said Warren Binford, a law professor at Willamette University and founder of the school’s Child and Family Advocacy Clinic. “We’re constantly trying to balance the rights to protection and the rights to participation,” said Ms. Binford. “We are a society that loves its liberty, but we’re also a society that recognizes that children are unique and special and deserving of protection.” Students, read the entire article, then tell us: Do you feel that you are an adult now? Why or why not? How will you know when you have reached adulthood? Do you think adulthood is connected to being a certain age or having specific responsibilities? Are there legal rights, like voting or drinking, that you think will help you demonstrate your own transition into adulthood? What do you think should be the legal minimum age for doing the following “adult” activities: getting married, voting, enlisting in the military, buying alcohol, buying cigarettes, owning a firearm, being tried as an adult in court? Do you think minimum age requirements are necessary to protect young people from adult risks and responsibilities? Who do you think should be responsible for setting these age requirements? What do you think should inform or determine those decisions? Should it be brain development, educational achievements, maturity or something else? Benming Zhang, who was elected to the City Council in Williamsburg, Va., during his final undergraduate year in college, said he faced the most skepticism about his campaign from his peers. Why do you think that was? Would you trust one of your peers if he or she was running for a political office now? How about in five years? Do you think there are certain experiences or qualifications that someone needs to be in a role of political leadership? How do you feel about the voting age in the United States? Do you think that you, or your peers, would be more active politically if you were able to vote? How do you think the voting age should be determined? Students 13 and older are invited to comment.

2020,When Are the Oscars? What Time? We Have Answers!,"Here’s everything you need to know so you can sound like you were paying attention all along. The 92nd Academy Awards take place Sunday. If you’ve been too busy to pay attention to the race (and who hasn’t?), here’s a primer to get you up to speed for Hollywood’s big night. When are the Oscars? Sunday, starting at 8 p.m. Eastern, 5 p.m. Pacific. Where can I watch? ABC is broadcasting the ceremony in the United States. It will be livestreamed on abc.com or via the ABC app, providing you signed up with a participating TV provider (like a cable company). Depending on where you live and your equipment, there’s also Hulu + Live TV, Sling TV, AT&T TV Now or YouTube TV, which all require subscriptions. Will there be a host? Nope. The lack of an M.C. seemed to work out well enough last year: ratings were up 12 percent over the previous ceremony (though the numbers still weren’t great). Who’s nominated? You can check out our complete ballot, but there are a couple of headlines to know: “Joker” topped all other films with 11 nominations, while “1917,” “The Irishman” and “Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood” each drew 10. Women were completely omitted from the best director race. And the acting slate was almost completely white, with the exception of the best-actress nominee Cynthia Erivo (“Harriet”). Who will win? We’d love to know, too. Our awards-season expert, Kyle Buchanan, has made his Oscar predictions, and the short answer is that the World War I drama “1917” is well-positioned. Then again the South Korean thriller “Parasite” could pose strong competition. Buchanan also expects the quartet of Joaquin Phoenix (“Joker”), Renée Zellweger (“Judy”), Brad Pitt (“Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood”) and Laura Dern (“Marriage Story”) to take home acting trophies, as they have all season long. Who will be presenting? The academy has announced a long list of household names, including Will Ferrell, Gal Gadot, Salma Hayek, Mindy Kaling, Spike Lee, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Keanu Reeves, Maya Rudolph and Timothée Chalamet. What else should I expect? There will probably be remembrances of Kirk Douglas, who died on Wednesday, and Kobe Bryant, the basketball star who won an Oscar for a short film made after he retired. And there will reportedly be a “special performance” by Janelle Monáe with Elton John and Randy Newman. What about the red carpet? You have some options. E! will begin its red carpet coverage with a countdown show at 1 p.m. Eastern, 10 a.m. Pacific, seguing to live coverage at 5 p.m. Eastern, 2 p.m. Pacific. And there’s an official academy preshow from the red carpet that starts at 6:30 p.m. Eastern, 3:30 p.m. Pacific. It will be broadcast on ABC. Now you’re all caught up!",The New York Times
2020,Opinion | When Black Girls Hear That ‘Our Bodies Are All Wrong’,"Opinion Insidious messages can contribute to eating disorders for women of color. With the deluge of imagery that associates beauty with whiteness, girls of color are primed not only to developing eating disorders, but also to see these disorders go untreated.Credit...Hassan Jarane/Photolibrary, via Getty Images Plus Ms. Kendall is the author of “Hood Feminism” When I was in high school, I had an eating disorder, and nobody noticed. Sure, I’d always been skinny, so perhaps my weight loss was undetectable at first. Occasionally some shrewd person would pile more food on my plate after taking note of how little I’d served myself. But I could mostly avoid scrutiny by talking about having just had a big lunch or needing to save room for dessert. Sometimes I did go back for seconds. People really don’t notice when you eat more fruit than anything else; they don’t see that you’re strategically piling on the low-calorie foods that will quickly fill up a plate. If anyone did take note, it would have been easy for them to see my habits as “healthy.” Americans live in a culture in which the line between “clean eating” or “detoxing,” and a disordered relationship with food is blurry. At least when it comes to people whose body sizes conform to what we expect. This partly explains why I got away with living with this illness in plain sight. But moreover: I was black. The societal narratives that position the curviness of black girls’ bodies as a warning sign of future obesity mean that as young women, we’re often congratulated for watching our weight when our food restriction might actually be the symptom of a real mental health problem. That’s why the lingering cultural myth that eating disorders are the province of white women isn’t just misleading: It also keeps us from addressing the uniquely insidious factors that can cause black women to hate their bodies. For women who are developing bodies that will most likely never assimilate into the mythical monochrome of Middle America, there’s very little validation available in the media or anywhere else. Add the deluge of imagery that associates beauty with whiteness, and girls of color are primed not only to developing eating disorders, but also to see these disorders go untreated. Although conventional wisdom says most eating disorders develop at the onset of puberty, for black girls I think the seeds are actually laid much earlier. By the time I was 8 years old, I remember noticing that television shows rarely included girls that looked like me — and if they did, they were never the ones who were heroes or love interests. Those roles were largely reserved for white girls. Even the black actresses who were depicted as happy, successful and loved tended to be lighter-skinned with straighter hair and narrow noses — something that’s still largely true today. Like many other black girls, I learned early that when it comes to white-centric, unreasonable standards of beauty, I didn’t measure up. To be sure, every community has its own standards — and within the black community, we can find some affirmation of our beauty. As a teen, I remember seeing myself in Diahann Carroll as Dominique Devereaux on “Dynasty,"" the girls on “The Cosby Show,” and the cast of “Waiting to Exhale.” And yes, a handful of black women have always seen their appearances affirmed by popular culture. But these messages are harder to hear over the roar of the mainstream. Then there are the commercials on TV, the ads on Facebook, the Instagram influencers, all pushing a never-ending stream of meal plans and diets and trendy new lifestyles. While it’s true that there’s more diversity in media and advertising now than ever before, the people in the images meant to represent ideal bodies and sell us on becoming our best selves are still overwhelmingly slim and white (not to mention, abled and cisgender). When you are constantly bombarded with messages that tell you again and again that your body is simply wrong, it can make you desperate to control and change it. Thankfully, there is a growing awareness that anyone, of any background, can have an eating disorder. But even professional organizations related to the treatment of these illnesses can fall short when it comes to contemplating the specific issues black women face. Primary texts still in use largely ignore the impact of racial identity on relationships with food. “The Eating Disorder Sourcebook: A Comprehensive Guide to the Causes, Treatments, and Prevention of Eating Disorders” by Carolyn Costin addresses issues of ethnicity and gender in just 10 of its pages. “Eating Disorders: A Reference Sourcebook” by Raymond Lemberg and Leigh Cohn does mention race, but only to assert that black women have more favorable body images than other women. On top of this, the mixed messages about race and beauty are deeply disorienting. We live in a country that loves the trappings of black culture on white bodies but not on the bodies of those who created these looks. When the singer Ciara’s faux locs are criticized, but the same hairstyle is received as edgy and inventive when one of the Kardashians sports it, what message is being sent to young girls of color? Similarly, fatphobia is an issue for everyone, but race impacts who is most likely to be supported by the general public when rightly challenging it. Black women notice when the white main character in the Hulu series “Shrill” is celebrated as an icon of body positivity, while every appearance by the artist Lizzo is accompanied by relentless attacks that focus on her size and shape. These issues aren’t just emotional. Being seen as attractive has well-documented professional and personal benefits. And while complexion can’t change, weight can — at least temporarily. Obsessive dieting isn’t just about being considered more attractive; for many, it could feel like the key to having access to quality housing, fair treatment by the legal system or simple respect in day-to-day interactions. As a high school student surviving on salad, I couldn’t have articulated any of this, but I definitely absorbed these messages. It’s no wonder I wanted to shrink my body. If it couldn’t be right in the other ways, maybe making it as small as possible was a way for it to be accepted. Not my best logic, but at the time it made a peculiar sense to me. Our eating disorders can be one reaction to the messages we’ve received our whole lives: that our bodies are all wrong. When you’re surrounded by constant reminders that the way you look is unwelcome, it’s natural to develop anxiety about your body and to fixate on changing it. It’s easy to understand why any black woman might think — as I once did — that the problem could be solved by disappearing.

2020,When Calling the Front Desk Is Not an Option,"Travel Tips There are certainly nice benefits to staying in an Airbnb. But if an emergency happens, you might be on your own. Choosing an Airbnb over a brand-name hotel can save you a few bucks. It can also allow you to be in the thick of a neighborhood while experiencing a more homey vacation. But an important trade-off of staying within the booming home-sharing industry is that you usually don’t have a front desk or concierge — and in the case of an emergency, you are probably on your own. That means extra planning might be needed to help reduce stress and let you best enjoy your time away, especially traveling overseas. Over the past few years, my wife and I have stayed at Airbnb apartments in Paris, Amsterdam, Lisbon and several other cities. While there are a lot of ideas online on how to stay safe, including suggestions from Airbnb, here are some tips we learned along the way about how to prepare for the worst, when calling the front desk is not an option. This one might seem quite obvious, but do your due diligence and really get to know the place where you’ll be staying. It is usually best to find Airbnbs with many positive reviews and a very high positive rating. Read those reviews closely and look for red flags. Don’t just read one or two reviews — read 20 or more. Any hint of trouble is worth taking very seriously as you make a decision. In hotels, I had grown accustomed to a fairly standard amenity: a small safe for important documents. Safes are not widely installed in Airbnbs. In fact, I never could find one in a listing until our recent rental in Lisbon — a deciding factor among several strong listings. Upon arrival, I made sure our host showed us the safe and how it worked. I appreciated being able to lock away our passports, a second credit card and local currency, and not thinking about it much until it was time to depart. I even threw a towel over the safe so it wouldn’t be an obvious target in a break-in. You can buy a small portable safe, one that fits in your carry-on. I’ve lugged around one that attaches to a pole or a pipe, and locks with a key or code. I usually find a discrete spot to stash it after I arrive. If you stay in enough home shares, you’ll soon learn that there are all sorts of doors with different locking mechanisms. Take an extra minute when you arrive to have your host clarify how things work so that you don’t lock yourself in or out, or invite in unwanted guests. On a visit to Paris, it wasn’t until a few days into our visit that we learned that we should have been locking a second security door. There was also a slightly confusing maneuver we didn’t know about when leaving that could have effectively locked us in the apartment at the end of our trip. Without the help of a hotel staff, if a health emergency arises, you’ll be on your own. That makes it especially important to know how to get health care in a hurry. A friend of mine learned that lesson when his young son closed his finger in a door at an Airbnb in Barcelona. Luckily, they made it to a hospital quickly, but it was a good reminder that it’s important to be prepared for a health issue. Along those lines, be sure there’s a first aid kit — and you know where to find it.

2020,"When Democrats Vote, Trump Is Never Far Away","First Iowa, then New Hampshire. Now the president is on a Western trip, and basing it in Las Vegas, days before the Nevada caucuses. LAS VEGAS — President Trump is not exactly a fan of life on the road. He agreed to a four-day Western trip this week on the condition that he spend every night at the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas. And that location had another attraction: It placed him at the current center of the 2020 presidential race — Nevada, where Democrats will vote Saturday in caucuses that could reshape the campaign. The trip was meant to showcase the president’s aggressive re-election push to drum up funds from high-dollar donors in California, a Democratic state where Mr. Trump is widely unpopular but enjoys some concentrated pockets of support. But the president believes that wherever he goes, he can force the news cycles — and political fortunes — to turn in his favor. And the first opportunity to do that was Wednesday night, at the same time the Democrats debated in Las Vegas. “Should I go to that debate?” Mr. Trump asked a group of volunteers gathered at his hotel before he left for a high-dollar fund-raiser in Palm Springs, Calif. The president then set off on a hectic schedule that had him hopscotching around California and touching down in Phoenix for a “Keep America Great” rally before returning to Las Vegas for the night. And he will hold two other rallies before returning to Washington — on Thursday in Colorado Springs and on Friday in Las Vegas. Both in private and in public, it was clear that Mr. Trump did not want to cede any political spotlight to Democrats on the debate stage. “We’ve seen the polls except some of the fake ones,” Mr. Trump said in Phoenix. “If I was treated fairly, we’d be up 20 points higher in the polls. There wouldn’t even be a competitive election. Unfortunately, I think it’s probably going to be competitive.” Journalists were not invited to the president’s campaign breakfast at his hotel, but a New York Times reporter was dining in the restaurant as a guest. There, Mr. Trump took aim at CNN and MSNBC for reporting on the polls, but saved his special contempt for Comcast, which owns NBC Universal. He called the media conglomerate “corrupt” and a “disgrace to this country.” Mr. Trump was reacting to several recently released polls, including one by NBC and The Wall Street Journal, that show him trailing several possible Democratic opponents, including Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. “Internal REAL polls show I am beating all of the Dem candidates,” Mr. Trump tweeted shortly before leaving for Rancho Mirage, Calif., near Palm Springs, for a private fund-raiser. “The Fake News Polls (here we go again, just like 2016) show losing or tied.” One Democrat in particular has held the president’s attention: Michael R. Bloomberg. For weeks, Mr. Trump has been preoccupied with Mr. Bloomberg, a former New York City mayor and late entry to the Democratic presidential race. “Is corrupt Bloomberg News going to say what a pathetic debater Mini Mike is,” Mr. Trump tweeted on Wednesday morning, using a nickname to insult Mr. Bloomberg, a billionaire who has recently enjoyed a surge of popularity but who was untested on the debate stage. At his rally, the president again assailed polling in the news media and expressed criticism that Mr. Bloomberg had bought his way into the Democratic race, appearing to fixate on the amount of money the former mayor had spent on his campaign. “My father would teach me: If you could spend less and win, that’s better than spending a lot and winning,” he told the crowd. Mr. Trump’s setting up base in Nevada this week was not the first time he suddenly appeared in the middle of the Democratic Party’s nominating process. Last month, he held a rally in Des Moines, four days before the Iowa caucuses. Eleven days later, the president traveled to Manchester, N.H., the evening before the state held its primary election on Feb. 11, though in that case he was on the Republican ballot. “If you want clear proof of how terrified Donald Trump is, just look at his travel schedule,” Tom Perez, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said on Wednesday. “He keeps following Democrats from state to state because he knows our message is resonating. Nevada is no exception. Nevadans have rejected this president and his policies, and they’re ready to elect a Democrat to the White House.” In Nevada, it seemed that voters were attuned to Mr. Trump’s attempts to wrest attention back to his own campaign. “It’s really disruptive, and in a way it goes hand in hand with his presidency,” Hillary Steinberg, 56, said at a restaurant in the Las Vegas Arts District. “His entire presidency has been a disruption, so it makes sense that he would do a rally so close to the primary.” Rick Van Diepen, an owner of a sustainable architecture consultancy in Las Vegas, said that it was a “pretty typical distraction,” but an effective one. “It’s a good tactic to keep his base energized, especially in a state that doesn’t have a Republican primary,” said Mr. Van Diepen, 49. “It’s reminding them that he’s here, too.” But at his rally, Mr. Trump tried to pre-emptively cast doubt on the Nevada electoral process, using the caucus chaos in Iowa as an example. (Technical glitches, among other problems, caused a major delay in reporting the results from the state’s first-in-the-national presidential contest.) “In Nevada I’m hearing bad things about the vote count — they don’t know what the hell they’re doing,” the president said before quickly adding he hoped that was not the case. Aside from the attention-grabbing spectacle of long lines, ample media coverage and cars festooned with Trump-Pence signs driving by candidates’ events, Mr. Trump’s travels through four states on his Western swing have created a logistical nightmare for some Democratic candidates. At least one campaign complained that Mr. Trump’s trip to Las Vegas hampered its Thursday plans, with the flight restrictions that accompany an Air Force One arrival and departure complicating its attempts for travel to more than one other state from now until Saturday. But Justin Buoen, Senator Amy Klobuchar’s campaign manager, saw only an upside to the president’s presence. “I haven’t gotten any sense that people care about him being here except for that it fires our base up,” he said. “I don’t think it’s hurt coverage of the candidates on cable news networks or even local TV. It hasn’t been any kind of distraction.” Though she rarely even makes mention of the president’s current travels, Ms. Klobuchar, of Minnesota, does have a favorite laugh line in her stump speech regarding Mr. Trump’s last-minute rallies before the Louisiana and Kentucky governors’ elections last year. “The night before the election in both those states, who went down there to campaign for those Democratic governors as opponents? Donald Trump,” Ms. Klobuchar has said. “So my first question is, where can we send him next? Because that went pretty well.” The Democratic candidates won in both cases.

2020,When Did Bloomberg Turn Against Stop-and-Frisk? When He Ran for President.,"Mr. Bloomberg has begun to imply that he turned against the practice much sooner than he did. In reality, he defended it for years, including the month before he entered the presidential race. Days before he announced his presidential campaign in November, Michael R. Bloomberg, the mayor of New York City from 2002 through 2013, renounced one of his signature policies: stop-and-frisk, in which police officers stopped and searched millions of New Yorkers, the vast majority of whom were black or Hispanic and had not committed a crime. But as his campaign has grown — he qualified on Tuesday for this week’s Democratic debate — and stop-and-frisk has become a major piece of ammunition for his opponents, Mr. Bloomberg has begun to imply that he turned against the policy much sooner than he did. He has also taken credit for the near-disappearance of the practice by the time he left office at the end of 2013 (the practice plummeted because of a court case whose outcome Mr. Bloomberg fiercely opposed), and claimed that the only reason he didn’t apologize before 2019 was that no one asked him about it (not true). In reality, Mr. Bloomberg defended stop-and-frisk throughout his time as mayor and continued to do so, consistently and repeatedly, for nearly six years afterward — including in an interview the month before he entered the presidential race. At a news conference in May 2012, when a reporter asked if he was bothered by how controversial stop-and-frisk was, Mr. Bloomberg said: “When you do polling, my understanding is that the polls show overwhelming support by the public for the tactics we’ve been using to bring down crime. There’s always going to be somebody who disagrees, and they have a right, but if you were ever to do a balanced story, I think you’d find that it’s a minority of people who don’t like the tactic. We are very careful to follow the law. We go where the crime is. If our school system were better and if we kept working with families to help them raise their kids, maybe someday we won’t have the crime. But right now, we unfortunately do in certain communities.” Mr. Bloomberg went on to suggest the policy had saved thousands of lives — though a study released the next year would find that only 6 percent of stops from 2009 to 2012 had resulted in an arrest, and 0.1 percent in a conviction for a violent crime. And he said that neither he nor the police commissioner, Raymond W. Kelly, would apologize for it. “When we came into office, people always thought that crime was at rock bottom and it couldn’t go any lower. I think conventional wisdom was that crime would go up in this city. If that had been true, and if we had just held on to the gains that Rudy Giuliani’s administration brought to the city — and he did dramatically reduce the crime — there’d be another 5,600 people dead today. … Nobody should ask Ray Kelly to apologize — he’s not going to, and neither am I — for saving 5,600 lives. I think it’s fair to say that stop, question and frisk has been an essential part of the N.Y.P.D.’s work.” In a speech at the Christian Cultural Center in Brooklyn, Mr. Bloomberg acknowledged the validity of some criticisms and said he and Mr. Kelly were working to reform the practice. But he refused to abandon it. “We’ve also sent a message to criminals: If we suspect you may be carrying a gun, we will stop you. Through those stops, the police have recovered thousands of guns over the past decade, and tens of thousands of other weapons. There is no doubt those stops have saved lives. Now, I understand why some people want us to stop making stops. Innocent people who are stopped can be treated disrespectfully. That is not acceptable. If you’ve done nothing wrong, you deserve nothing but respect and courtesy from the police. Police Commissioner Kelly and I both believe we can do a better job in this area, and he’s instituted a number of reforms to do that. We believe that when it comes to making stops — to borrow a phrase from President Clinton — the practice should be mended, not ended. That work has already begun, and Commissioner Kelly has said that he fully expects the number of stops to decline.” As contenders to replace him as mayor made stop-and-frisk a campaign issue, Mr. Bloomberg accused them of “playing politics with people’s lives” and said in a speech to police leaders: As the ongoing federal court case is now demonstrating for any objective observer to see, the N.Y.P.D. conducts stops based on seeing something suspicious, or witnesses’ descriptions of suspects, not on any preconceived notions or on demographic data that would have you stopping old women as often as you stop young men. That’s not the real world. If the N.Y.P.D. conducted stops and intelligence gathering based on demographic data rather than real leads, guns would be everywhere in our city, thousands of New Yorkers who are alive today would be dead, and terrorists may well have succeeded in attacking us again.” He went on to denounce a City Council proposal to ban racial profiling, claiming that if a witness described the perpetrator of a crime as “a 20-something white man wearing a blue windbreaker,” the legislation would make officers ignore the racial identification and “stop 80-year-old black women if they’re wearing blue windbreakers.” “The legislation is based on the false allegation that the N.Y.P.D. disproportionately stops young men of color. But as you know, stops are made based on descriptions of suspects and suspicious activity only. And the sad reality is on the streets of our city, 90 percent of murder suspects and murder victims are black and Latino, and blacks and Hispanics are the overwhelming majority of suspects in other violent crimes. The truth of the matter is, comparing stops to the general population is just not rational. Comparing stops to the witnesses’ description of suspects and the identification of suspicious activity, which together reflect the racial and ethnic breakdown of criminal activity, is what matters. And the numbers put the lie to the racist allegations. In fact, the percentage of stops of blacks is less than that of whites and Asians when adjusted for crime reports.” In comments that drew a strong backlash at the time, Mr. Bloomberg said on a radio show that, in fact, the police stopped and frisked too few people of color. “They just keep saying, ‘Oh, it’s a disproportionate percentage of a particular ethnic group.’ That may be. But it’s not a disproportionate percentage of those who witnesses and victims describe as committing the murders. In that case, incidentally, I think we disproportionately stop whites too much and minorities too little. It’s exactly the reverse of what they’re saying. I don’t know where they went to school, but they certainly didn’t take a math course or a logic course.” The Wall Street Journal reported additional comments: “For years now, critics have been trying to argue that minorities are stopped disproportionately. If you look at the crime numbers, that is just not true. The numbers don’t lie. … I understand that we’re in a campaign season and everybody wants to do something right for their campaign, rather than help us get out of this terrible situation where a disproportionate percentage of the crime is committed by a group of young kids that just don’t have any future.” In a New Yorker interview, Mr. Bloomberg said: “I would suggest to the next mayor, whoever it is, that saving lives is the most important thing, more so than pandering. Stop-and-frisk has been shown to be not the only, but the most effective, tool in getting guns out of the hands of kids.” After a federal judge ruled that New York’s use of stop-and-frisk was unconstitutional, Mr. Bloomberg complained in a radio interview: “What does she know about policing? Absolutely zero. Your safety and the safety of your kids is now in the hands of some woman who does not have the expertise to do it.” He also gave a lengthy speech defending the policy. “I’m happy to say we are on pace for another record low of shootings and homicides this year because our police officers follow the law and follow the crime. They fight crime wherever crime is occurring, and they don’t worry if their work doesn’t match up to a census chart. As a result, today we have fewer guns, fewer shootings and fewer homicides. In fact, murders are 50 percent below the level they were 12 years ago, when we came into office — something no one thought possible back then. Stop-question-frisk, which the Supreme Court of the United States has found to be constitutional, is an important part of that record of success. It has taken some 8,000 guns off the streets over the past decade, and some 80,000 other weapons. … We have the lowest percentage of teenagers carrying guns of any major city across our country. The possibility of being stopped acts as a vital deterrent. … The fact that fewer guns are on the streets now shows that our efforts have been successful, and there is just no question that stop-question-frisk has saved countless lives. And we know that most of those lives saved, based on the statistics, have been black and Hispanic young men. Shortly after the court ruling, Mr. Bloomberg defended stop-and-frisk in an interview with New York magazine. “The judge is just wrong. We have not racial profiled, we’ve gone where the crime is. I don’t have any doubts that she will be reversed right away. The question is, will our successor continue the battle? I cannot get involved in the next administration, nor should I. But for something like that, I would certainly make my views known. … The sad thing, which nobody’s willing to talk about, is that most of our crime is in two neighborhoods: southeast Bronx, central Brooklyn. All minority males 15 to 25. We’ve got to do something about that. And unless you get the guns out of their hands, you’re not going to ever be able to do anything.” Mr. Bloomberg went to a black church in Harlem in late 2013 to defend the policy. Here is his account from a speech two years later at the Aspen Institute: “Two Decembers ago, my last year in office, some minister from a black Baptist church in Harlem invited me to come speak about stop-and-frisk. And I never turn down an opportunity to explain to the voters what we’re doing. Sometimes people like it, sometimes they don’t, but I went. And while I’m sitting there, he introduced me, he said to his congregation, ‘You know, if every one of you stopped and frisked your kids before they went out at night, the mayor wouldn’t have to.’ And so I knew I was going to be OK.” When he eventually apologized years later, Mr. Bloomberg would take credit for almost eliminating stop-and-frisk by the end of his tenure (a trend largely attributable to the legal challenges that he opposed). In reality, he still gave a full-throated defense of stop-and-frisk in a Rolling Stone interview after he left office. “Almost all murders are young minority males killing young minority males. It’s like 90 percent. Take out domestic violence; after that, there’s nothing left. … So you go to those places where the crimes are reported, you look for people that look like the description, and then you use good police work. Is there any reason to stop them? The courts say if you act furtively, or there’s a bulge in their pocket or something like that, you stop them. And what happens is the kids learn, ‘I don’t want to carry a gun.’” When the interviewer brought up the ruling that the practice “violated the constitutional rights of black and Latino New Yorkers as it was applied,” Mr. Bloomberg responded: “Well, that’s what cops do. That is the job. If you don’t do that, you’re not going to ever stop anybody. And in fact, one judge did rule that it was discriminatory. We argued — and I am 100 percent convinced it would have won on appeal — that that’s not true. We are not targeting any race. The sick thing in our society is, the perpetrators and victims fit that description, 90 percent of them. That’s where we should be focusing our efforts. We did two things, really: less incarceration, because you create less criminals, and stop-and-frisk. If you hadn’t done that in the last 12 years, 9,000 more murders would have taken place in New York City, and they all would have fit that description of male minorities, 15 to 25. Just think about the carnage. Think about the families. … I’ve looked at it very carefully, and I am 100 percent convinced that as explained to me by lawyers, we were consistent with the law, that we were doing the right thing, and that we saved 9,000 lives. You can actually get a list of those 9,000 lives. It’ll be an interesting list. That’s what we should do — run an ad with the names of the 9,000 people.” Mr. Bloomberg’s “9,000 lives” figure is hypothetical: a statistical extrapolation from past and present crime rates. It is not possible, as he claims, to identify specific people whose lives were saved. In an audio clip from his speech at the Aspen Institute, which circulated widely this month, Mr. Bloomberg said: “It’s controversial, but the first thing — 95 percent of your murders and murderers and murder victims fit one M.O. You can just take the description, Xerox it and pass it out to all the cops. They are male minorities, 15 to 25. That’s true in New York, it’s true in virtually every city in America, and that’s where the real crime is. You’ve got to get the guns out of the hands of the people that are getting killed. … Kids think they’re going to get killed anyway because all their friends are getting killed, so they just don’t have any long-term focus or anything. It’s a joke to have a gun, it’s a joke to pull the trigger.” He said other cities had higher murder rates than New York because “they haven’t gone after scaring the kids to get guns out of them. A lot of people don’t like the fact that that’s what you do, but that’s what stops this.” “Put those cops where the crime is, which means in minority neighborhoods. An unintended consequence is people say, ‘Oh my God, you are arresting kids for marijuana, they’re all minorities.’ Yes, that’s true. Why? Because we put all the cops in the minority neighborhoods. Yes, that’s true. Why do we do it? Because that’s where all the crime is. The first thing you can do for people is to stop them getting killed. We did a calculation on how many people who would have been dead if we hadn’t brought down the murder rate and got the guns off the streets, and the way you get the guns out of the kids’ hands is to throw them against the wall and frisk them. Because then they say, ‘I don’t want to get caught,’ so they don’t bring the gun. They still have a gun, but they leave it at home.” After a long stretch in which he didn’t prominently comment on stop-and-frisk, Mr. Bloomberg confirmed in an interview with The New York Times (parts of which were published at the time) that he still believed it had been the right policy during his tenure. He did allow, though, that circumstances might be different now. “We used it at a point in time where there were an awful lot of people killing each other, and it was a technique that we used which was supported by a lot of people who said, ‘Look, we just got to stop this carnage no matter what.’ And based on that, we’ve evolved into using other techniques. But the murder rate came down dramatically, and what I look at is the number of people whose lives were saved by getting kids to not carry guns because they were afraid to be stopped. The New York City Police Department is very well managed and has stayed within the law. And I can’t tell you every cop did everything perfectly, but I think it was a technique that was appropriate at the time. My job was to do everything I could to stop murder.” When pressed on the fact that the crime rate kept falling after Bill de Blasio became mayor and abandoned stop-and-frisk, Mr. Bloomberg acknowledged the trend but said: “Keep in mind, all of this stuff is built on what was done before. So you can’t just say the techniques you would have after kids are afraid to carry guns are different than the techniques you would use if they were not afraid to carry guns.” During a question-and-answer session at the United States Naval Academy, a midshipman asked Mr. Bloomberg what he would say to the black and Latino communities affected by stop-and-frisk. Mr. Bloomberg said the police “certainly did not pick somebody by race” and added: “We focused on keeping kids from going through the correctional system — kids who walked around looking like they might have a gun, remove the gun from their pockets and stop it. … The result of that was, over the years, the murder rate in New York City went from 650 a year to 300 a year when I left. … It was a program which we had, and then when the number of guns we were confiscating started to fall and people left their guns at home, we tailed that off.” Just a month before he renounced stop-and-frisk, Mr. Bloomberg defended it in a Washington Post interview and argued that it had actually helped minority communities. “I came into a situation where an awful lot of people were killing an awful lot of other people, and it was all pretty much one community. And I just said, we are going to do anything we can to stop the carnage. The first thing was stop the murders. And we brought down the incarceration rate in jails by a third, mostly minority kids. We brought down the murder rate by 50 percent, from 600 to 300 murders, and you know who would have been killed.” On the eve of his presidential campaign announcement, standing in the same church where he defended stop-and-frisk in 2012, Mr. Bloomberg renounced the policy for the first time. “I can’t change history. However, today, I want you to know that I realize back then I was wrong, and I’m sorry. … Over time, I’ve come to understand something that I long struggled to admit to myself: I got something important wrong. I got something important really wrong. I didn’t understand back then the full impact that stops were having on the black and Latino communities. I was totally focused on saving lives, but as we know, good intentions aren’t good enough.” Mr. Bloomberg reiterated his apology in an interview with CBS News’s Gayle King, and acknowledged that the continued decrease in crime after stop-and-frisk ended undermined his argument that it had been necessary. “We were overzealous at the time to do it. Our intent was to do anything we could to stop the carnage, the murder rate. What was surprising is when we stopped doing a little bit, we thought crime would go up. It didn’t; it went down. Should have, would have and could have — in looking back, I can’t help that. In looking back, I made a mistake. I’m sorry. I apologize.” When Ms. King noted that the timing of Mr. Bloomberg’s apology raised questions about its sincerity, Mr. Bloomberg claimed falsely, “Well, nobody asked me about it until I started running for president, so come on.” People had asked him about it at least four times between when he left office and when he started running for president, including twice in 2019 alone, and he defended it each time. In a statement after the release of the audio from his 2015 Aspen Institute speech, Mr. Bloomberg said he had “taken responsibility” but simultaneously sought to play down his responsibility by saying stop-and-frisk predated his time as mayor. “I inherited the police practice of stop-and-frisk, and as part of our effort to stop gun violence it was overused. By the time I left office, I cut it back by 95 percent, but I should’ve done it faster and sooner. I regret that and I have apologized — and I have taken responsibility for taking too long to understand the impact it had on black and Latino communities.” This statement falsely implied, once more, that Mr. Bloomberg had begun to reject the policy “by the time” he left office.

2020,When Did Bloomberg Turn Against Stop-and-Frisk? When He Ran for President.,"Mr. Bloomberg has begun to imply that he turned against the practice much sooner than he did. In reality, he defended it for years, including the month before he entered the presidential race. Days before he announced his presidential campaign in November, Michael R. Bloomberg, the mayor of New York City from 2002 through 2013, renounced one of his signature policies: stop-and-frisk, in which police officers stopped and searched millions of New Yorkers, the vast majority of whom were black or Hispanic and had not committed a crime. But as his campaign has grown — he qualified on Tuesday for this week’s Democratic debate — and stop-and-frisk has become a major piece of ammunition for his opponents, Mr. Bloomberg has begun to imply that he turned against the policy much sooner than he did. He has also taken credit for the near-disappearance of the practice by the time he left office at the end of 2013 (the practice plummeted because of a court case whose outcome Mr. Bloomberg fiercely opposed), and claimed that the only reason he didn’t apologize before 2019 was that no one asked him about it (not true). In reality, Mr. Bloomberg defended stop-and-frisk throughout his time as mayor and continued to do so, consistently and repeatedly, for nearly six years afterward — including in an interview the month before he entered the presidential race. At a news conference in May 2012, when a reporter asked if he was bothered by how controversial stop-and-frisk was, Mr. Bloomberg said: “When you do polling, my understanding is that the polls show overwhelming support by the public for the tactics we’ve been using to bring down crime. There’s always going to be somebody who disagrees, and they have a right, but if you were ever to do a balanced story, I think you’d find that it’s a minority of people who don’t like the tactic. We are very careful to follow the law. We go where the crime is. If our school system were better and if we kept working with families to help them raise their kids, maybe someday we won’t have the crime. But right now, we unfortunately do in certain communities.” Mr. Bloomberg went on to suggest the policy had saved thousands of lives — though a study released the next year would find that only 6 percent of stops from 2009 to 2012 had resulted in an arrest, and 0.1 percent in a conviction for a violent crime. And he said that neither he nor the police commissioner, Raymond W. Kelly, would apologize for it. “When we came into office, people always thought that crime was at rock bottom and it couldn’t go any lower. I think conventional wisdom was that crime would go up in this city. If that had been true, and if we had just held on to the gains that Rudy Giuliani’s administration brought to the city — and he did dramatically reduce the crime — there’d be another 5,600 people dead today. … Nobody should ask Ray Kelly to apologize — he’s not going to, and neither am I — for saving 5,600 lives. I think it’s fair to say that stop, question and frisk has been an essential part of the N.Y.P.D.’s work.” In a speech at the Christian Cultural Center in Brooklyn, Mr. Bloomberg acknowledged the validity of some criticisms and said he and Mr. Kelly were working to reform the practice. But he refused to abandon it. “We’ve also sent a message to criminals: If we suspect you may be carrying a gun, we will stop you. Through those stops, the police have recovered thousands of guns over the past decade, and tens of thousands of other weapons. There is no doubt those stops have saved lives. Now, I understand why some people want us to stop making stops. Innocent people who are stopped can be treated disrespectfully. That is not acceptable. If you’ve done nothing wrong, you deserve nothing but respect and courtesy from the police. Police Commissioner Kelly and I both believe we can do a better job in this area, and he’s instituted a number of reforms to do that. We believe that when it comes to making stops — to borrow a phrase from President Clinton — the practice should be mended, not ended. That work has already begun, and Commissioner Kelly has said that he fully expects the number of stops to decline.” As contenders to replace him as mayor made stop-and-frisk a campaign issue, Mr. Bloomberg accused them of “playing politics with people’s lives” and said in a speech to police leaders: As the ongoing federal court case is now demonstrating for any objective observer to see, the N.Y.P.D. conducts stops based on seeing something suspicious, or witnesses’ descriptions of suspects, not on any preconceived notions or on demographic data that would have you stopping old women as often as you stop young men. That’s not the real world. If the N.Y.P.D. conducted stops and intelligence gathering based on demographic data rather than real leads, guns would be everywhere in our city, thousands of New Yorkers who are alive today would be dead, and terrorists may well have succeeded in attacking us again.” He went on to denounce a City Council proposal to ban racial profiling, claiming that if a witness described the perpetrator of a crime as “a 20-something white man wearing a blue windbreaker,” the legislation would make officers ignore the racial identification and “stop 80-year-old black women if they’re wearing blue windbreakers.” “The legislation is based on the false allegation that the N.Y.P.D. disproportionately stops young men of color. But as you know, stops are made based on descriptions of suspects and suspicious activity only. And the sad reality is on the streets of our city, 90 percent of murder suspects and murder victims are black and Latino, and blacks and Hispanics are the overwhelming majority of suspects in other violent crimes. The truth of the matter is, comparing stops to the general population is just not rational. Comparing stops to the witnesses’ description of suspects and the identification of suspicious activity, which together reflect the racial and ethnic breakdown of criminal activity, is what matters. And the numbers put the lie to the racist allegations. In fact, the percentage of stops of blacks is less than that of whites and Asians when adjusted for crime reports.” In comments that drew a strong backlash at the time, Mr. Bloomberg said on a radio show that, in fact, the police stopped and frisked too few people of color. “They just keep saying, ‘Oh, it’s a disproportionate percentage of a particular ethnic group.’ That may be. But it’s not a disproportionate percentage of those who witnesses and victims describe as committing the murders. In that case, incidentally, I think we disproportionately stop whites too much and minorities too little. It’s exactly the reverse of what they’re saying. I don’t know where they went to school, but they certainly didn’t take a math course or a logic course.” The Wall Street Journal reported additional comments: “For years now, critics have been trying to argue that minorities are stopped disproportionately. If you look at the crime numbers, that is just not true. The numbers don’t lie. … I understand that we’re in a campaign season and everybody wants to do something right for their campaign, rather than help us get out of this terrible situation where a disproportionate percentage of the crime is committed by a group of young kids that just don’t have any future.” In a New Yorker interview, Mr. Bloomberg said: “I would suggest to the next mayor, whoever it is, that saving lives is the most important thing, more so than pandering. Stop-and-frisk has been shown to be not the only, but the most effective, tool in getting guns out of the hands of kids.” After a federal judge ruled that New York’s use of stop-and-frisk was unconstitutional, Mr. Bloomberg complained in a radio interview: “What does she know about policing? Absolutely zero. Your safety and the safety of your kids is now in the hands of some woman who does not have the expertise to do it.” He also gave a lengthy speech defending the policy. “I’m happy to say we are on pace for another record low of shootings and homicides this year because our police officers follow the law and follow the crime. They fight crime wherever crime is occurring, and they don’t worry if their work doesn’t match up to a census chart. As a result, today we have fewer guns, fewer shootings and fewer homicides. In fact, murders are 50 percent below the level they were 12 years ago, when we came into office — something no one thought possible back then. Stop-question-frisk, which the Supreme Court of the United States has found to be constitutional, is an important part of that record of success. It has taken some 8,000 guns off the streets over the past decade, and some 80,000 other weapons. … We have the lowest percentage of teenagers carrying guns of any major city across our country. The possibility of being stopped acts as a vital deterrent. … The fact that fewer guns are on the streets now shows that our efforts have been successful, and there is just no question that stop-question-frisk has saved countless lives. And we know that most of those lives saved, based on the statistics, have been black and Hispanic young men. Shortly after the court ruling, Mr. Bloomberg defended stop-and-frisk in an interview with New York magazine. “The judge is just wrong. We have not racial profiled, we’ve gone where the crime is. I don’t have any doubts that she will be reversed right away. The question is, will our successor continue the battle? I cannot get involved in the next administration, nor should I.

Just think about the carnage.

You can actually get a list of those 9,000 lives. It’ll be an interesting list. That’s what we should do — run an ad with the names of the 9,000 people.” Mr. Bloomberg’s “9,000 lives” figure is hypothetical: a statistical extrapolation from past and present crime rates. It is not possible, as he claims, to identify specific people whose lives were saved. In an audio clip from his speech at the Aspen Institute, which circulated widely this month, Mr. Bloomberg said: “It’s controversial, but the first thing — 95 percent of your murders and murderers and murder victims fit one M.O.

Yes, that’s true. Why do we do it? Because that’s where all the crime is. The first thing you can do for people is to stop them getting killed. We did a calculation on how many people who would have been dead if we hadn’t brought down the murder rate and got the guns off the streets, and the way you get the guns out of the kids’ hands is to throw them against the wall and frisk them. Because then they say, ‘I don’t want to get caught,’ so they don’t bring the gun. They still have a gun, but they leave it at home.” After a long stretch in which he didn’t prominently comment on stop-and-frisk, Mr. Bloomberg confirmed in an interview with The New York Times (parts of which were published at the time) that he still believed it had been the right policy during his tenure.

And I just said, we are going to do anything we can to stop the carnage. The first thing was stop the murders. And we brought down the incarceration rate in jails by a third, mostly minority kids.

However, today, I want you to know that I realize back then I was wrong, and I’m sorry. … Over time, I’ve come to understand something that I long struggled to admit to myself: I got something important wrong. I got something important really wrong. I didn’t understand back then the full impact that stops were having on the black and Latino communities. I was totally focused on saving lives, but as we know, good intentions aren’t good enough.” Mr. Bloomberg reiterated his apology in an interview with CBS News’s Gayle King, and acknowledged that the continued decrease in crime after stop-and-frisk ended undermined his argument that it had been necessary. “We were overzealous at the time to do it. Our intent was to do anything we could to stop the carnage, the murder rate. What was surprising is when we stopped doing a little bit, we thought crime would go up. It didn’t; it went down. Should have, would have and could have — in looking back, I can’t help that. In looking back, I made a mistake. I’m sorry. I apologize.” When Ms. King noted that the timing of Mr. Bloomberg’s apology raised questions about its sincerity, Mr. Bloomberg claimed falsely, “Well, nobody asked me about it until I started running for president, so come on.” People had asked him about it at least four times between when he left office and when he started running for president, including twice in 2019 alone, and he defended it each time. In a statement after the release of the audio from his 2015 Aspen Institute speech, Mr. Bloomberg said he had “taken responsibility” but simultaneously sought to play down his responsibility by saying stop-and-frisk predated his time as mayor. “I inherited the police practice of stop-and-frisk, and as part of our effort to stop gun violence it was overused. By the time I left office, I cut it back by 95 percent, but I should’ve done it faster and sooner. I regret that and I have apologized — and I have taken responsibility for taking too long to understand the impact it had on black and Latino communities.” This statement falsely implied, once more, that Mr. Bloomberg had begun to reject the policy “by the time” he left office.

2020,When Did Gluttony Become So Glamorous?,"Over-the-top banquets have long been viewed as harbingers of impending doom. Their recent resurgence on the fashion circuit feels like a cheeky comment on the times. LANGOUSTINES DROOPED FROM above, their whiskers trailing like vines. Below them, the table was laden with duck potpies, caviar and great loaves of pâté; lobster tails spilling from a ceramic shell nearly as large as the one that birthed Venus; lamb chops with the bones jutting out amid cracked-open pomegranates yielding glittering ruby seeds. Some of this could be eaten — the lobster tails were replenished every few minutes, a seemingly endless supply — but what could be done with a swan built to scale out of artichoke petals, or kumquats rising to a tall, narrow peak that recalled the perilous architecture of a croquembouche? This was less banquet than elaborate tableau, staged last spring by the New York caterer Olivier Cheng to mark the opening of the Hermès boutique in Manhattan’s meatpacking district. Extravagant food displays have become a motif at high-end fashion, design and other events in the past few years, from the pyramid of shrimp layered with roses and the three-foot-long challah surrounded by butter renditions of the face of Michelangelo’s David, created by the New York-based artist Laila Gohar for the opening of the Galeries Lafayette Champs-Élysées in Paris in March, to an event last October at Longchamp’s SoHo boutique, where the Brooklyn catering company known as BoardGirlsNY dispensed with serving ware and instead heaped food directly on the six-foot-long table, a sprawl that was at once wreckage and bounty, with macarons tilting up against raw broccoli florets, cherry tomatoes tumbling over coins of salami and giant rough-hewn cantaloupe halves daring someone to scoop out their flesh. In another era — ancient Rome, perhaps, or 18th-century France — such profligacy might have been interpreted as the last gasp of a blinkered privileged class before the revolution. But now a strange satirical spirit appears to be at play, self-consciously looking back to the debaucheries of antiquity with a knowing eye. The Hermès feast was so excessive as to become a commentary on excess, on the enormous marshaling of resources, expenditure of labor and frenzied attention to detail devoted to the ephemeral pleasures of a single night. In this it served as a metaphor for fashion itself and the great machinery of artifice that each fleeting season creates clothes and accessories to be exulted over, scrambled after and then pushed to the back of the closet to make way for the new. Obsolescence is the dark side of fashion, which, accordingly, has always (and often intentionally) blurred the line between narcissism and futility. These lavish buffets explicitly invoke vanity in the Old World form of vanitas, the 17th-century genre of Dutch still lifes that sought to illustrate, through an arrangement of objects, the transience of human existence. Each carefully chosen item holds within it its doom: expensive fruit imported from abroad and soon to rot, flowers already listing, a bubble unmoored, about to land. At the Hermès event, platters were lit by candelabra, and a faux butterfly — another vanitas motif, its life span but a moment — perched on a dome of jelly flecked with silver foil. But unlike the still lifes of the 17th century — so heavily freighted with moral sensibility, favoring the eternal kingdom over earthly delights — these recent tableaus suggest a rage against the dying of the light. If anything, the hint at demise heightens the revelry, as in Edgar Allan Poe’s short story “The Masque of the Red Death” (1842), when a prince throws a masquerade ball inside a castellated abbey even as a plague decimates the peasants outside. The first-century poet Juvenal, who satirized the excesses that would lead to the collapse of the Roman Empire, likewise wrote of those who remained in denial as the end looms, retreating further into indulgence: “The greater their straits — though the house is ready to fall, and the daylight begins to show between the cracks — the more luxuriously and daintily do they dine.” EXCESS IS DEFIANCE, sometimes literally, as in ancient Rome, when the government imposed so-called sumptuary laws to prevent extravagant spectacles. In response, the most powerful in society outdid each other with menus of difficult-to-procure exotica: boiled flamingo, peacock brains, nightingale tongues and parrot heads; camel heels, sow’s udders, mullet guts and milk-gorged snails. The Hermès party was almost austere in comparison. But a moral note did creep in, slyly, in keeping with recent calls by protesters on the far left to “eat the rich” — a slogan lifted from a phrase often misattributed to the 18th-century Genevan philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau: “When the people shall have nothing more to eat, they will eat the rich.” That night, actors were hired with a counterintuitive mission: to disrupt the proceedings and purposefully unsettle guests. Posing as staff, they loudly bungled names, shrieked in corners and snatched away plates. It was a warning amid the debauchery: Don’t rest easy. Trouble is coming. There is at least one historical instance in which an over-the-top affair helped bring its host to ruin. In 1661, Nicolas Fouquet, France’s finance minister under Louis XIV, threw a party so ostentatious that it convinced its observers of a long-held suspicion that the erstwhile government functionary was skimming off crown funds for his own benefit. He was arrested on charges of treason and embezzlement and put in prison, where he would die in 1680. But Louis XIV, while righteously angry, didn’t take the lesson to heart: He poached Fouquet’s architect for himself in order to transform a relatively humble hunting lodge near Versailles into a proper chateau. There, the feasts grew lusher, grander, madder with each royal generation. Finally, all that was left was the guillotine. Crystal decanter and silver pheasant from Nelson & Nelson Antiques.

2020,When Did the Super Bowl Halftime Show Become Political?,"For many years — decades even — the Super Bowl halftime show was an uncontroversial distraction, a way for the N.F.L. to retain eyeballs and collect advertising dollars in between the two halves of the most watched game of the year. But something that is seen by that many people can easily become a site of protest (political, or just petulant), or simply disrupted, whether by the Justin Timberlake/Janet Jackson wardrobe malfunction, or M.I.A. flashing a middle finger to the camera or Prince’s very careful guitar placement. In the post-Kaepernick era, the halftime show has taken on a whole new political valence. Rihanna declined the opportunity to perform last year in solidarity with the quarterback. And in advance of this year’s show, the N.F.L. entered into a business relationship with Jay-Z’s Roc Nation, which is now helping to produce the halftime extravaganza. This year’s scheduled performers are Jennifer Lopez and Shakira. On this week’s Popcast, a conversation about the history of the halftime show, and how its meaning has evolved over the last two decades.

2020,When Do You Become an Adult?,"student opinion What are the responsibilities and privileges that you associate with being an adult? Find all our Student Opinion questions here. Do you think there is a certain age when someone becomes an adult? How can you know what that age is? What are the privileges associated with adulthood in your state or country? What are the responsibilities? What about within your family? Are you expected to do certain “adult” things by a certain age? In “When Are You Really an Adult?,” Maria Cramer writes about a Vermont senator, John Rodgers, who proposed a bill to outlaw cellphone use by anyone under 21 to make a point about a Vermont law that banned the sale of firearms to most people under that same age: “There are all these pushes around some parts of the country for 16-year-olds to vote but we’re saying they’re not mature enough to smoke or purchase a gun. So which is it?” said Mr. Rodgers. “When are you really an adult?” It is a question that has possessed both poets and lawmakers. But there is not much clarity in state laws. In Alaska, teenagers as young as 14 can get married with a court order. Only a handful of states allow drinking under 21 and that is under strict circumstances, like when a parent or legal guardian is present. Eighteen-year-old adults can run for office, go to strip clubs, be sentenced to life in prison, and volunteer to go to war or be drafted, but as of last December, they cannot vape or smoke tobacco products. And since 1984, when states began raising the legal age of drinking to 21 from 18 in exchange for federal highway funds — in some cases barely a decade after lowering it — they have not been able to buy a beer at a bar in most of the United States, a restriction that has infuriated college students ever since. “If 18-year-olds are burdened with the responsibility of adulthood, they should be afforded some of its privileges,” said Charlotte Lawson, a 21-year-old fourth-year student at the University of Virginia who wrote an opinion piece in the campus paper in 2018 calling for the drinking age to be lowered from 21. “It’s interesting these are people who work full-time jobs, pay their own rent, pay taxes and are eligible to vote,” she said. “Yet none of this constitutes adequate proof that a person is responsible enough to drink.” The article looks at the history of the changing drinking age throughout the 20th century: After the end of Prohibition in 1933, most states set the drinking age at 21, which was also the minimum voting age at the time. Lawmakers reasoned that if you were old enough to vote, you were old enough to drink, Mr. Parent said. That philosophy continued in 1971, when Congress lowered the voting age to 18 in response to fury over the draft during the Vietnam War, which conscripted thousands of men between 18 and 21 into war. States, in turn, lowered the drinking age to 18, Mr. Parent said. But in 1984, President Ronald Reagan began pushing hard for states to raise their drinking age, citing what he called a “great national problem” of drinking and driving by teenagers. In July of that year, Congress passed the National Minimum Drinking Age Act, which required states to raise the age of drinking to 21 or risk a 10 percent cut in their federal highway funds. Scientists are also trying to answer this question by looking at brain development: The scientific consensus that most brains do not fully develop until age 25 has led to a host of reforms in the criminal justice system and reexaminations about how society should punish young adults. But it has also fed the confusion over what young adults should be allowed to do when scientists know that they use less restraint and discipline than older people, said Warren Binford, a law professor at Willamette University and founder of the school’s Child and Family Advocacy Clinic. “We’re constantly trying to balance the rights to protection and the rights to participation,” said Ms. Binford. “We are a society that loves its liberty, but we’re also a society that recognizes that children are unique and special and deserving of protection.” Students, read the entire article, then tell us: Do you feel that you are an adult now? Why or why not? How will you know when you have reached adulthood? Do you think adulthood is connected to being a certain age or having specific responsibilities? Are there legal rights, like voting or drinking, that you think will help you demonstrate your own transition into adulthood? What do you think should be the legal minimum age for doing the following “adult” activities: getting married, voting, enlisting in the military, buying alcohol, buying cigarettes, owning a firearm, being tried as an adult in court? Do you think minimum age requirements are necessary to protect young people from adult risks and responsibilities? Who do you think should be responsible for setting these age requirements? What do you think should inform or determine those decisions? Should it be brain development, educational achievements, maturity or something else? Benming Zhang, who was elected to the City Council in Williamsburg, Va., during his final undergraduate year in college, said he faced the most skepticism about his campaign from his peers. Why do you think that was? Would you trust one of your peers if he or she was running for a political office now? How about in five years? Do you think there are certain experiences or qualifications that someone needs to be in a role of political leadership? How do you feel about the voting age in the United States? Do you think that you, or your peers, would be more active politically if you were able to vote? How do you think the voting age should be determined? Students 13 and older are invited to comment.

2020,Opinion | When Donald Trump Is the Law,"Guess who benefits? The editorial board is a group of opinion journalists whose views are informed by expertise, research, debate and certain longstanding values. It is separate from the newsroom. “I’m actually, I guess, the chief law enforcement officer of the country,” President Trump said on Tuesday. The alarming thing is that he’s right. The nation’s founders put the president in charge of the executive branch, which is tasked with enforcing the law. That is a remarkably broad power, and it can be easily abused. So it’s worth asking: What does Donald Trump understand the law to be? Well before the events of the past week, Mr. Trump supplied a pretty good idea: The law is something that applies to his adversaries, not to himself or his friends. He regularly turned to the courts to harass and intimidate employees, critics and contractors. But when it has come to his own perceived advantage — whether he was violating federal fair-housing laws to keep black renters out of his apartment buildings, playing shady games with his tax returns, sexually assaulting women, defrauding students of his “university,” raiding his own charity, buying the silence of alleged mistresses on the eve of an election, running his global business empire out of the White House, or thwarting the will of Congress by using foreign aid to advance his re-election — Mr. Trump has always seen the law as just another set of rules to be bent, if not broken. Americans, meet your chief law enforcement officer. Richard Nixon infamously declared, “When the president does it, that means that it is not illegal.” Nixon’s attempts to take the law into his own hands proved too much for the Republic to bear, and after he was driven from office, subsequent presidents embraced laws and practices intended to honor the principle of justice for all by insulating federal law enforcement from political pressure. Those checks have largely worked, until now. President Trump, abetted by supine Republicans in Congress, is now undermining the fair application of justice as Nixon did, in similar, and in some cases, more egregious ways. Mr. Trump has claimed that the Constitution gives him “the right to do whatever I want.” His lawyers have argued in a federal case involving his tax returns that a sitting president cannot even be investigated. They have also, in a head-spinning assertion of executive authority, dismissed any efforts by Congress to hold the president and the executive branch accountable — even in an impeachment inquiry — as “constitutionally invalid.” On Tuesday, the president granted clemency to a rogues’ gallery of, well, rogues — including the former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich (extorting a children’s hospital and trying to sell a Senate seat), the disgraced junk-bond trader Michael Milken (multiple counts of tax and securities fraud) and the former New York City police commissioner Bernard Kerik (tax fraud and lying to the government). The White House claimed that Mr. Trump’s mercy reflected his deep concern with excessive criminal sentences. If so, he has an interesting way of showing it. The American justice system is rife with examples of inequity, but being too tough on white-collar criminals is not among them. This air of monarchical impunity has colored many of Mr. Trump’s actions as president, but especially in the last several days. Before his grants of clemency, he brazenly tried to interfere in the criminal sentencing of his longtime crony and fixer, Roger Stone, who was convicted last year of lying to Congress, obstructing justice and intimidating a witness. After federal prosecutors sought a sentence of seven to nine years, which was within the sentencing guidelines’ range, Mr. Trump demanded that Mr. Stone receive a lighter sentence — which Attorney General William Barr then requested. Mr. Trump has since personally attacked the prosecutors, the federal judge and the jury forewoman on the case. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump retweeted calls for Mr. Barr to “clean house” at the Justice Department, apparently referring to anyone with the temerity to maintain allegiance to the Constitution rather than to the president. Characteristically, while interfering in the justice system, Mr. Trump is both insisting he’s doing nothing of the sort and asserting his right to do so. “Just so you understand, I chose not to be involved,” he said Tuesday in response to a question about his meddling in Mr. Stone’s case. “I’m allowed to be totally involved.” This is in the style of autocrats across the globe, who weaponize the law to help themselves and their friends and hurt their enemies. The nation’s legal system is now run by a man who has spent his life mocking it. He is trying to turn the people charged with federal law enforcement into presidential fixers, starting with Mr. Barr, who finds himself in a tight spot. Whether or not you believe him when he says the president’s tweets make his job “impossible,” the fact is that he said it, and that Mr. Trump ignored him. And if you do believe him, then you have to ask why, if his job has become impossible, he hasn’t resigned already. (You might also ask just what Mr. Barr considers his job to be.) Mr. Barr becomes only the latest in a long line of powerful officials Mr. Trump has seemed to take delight in publicly humiliating, including, to name just a few: Jeff Sessions, Rex Tillerson, H.R. McMaster, Jim Mattis, Kirstjen Nielsen and John Kelly. This is the second time in half a century that a lawless chief executive has tested the nation’s fundamental constitutional design. The first time, we passed. But now we know that the mechanisms put in place after Watergate were not sufficient. One potential new safeguard would be for Congress to make the Justice Department more independent, like the Federal Reserve, thus insulating it from the self-interested meddling of unethical presidents. The Supreme Court is currently considering the scope of Congress’s power to establish independent agencies. However it rules, the current checks are demonstrably not strong enough. If there is anything useful to draw from Mr. Trump’s degradation of the rule of law and the powers of his office, it’s that he is exposing a critical vulnerability in the Constitution’s design, which anticipated presidents behaving badly, but not this badly. To be fair, the founders did include two backstops to guard against a lawless chief executive: One is impeachment. The other is a quadrennial election.

2020,When Is Super Tuesday and What Is It Exactly?,"Super Tuesday is Tuesday, March 3. It is the most important day on the Democratic primary calendar because there are so many delegates up for grabs. Yes, yes — we know the South Carolina primary comes first on Saturday. But like a successful sports team looking ahead to a big game, we want to start getting you prepared for Super Tuesday — the most important day on the Democratic primary calendar. So when exactly is Super Tuesday, what makes it so “Super” and how did we even get to a place where we have a day with that title? Here’s what you need to know: Tuesday, March 3. Super Tuesday is the closest thing we have to a national primary. On March 3, more than a dozen states will hold primaries, as will Democrats abroad. The American Samoa Democratic caucuses are also set to take place. Some of the states that will vote on Super Tuesday, like California and Texas, have enormous troves of delegates available for the taking. (For a full list of states that will vote that day, you can view our 2020 election calendar.) All together, there will be more than 1,300 delegates to the national convention at stake — about a third of the total available — and the most offered up on any single day of the primary. And if you add the 155 delegates allocated from the early voting states — Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina — by the time Super Tuesday has ended, almost 40 percent of the total delegate allocation will be spoken for. If one candidate opens a wide delegate lead, it could prove mathematically difficult for others to climb back into contention. As such, what happens on Super Tuesday could very well decide the race — or come very close to doing so. At the very least, the results that come out of Super Tuesday could winnow the field. See how many delegates are available in each state. If you look at our presidential primary election calendar, you’ll notice that several of the Democratic primary contests are being held on Tuesdays. Technically speaking, we vote in presidential general elections on that day of the week in November because of a law that dates back to the 1800s. And the reason that we settled on Tuesday had to do with the fact that at the time, America was mostly a religious and agrarian society. Sundays were a day of rest and worship and were therefore not good for voting. Wednesdays were often market day — the day for selling crops. And for many farmers, voting in town required travel time, so Mondays and Thursdays would not work. Thus Tuesdays ended up being one of the best and only options. “Super Tuesday,” however, is a fairly recent political development. Our archives contain a reference to “super-Tuesday” as early as 1976, in a political article that seems to suggest that at least three states voted in the Democratic primary that year on June 8. Later articles refer to a “Super Tuesday” in the Democratic primary of 1980, when on June 3, eight states voted. One article explained its genesis this way: In 1980, Carter-Mondale campaign strategists, wanting to give President Carter a chance to make a quick rebound should he lose the New Hampshire primary to his Democratic challenger, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, arranged to move up the dates of three Southern state primaries to one week behind the New Hampshire contest. Thus “Super Tuesday” was created in the South, with voters in Georgia, Alabama and Florida expressing their Presidential preference the same day. But what several articles call the “first” official Super Tuesday came on March 13, 1984, when nine states — Washington, Nevada, Oklahoma, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Alabama, Georgia and Florida — American Samoa and Democrats abroad all voted. It was “the largest single harvest of convention delegates of the campaign,” The Times noted, adding that 511 delegates were at stake. That delegate trove would continue to grow over the years in a tradition that would persist. Kitty Bennett contributed research. Updated Feb. 29, 2020",The New York Times
2020,"When It’s This Easy at the Top, It’s Harder for Everyone Else","America has always known haves and have-nots. But what was a tiered system is morphing into a caste system. A $1,000 seat at Yankee Stadium, in the first few rows along the baseline, is known as a Legends ticket. Holders bypass the long lines of fans waiting to enter the park by conventional means, whisked in by security guards who greet them like family. They enjoy a private dining room and concierge access, and they are separated from lesser fans by a concrete moat. It has been a long time since sporting events were essentially communal experiences, and it’s no secret that the industry caters to the wealthy. But what struck me about the Legends experience, when I shelled out for a pair of seats one autumn Sunday, was something called the Harman Lounge. It’s a club within the Legends club, and there’s nothing particularly unique about it — just more gray suede couches, another bar and some TVs. The only thing that makes the Harman Lounge special is that it is restricted to fans sitting in the first row and only the first row. It exists solely to exclude fans who are not at the absolute top. I had gone to Yankee Stadium in search of what I call the Velvet Rope Economy, and in the Harman Lounge I found something like its apotheosis. Whatever the arena — health care, education, work, leisure — on one side of the velvet rope is a friction-free existence. Red tape is cut, appointments are secured, doors are opened. On the other side, friction is practically the defining characteristic, with middle- and working-class Americans facing an increasingly zero-sum fight for a decent seat on the plane, a college scholarship, even a doctor’s appointment. There has always been a gap between the haves and have-nots, but what was a tiered system in America is morphing into a caste system. As the rich get richer and more businesses focus exclusively on serving them, there is less attention and shabbier service for everybody who’s not at the pinnacle. [This article is adapted from Nelson D. Schwartz’s new book, “The Velvet Rope Economy: How Inequality Became Big Business,” published by Doubleday.] This trend doesn’t merely delight the wealthy — it also exacerbates the isolation and abandonment of everyone else. Anger and resentment are hardening into permanent features of our politics. President Trump regularly inveighs against the elite, and the Democratic front-runner, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, makes attacks on “millionaires and billionaires” a hallmark of his campaign. Consumer dissatisfaction is high despite low unemployment and steady hiring gains. Among the purveyors of elite experiences, however, business has never been better. The creation of products like Yankee Stadium’s Harman Lounge is driven by straightforward economics: As more money accumulates in fewer hands, attracting this contingent is essential if profits are to grow. “By definition, the 1 percent is always just 1 percent, but that group has gotten much wealthier and their purchasing power is bigger,” said Geoff Yang, a co-founder of Redpoint Ventures and one of Silicon Valley’s most successful venture capitalists. Meanwhile, ordinary experiences deteriorate in quality, and the motivation to pay more for an upgrade and better treatment becomes more urgent, even for Americans who don’t consider themselves part of the elite. The political and social repercussions go beyond symbolism — they have a real impact on government policies and fiscal priorities. For instance, when corporate decision makers, members of Congress and especially the political donor class routinely bypass traffic jams and deteriorating trains and buses and get to the airport via a luxury helicopter service like Blade, the political impetus to improve public transit fades. The ease of catching a commercial flight at the deluxe new private terminal at Los Angeles International Airport — the first of its kind in the country, with a $4,500 annual membership plus a $3,000 fee per trip — makes it that much easier for those who can afford it to forget about the decrepit main terminal, with its claustrophobic hallways and overcrowded waiting areas. Similarly, if wealthier consumers can hack the hospital game and see specialists before everyone else, or employ high-priced counselors to gain special access to the Ivy League, health care and education reform become much less pressing. Nowhere is the segmentation worse, or anger more evident, than up in the air. With nine different groups to board a plane, flying has explicitly become an exercise in class distinction. The frustration isn’t confined to rhetoric. A 2016 study on air rage by Katherine A. DeCelles of the University of Toronto and Michael I. Norton of Harvard Business School found a surprisingly robust link between onboard incidents and what they call “physical and situational inequality.” What the researchers discovered as they sifted through the data was remarkable. When passengers boarded at the front of the aircraft and had to walk through the premium cabin to get to coach, the odds of an outburst in economy doubled. Nor was the anger limited to the back of the plane. On those flights where coach passengers traipsed their way through first class upon boarding, unruly behavior among elite passengers was nearly 12 times as likely. The extremely rich don’t see even first-class fliers, let alone those in coach. Take Nick Hanauer, a Seattle entrepreneur worth hundreds of millions of dollars. As an early investor in Amazon, Mr. Hanauer gets around in his personal Dassault Falcon 900LX jet, which retails for $43 million. Money provides him with a kind of all-encompassing E-ZPass, enabling him to zip past the everyday obstacles the rest of us have to contend with. “This is my life — I see it everywhere,” Mr. Hanauer said. “I haven’t waited in a line in 10 years.” But for all his wealth, Mr. Hanauer said, he has a gnawing fear that the widening gulf between economic winners like himself and ordinary Americans is unsustainable. “If you’re not genuinely concerned about the future of the United States, you are not paying attention,” he said. In some cases, money can mean the difference between life and death. In California, private firefighters sent by insurers saved the vineyards and estates of a fortunate few during the recent spate of wildfires, even as neighboring homes were reduced to ashes. For $50,000, private health care consultants can steer cancer patients into potentially lifesaving clinical trials. The evidence of this trend isn’t merely anecdotal, either. The richest 1 percent of Americans live nearly 15 years longer on average than the poorest 1 percent, according to a 2016 study in JAMA. And that disparity is increasing. It’s getting impossible to imagine that we’re all in it together as a society. Because the hard truth is we’re not. On the other side of the velvet rope, millions of Americans are going about their daily lives, paying their taxes and trying to make ends meet, even as they wait longer to see a doctor or to get through security at the airport because richer Americans are jumping the line. “If this continues unabated, we’re done,” said Mr. Hanauer, who in 2013 started Civic Ventures, a think tank aimed at creating a more level playing field. “This won’t be a capitalist system — it’ll be a feudal system. You can’t shred the norms of reciprocity that make social cohesion possible and expect to have a functioning democracy. It’s just not going to work.” Updated Feb. 29, 2020",The New York Times
2020,When Jim Crow Reigned Amid the Rubble of Nazi Germany,"beyond The World War II WE Know Thousands of African-American troops were sent to a defeated Germany to promote democracy, even as they were confined to the social order of Jim Crow. In commemoration of Black History Month, the latest article from “Beyond the World War II We Know,” a series by The Times that documents lesser-known stories from World War II, focuses on the challenges of black troops stationed in Germany in the aftermath of the war. When Walter White, the head of the N.A.A.C.P. from 1931 to 1955, wrote a piece for the Chicago Defender in 1948 about a recent trip he had taken to Germany to report on black troops stationed there, he reflected on one particular question Germans had asked him about America: “How can you talk about German racism as long as you maintain separate white and black armies?” As a civil rights activist, White had posed that very question to the United States government time and again. And the answer he received repeatedly was frank: America functioned under Jim Crow and the military was no different. For the 1.2 million black men who served in a segregated army during World War II, efficiency and bravery on the battlefield didn’t lead to the social changes they had hoped for. The gulf between America’s ideals and its realities hit home particularly hard for one group: the thousands of black occupation troops sent to a defeated Germany to promote democracy. “The military was just as segregated as the Deep South,” said Richard Kingsberry, a retired Army lieutenant colonel who leads the National Association for Black Veterans, a veterans’ service organization. “They didn’t want blacks in leadership positions. They didn’t want blacks supervising other soldiers. They wanted to function as they did in the United States.” [Sign up for the At War newsletter for more about World War II.] It didn’t matter that African-American men had been essential to winning the war. A famed truck convoy called the Red Ball Express, made up of mostly black drivers, became invaluable to Gen. George S. Patton, delivering vital goods to Allied troops on the front lines in France. The all-black 761st Tank Battalion fought valiantly in the Battle of the Bulge. The famed Tuskegee airmen escorted U.S. bombers in Europe, engaging in air combat over Sicily, Italy and Germany. None of those heroic efforts by black troops, nor countless others, changed their second-class status during the war — or in its aftermath. The occupation years, 1945 to 1955, would expose a glaring hypocrisy perpetuated by the United States. Black occupation troops were part of the effort to prevent the resurgence of Nazism, yet for years were housed in segregated quarters, barred from officers’ clubs (regardless of their rank) and openly slurred, harassed and physically attacked by white American service members. The restrictions and abuse served to reinforce the military’s racial hierarchy and maintain the perception that Jim Crow laws remained in effect, even overseas. “It would cause trouble if black soldiers were in charge of occupying a white population,” said Maria Höhn, a professor at Vassar College and a co-author of the book “A Breath of Freedom: The Civil Rights Struggle, African American GIs, and Germany.” “If they were put in charge of guarding white German prisoners or running an office and having authority over white people, the military was concerned that would distort black soldiers’ perceptions of their own place in society.” When the Nazi regime surrendered on May 7, 1945, there were 1.6 million American troops in Germany. As the threat of Nazi uprisings dissipated, the United States withdrew a substantial number of its troops. By 1948, there were approximately 90,000 American occupation service members in Germany and 10,000 were black, according to Höhn’s book. But by 1951, as the Cold War was intensifying, the number of U.S. occupation troops rose to 250,000, with African-Americans making up 10 percent. The U.S. military was careful to keep that percentage as the cap so that the American military would be identified as overwhelmingly white. Discrimination toward black troops came not just from white soldiers but also the highest rungs of the military ladder, including commanders who expressed their resentment of black service members for being a part of the occupation, bitter that blacks were allowed to represent America during the occupation. As Höhn notes in her book, Gen. Joseph T. McNarney, the military governor of the American zone from 1945 to 1947, said that it would take 100 years before “the Negro will develop to the point where he will be on a parity with white Americans.” Unsurprisingly, no African-Americans served on his staff in Frankfurt, Höhn wrote. That was not unusual. “You had very few African-Americans in Heidelberg or Frankfurt or other big cities, because that’s where the intelligence and tactical units were, where policy was made and implemented,” Höhn said. Instead, a substantial number of black troops were stationed in the more rural regions: Hesse, Bavaria and later in the Rhineland-Palatinate, where the large training camps and bases were located. The majority of black troops were relegated to labor and service roles — loading and unloading supplies, transporting cargo and fuel, repairing army vehicles and roads and distributing food to hungry Germans, the last of which endeared them to local communities. They also performed in division orchestras, like the 427th Army Band, which played for special events and to boost troop morale. Although some black troops held the rank of officer, overseeing all-black platoons, very few rose above first or second lieutenant, said Höhn, and they were not immune to racist slights. Peter Grammer, who retired from the Army as a master sergeant, recalled when his father, Oscar Grammer, a chief warrant officer, was stationed in Mannheim in the early 1950s. “I was with my dad in the car and he drove on post where he worked,” he said, referencing the military base. “The sentry at the gate didn’t salute him.” And Lonnie G. Bunch III, secretary of the Smithsonian Institution and founding director of the National Museum of African-American History and Culture, remembered an account that his father, Lonnie G. Bunch Jr., had shared about his time as a corporal in the 1697th Engineer Combat Battalion in Kempten. “It was muddy and rainy, and a group of white engineers were billeted on top of a hill,” Bunch said. Down below in the valley, the black engineers were told to pitch their tents where the rain and mud accumulated. “I remember it must have really bothered my dad. He kept talking about how offended they were that their white counterparts didn’t have to wrestle in the mud as they did.” White American service members also took issue with how easily black G.I.s interacted with German civilians. There were no “whites only” signs in Germany, and blacks could freely frequent shops, restaurants, parks, beaches and local bars. In some towns, white soldiers threatened to boycott German businesses if they continued to serve black troops. And it wasn’t uncommon for white military police to take their batons to African-American G.I.s if they refused to leave an establishment. Though there were locals who clung to Nazi views on white supremacy, Germans largely embraced black culture. “The jazz, our dance, our music, our arts. The Germans were very receptive of that,” said Kingsberry, the National Association for Black Veterans commander. Black troops also had romantic relationships with German women, infuriating many white troops. Bunch said his father had told him about another incident when a white American officer walked a German woman in front of his unit and asked her to point out the man who had raped her. No one knew if the allegations were true or if the German woman had been pressured to do it, said Bunch. “It was a great fear. Suddenly, you could be picked out and court-martialed.” The indignities were well documented by the N.A.A.C.P. and the black press, and were used by the Soviet Union as a propaganda point during the early years of the Cold War: How could the United States promote free elections in Germany while it was mistreating its own citizens there, and making it harder for them to vote at home? In 1947, with mounting pressure to ease racial hostilities, Gen. Lucius D. Clay, who replaced Gen. McNarney as military governor of the American zone, ordered the creation of the 7800th Infantry Platoon — an honor guard of black troops based in Berlin — putting African-Americans in front of visiting dignitaries for the world to see. Stationed at Andrews Barracks, the former home of Hitler’s SS bodyguards, the soldiers were handpicked, “handsome men, all over six-feet,” wrote the American military governor of Berlin, Brig. Gen. Frank L. Howley, in his memoir of the occupation, “Berlin Command.” “They were excellently trained, smartly uniformed, and, when they appeared on parade, Russian propaganda about the sorry lot of the American Negro looked pretty silly.” The tactic may have helped improve perceptions of the United States, but it didn’t change the daily realities for black soldiers. “They knew they were being used,” said Höhn, who notes in her book that the G.I. service club in front of Clay’s Berlin headquarters did not permit black soldiers on the premises. Roi Ottley, an African-American war correspondent, wrote for several newspapers about black occupation troops and how their treatment undermined the political mission of the United States. “His writing illuminates the American paradox,” said Mark Huddle, a professor at Georgia College and State University and editor of “Roi Ottley’s World War II: The Lost Diary of an African American Journalist.” The process of re-educating Germans about a fair and free democratic society contradicted how America truly operated, Huddle said. “There were white troops that were probably almost as hateful towards black American soldiers as they were toward their German enemy.” Despite their treatment by white American service members, a number of black troops expressed their preference for life in Germany compared with back home. The percentage of black G.I.s extending their tours of duty in Germany was three times that of white G.I.s. A Chicago Defender article from June 1946 reported that 85 percent of black volunteer enlistments requested service in Europe, with the majority requesting assignments in Germany, as noted in Höhn’s book. A black soldier stationed in Germany reflected on his experience in the December 1945 issue of The New Republic. “You hear a lot of stuff about how homesick the overseas American soldier is for the good old USA,” he said. “But you don’t hear much of that from the Negro soldier. Not the ones in Europe. Anyway, not the ones I know, not the ones in the 41st Engineers. Hell, why should they be homesick? Homesick for Jim Crow, for poll taxes and segregated slums? Homesick for lynchings and race riots?” As time passed, the pressure to address the glaring mistreatment of African-American occupation troops continued to rise. “The black press and the N.A.A.C.P. were very tactical about this,” Höhn said. “They basically said to the American military leadership, ‘We’re making fools of ourselves over there, teaching the Germans democracy with a segregated army.’” With mounting pressure, President Truman formed a presidential committee on civil rights to address grievances of African-Americans. In December 1947, the committee — activists, and labor and religious leaders — released a report filled with sweeping social justice demands, including an integrated military. Knowing that Southern senators would reject most of the recommendations and facing a threat from civil rights activists who said they would encourage black and white youth to resist military service if the army remained segregated, Truman had to act. On July 26, 1948, he signed Executive Order 9981, desegregating the entire armed forces. It declared that “there shall be equality of treatment and opportunity for all persons in the armed services without regard to race, color, religion or national origin.” The order was met with resistance, and it was not until 1954 that the military was actually integrated. Still, the fight to move beyond menial jobs and receive top ranks in the armed forces would continue for African-Americans well into the Vietnam War. “Historically blacks have used the military as a way to prove they’re worthy of citizenship,” Bunch said. “I think even though they recognized the unfair treatment, they vowed to be the best they could because they knew that would, in their minds, be a way to open doors of possibility.” Alexis Clark is an adjunct professor at Columbia Journalism School and author of “Enemies in Love: A German POW, a Black Nurse and an Unlikely Romance.”",The New York Times
2020,When Moms Attack,"In “The Lodge” and “Swallow,” two would-be mothers terrify with willful anti-maternal actions. This article contains spoilers for “The Lodge.” Poisoning, verbal abuse, neglect, decapitation by piano wire: These are just a few of the sins committed by mothers in horror movies. Whether harming their children or raising monsters of their own, these women eschew maternal expectation so thoroughly as to harm humanity. The anti-mothering in movies like “Psycho,” “Carrie,” “Antichrist” and “Hereditary” is so blatant it borders on sacrilege — no accident, as each of these movies deals in zealotry as well as maternal abuse. “The Lodge” (now in theaters), from the “Goodnight Mommy” directors Veronika Franz and Severin Fiala, and “Swallow” (March 6), from Carlo Mirabella-Davis, present more complex takes on spurned motherhood. In both films, the central mother figures are unprepared for their new roles — what’s more, in a disturbing blow to the patriarchal nuclear family, these women are ambivalent about motherhood itself. But as the films’ many terrors unfold, it seems they were right to be reluctant. “The Lodge” centers on Grace (Riley Keough) and her soon-to-be stepchildren Mia (Lia McHugh) and Aiden (Jaeden Martell). The children are scarred by their mother’s recent suicide, partially driven by the revelation that her husband intends to marry his mistress, Grace. At the same time, Grace is recovering from her childhood in a Waco-meets-Heaven’s Gate death cult. Young and awkward, Grace does her best to win over her fiancé’s children. But Mia and Aiden, determined not to let this woman replace their mother, set out to exploit Grace’s trauma when the three are forced together for Christmas in their family vacation home. The results are gut-wrenching, as an addled Grace turns on her juvenile charges. Although one woman gets the most screen time, “The Lodge” is really about three mother figures: the children’s dead mom, the Virgin Mary (via a foreboding portrait in the dining room) and Grace. A martyr, a saint and — at least in the children’s eyes — a harlot. So go three popular sexist tropes, with mothers — stereotypically sexless figures — usually falling into martyrdom or sainthood. In horror movies, where social comforts are upended for maximum disturbance, this idealism curdles into (often literal) demonization. In the Lars von Trier movie “Antichrist,” the mother (Charlotte Gainsbourg) does not prevent her child’s fatal fall, portending her psychotic attempts to kill her husband in a forest called Eden. Ellen, the dead matriarch and closet occultist of Ari Aster’s “Hereditary,” invites a malevolent spirit to puppeteer her daughter and granddaughter, thus leading to the end of her entire family. Then there’s Margaret White, the mother of Carrie, and Norma Bates, the mother of Norman, two obsessive, sexually obsessed Christian parents who smother their children to a fault. As Sady Doyle writes in her book “Dead Blondes and Bad Mothers,” “At the heart of horror is a bad mother; the familiar and terrible vision of a woman corrupting the world, unleashing her own flaws upon it through her monstrous children.” “The Lodge” finds Grace struggling against a mother and father from her own past, in the form of the Virgin Mary and the priest who led her former cult (played, quite unsettlingly, by Riley Keough’s real-life father, Danny). But unlike other horror mothers, Grace’s upbringing does not make her fundamentally violent, nor does she instigate the violence between herself and the children. Instead, Aiden and Mia put Grace through grueling emotional and physical torture, hiding her food, belongings and psychiatric medication and playing tapes of her old priest until they eventually trigger her cult programming. There is no unending maternal love to save these three, as in horror films like “Bird Box” or “The Conjuring.” Instead, “The Lodge” implies what other horror films are usually too afraid to say: Motherhood, with all its sacrifice and crushing expectation, might not be worth it for everyone. That message is likely familiar to fans of “Rosemary’s Baby,” though the film’s protagonist eventually accepts the malevolent force that invades her home (and uterus). Recent takes on the reluctant or terrified mother include “The Babadook,” Jennifer Kent’s debut feature about a mother troubled both by her misbehaving son and a demonic force, “Prevenge,” Alice Lowe’s slasher about a pregnant woman whose fetus compels her to kill, and “Swallow,” about Hunter Conrad (Haley Bennett), a dutiful housewife who, once she learns she is pregnant, begins compulsively swallowing dangerous inanimate objects. Hunter appears to have a charmed life. Wide-eyed and bubbly, she spends her days homemaking and playing games on her cellphone. She was a retail worker who bagged a rich man. Bearing his child is just another privilege, like en suite bathrooms or the latest iPhone. Her pregnancy gifts her life with purpose. Still, she swallows a thumbtack well before her second trimester. Determined to produce an heir, her domineering in-laws shuttle her off to therapy to uproot the compulsion. There, placidly smiling, she reveals a family trauma that disassembles any preconceived notions about the film’s relationship to gender, motherhood or even Hunter herself. She’s no twit, and her destructive behavior — inspired by that of Mirabella-Davis’s own grandmother, who was lobotomized for a hand-washing compulsion — becomes a savvy and tragic bid to retain her selfhood. What little independence she has as a wife can be distilled into the moments she steals to swallow objects, her private world as small as the tray on which she places a marble, an earring, a battery. “The Lodge” and “Swallow” are so effectively disturbing because there are few Freudian terrors more primal than that of the mother figure who turns on her children, or the woman who violently rejects the very idea of maternity. Grace and Hunter are not demons but martyrs, sacrificed to the feminine ideal of motherhood despite their independent desires. The disobedient mother is a horror trope because, as an idealized figure, she has so far to fall, and so many means by which to do so. In comedies like “Bad Moms,” unruly mothers use cursing and alcohol. In chillers like “The Lodge” and “Swallow,” they guzzle safety pins and play Russian roulette.",The New York Times
2020,Opinion | When Pharmacists Make Drug Errors,"letters The American Pharmacists Association says we need to look at how pharmacies are reimbursed and who profits. Also: The folly of environmental deregulation; the poor and the cashless society. To the Editor: The mistakes described in “Overloaded Pharmacists Warn They’re Making Fatal Mistakes” (front page, Feb. 1) keep me up at night. Even one medication error is too many. Unfortunately, the current system sets pharmacists up to fail. The weight of the potentially dire consequences of filling the wrong prescription or missing dangerous drug interactions is crushing pharmacists, personally and professionally. The solution comes from taking a hard look at how pharmacies are reimbursed and who profits from inadequate patient care. Pharmacy benefit managers make piles of money with no proof they serve patients. They say they keep prices and premiums down but fight efforts to demystify how they achieve this. If it’s not greedy, let’s see how it works. If it really helps patients, tell us how. But they won’t. It’s indefensible. Patient safety must always remain a priority. We need change now. Thomas E. MenighanWashingtonThe writer is chief executive of the American Pharmacists Association. To the Editor: Re “The Triumph of Fiscal Hypocrisy” (column, Feb. 7): Paul Krugman explains how the Republicans have gained political advantage by blocking fiscal stimulus when it was badly needed during the Great Recession, then supporting profligate stimulus policies well after the economy had recovered. Add to this fiscal folly the rollback of environmental regulations, even as we are facing a climate crisis of enormous economic consequence. Yes, the deregulation has likely added some small percentage of short-term G.D.P. growth. But it comes at a potentially staggering cost to future generations, as methane regulations and fuel economy standards are reversed, and critical support for an international climate response is withheld. What’s left of the Republican reputation for competent fiscal stewardship has now gone up in flames. Ken SwensenRedding, Conn. To the Editor: Re “Cashless Businesses? City Council Says No” (news article, Jan. 24): It is disheartening to see the New York City Council follow the lead of Philadelphia and San Francisco in banning cashless retail establishments. This measure only attacks a symptom of discrimination, not the root cause. Far too many people lack access to the banking system, which studies show is essential to improving their income-earning ability over time. So why not give banks more incentives to serve low-income people? For example, Congress could change the Community Reinvestment Act to incentivize banks to issue debit cards, without overdraft provisions. Instead of fighting against the digital economy, government leaders should be doing more to ensure that their residents can participate in it. Fred P.

2020,Opinion | When White Women Wanted a Monument to Black ‘Mammies’,"A 1923 fight shows Confederate monuments are about power, not Southern heritage. Dr. Parker is a history professor at the University of Delaware. In 1923, a group of white women wanted to build what they called a “monument to the faithful colored mammies” in Washington. These women, members of the United Daughters of the Confederacy, pressed lawmakers in Congress to introduce a bill. The Senate passed it, but the bill stalled in the House after fierce opposition from black women, including Mary Church Terrell and Hallie Quinn Brown, members of the National Association of Colored Women. The fight over a proposed monument to black “mammies” exposes the lie of those who describe Confederate monuments as innocuous celebrations of Southern heritage. Lost Cause memorials are hurtful public symbols of white supremacy. Consider that most Confederate monuments were not erected by grieving widows or relatives immediately after the Civil War. A majority were put up in the 1890s and early 1900s by Southern whites hoping to justify the spread of Jim Crow while erasing the legacy of Reconstruction, a time when African-Americans had gained citizenship and voting rights. There are now more than 1,740 Confederate monuments, statues, flags, place names and other symbols in public spaces across the country, not counting more than 2,600 markers, battlefields, museums and cemeteries that commemorate the Confederate dead or the many hundreds of statues of staunch segregationists. To date, only about 115 have been removed. In stark contrast, fewer than 100 monuments pay tribute to the civil rights movement. Southern white women in organizations like the United Daughters of the Confederacy, founded in 1894, raised funds to build many of the Confederate memorials and placed “loyal slave” plaques nearby. These celebrations of the “loyalty” of formerly enslaved people implied they had been happier in subordination, were still unequal and so should be segregated and treated as inferiors. In addition to the plaques, many formal monuments to “faithful slaves” were proposed; three were built, including the Faithful Slave Monument in Fort Mill, S.C., in 1895. The United Daughters of the Confederacy’s most successful attempt at memorializing slavery at the national level happened during the presidency of Woodrow Wilson, who institutionalized segregation in the federal government. In 1914, the organization championed the Confederate Monument at Arlington National Cemetery, which features panels depicting “loyal” slaves and a “mammy” figure with two white children in tow. Whites’ affection for “colored mammies” glossed over the violence and pain inflicted upon enslaved women who had their families torn apart. But African-American clubwomen and reformers did not accept the “mammy” stereotype. Many were the daughters and granddaughters of enslaved women who had been forced to work as caretakers of other women’s children. They quickly mobilized and led their African-American allies in the N.A.A.C.P. and the black press in the fight against the proposed monument through letters to editors. Their defiant resistance made white Americans take notice. The civil rights and feminist activist Mary Church Terrell wrote a widely reproduced editorial in The Evening Star, a white Washington newspaper. Indicting the Southern white women who proposed the monument, Terrell’s scathing critique called out their past and current complicity in the sexual abuse of black women by white men: “When one considers the extent to which the black ‘Mammy’ was the victim of the passion and power of her master or any other white man who might look with lustful eyes upon her,” she wrote, it’s difficult to understand how “the wives, mothers and sisters of slave owners could have submitted without frequent and vigorous protests to such degradation of the womanhood of any race.” She added, “And it is harder to understand why their descendants should want to behold a perpetual reminder of the heart-rending conditions under which Black Mammies were obliged to live.” Terrell asked her readers to view enslaved black women as three-dimensional human beings who were psychologically tormented by the prospect of having their children sold. Being forced to care for white children also came at the price of not taking care of their own children. Cutting to the heart of the myth of the nonproblematic love whites imagined they had given to and received from enslaved women, Terrell condemned these monuments as actively rewriting the history of slavery. Asserting the authority of the black community to define and value itself, she vowed that black women would do everything they could to resist the building of the monument. Monuments can either work to dismantle white supremacy, as does the stunning new memorial to victims of lynchings in Montgomery, Ala., or they can perpetuate it. The symbols of white supremacy have no business in our public spaces. Alison M.

2020,Clicking Buy on Amazon? It’s Trying to Prevent a Coronavirus Caveat,"The Everything Store, which stocks more than 100 million items, is working to avoid disruptions in its supply chain. Get an informed guide to the global outbreak with our daily Coronavirus
 newsletter.
 SEATTLE — What if the Everything Store couldn’t sell everything because of disruptions from the coronavirus? That’s the situation that Amazon — which typically stocks more than 100 million items, from toilet paper to yoga pants — is working to avoid as the deadly outbreak continues to shut down and slow factories in China that produce the world’s goods. Over the past few weeks, Amazon has responded to the crisis by making larger and more frequent orders of Chinese-made products that had already been shipped to the United States, according to company emails and consultants who work with major brands. Some of its suppliers have cut back on advertising and promotions on the site so they don’t run out of products too quickly. Amazon also sent an urgent email to brands on Wednesday about Prime Day, its midsummer mega sale, indicating that it has begun worrying about inventory for the event. And the company has contacted some of its third-party merchants, whose dog leashes, crayons and other products account for about 60 percent of its sales, to figure out how their flow of goods might be impeded. “Hello!” read one recent email from Amazon to a seller, which The New York Times reviewed. “We have identified that part of your supply chain process might be China dependent and in light of the coronavirus outbreak effecting manufacturing and logistics in China, we are reaching out to you to understand its impact on your business operations.” With its reliance on Chinese manufacturing, Amazon is turning into a case study of how a giant retailer grapples with the fallout from the coronavirus and what may lie ahead for other stores. Already dozens of companies have indicated that the virus will take a toll on them, with Apple cutting its sales expectations this week and airlines canceling flights to China. Retailers have so far said less about how the coronavirus will affect them. On Tuesday, Walmart said sales at its 430 stores in China had not faltered and added that the impact on its supply chain was unclear but might be more muted than at other companies. Updated Feb. 26, 2020 Last year’s trade war with China may inadvertently be helping some big retailers now. At the time, companies imported more goods than usual from China to get ahead of expected tariffs. Some moved manufacturing to Vietnam and other Asian countries. When the new tariffs never took effect, retailers were left with more supply and more sourcing from other countries already in place. Still, if China Inc. continues to be fitful beyond the next few weeks, major stores could run out of everyday products like sponges, print cartridges and construction paper by mid-April, according to a report from Wells Fargo last week. China is the largest source of imported consumer goods. “We believe the time to start worrying about the supply chain risk” of the virus “is here,” the report said. Amazon is likely to feel potential shortages of goods earlier than its American peers because it usually keeps fewer items on hand than they do. In good times, that lets the internet company run more efficiently because it does not tie up money to buy and store products that are waiting to be sold. But that approach, called “lean inventory,” exposes Amazon more to shocks. “This is a cost to pay for the efficiency that a just-in-time supply chain gets you,” said Guru Hariharan, a former Amazon employee and the founder of CommerceIQ, a start-up whose automation tools are used by major brands including Kimberly-Clark and Logitech. Some supply problems may be hidden. Even products made in America can rely on Chinese suppliers, which may cause problems down the line. Ketchup made in a plant in Sacramento, for example, may depend on tomato paste or bottles and caps from China. Amazon faces an additional wrinkle in keeping its virtual shelves stocked: While traditional retailers generally control their inventory directly, most of the products on Amazon are bought and sold by third-party merchants. Amazon simply facilitates those sales, giving it less visibility into supply. “Out of an abundance of caution, we are working with suppliers to secure additional inventory to ensure we maintain our selection for customers,” an Amazon spokeswoman said. The company later added, “We are monitoring developments related to the coronavirus and taking appropriate steps as needed.” Amazon’s algorithms have now asked for six to eight weeks of supply on products made in China instead of just two or three weeks, said Mr. Hariharan, who discussed the changes with large brands that supply the retailer. Amazon has also made larger and more frequent buys, deviating from its regular cadence of automated purchases, according to company emails and consultants. “Amazon issued off-cycle orders to you last night in order to prepare for possible supply chain disruptions due to recent global events originating in China,” one recent email to a vendor read. Similar emails were earlier reported by Business Insider. Fahim Naim, who managed inventory at Amazon and now advises brands selling there, said it had placed extra orders from his clients who have more than $10 million in annual sales on the site and had marked “China” as the source of their products. Amazon’s emails to his clients show that it is giving brands extra time to get their products to its warehouses without a penalty. On Feb. 7, the main Amazon website that sellers use to run their business posted a message that included tips for making sure Amazon’s algorithms didn’t ding their accounts if they couldn’t fulfill orders. Jerry Kavesh, who offers Western wear like $85 cowboy boots on Amazon, is emblematic of the supply issues that its sellers face. Mr. Kavesh, 57, who is based in a Seattle suburb, said that the factory in China that produced his cowboy hats was closed and that he did not know when it would reopen. Even after the factory’s workers return, the facility needs wool from its Chinese suppliers to make the hats. “The key component — they don’t know when they are going to get that,” he said. It takes about four months for his orders to be made and to arrive in the United States, Mr. Kavesh added. That means he typically would have products already in process for Prime Day, Amazon’s two-day shopping deal extravaganza, which usually falls in early July. Amazon appears to share the concern. On Wednesday, it sent an email to a beauty supplies brand asking whether it expected to have enough of its top five products this summer. “Amazon is trying to establish an inventory risk for your business moving forward and specifically for Prime Day,” said the email, which The Times reviewed. “We appreciate your feedback by TODAY.” Mr. Naim said some brands he worked with had pulled back on their ads on Amazon by 25 percent to 50 percent, and had stopped promotions they had planned, to preserve money and inventory. Other sellers said they were contemplating whether to raise prices to prevent — or at least delay — running out of stock. Eddie Levine, who has been selling on Amazon since 2012, shipped more than 130 containers of toys, housewares and other goods from China last year, largely to offer on the site. He has cautioned the brands he works with against raising prices, saying that if a $20 product suddenly costs $40, “the last thing you want is a bad review saying it’s not worth $40.” But if the virus disruptions persist into late spring or early summer, “people will have to raise prices without even having the option because there is just no stock,” Mr. Levine said. “That’s pure supply and demand.” Karen Weise reported from Seattle, and Michael Corkery from New York.",The New York Times
2020,"When a Ballet Director Was Fired, Dance Stars Rallied. Or Did They?","In a letter, top choreographers appeared to threaten a French company that fired its artistic director over his treatment of a dancer who had recently given birth. But some big names say they never signed it. Some of the dance world’s biggest names threatened to withdraw work from the repertoire of the Lyon Opera Ballet — a major French company — this week unless it reinstated its former artistic director. “This is with a heavy heart,” they wrote in an open letter published in Libération, a major newspaper in France. But, they added, they saw “no other solutions.” Yorgos Loukos, the Lyon company’s artistic director since 1991, was fired this month after a French court found him guilty of discriminating against a dancer. Mr. Loukos had refused to give the dancer a contract when she returned from maternity leave. The Lyon Opera Ballet’s decision to fire him was “incomprehensible and arbitrary,” said the letter, which called on the French government to intervene. The letter — in which stars appeared to hold a company to ransom — contained the signatures of around 100 people, including Benjamin Millepied, William Forsythe, and the European choreographers Jiri Kylian and Mats Ek. Sylvie Guillem, the French ballet star who retired in 2015, was listed as a signatory, as was the actress Isabelle Huppert. But when The New York Times contacted some of the letter’s signees for comment, several disavowed it. “I was asked to sign, but declined, because the letter spoke to internal matters of the theater of which I have no direct experience or knowledge, and I do not agree with the coercive tactics,” Mr. Forsythe said in an email. “We’re all sad for Yorgos,” Mr. Millepied said in a telephone interview, but he said he had never put his name to the letter. “I don’t know enough to,” he said. Didier Deschamps, the director of France’s National Theater of Dance in Paris, said in a telephone interview that he had wanted to show his support for Mr. Loukos, but had asked for the threat of withdrawing work to be removed. Brigitte Lefèvre, the director of the Festival of Dance in Cannes, France also said through a spokeswoman that she had not signed the letter. So what happened? Mr. Loukos’s work in Lyon has been much admired in the dance world. It “has long had an exceptionally ambitious and diverse repertory,” Roslyn Sulcas wrote in The Times in 2016. The following year, Alastair Macaulay, then The Times’s chief dance critic, named one of the company’s productions among the best of the year. The current saga goes back to 2014, when Karline Marion, a then-34-year-old dancer, returned from maternity leave. Two days later, she received a letter saying that she would not receive a new contract. Ms. Marion recorded a conversation with Mr. Loukos — later released by Mediacities, a French news website — in which he said that she had “done quite a bit” during her five years at the company, but that her best years were behind her. “Especially with a child,” he added, before telling the dancer to “stay in Lyon, go to the gym and look after your stuff.” In 2017, a French court ruled that Mr. Loukos had discriminated against the dancer. Last December, an appeals court confirmed parts of the decision. The Lyon Opera Ballet said in an statement that it had then conducted an internal investigation that “revealed evidence that could be qualified as moral harassment” by Mr. Loukos. The company fired him six months before he was due to retire. The open letter to Libération was written by Maguy Marin, a French choreographer, with the aid of Ariane Mnouchkine, a theater director. A spokeswoman for Ms. Marin declined to answer further questions in an email on Wednesday and did not respond to requests on Thursday to explain why the names of people who said they had disavowed the letter, or who had reservations about it, appeared in the published version. On Thursday, Libération published an apology to its readers that included a comment from Ms. Marin and Ms. Mnouchkine, and an explanation as to how Mr. Forsythe and Mr. Millepied’s names were added to the letter. They said Mr. Forsythe had offered his support to Mr. Loukos in a telephone call, which was misinterpreted as an agreement to sign the letter. But the pair did not apologize for Mr. Millepied’s inclusion. “Regarding the signature of Benjamin Millepied,” they said, “we received an email on Feb. 12 sent from his cellphone with the subject: ‘I agree to sign the letter for Yorgos.’” The Times has seen a screenshot of this email, but not the full exchange. “There seems to have been some unfortunate miscommunication about this situation,” Mr. Millepied said in an email on Thursday. “The bottom line is that I was ultimately asked to sign and return the final version of the letter directly to the people in charge of organizing it,” he said. “I did not do so, because I did not agree with the content of the letter and the position they took.” Some signees of the letter said they understood Mr. Loukos’s decision not to renew the dancer’s contract. “I know enough to say Loukos has great respect for the dancers in his company, even the ones who have babies,” Mr. Deschamps said. He said Mr. Loukos had not renewed Ms. Marion’s contract because she wasn’t a skilled enough dancer. “A director has to maintain the level of the company,” Mr. Deschamps said, though he added that Mr. Loukos “was wrong to say what he did to her.” Mats Ek, the choreographer, said his intention in signing the letter had been to protest Mr. Loukos’s firing. He said he had not meant to send a message to young dancers that their complaints would not be listened to. Mr. Ek said that artistic directors hired and let go of dancers for artistic reasons, and that this was a specific case. “Of course dancers can be bullied and abused and harassed, and should speak,” Mr. Ek said. “But from my point of view, Loukos has been harassed by the theater.”",The New York Times
2020,When a Critic Hosts the Premiere,"All assumptions about classical music are in question when the performance is at your apartment. “Please silence your cellphones.” There are few phrases I hear more often in my life as a music critic. But it was strange — like a child playing dress-up — to speak the sentence myself, and in the incongruous setting of my own living room on a rainy evening earlier this week. A few months ago, I got an email from the publicist for Michael Gordon, one of the Bang on a Can trio of composers who, since the 1980s, have infused into classical styles a wry and rebellious rock sensibility. She said that Mr. Gordon, celebrated for his stylishly aggressive treatment of acoustic instruments, had written a piece called “House Music,” an hourlong solo cello work with a single requirement: It had to be played in a domestic space, not a concert hall. Did I want to present the New York premiere at my apartment in Brooklyn? I’ll admit it was an appealing prospect. For someone who’s never grown quite used to my late-night subway journey home after an opera, it was hard to turn down a performance that would take place a few steps from bed. So 20 friends showed up on Monday just before 8 p.m., drank a little wine, and gathered close around Ashley Bathgate, a cellist closely associated with the Bang on a Can circle. The music was less than two years old, but the spirit was retro. Before the rise of the urban bourgeoisie and then recordings, and the concomitant decline of amateur performance, this was how music lived: in homes, in front of small groups. No stage, no dimmed lights, nowhere to hide for anyone. The practice hasn’t died out completely. The company Groupmuse has made a specialty of providing small ensembles that arrive at your place to play Mozart or Brahms. And people who fund artists often host them, too: I once heard a quartet by Andrew Norman in the Dumbo loft of new-music patrons. But “House Music,” conceived for this and only this situation, particularly calls into question the conventions of place and etiquette that classical music largely takes for granted. For me, who hadn’t played impresario since putting on nursery-school puppet shows for my parents, it brought up the logistical, ethical, even emotional demands that arise from presenting while writing. (Throwing a party always provokes anxiety, doesn’t it?) Like any journalist, but even more so, critics balance learning about their subjects with remaining well apart from them. It’s a profession that thrives on a kind of passionate distance. It can be hard enough to feel comfortable reviewing an artist after an interview on neutral ground. So to let one into my home? And would I, someone asked a few days before the big night, pay Ms. Bathgate? I was embarrassed that the question hadn’t even occurred to me. With complimentary press tickets a given, a critic’s existence is almost entirely free of financial transactions. The performer and I both just show up; this magical ease elides the reality that each of our activities translates to real currency for the other. Ms. Bathgate is a freelancer; for years, I was one, too, making decisions about gigs based on a rough calculus of money, exposure and artistic fulfillment. She — and Mr. Gordon, with whom she’s agreed to split fees for “House Music” — would likely ask thousands of dollars from a random person interested in hosting. But she said that on this occasion she’d be willing to perform the piece, which she was eager to play and eager for people to learn about, without charge. After consulting my editors, I offered an honorarium of a few hundred dollars, less than her time and talent deserved, but symbolic of what “House Music” came to mean for me: a reminder of dynamics in my job that I’m often able and willing to forget. This went for the experience of listening, too. Concert-going is usually the easy comfort of disappearing into the dark. At Carnegie Hall or Lincoln Center, critics are just like everyone else in the audience: empowered by anonymity, as harsh light shines on the vulnerable artist. Not so much in my living room. I had planned to place Ms. Bathgate in a spot that would spread my friends throughout my apartment, letting restless people wander a little. But she gently corrected me; she wanted to have everyone almost literally within reach. Of course, she was right. My arrangement, I realized, had aimed to spare myself and the rest of my little audience the full exposure demanded by “House Music.” It’s not always pleasant. Accounts of Groupmuse events that I’ve read tend to focus on how much more comfortable they are than traditional concerts. But I was surprised to feel so awkward sitting on my own couch: the setting familiar, yet not for this purpose, and the behavior imported from another context. (It was still a tiny cataclysm when someone dropped a cup during a soft passage.) To be two or three feet from the performer, the listeners in full view of one another, makes far more explicit than usual what is tacit in a concert hall: The audience is performing, too, both accepting and feeding energy, watched as it watches. The unshakable sense that I owned this performance — the way people own paintings and hang them in their homes — prevented me from reviewing it, in my usual sense. It had become part of my furniture; it was, I couldn’t help but feel, mine. But I can describe it, and its effect on me. “House Music” is divided into eight sections, and Ms. Bathgate wisely spoke briefly before each. (Given the intensity of the surroundings, a collection of separate pieces felt very different than an unbroken 60-minute span would have.) In true Gordon style, the music tends violently percussive and extreme, relentless in its industrial repetitions, but with stark exceptions: a section of glassy harmonics, another of keening, drooping melancholy gestures. By the end, Ms. Bathgate was practically sawing at a string while twisting the cello’s peg and painfully contorting its pitch, the classical equivalent of smashing a guitar against the stage. Yet I was most shocked, almost to tears, by the far more restrained fourth piece. Ms. Bathgate, playing soft double stops, suddenly began to quietly sing the doleful words of Emily Dickinson’s poem “I felt a Funeral, in my Brain” in an ethereal voice, unhurriedly rising to a intimately piercing wail. While I’m often delighted during performances, and I don’t infrequently get goose bumps and shivers, true musical surprises are few and far between. Would this song have had the same impact had I been sitting 50 feet away, with a few hundred strangers? Not a chance.",The New York Times
2020,"When a Friend Is in Need, Show You Care With Food","Wirecutter If you want to give someone a food gift to show you care, consider cooking for them, ordering a gift basket or delivery, or organizing a meal train. Ms. Perling is a staff writer at Wirecutter, a product recommendation site owned by The New York Times Company. Like it is with many cooks, food is my mother’s love language. As a child, I watched her make meals for people as they celebrated births, pushed through cancer, moved, or mourned, packing a pop-up basket with aluminum pans and zip-top bags. The dishes inside were always carefully calibrated to the recipient. Sometimes it was black beans and rice with gazpacho for a vegetarian friend, or simply roasted chicken and potatoes for a neighbor with colitis. Often it was a traditional Jewish comfort dish, like brisket or matzo ball soup, that she knew our family craved. Food can’t solve every problem. But delivering a homemade dish or edible gift to someone’s door is a concrete response to the sometimes hard-to-answer question of “What can I do to help?” In our digital age of apps and near-instant delivery services, there are many creative ways in which you can nourish people and make sure you’re giving them something they actually want. And if you’re the one who needs nourishing, you can suggest these same ideas to those close to you. Either way, here’s how to show you care with food. If you’re cooking for other people, consider their needs first — even if you’re a seasoned cook who loves to experiment. Emily Weinstein, deputy food editor for The New York Times and editor of NYT Cooking, suggests putting yourself in the recipient’s shoes. “Ask yourself, ‘What’s the brief, what’s the need? And how can I meet it?’” Ms. Weinstein said. She recommends making comfort foods with a twist, like lasagna, meatballs, chili, or lentil soup, all of which freeze and reheat well. Margaux Laskey, senior staff editor at NYT Cooking, said casseroles, meatloaf, quick breads, drop cookies, and cakes are also great ideas. Of course, consider potential food allergies as well as dietary or religious restrictions. But also ask about special circumstances and space limits. You can cook a large-batch meal or portion foods individually using zip-top bags, containers, wax paper, or foil, letting people reheat small amounts when they’re hungry. Clearly labeling instructions, delivering meals that are already hot, and bringing premade add-ons like salad dressing can help streamline preparing and serving, especially when your recipient isn’t thinking about cooking. Both Ms. Weinstein and Ms. Laskey recommend labeling your containers if you want them back. If you’re freezing dishes, do your best to remove air and wrap them tightly with freezer-weight packaging. (Wirecutter recommends glass Pyrex containers, plastic Snapware, or Rubbermaid TakeAlongs for food storage.) Elizabeth Andress, food safety specialist and professor at the University of Georgia, said freezer-specific packaging really does make a difference in preventing freezer burn. For ingredient-specific freezing advice, she recommends consulting the guidelines from the National Center for Home Food Preservation. You might also consider making something surprising and delightful that goes beyond basic sustenance. Laskey’s go-to gift for new parents is a batch of frozen cookie dough, wrapped in individual servings so they can bake just a few cookies at a time. It doesn’t matter if you’re not an experienced cook, said Ms. Weinstein. “I really can’t emphasize this enough,” she said. “It’s just that you took the moment to think of somebody.” Bringing something you didn’t make yourself, like a bag of granola, an excellent hot sauce, or a rotisserie chicken from your local grocery store, is still appreciated. Perhaps you aren’t the only person looking to help your friend or loved one. In that case, you can organize a meal train — a group of people who agree to feed someone on different days or during particular weeks — to avoid duplicate dishes or an overloaded fridge. Wirecutter recommends MealTrain.com, a dedicated crowdsourcing platform that makes coordinating drop-offs and specific meals easier. (A spreadsheet, email chain, or other sign-up website can work too). Mealtrain.com builds an interactive calendar and lets you customize the number of recipients, as well as their meal preferences and allergies. The same rules apply to a meal train: Think about the recipient’s needs, inquire about available space, and label your containers if you want them back. Whether your friend or loved one is sick, in mourning, or freshly moved into a new home, getting an edible treat in the mail is a welcome break from the usual bills and circulars. Wirecutter has recommendations for gift baskets that go beyond bland fruit-and-nut assortments. Before you buy, consider any dietary constraints, how long the items might last, and how many people the gift is for. For example, a sampler of Jeni’s ice cream keeps well in the freezer, whereas a Jasper Hill Farms cheese basket offers a nosh for visitors but won’t hold up longer than a few weeks. You can also send over tea or coffee for a much-needed caffeine boost. On-the-go options, like instant coffee or tea, may be better for people who are working, traveling, or camping out at a hospital. (We like Mount Hagen Organic Single Serve Instant Coffee.) If you know your recipients are staying home, you can pair loose-leaf tea with a fine-meshed steeper or send over a box of great coffee. Wirecutter stocks Harney & Sons teas in our test kitchen and recommends the Finum Brewing Basket for steeping. Sometimes the best gift is giving people exactly what they want, when they want it. You can purchase gift cards for food delivery services like GrubHub and Uber Eats or pick one up from a local restaurant. That way, people can get takeout on their own time frame. Alternatively, you can place an order yourself so that it arrives at their door at just the right time. If people can still cook but aren’t able to shop for themselves, you could also ask for their grocery list and send them what they need through a delivery service like Instacart or FreshDirect. Another creative idea is a gift card for a meal kit service: Wirecutter recommends Blue Apron, which offers approachable recipes for beginners and provides all necessary ingredients except for salt, pepper, and oil. (It has vegetarian options too.) Again, you don’t want your gift to make things more difficult, so check in with your friend or family member beforehand to find out whether they’re really up for cooking. If you’re going through a tough time of your own and people are pestering you about how they can help, offer up these ideas yourself. Don’t be afraid of breaking a taboo by asking for what you want or need. You’re giving people a purpose and can return the favor later on.

2020,"When a Mentor Said Tear Down Your Collection and Start Over, They Did","Show Us Your Wall Would you make a purchase based solely on a JPEG from an artist’s Instagram page? No problem. LOS ANGELES — Many contemporary art collectors have an adviser. Arthur Lewis is lucky enough to have a mentor, instead. A decade ago, Mr. Lewis, then a merchandising executive at the Gap, and his partner, Hau Nguyen, who owns hair salons, invited the collector Joy Simmons to their home here, where they had art by popular provocateurs like Jeff Koons and Paul McCarthy. She was not impressed. “Joy told us we have to take everything off our walls and start all over again,” Mr. Lewis said. “She said we have an opportunity to make some impact by collecting artists who are not getting their moment to shine, artists in our own community.” “I’m really grateful for what she said,” he added. “It helped us discover our passion as collectors: artists who tell stories that we understand personally as two people of color.” Now, they own a range of work by emerging black artists and those already in demand, like Amy Sherald (who painted Michelle Obama’s portrait in 2018) and Kerry James Marshall (whose work set an auction record that year for living black artists). There’s also a strong Los Angeles contingent, including Lauren Halsey, Genevieve Gaignard and Diedrick Brackens. In 2012 the couple renovated their Italianate home to create more space, and more walls, for art. Last year, Mr. Lewis turned his avocation into a vocation, taking a job at United Talent Agency, overseeing the division representing visual artists in entertainment and licensing deals. This team also runs an unconventional gallery, UTA Artist Space. It has a show of fiery figurative paintings by Arcmanoro Niles opening Feb. 12, in time for Frieze Los Angeles. These are edited excerpts from a conversation with Mr. Lewis. Which artists have you developed relationships with? We know many of the artists really well. Collecting is so personal for us. It’s our pillow talk, our down time. We like to go deep and collect their full narrative, like we did with Jennie C. Jones, who tends to work with and around sound and music. We met her many years ago, and I think we’ve collected a work from Jennie every year since then. It was not just getting to know her work but getting to know her, so she’s family now. The collecting category of “black artists” has become very strong lately — some would say trendy. Is this a good thing? I’m so excited that these geniuses are being recognized for their enormous talent. As long as sustainable careers are being created for these artists, I think it’s a very good thing. When I have caution is when a frenzy occurs around certain artists at certain moments. I watched what just happened at Art Basel in Miami with Amoako Boafo: The Rubells made him their artist in residence at their new museum and Mariane Ibrahim [a Chicago gallerist] gave him a solo booth at the fair, and my phone goes nuts. Collectors who know I own his work are calling me, asking: Is there anything left? Which artwork in your home is the biggest conversation starter? When you walk in, the first thing you see is Titus Kaphar’s “Enough About You,” based on a painting owned by Yale. In the original painting, this young black boy was shown in shackles, subservient to the university benefactors. So Titus recreated the narrative in a painting that was even larger, 10 by 10 feet, but he crumpled the part of the canvas with the men to make the little boy the hero. His ability to reposition a story is something I find extraordinary. In your retail career you’re known for building brands. Do visual artists today need to think about that as well? Yes, and I think they are all brand-masters. Mickalene Thomas’s rhinestones are part of these beautiful settings that she puts forward, and Genevieve Gaignard’s ability to make the everyday object seem extraordinary is part of the brand she’s built. And I love the way that Instagram has changed the art world, with an artist curating their page, their brand, their identity on social media, so that you get what their work is. Do you ever buy a work by JPEG without seeing it in person? All the time. Once we know the artist, we’re usually pretty good to go off a JPEG. It hasn’t failed us yet.",The New York Times
2020,Opinion | When a Pandemic Meets a Personality Cult,"The Trump team confirms all of our worst fears. Opinion Columnist So, here’s the response of the Trump team and its allies to the coronavirus, at least so far: It’s actually good for America. Also, it’s a hoax perpetrated by the news media and the Democrats. Besides, it’s no big deal, and people should buy stocks. Anyway, we’ll get it all under control under the leadership of a man who doesn’t believe in science. From the day Donald Trump was elected, some of us worried how his administration would deal with a crisis not of its own making. Remarkably, we’ve gone three years without finding out: Until now, every serious problem facing the Trump administration, from trade wars to confrontation with Iran, has been self-created. But the coronavirus is looking as if it might be the test we’ve been fearing. And the results aren’t looking good. The story of the Trump pandemic response actually began several years ago. Almost as soon as he took office, Trump began cutting funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, leading in turn to an 80 percent cut in the resources the agency devotes to global disease outbreaks. Trump also shut down the entire global-health-security unit of the National Security Council. Experts warned that these moves were exposing America to severe risks. “We’ll leave the field open to microbes,” declared Tom Frieden, a much-admired former head of the C.D.C., more than two years ago. But the Trump administration has a preconceived notion about where national security threats come from — basically, scary brown people — and is hostile to science in general. So we entered the current crisis in an already weakened condition. And the microbes came. The first reaction of the Trumpers was to see the coronavirus as a Chinese problem — and to see whatever is bad for China as being good for us. Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, cheered it on as a development that would “accelerate the return of jobs to North America.” The story changed once it became clear that the virus was spreading well beyond China. At that point it became a hoax perpetrated by the news media. Rush Limbaugh weighed in: “It looks like the coronavirus is being weaponized as yet another element to bring down Donald Trump. Now, I want to tell you the truth about the coronavirus. … The coronavirus is the common cold, folks.” Limbaugh was, you may not be surprised to hear, projecting. Back in 2014 right-wing politicians and media did indeed try to politically weaponize a disease outbreak, the Ebola virus, with Trump himself responsible for more than 100 tweets denouncing the Obama administration’s response (which was actually competent and effective). And in case you’re wondering, no, the coronavirus isn’t like the common cold. In fact, early indications are that the virus may be as lethal as the 1918 Spanish Flu, which killed as many as 50 million people. Financial markets evidently don’t agree that the virus is a hoax; by Thursday afternoon the Dow was off more than 3,000 points since last week. Falling markets appear to worry the administration more than the prospect of, you know, people dying. So Larry Kudlow, the administration’s top economist, made a point of declaring that the virus was “contained” — contradicting the C.D.C. — and suggested that Americans buy stocks. The market continued to drop. At that point the administration appears to have finally realized that it might need to do something beyond insisting that things were great. But according to The Washington Post’s Greg Sargent and Paul Waldman, it initially proposed paying for a virus response by cutting aid to the poor — specifically, low-income heating subsidies. Cruelty in all things. On Wednesday Trump held a news conference on the virus, much of it devoted to incoherent jabs at Democrats and the media. He did, however, announce the leader of the government response to the threat. Instead of putting a health care professional in charge, however, he handed the job to Vice President Mike Pence, who has an interesting relationship with both health policy and science. Early in his political career, Pence staked out a distinctive position on public health, declaring that smoking doesn’t kill people. He has also repeatedly insisted that evolution is just a theory. As governor of Indiana, he blocked a needle exchange program that could have prevented a significant H.I.V. outbreak, calling for prayer instead. And now, according to The Times, government scientists will need to get Pence’s approval before making public statements about the coronavirus. So the Trumpian response to crisis is completely self-centered, entirely focused on making Trump look good rather than protecting America. If the facts don’t make Trump look good, he and his allies attack the messengers, blaming the news media and the Democrats — while trying to prevent scientists from keeping us informed. And in choosing people to deal with a real crisis, Trump prizes loyalty rather than competence. Maybe Trump — and America — will be lucky, and this won’t be as bad as it might be. But anyone feeling confident right now isn’t paying attention. The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

2020,Opinion | When a Picture Is Worth a Thousand Tears,"Photos of suffering children have the power to soften sentiment toward the “other.” Can that still happen in a polarized age? Contributing Opinion Writer NASHVILLE — On June 8, 1972, Nick Ut, a Vietnamese photographer working for The Associated Press, shot a now-iconic photo of children fleeing napalm mistakenly dropped on their village by South Vietnamese forces. At the center of the photo is a naked 9-year-old girl named Phan Thi Kim Phuc. She is in agony; her skin appears to be melting. None of the helmeted soldiers in the background are looking at the children. Only the photographer sees her pain. Now we all see her pain. The photo, which was published by The Times and other newspapers three days later, shocked readers with its clarion depiction of the costs of war. The photo won a Pulitzer Prize in 1973. Later that year, U.S. forces withdrew from Vietnam. Whether or not the photo is directly related to the withdrawal, at the very least it fed the growing antiwar sentiment in this country and may have hastened the end of the war. “Napalm Girl” belongs to a tradition of photojournalism that furthers the cause of social justice. There’s David Jackson’s 1955 image of 14-year-old Emmett Till in his coffin, murdered for being black in Jim Crow Mississippi. Sam Nzima’s 1976 photo of a teenager carrying a lifeless child in his arms during the Soweto uprising in South Africa. Kevin Carter’s 1993 photo of a starving Sudanese child being watched by a vulture. Nilufer Demir’s 2015 photo of a 3-year-old lying facedown in the surf, drowned with his mother and brother in a desperate attempt to flee the war in Syria. John Moore’s 2018 photo of a terrified 2-year-old Honduran child seeking asylum with her mother at the southern U.S. border. These photographs clarify a particular cultural moment; they distill the vast churn of history into a single image so searing it returns in your dreams to make you weep in the dark. As with Mr. Ut’s photo of Ms. Kim Phuc, it’s never completely clear whether that image is the actual cause of a communitywide lurch toward empathy, but the correlation, at least, is almost always evident. The federal government did dismantle Jim Crow laws in the segregated South, even if it dragged its feet in doing so. American forces did ultimately leave Vietnam. Apartheid did finally end in South Africa. European countries did eventually open their borders to refugees. After months of defending it, the Trump administration did end its brutal family-separation policy at the southern border, at least officially. The Times’s recent photography roundup of the past decade got me to thinking about the power of photographs to affect the course of history. So many of these photos were made during times of profound extremity: war, natural disaster, deep social unrest. There are heart-wrenching pictures of survival and death amid the rubble, of an unarmed man and an unarmed woman facing down officers in riot gear, of tribal members protesting the Dakota Access pipeline, of death in the cause of freedom. Images of ugliness cheek by jowl with images of honor, photos of fury side by side with pictures of love. But the photos that stand out, again and again, are images of children: a baby in a portable crib watching an eviction team dismantling his home, terrified survivors of the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School being led from the building, a tiny girl howling at the edge of her father’s open coffin, a baby refugee from the Rohingya minority fleeing Myanmar in a sling on his mother’s hip, a 7-year-old dying of starvation in Yemen. Such photos have the power to haunt us in ways that other photographs, no matter how moving, rarely do. They trigger an empathy that’s both profound and unquestioning: When we see a child in danger, our immediate impulse is to intervene, and we don’t stop to interrogate that impulse. What kind of person wonders whether it’s right to protect a child? In part this reaction is biological: An infant’s crying inspires an immediate caretaking response in the brains of adults, whether or not they’re responsible for the baby. Which makes sense, if only in evolutionary terms. Helpless creatures who don’t inspire help from the powerful are helpless creatures who don’t survive. More than that, though, what we feel when we look at images of children in pain or terror or death is surely tied to our innate capacity for justice. Children did not cause and cannot possibly understand what we are doing to them, and their innocence is a reminder of our own moral obligations, their suffering a spur to action. The world has changed since David Jackson photographed the brutalized face of Emmett Till and Nick Ut captured the napalm-burned body of Phan Thi Kim Phuc. Last summer, Julia Le Duc photographed the bodies of Óscar Alberto Martínez Ramírez and his 23-month-old daughter, Valeria, facedown in the mud alongside the Rio Grande. The photo went viral on social media, a visceral reminder of the desperation of migrants seeking asylum in this country. And yet this country is no closer to a reasonable immigration policy now than it was when baby Valeria died with her tiny arm wrapped around her father’s neck. Nor are we any closer to a gun policy that protects schoolchildren or an economic policy that protects the working poor. Perhaps there are just too many photos now, too many bloody troughs of suffering in too many God-forsaken places, to focus for long on any one tragedy. Perhaps our distrust of technology, our suspicion that the images have been manipulated, or that we ourselves are being manipulated, makes it too easy to distrust our own response to them, too. But so long as we continue to be moved, even unconsciously, by the iconic photographs of our age, there is hope. So long as photographs — and novels and poems and songs and plays and paintings and every other kind of art that filters the world through the moral imagination — teach us to see what we might otherwise overlook, there is a chance for change. Our national failure to develop a humane and coherent policy toward any of the conflicts that cause the suffering of children is a temporary failure. Government offices can change hands. Policies can change direction. What doesn’t change is the authority of a human heart open to the pain of others. Nick Ut’s photo of Phan Thi Kim Phuc taught us something crucial about the casual brutality of war, but it reminds us of something equally crucial: the power of human compassion. Ms. Kim Phuc’s younger brother died from wounds sustained in the same napalm attack that she survived. And she survived thanks to the quick actions of Mr. Ut, who doused her with water and took her to a hospital in Saigon for care.

2020,When a Teenager’s Irregular Periods Are Cause for Concern,"The Checkup One common cause is polycystic ovary syndrome, or PCOS, which is difficult to diagnose in adolescents. I’ve written recently about teenagers having too-heavy periods and too-painful periods, and now I want to talk about too-irregular periods. These issues can overlap, but let’s focus on what it can mean when an adolescent doesn’t menstruate regularly — and on the question of how irregular is too irregular. Dr. Andrea Bonny, an associate professor of pediatrics at The Ohio State University and chief of adolescent medicine at Nationwide Children’s Hospital, said that in the past, many doctors had thought that in the first two years after menstruation begins, “really, anything goes,” as far as frequency. Now, she said, the thinking is that some irregularity is OK, but to go more than 90 days without a period for two consecutive periods is concerning — and should get worked up medically. After someone has been menstruating for two years, she said, intervals shorter than 21 days or longer than 45 days are considered abnormal, especially if they recur. And many adolescents with irregular cycles — like those with heavy periods, and like those with very painful periods — may be offered hormone treatments, either oral contraceptives or other hormone-based contraceptives. The diagnosis hanging like a shadow over these conversations is polycystic ovary syndrome, or PCOS, the most common endocrine problem in reproductive age women, which has been the subject of recent work developing diagnosis and management guidelines in women. But it is a difficult — and sometimes controversial — diagnosis in adolescents, because the polycystic ovarian changes that give the syndrome its name, usually identified on ultrasound, can overlap with what ovaries normally look like in adolescents. So in adolescents, making this diagnosis is not about doing ultrasounds, but about paying attention to menstrual cycles and also to other symptoms. The underlying cause is a high level of androgens, or what we usually think of as male sex hormones. Hyperandrogenism — more testosterone in the blood than is usual for adolescent girls — can also mean bad acne and hirsutism, body hair growing heavily and in patterns more associated with male puberty than with female puberty (for example, hair on the upper lip and chin, on the chest and abdomen, or on the back and arms). Girls with these symptoms should also be tested for other sources of androgens and for other hormonal issues like thyroid problems. Raising awareness around PCOS is important because many adult women feel, looking back, that this diagnosis was not considered soon enough as a possible cause of fertility problems and other health issues they experienced; it is associated with metabolic alterations that can put women at risk for obesity, diabetes and heart disease. With adolescents, the priority should be treating the symptoms and helping girls understand the importance of the choices they can make around diet and exercise, which should be the real first line treatment. [Read more: Information from the National PCOS Association] “You don’t have to label to treat,” said Dr. Sharon Oberfield, a professor of pediatrics at Columbia University and chief of pediatric endocrinology, who was one of the authors of a recent update on the diagnosis and treatment of PCOS in adolescents. The formal diagnosis in adolescents, she said, which should not be made until at least two years after menarche, has to be based on high androgen levels and irregular menstrual periods. And many adolescents with irregular periods will not go on to develop PCOS. Dr. Oberfield worries that making the diagnosis too early may give some younger girls the sense that the later problems are inevitable, and therefore bring up issues of anxiety and depression and body image problems, not to mention concerns about fertility. “We like to use the words, ‘at risk,’” she said. “The key issue of looking at these girls is sometimes with early screening you can do early intervention.” Some of the adolescents with these symptoms will go on to develop polycystic ovaries, but the priority when they are young should be to make sure there are no other underlying medical problem causing the excess androgens, and to help them understand what’s going on in their bodies. Dr. Bonny said she explains to patients that men make a lot of testosterone, gesturing with her hand up near her head, and that most “women make a teeny tiny bit, but some make a bit more.” She explains that usually it’s the ovary producing it, and that the extra hormone tends to shut down their periods, and cause the acne and the hair growth. Dr. Susan Coupey, an expert in adolescent medicine and gynecology at the Children’s Hospital at Montefiore in the Bronx, said that she explains, “there are two kinds of cells in the ovaries, the ones that make the eggs and the ones that make the hormones.” Too much testosterone in some girls, she said, “causes them often to have acne and have unwanted hair; it can also change their lipid metabolism.” The hormone imbalance and its associated troubling symptoms are often treated with oral contraceptives, which stimulate the regular shedding of the endometrium — that is, the menstrual period. And that’s also important because it lowers the risk of endometrial cancer down the line. In girls who can’t take hormonal contraceptives because of medical contraindications, or whose families don’t want them to, Provera, another form of female hormone that helps regulate menstruation, is sometimes used to induce what is called a “withdrawal bleed” if they go for more than three months without a period. Dr. Bonny said she tries to make sure that either a period or a withdrawal bleed happens at least four times a year. Dr. Coupey said that with young girls and their families, though she explains that older women use these pills for birth control, for them, “I say, ‘You’ve got a hormone imbalance, taking this pill will put your ovaries to sleep.’” For overweight patients, losing weight can help with the symptoms — but the hormonal issues can make this even harder than usual; the androgens and the insulin resistance tend to spur the body to gain weight, not lose it. Adolescents who have evidence of insulin resistance may be started on a medication called metformin, an oral treatment that helps control insulin resistance and blood sugar levels and sometimes makes weight management a little easier as well for kids with this problem. Dr. Coupey said she suggests those prone to weight gain make a single change — usually cutting out sugary drinks — and then perhaps move on to a low-carbohydrate diet. And many of them eventually take both metformin and birth control pills. “Many of them do quite well,” she said. If the metabolic issues are not addressed — with lifestyle changes, with medication, with close follow-up — these adolescents with persistent symptoms are at risk for Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular problems as they grow, in addition to the reproductive and fertility problems that may arise, as well as mental health issues. “You don’t have to diagnose PCOS in a young girl to tell her she’s at risk for it and still treat her,” Dr. Bonny said. “It’s the symptoms that are so troubling to these young women — follow her, make sure you provide some treatment for acne, hirsutism, abnormal periods.”",The New York Times
2020,"When an Epidemic Looms, Gagging Scientists Is a Terrible Idea","News Analysis In an epidemic, suppression of bad news costs lives and eventually angers the public. The White House is in danger of repeating the error. Get an informed guide to the global outbreak with our daily Coronavirus
 newsletter.
 Many times in many countries, political leaders have tried to censor health officials and play down the risks of infection just as epidemics approached. This strategy has almost never worked, historians and former health officials said. And ultimately, if there are more deaths than leaders blithely predict, it destroys the reputations of the leaders themselves. This week’s efforts to reorganize the Trump administration’s chaotic response to the coronavirus outbreak risk falling into that pattern. The White House will coordinate all messaging, the public was told, and scientists in government employ will not be popping up on television talk shows, saying whatever they think. That may not be a winning strategy, experts warned. The stock market reacts to rumors, and the Federal Reserve Bank may succumb to political pressure. But pathogens, like hurricanes and tsunamis, are immune to spin. As they bore into communities, how many people in their path survive usually depends on whether a country’s leaders can correctly read early warning signs, muster an intelligent response and adroitly adjust their tactics if the threat changes. For that to happen, medical expertise must outweigh campaign messaging. China has already experienced the consequences. Initially, officials in Wuhan — the city at the epicenter of the coronavirus epidemic — claimed that the new lethal pneumonia associated with a seafood market there was not jumping from person to person. When that was exposed as a lie, local officials arrested and threatened the first doctors to expose it. As hospitals were mobbed, large numbers of Wuhanese began dying, and cases began cropping up in other cities. Beijing tried to play down negative news in state-controlled media. As a result, a population that normally does not dare criticize its leaders began doing so — loudly. Finally, stung by the outcry, President Xi Jinping asserted that he had been in charge all along, although critics noted that the initial response was inept. Updated Feb. 26, 2020 Something similar may happen in the United States, now that the virus has reached these shores. Fighting epidemics is often likened to war. It is best led by generals with combat experience and deep understandings of military history. During crises, when the public seeks trustworthy leadership, the leader’s bearing and credibility matter. The awkward bickering over who was in charge that ended Mr. Trump’s first news conference on the coronavirus was the exact opposite of what was needed, experts said. So is the confusion about whether the vice president’s office will filter messages, or to what extent Dr. Deborah L. Birx, who was until recently the country’s global AIDS coordinator, will be allowed to lead. Dr. Birx has long experience as a clinician in Africa, and directs the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, which dispenses billions of dollars. But she is not a familiar public figure and has no history of working with the hundreds of state and local health departments that will provide the front-line troops for the fight. “It’s crucially important that experts tell the public what they know and when they know it,” said Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, a former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “That’s the only way to earn and maintain the public trust that is essential to work together as a society and fight an epidemic.” On Friday, the president of the Service Employees International Union, which represents two million health care workers, accused Mr. Trump of jeopardizing its members’ health by playing down the epidemic’s severity. The administration “must immediately reverse course and allow public health experts to lead a nationally coordinated response,” said the S.E.I.U. president, Mary Kay Henry. Medical groups decried the idea of muzzling or sidelining scientists. “Introducing a political sieve between the scientists and the public undermines the public’s right to know the truth about the health threats they face,” said Dr. Keith Martin, executive director of the Consortium of Universities for Global Health. Previous American presidents have tried, unsuccessfully, to suppress bad news about disease. In early 1918, said Dr. Howard Markel, a medical historian at the University of Michigan medical school, President Woodrow Wilson told his own staff to keep silent about the devastating flu then striking the American military. “They were taking precautions like wearing masks, but he ordered them not to talk about it,” Dr. Markel said. “But it was spreading so fast that attempts to cover it up were just silly.” That pandemic became known as the Spanish flu — even though it first hit the American, English, French and German armies in Europe — because war correspondents were subject to military censorship. Reports of widespread deaths of young soldiers were considered bad for morale. In neutral Spain, newspapers were free to report deaths on the front pages. Message control also failed in Hamburg, Germany, in 1892, Dr. Markel noted. The city’s business and civic leaders conspired to suppress news of its cholera epidemic. But word leaked out, and ships from Hamburg, a major port, became suspect and were refused entry when they tried to dock in the United States. During the early 1980s, a mysterious illness appeared: Its victims slowly wasted away and died despite all attempts to save them. No one knew the cause, how it was transmitted or who, if anyone, was safe. Because it struck hardest at groups who initially had no political power, including gay men, hemophiliacs, heroin users and Haitians, President Ronald Reagan for years did not even acknowledge the outbreak of what was first called Gay-Related Immune Disease and ultimately Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, or AIDS. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] But public health officials in cities like San Francisco were forced to confront it — and they realized that they had to institute policies that would mean asking victims extremely intrusive questions, including their sexual orientation and the names of all their sexual partners. “Can you imagine what would have happened if people thought that everything I was saying was first politically vetted?” said Dr. Dean Echenberg, who was then director of disease control for the city’s health department, and held almost daily news conferences. “It was very difficult to be trusted as it was,” he said. “Providing information about the disease was as important a tool in control for us as testing and contact tracing.” Asked if he had ever been asked to suppress or tailor a health message, Dr. Frieden, who was New York City health commissioner under Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg before running the C.D.C., replied: “Never. Never when I worked for Mike. Never on Ebola. Never on the flu pandemic. And never over the stock market.”",The New York Times
2020,When the Craving for Cassoulet Strikes …,"In determining his latest dinner party menu, David Tanis lets the main course take the lead. So many things can determine the making of a menu: the weather, the season, the diners’ tastes and, of course, what looks good at the market. Or maybe it’s simply dictated by something you have been craving to cook and eat. Whim and whimsy (and changing your mind) can be part of the process, too. Whether it’s a dinner party or a casual dinner, your goal should be a collection of cohesive elements. You want flavors that will complement one another and at least a loose plan for how it will all go together. Will it be an orderly progression of single dishes — a first course, a main course and dessert? Or will it all go on the table at once, as with, say, pasta al forno and a gorgeous green salad? That’s the menu, and that’s the meal, and that’s fine. At my house, we often start out in the kitchen with drinks and stand-up snacks, then move to the table for the main course. Other times, we may like to spend a little more time at the table. For this meal, which is more of the latter, I built the menu around the main course — something cassouletish, without the bother of making a proper cassoulet, a project that can take several days. With a little tweaking, I came up with a dish that had cassoulet elements (duck, beans), but with a lighter, and perhaps slightly Italianate feel. The result was slow-roasted duck legs with mashed white beans, with a savory topping of sizzled rosemary, sage and olives. Peppery arugula leaves dressed with lemon and salt paired well with the richness of the duck, though steamed broccoli rabe could be another choice. Slow-roasting duck legs in the oven, uncovered, yields tender meat, similar to duck confit, as well as a lovely crispy skin. Look for large moulard legs, available at some butcher shops and online. For a simple first course, I wanted something fishy, but easy: steamed clams with snail butter. No, not butter made from snails, but rather, the emerald-green garlic butter used for escargots. The ingredients are simple — just butter, parsley and garlic — but it tastes good on nearly everything, whether pan-seared steaks, grilled fish or pasta. This is meant to be a small first course, just four or five clams per person, but feel free to increase the quantities for larger servings. Or, skip the buttery clams and serve raw oysters on the half-shell. I often don’t want a fancy dessert, so for this menu, I chose one of the simplest and best desserts imaginable (also delicious for breakfast). Its inspiration is the Mediterranean treat of fresh ricotta drizzled with regional honey. The main challenge is to find good fresh ricotta. You want the kind that is delicate and custardlike, not the grainy-textured supermarket kind. Sometimes you can find fresh ricotta sold in little plastic basket molds. Unmolded on a plate, it makes a lovely presentation, cut into wedges. Instead of honey, I served it with a very refreshing rhubarb sauce punched up with ginger and cardamom — a nod to spring, for which rhubarb is a rosy harbinger. The good news about this menu is that much of it can be prepared in advance. You can cook the beans up to two days ahead, and the same goes for the snail butter and rhubarb sauce. Then, put the dinner together leisurely as duck legs slowly roast. The white beans and olives in this dish suggest Tuscany, and the slow-roasted duck legs conjure up the southwest of France. Red wines from those regions could not be better matches. From Tuscany, Chianti Classico will go brilliantly with this dish, its flavors and acidity melding seamlessly with the richness of the duck and beans. You could also choose a Brunello di Montalcino if you like. From the southwest of France, the land of confit, you have a variety of delicious reds. The tannic tannats of Madiran might need to be decanted. Bergerac could provide a softer experience, while the wines of Cahors or Irouléguy would be superb. For a more luxurious experience, try a Pomerol from Bordeaux. From outside these areas, a pinot noir would be delicious as well.

2020,When the Police Stop a Teenager With Special Needs,"People with autism or other special needs may repeat words, avoid eye contact and run from authorities. A man in his mid-20s regularly roams the streets of my small town in the middle of the night. He looks angry and doesn’t communicate clearly. Not everyone living in the area knows him. But the police do. “His father reached out to us,” said Sgt. Adrian Acevedo of the South Orange, N.J., police department, “to tell us his son is blowing off steam, has special needs, and won’t make eye contact or listen to us. If we didn’t have this information, we could mistakenly take him for a burglar.” All of South Orange’s police officers are aware of this man’s disability. His name, his parent’s phone numbers, and brief details about his special needs are on file at the South Orange Police Office. “It’s a smart move,” said Gary Weitzen, executive director of Parents of Autistic Children, a nonprofit based in New Jersey that provides training for parents and educators on how to teach children with autism to respond to people in uniform. The group also hosts workshops for police officers and other officials on how to interact with people with special needs. To date, they’ve trained more than 70,000 police officers, firefighters and ambulance squads in New Jersey. When Mr. Weitzen’s son Christopher, who has autism, was young, Mr. Weitzen always held his hand when out in public. If he didn’t, Christopher would bolt. “Our friends called our house Fort Weitzen,” he said. “I couldn’t let Christopher out of my sight.” Today Christopher is 25 and goes out on his own. “It was a lot of training on my part,” Mr. Weitzen said. Whenever they were out as a family at a community gathering and the police were nearby, Mr. Weitzen would introduce Christopher to the officers. “I want them to know him and for him to feel comfortable around them,” Mr. Weitzen said. Many people of color talk to their children about ways to interact with the police. While the circumstances are different, parents of children with special needs often need to educate their children about ways to behave if they’re stopped by the police. Indeed, in 2016, North Miami police officers shot a behavioral therapist, Charles Kinsey, who was trying to calm down a young man with autism who was holding a toy truck that the officers mistook for a weapon. The tendency of many people on the autism spectrum to wander can lead to encounters with the police, but Wendy Fournier, president of the National Autism Association, said there are two distinct categories, wandering and elopement, though they are often used interchangeably. Wandering, she said, is more purposeful and usually happens between ages 4 and 7. “That child will have it in his head that he wants to go swimming or to the park,” she said. “It’s what he wants to do regardless of the safety issues, which can be crossing a busy street without looking so he can get to his destination. It’s hard to stop him.” In elopement, a child may bolt because of an overwhelming situation such as being around large crowds. The association has two free downloadable programs with tools to address these issues. The Big Red Safety Box covers wandering and elopement, and the Meet the Police program teaches parents of children on the autism spectrum and children with autism how to interact with the police. According to a 2017 study from the A.J. Drexel Autism Institute at Drexel University, an estimated one in five teenagers with autism was stopped and questioned by the police before age 21, and 5 percent were arrested. And according to research at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, people with disabilities, including those on the autism spectrum, are five times more likely to be incarcerated than people in the general population, and “civilian injuries and fatalities during police interactions are disproportionately common among this population.” “The police are not the bad guys,” Mr. Weitzen said. “They need to meet our children and should understand why they may not be able to make eye contact or that they’ll run when ordered to stay put.” He said that people with autism “may keep their hands in their pockets because it’s a coping mechanism. They may repeat a word because it helps them focus. Not all uniformed personnel understand these behaviors.” When a friend of mine whose son has both autism and oppositional defiant disorder moved to a new neighborhood about six years ago, she called the local police to let them know about his behavior. The officer on duty invited them to come in so they could meet. “At the station, the officers treated him with respect,” said my friend, who did not want her name published to protect her son’s privacy. “I told them about his violent temper ahead of the visit, and we discussed it with the police officers. All of the officers know him. They have our information on file at the precinct. It will help keep him safe in the event of a meltdown. They even know his coping words.” Recently, when her son began attending a program for students on the autism spectrum in New Jersey, she asked the school to host a seminar with the local police. “When I met the officer, I was a bit scared,” said her son, who is now 19. “But I listened and he seemed friendly. I was able to talk to him, and I know that most police officers are good and are here to protect us.” In the Weitzens’ neighborhood, the police officers know that it can help Christopher if they mention John Deere tractors and “Thomas the Tank Engine” characters. They also know what triggers him. “Most people with autism have some form of anxiety,” Mr. Weitzen explained. “The cops know Christopher won’t look them in the eye. Something little like that can escalate and make a bad situation worse.” Mr. Weitzen believes children with autism should carry an ID card. It should have their name, their diagnoses, a parent’s or caretaker’s name and phone numbers, and any other information that could be helpful to the police. “Your child should never reach into his pocket” if confronted by police, he said. “Instead, he needs to tell the officer that his ID is in his pocket and ask if he can take it out.” Sgt. Acevedo said, “If we have information about your child, we have an idea of what to expect. We need to know the people in the neighborhood, the signs to look for, and it helps if they know us. Some parents share information and others don’t.” “We even have a file of elderly people with Alzheimer’s and dementia,” he said. “We’ve had a few elderly people with dementia wandering the streets looking lost. Knowing about someone’s autism, Alzheimer’s or special needs saves lives.” “Police officers don’t want children to be afraid of us,” Sgt. Acevedo said. “In a tense situation, where we don’t know what to expect, we make split-second decisions. Knowing your child and having your child know us completely changes that situation.”",The New York Times
2020,When the Teenager or Young Adult Has Cancer,"Doctors Adolescents and young adults are a special population of cancer patients. My patient was brought to the emergency room by his friend because he could no longer catch his breath and had a cough that wouldn’t extinguish. He lived with three other young men, all in their early 20s, in a small house located in what many of us considered the no-man’s land between Cleveland and Buffalo, the four of them suspended between spending some time in a community college and finding work that they might one day call a career. Findings on a chest X-ray prompted a CT scan, which showed a “huge mass lesion,” in the words of the usually composed radiologist, measuring 18 centimeters by 15 centimeters in the front of his chest, beneath the breastplate. The mnemonic for what this anterior mediastinal tumor could represent was “The Four T’s”: abnormalities of the Thymus, Thyroid, a Teratoma (a type of germ cell tumor containing several different types of tissue, even sometimes hair and muscle), or a Terrible lymphoma. A subsequent biopsy confirmed the terrible lymphoma, and he was admitted to my hospital service for treatment. The nurses and social worker who had met him were concerned. “He drinks 15 cans of beer a week that he’ll admit to, and has blacked out in the past,” I was told. I had noticed a previous visit to the E.R. for trauma related to a binge-drinking episode. I asked about his family. His social worker, who has borne witness to extremes of challenging environmental situations in her many years of caring for cancer patients, looked grim. “His father’s in jail. His mother is addicted to drugs and in the past has stolen his money and medications. His sister is developmentally delayed. He doesn’t have any caregivers and has been living independently for years.” She paused, giving me space to absorb this. “It’s going to be tricky for him to get through all of his therapy.” Adolescents and young adults, which in medicine we define as ages 15 to 39, are a special population of patients with respect to the types of cancers they commonly get and the biology of those cancers. They also have distinct concerns from older or younger cancer patients, including unique issues surrounding their emerging identities, body image and autonomy. They are caught in the no-man’s land between being treated by adult oncologists, who may not be sensitive to these concerns, or by pediatric oncologists, where they may feel out of place sitting in an infusion chair receiving treatment next to a child. I walked into my patient’s room, where he lay in his hospital bed, looking almost too fragile to be able to handle this huge mass lesion, never mind the chemotherapy I was about to propose. Slight, at five-and-a-half feet and 125 pounds, his face appeared even smaller, with a thick, black beard, oxygen tubing beneath his nose, and a snapback trucker baseball cap over his head. Tattoos covered both of his arms — a style element that my teenage children tell me is now considered normative. Another young man sat in the chair by his bed. I discussed his diagnosis and its treatment. “The first course of chemotherapy we’ll give you in the hospital. After that, over the next few months, we’ll provide most of your care as an outpatient, meaning you’ll need to come back and forth to clinic a bunch of times.” I paused, giving him space to absorb this. “Is that something you can do?” He nodded and gestured with his thumb toward his buddy, sitting in the chair beside him. “These guys will help me out.” He sounded confident. But I must have looked unconvinced, because his friend stepped in to reassure me, “We’ve got this. Whatever he needs.” I still had many doubts. Over the next four weeks, we treated his terrible lymphoma in the hospital. Another CT scan showed that his huge mass lesion had gotten smaller. When he recovered from the side effects of chemotherapy, we held our breath and discharged him home, with a follow-up appointment to see me in clinic and instructions to lay off the drinking. He showed up a few days later to my office for his first outpatient appointment, early even, with another buddy by his side. He was grinning ear-to-ear, having defied my expectations. Same with the next appointment. And the one after that. And every appointment with me for the following year and a half. I got to know all of his housemates, and some of their girlfriends, too. They brought him to the hospital or clinic for his chemotherapy, to the E.R. when he got sick, and asked questions about his health, on his behalf. One even inquired if he could have one alcoholic drink on his birthday — the only one he has imbibed since I’ve known him. He’s become one of my heroes, a role model patient who is totally compliant with his health care appointments. And while there were real warning signs that his treatment might not have gone as smoothly as it did, I was guilty of discounting his commitment to it because of his age, appearance and background. Fortunately, I haven’t gotten too old to learn from him and his buddies.

2020,Where America’s Fight for Housing Is an All-Out War,"Nonfiction When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. GOLDEN GATES Fighting for Housing in AmericaBy Conor Dougherty In California, more than 100,000 people sleep on the streets. The tent cities in Los Angeles’s skid row have distinct neighborhoods, and across from a homelessness center, the bodies on the sidewalk are four rows deep. Trailers line the streets near Google’s Mountain View headquarters, and in Modesto, a woman sleeping in a cardboard box was crushed to death by a front loader that came to clear her encampment away. It’s hard to overstate how dire California’s housing crisis is. To combat it, policymakers must consider a complicated intersection of issues, including the displacement of vulnerable populations, maintaining the character of neighborhoods, the environment, affordability. But there’s only one answer: more housing. To end the crisis, 3.5 million new homes must be built. However, as Conor Dougherty shows in “Golden Gates,” his study of the housing shortage plaguing San Francisco, America’s most prosperous city, the Bay Area is beset by hypocritical homeowners and the paradoxes of progressivism. Too often the important issues aren’t so much weighed as weaponized in the war against new development. Dougherty has covered this quagmire extensively for The New York Times, and “Golden Gates” is both an empathetic portrait of all sides — legislators, developers, pro-housing and anti-gentrification activists — as well as a masterly primer on the fight for new construction in California. Look at Dougherty’s chapter on the semirural Bay Area suburb of Lafayette. In 2011, it went nuclear over a proposal to build 14 buildings and 315 apartments. The developer, Dennis O’Brien, knew how protectionist Lafayette was; like so many other suburbs and cities within cities (Lakewood, Beverly Hills), Lafayette had incorporated, as Dougherty writes, expressly to “wrest land-use power from the county” — of Contra Costa — “and put a stop to growth.” It worked. While Lafayette’s population more than tripled between 1950 and 1965 (from 5,000 to 19,000), after its incorporation in 1968 it has stayed steady at 25,000. Residents decried O’Brien’s proposed project on the grounds of aesthetics, traffic congestion, protecting the school system and carcinogenic construction dust. But O’Brien had been building in the Bay Area since the 1960s, and he had a plan. He notified the city that he intended to offer below-market rents and that if Lafayette opposed him, he would sue under the Housing Accountability Act. This was a forgotten law that Jerry Brown had signed at the end of his first tenure as governor in 1982. It allowed cities to be sued for thwarting high-density development. Lafayette’s city manager, who would eventually lose his job over this dispute, reached out to O’Brien, and after numerous discussions, alighted on a compromise: a new plan for 44 single-family homes, and O’Brien would kick in a sports field and a dog park. But O’Brien’s initial threat had made headlines and the Housing Accountability Act had caught the attention of Sonja Trauss, an audacious housing activist who had been bravely commandeering the mics at City Council meetings. “Thirty-five years of wonky liberals trying to induce localities to build housing has been a complete failure,” one fellow activist said. “So, why not just sue the suburbs?” Which is what Trauss did. But by the time the case made its way through the court system, Lafayette’s NIMBY residents had collected enough signatures to demand a referendum to overturn the City Council’s approval of the 44 houses. O’Brien vowed to revive his original 315-apartment plan if the referendum passed. The “Save Lafayette” activists didn’t believe him, but when the referendum passed, that’s just what he did. Both the NIMBYs and the pro-housing YIMBYs had shot themselves in the feet. And the developer hadn’t won either. He’d already invested four years and several million dollars proposing two completely different projects. Now, it would likely take years and more lawsuits if the 315 units were to be built. Dougherty expertly explains the confluence of microeconomic and historical forces that have created a housing shortage so severe that it’s rendered the most prosperous state in the country the poorest when adjusted for cost of living. To challenge readers to consider how change might be achieved, he features two very different YIMBYs. Trauss, the passionate but abrasive activist who rose to national prominence with her slash-and-burn tactics, raises the question, how far does one need to go to get results and how far is too far?, while the dryly diligent California state senator Scott Wiener shows how difficult it is to correct course legislatively. His much-needed bill to give the state control over zoning near transportation hubs, like BART stations and popular bus stops, in order to streamline the approval of tall, dense housing complexes, failed at the end of January for the third year in a row. Anywhere else in the country, Wiener, who supports single-payer health care, state-sponsored abortion and fracking bans, would be considered a progressive. But in Los Angeles and San Francisco, liberals are divided into hyperlocal factions that war over hyperlocal issues, and the meaning of “progressive” has become distorted. There, Wiener is labeled a moderate because he is comfortable with growth, while “progressives” want it all to stop. Only in California’s paradoxical politics could “rich homeowners who fought for the sanctity of single-family zoning … be in alignment with poor renters fighting gentrification.” Locking down the city, however, is what brought California to the crisis in the first place, Dougherty aptly argues. During the Great Inflation of the 1970s, when living expenses became unstable, factory jobs disappeared and C.E.O. pay began its exorbitant rise, home prices also spiked and, for the first time, outpaced stock performance. Two things happened to homes, according to Dougherty: They became not just dwellings but strategic investments — ones that represented the bulk of American household wealth. As a result, cities, driven by “homevoters” — essentially single-issue voters who wanted to protect their property values — began passing zoning ordinances to limit growth and “protect neighborhoods.” Because stunting growth leads to higher property taxes, a vast number of suburbs and neighborhoods incorporated in order to control local land use and zone out poor people (whose social services raise property taxes). And in 1978, homevoters passed Proposition 13, capping property taxes. The result? By 2018, the Bay Area created eight new jobs for each one unit of housing and in California, 130,000 were without a home. Would San Franciscans rather drive out the tech industry than build more houses? Some, like the activist who jumped onto the hood of a Yahoo bus and vomited down its windshield, certainly would. Tech, with its pseudo-utopian airs and surveillance-profiteering, is a tempting scapegoat. But cities that oppose growth will fall apart or have cripplingly high property taxes. A bill like Wiener’s, Dougherty argues, is the solution. But stakeholders — cities, construction unions and environmental groups (some of which aren’t actually concerned with the environment but are skilled at using California’s environmental laws to thwart construction) — all fear that if building is easier, they’ll lose their leverage. “A complicated process was full of political profit,” Dougherty writes. “Golden Gates” is essential reading for every Californian, new or native. But will outsiders care? Dougherty’s introduction lays out why they should. “You can’t talk about educational inequities or the shrinking middle class without talking about how much it costs to live near good schools and high-paying jobs,” he writes. The carnivalesque land-use battles that ensnare San Francisco and its semirural suburbs, he points out, are a microcosm of the exasperating land-use issues threatening other thriving economies, like Seattle, Austin and Denver; Vancouver, London and Berlin. I wish he had continued to connect what’s happening in California with what’s going on elsewhere. But after the introduction, the borders mostly close, and so “Golden Gates” can feel, well, a little local. Perhaps that’s the point. At the moment, housing policy is primarily dictated by local jurisdictions that act like fiefs. Local jurisdictions are made up of idiosyncratic individuals — but, given the will, they can slowly be changed by idiosyncratic individuals, too.",The New York Times
2020,Where Are Global Home Values Rising the Most?,"Calculator A basic guide for future expatriates, wishful foreign investors and vacation house hunters. Attention wishful foreign investors and vacation house hunters: The world is your oyster. But as readers of our weekly International Real Estate columns know, buying internationally can be complex and fraught with unexpected hurdles. So where to begin? This week’s chart, which shows fluctuations in international home prices over time, may offer a good starting point. Using data from Global Property Guide, which provides price information on home values in more than 70 countries, Hong Kong (part of China) and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, we’re looking at where prices grew at the greatest rates over one year, five years and 10 years as of the third quarter of 2019. The data is culled from central banks and national statistics and serves as a good general guide for home values. The top of the list shows that a home purchased in Hong Kong a decade ago is likely worth nearly three times as much today. Does that suggest Hong Kong real estate will continue to grow at the same rate over the next decade? Of course not. Over five years, the growth was substantial, about 43 percent, but over one year, real estate there was down a little over 2 percent. While 20/20 hindsight on price changes is helpful, the universal investment disclaimer certainly applies: “Past performance is no guarantee of future results.” So study our chart, and begin to dream. But don’t forgo consultation with financial, legal and real estate professionals. Making connections with other international buyers to learn about their experiences will also prove invaluable.

2020,Opinion | Where Being a Single Woman Is Not OK,"Op-Docs Dating is hard. A government campaign to get you married is worse. transcript What kind of man would be a good match for you? I have high standards. For example, he must be well educated. Most important, he must respect women. Have you ever been in a relationship? Twice. Sorry if I’m being too straightforward, but you’re not beautiful in the traditional sense. I don’t mean you’re not pretty, I mean you’re not a beauty. And also, you’re really old. I’m old? I think I’m at a good age. Do you think you’re at the perfect age for the marriage market? Please don’t think you’re in a good position. You might think you look young, but you’re fooling yourself. Are you HauMei? Yes. I am Zhang Xu. Hi. Nice to meet you. You look better than your photo. Thank you. Your coffee. Thank you. You are welcome. My parents always wanted a son so despite the one child policy, they still kept trying and had multiple kids. In the rural area where I’m from, people treat girls as inferior to boys, so my parents pushed me to get a good education. For them, a girl with a degree equals a boy. I studied hard and became a lawyer. What kind of girl are you looking for? At my age... I’ve passed the age of falling in love. You’ve passed the age of romantic relationships. Instead of falling in love, you want to get married? Where were you born? Wudi, Bing Zhou. I’m from the county town. Really? So we could go home together on holidays. Right. I never think about going back. It’s such a small town. There is no development. People in Shandong are traditional, male chauvinism is very common. I know it, my family is like that. After you get married, will you continue to keep that tradition? I think… Like you said, every man in Shandong is a male chauvinist but they vary in degrees. In my marriage, I’m hoping to be dominant. Dominant? I want to be dominant in my family. For example, I research about cell phones and TV, as a woman, you don’t have to give advice, just tell me what you need. I’ll make the decision. I don’t want my wife to be stronger than me. Suddenly making decisions alone… Cheers. Let me see how heavy you are. How did you get so tall? Look at grandpa. Say “grandpa” Kiss. Have you found your Mr. Right yet? I don’t want to find one. You should consider getting married. Honestly, I’m very worried. You are? The law says people should get married in their 20s. You’re in your 30s and still not married? When people ask me about you, I don’t know what to say. I can date someone but I don’t want to get married. All that schooling makes you dumb. – It made her dumb. You’re highly educated and you don’t want someone at a lower level. The ones in a higher class won’t be interested in you. Since you have a steady job, you should consider getting married. I did consider it. I did consider it and I’ve decided to remain single. You don’t care. You only do whatever you want. Dad and Mom never worry about me or the others. You’re the only one they worry about. Why are you doing this? Since you were a kid, I did whatever you asked. I gave you whatever you wanted. I rarely slept. I worked in the water, in the mud. What for? To support you. How will your life look when you’re 45 years old? Our other sisters and I worry about you all the time. When you get sick, who can you call? Who will take care of you? It’s tiring to start a family but who doesn’t want to have one? Who has a comfortable life after marriage? I’m not saying I want to stay single my whole life. I simply don’t mind being single. You don’t care. I don’t care, of course I don’t care. I simply don’t want to get married but you keep worrying about it. You say seeing your child growing up makes you happy. It’s bullshit. After all, I don’t bring you any happiness, do I? “Sheng nu” (“leftover women”) is a term used to describe single women who are 27 or older in China. Most of these women live in cities and lead rewarding professional lives. The term was coined in 2007 by a government organization responsible for the protection and promotion of women’s rights and policies. That same year, the Ministry of Education added “sheng nu” to the official lexicon. In this Op-Doc, based on the Independent Lens feature documentary “Leftover Women,” we follow one of those women — Qiu Huamei, contending with the stigma and social pressure forcing her to go on a grueling quest in search of a husband. She grew up in a small village five hours south of Beijing and is the second youngest of five sisters. Ms. Qiu is a successful lawyer, fluent in English and opinionated — but those qualities do not outweigh one key flaw: She is not married. In recent years, the Chinese government has been waging an aggressive campaign to pressure women into marriage. Single women are caricatured in news reports, editorials and social media. The orchestrated campaign is a byproduct of China’s one-child policy, which created a great gender imbalance in the population. Ms. Qiu does all she can to comply with expectations and find a partner. But the search sometimes feels incompatible with the life she envisions for herself. When she goes on dates, she hears again and again how a woman’s place is at home. Her intellectual and professional achievements are irrelevant. She is measured only by traditional values. And so with every year that passes, her value in the marriage market diminishes. The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

2020,Where Does All the Swag Go After Campaigns Fail? Everywhere,"Some items are reused in future campaigns. Others are thrown away. And some resurface in Kenya. Buttons, shirts and bumper stickers heralding the failed presidential ambitions of Senator Kamala Harris are gathering dust inside a warehouse in Texas. Among lava lamps and incense sticks, a retailer in Connecticut still offers shirts that cry “Jeb!” And for years after Mitt Romney’s 2012 quest for the White House ended, fading campaign hats and shirts resurfaced on the streets of Kenya’s capital, Nairobi. For decades, American presidential campaigns have churned out enormous quantities of swag — $5 buttons, $15 mugs, $75 guacamole bowls — to promote candidates, fill campaign coffers and gather sophisticated data about supporters. Less attention has been paid, however, to what happens to all those things after most of those campaigns end, sometimes abruptly. Many campaigns do not have a plan for what they leave behind. With the South Carolina primary on Saturday fast approaching, and about a third of all delegates up for grabs on March 3, some of the eight candidates still seeking the Democratic nomination could find themselves confronting that problem soon. “You literally go from building a multimillion-dollar start-up to being shut down overnight,” said Matt Terrill, the former chief of staff for Senator Marco Rubio’s 2016 campaign, which gave many leftover shirts to volunteers. “It’s a lot easier to have people help you when you win to shut down a campaign.” Surplus items often end up in storage or in the homes of staff members and volunteers. Some are given a second life with a new campaign. Most are thought to be recycled or thrown away. “If somebody doesn’t deliberately collect them or hold on to them, almost all of it disappears,” said Jon Grinspan, a curator of political history at the National Museum of American History who collects presidential campaign memorabilia for the museum. The Harris campaign placed a bulk order for merchandise in the summer, said Shelby Cole, who was the digital director of Ms. Harris’s campaign. The plan was to distribute the items to campaign teams nationwide. But before they could, Ms. Harris, a senator from California, dropped out. “All of our staff was pretty much caught by total surprise,” Ms. Cole said. “I was just thinking, ‘Oh my God, what are we going to do with all these shirts?’” Ms. Cole said that the vendor the Harris campaign had hired, Bumperactive, offered to store the items in a warehouse and that they had been there for months. The merchandise is not marked with the year 2020, so it could in theory be used for Ms. Harris’s future campaigns, Ms. Cole said. Ms. Harris’s office said there were plans to recycle the items, but offered no specifics. Kyle Johnson, the owner of Bumperactive, declined to comment. At times, vendors that print shirts and other items are left with the surplus stock. The retailer in Connecticut, Old Glory, still offers items printed for Jeb Bush, John McCain and other bygone candidates. “It’s just in our warehouse, sitting on a shelf,” said Austin Braumann, a district manager for the company. “What ends up happening is you either leave it up online and you can sell it, or you can donate it or throw it away.” Several hundred shirts and hats promoting Mr. Romney’s 2012 presidential campaign wound up in Kenya after a former county campaign director in Tennessee donated the items to a charity run by his aunt. The former campaign official, Alexander Waters, recalled thinking after the election, “Instead of someone selling them on eBay for $5 down the road, how can we turn this boon into something that can change someone’s life?” In 2013, Mr. Waters delivered the clothes to his aunt’s charity, the Orbit Village Project, which has been operating in Kenya for more than 20 years. His aunt, Cyndy Waters, said she saw people wearing Romney hats for years. “Kenyans are very much in tune to what’s going on in American elections, so they knew Romney,” she said. “Interestingly enough, campaign shirts are just becoming popular over here,” she added, referring to local elections. Jason Worrix, the marketing director for My Campaign Store, a company in Louisville, Ky., that prints items for campaigns, said he advises them to donate leftover goods to local organizations. Signs can be painted over by Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts, pens can go to bars and restaurants, clothing to shelters or Goodwill. Sometimes, campaigns reuse the material, Mr. Worrix said. Small changes can turn a yard sign for a congressional campaign into a yard sign promoting a run for governor or president, he said, and if a T-shirt or mug shows only a candidate’s name, it can be reused every election cycle. “Politicians, a lot of times they’re lifers,” he said. “Especially for yard signs and things, we print a lot of stickers that say ‘re-elect,’ or cover up positions and years to modify what they’re running for.” But there is no consistent practice of giving to charity, as the National Football League does with the premade, “winning” merchandise of teams that lose in the Super Bowl. Some campaigns keep their stores open; sales can help pay the bills or generate income to finance a future race. Zach Graumann, the campaign manager for Andrew Yang, the entrepreneur who ended his long-shot bid for president this month, said that Yang merchandise would remain available until whatever was left sold out. “The good news is, our campaign swag is actually cool, so even after we’re done running, people still want it,” he said. He made a pitch for a camouflage “Math” hat: “Camo is in — I think. Or was in!” Mr. Graumann said that any unsold hats or T-shirts would be donated. And at least some campaign merchandise ends up with collectors, both private and public. The National Museum of American History has about 130,000 items that showcase American political history, most of which came from campaigns. Mr. Grinspan, who has been a curator at the museum for five years, said that snagging items before they got tossed could be a challenge, and that “99 percent” of items were thrown away. Sometimes, collecting can mean sifting through recycling bins or piles of discarded material. In most cases, volunteers and staff members willingly share campaign merchandise. Curators gathered a few dozen posters and buttons in New Hampshire while attending political rallies and visiting campaign headquarters, said Claire Jerry, another curator at the museum. Ms. Jerry said the museum also received older items from people who had packed them away at home and forgotten about them. The museum recently obtained a torch used in Abraham Lincoln’s 1860 presidential campaign that had been sitting in the attic of a small historical society in Milford, N.H., Mr. Grinspan said. “A lot of these things come from people’s junk drawers,” Ms. Jerry said. Lori Ferber Collectibles in Scottsdale, Ariz., has been gathering campaign ephemera from elections, administrations, manufacturers and estate sales for over 40 years, said Steve Ferber, the company’s vice president. The company, which specializes in presidential and presidential campaign memorabilia, recently bought and sold about 160,000 Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan buttons that one manufacturer had sitting in a warehouse since the 1970s and ’80s, Mr. Ferber said. “It’s amazing what people collect sometimes, and what people hold on to,” he said. Collectibles from losing candidates are sometimes worth more than the winners, he noted: Buttons for Eugene V. Debs’s socialist campaign for president in 1920 can be worth $500 to $1,000. Lori Ferber is selling items from the 2020 Democratic primary, too. “We have quite a few Beto O’Rourke posters and buttons on our shelves,” Mr. Ferber said, referring to the former Texas congressman who dropped out of the race in November. “It’ll take years, probably, before we sell those.” But Mr. Ferber said the company had sold everything from Reagan yo-yos to a Nixon pizza box. “It can get pretty strange,” he said. “But everything sells eventually.” Matt Stevens contributed reporting.

2020,Opinion | Where Might Trumpism Take Us?,"For analogies that show us where the nation might be headed, look close to home. Opinion Columnist When critics reach for analogies to describe Donald Trump — or look for examples of democratic deterioration — they tend to look abroad. They point to Russia under Vladimir Putin, Hungary under Viktor Orban, or Turkey under Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Trump, in this view, is a type — an authoritarian strongman. But it’s a foreign type, and his corrupt administration is seen as alien to the American experience. This is a little too generous to the United States. It’s not just that we have had moments of authoritarian government — as well as presidents, like John Adams or Woodrow Wilson, with autocratic impulses — but that an entire region of the country was once governed by an actual authoritarian regime. That regime was Jim Crow, a system defined by a one-party rule and violent repression of racial minorities. The reason this matters is straightforward. Look beyond America’s borders for possible authoritarian futures and you might miss important points of continuity with our own past. Which is to say that if authoritarian government is in our future, there’s no reason to think it won’t look like something we’ve already built, versus something we’ve imported. Americans don’t usually think of Jim Crow as a kind of authoritarianism, or of the Jim Crow South as a collection of authoritarian states. To the extent that there is one, the general view is that the Jim Crow South was a democracy, albeit racist and exclusionary. People voted in elections, politicians exchanged power and institutions like the press had a prominent place in public life. There’s a strong case to be made that this is wrong. “To earn the moniker,” argues the political scientist Robert Mickey in “Paths Out of Dixie: The Democratization of Authoritarian Enclaves in America’s Deep South, 1944-1972,” “democracies must feature free and fair elections, the safeguarding of rights necessary to sustain such elections — such as freedoms of assembly, association, and speech — and a state apparatus sufficiently responsive to election winners and autonomous from social and economic forces that these elections are meaningful.” By that standard, the Jim Crow South was not democratic. But does that make it authoritarian? A look at the creation of Jim Crow can help us answer the question. Jim Crow did not emerge immediately after the Compromise of 1877 — in which Republicans agreed to withdraw federal troops from the South in return for the presidency — and the end of Reconstruction. It arose, instead, as a response to a unique set of political and economic conditions in the 1890s. By the start of the decade, the historian C. Vann Woodward argued in his influential 1955 book “The Strange Career of Jim Crow,” opposition to “extreme racism” had relaxed to the point of permissiveness. External restraining forces — “Northern liberal opinion in the press, the courts, and the government” — were more concerned with reconciling the nation than securing Southern democracy. And within the South, conservative political and business elites had abandoned restraint in the face of a radical challenge from an agrarian mass movement. Mickey notes how the Farmers’ Alliance and Populist Party “clashed with state and national Democratic parties on major economic issues, including debt relief for farmers and the regulation of business.” What’s more, “A Colored Farmers’ Alliance grew rapidly as well, and held out the possibility of biracial coalition-building.” This possibility became a reality in states like Alabama, Georgia and North Carolina, where Populists joined with a majority-black southern Republican Party to support common lists of candidates in “fusion” agreements against an explicitly elitist and white supremacist Democratic Party. Populists and Republicans won their greatest victories in that era in North Carolina, where they captured the state legislature and governor’s mansion, as well as local and county offices. Democrats, among them large landowners and “New South” industrialists, responded with violence. Democratic paramilitary organizations — called “Red Shirts” — attacked Populist and Republican voters, suppressing the vote throughout the state. In Republican-controlled Wilmington, N.C., writes Mickey, “Democratic notables launched a wave of violence and killings of Republicans and their supporters, black and white, to take back the state’s largest city; hundreds fled for good.” This basic pattern repeated itself throughout the South for the next decade. Working through the Democratic Party, conservative elites “repressed Populists, seized control of the state apparatus, and effectively ended credible partisan competition.” They rewrote state constitutions to end the vote for blacks as well as substantially restrict it for most whites. They gerrymandered states to secure the political power of large landowners, converted local elective offices into appointed positions controlled at the state level, “and further insulated state judiciaries from popular input.” This could have been stopped, but the North was tired of sectional conflict, and the courts had no interest in the rights of blacks or anyone else under the boot of the Democrats. The southern Democratic Party didn’t just control all offices and effectively staff the state bureaucracy. It was gatekeeper to all political participation. An aspiring politician could not run for office, much less win and participate in government, without having it behind him. “What is the state?” asked one prominent lawyer during Louisiana’s 1898 Jim Crow constitutional convention, aptly capturing the dynamic at work, “It is the Democratic Party.” Statehood was conflated with party, writes Mickey, “and party disloyalty with state treason.” Southern conservatives beat back Populism and biracial democracy to build a one-party state and ensure cheap labor, low taxes, white supremacy and a starkly unequal distribution of wealth. It took two decades of disruption — the Great Depression, the Great Migration and the Second World War — to even make change possible, and then another decade of fierce struggle to bring democracy back to the South. It’s not that we can’t learn from the experiences of other countries, but that our past offers an especially powerful point of comparison. Many of the same elements are in play, from the potent influence of a reactionary business elite to a major political party convinced of its singular legitimacy. A party that has already weakened our democracy to protect its power, and which shows every sign of going further should the need arise. A party that stands beside a lawless president, shielding him from accountability while he makes the government an extension of his personal will. I’m not saying a new Jim Crow is on the near horizon (or the far one, for that matter). But if we look at the actions of the political party and president now in power, if we think of how they would behave with even more control over the levers of the state, then we might be on a path that ends in something that is familiar from our past — authoritarian government with a democratic facade.

2020,Highlights From the Final Day Before Voting,"MANCHESTER — Amy Klobuchar, sounding only slightly hoarse at her fifth rally of the day, at a bar in downtown Manchester, told voters she was in the process of firing up her campaign operation in the coming Nevada caucuses — “and beyond,” she added. More than any other major candidate, Ms. Klobuchar will have to expand her organization in Nevada in a tightly compressed time frame before the Feb. 22 caucuses. She has focused overwhelmingly so far on Iowa and New Hampshire, and for most of the race has faced significant financial constraints. But a Klobuchar aide said on Monday that the campaign was shifting staff members out of Iowa and into Nevada, and Ms. Klobuchar appears to be in a stronger financial position after a post-debate infusion of online cash. “We’re so excited about tomorrow night and then to Nevada, where we’re building a big operation,” Ms. Klobuchar said. She went on to repeat a plea she has offered over the last few days, telling New Hampshire voters “this is a big deal for me here” and crediting the state with having vaulted relatively unknown or underfunded candidates into national contention in the past. Without strong finishes in both New Hampshire and Nevada — and perhaps even with them — it could be exceedingly difficult for Ms. Klobuchar to compete across the enormous Super Tuesday map in early March. But the mere fact that Ms. Klobuchar is confidently turning her attention west represents a real shift from just last week, when her fifth-place finish in Iowa seemed unlikely, on its own, to change the trajectory of her campaign. Without the intervening debate, Ms. Klobuchar could well have been headed for another likely fifth-place finish, leaving her future as a candidate in serious doubt.",The New York Times
2020,Where to Celebrate Women’s Rights This Year,"Trending To commemorate the centennial of the ratification for the women’s vote, new tours and exhibitions can be found across the country. Congress granted women the right to vote on June 4, 1919, a bittersweet moment for many who had fought for equality for decades. To commemorate the centennial of the ratification in 1920, enshrined in the 19th amendment, new tours and exhibitions can be found across the country. “There’s been a huge interest in the centennial and voting rights,” said Deborah Hughes, president of the National Susan B. Anthony Museum and House in Rochester, N.Y. This national landmark, where Anthony was arrested for voting as a woman before that activity became legal, receives over 13,000 visitors each year. The $15 daily admission for adults includes a tour, while “Votercade 2020,” a free series of daylong events with artistic and philosophical discussions, runs until Oct 3. In Seneca Falls, N.Y., well-known as the official birthplace of women’s rights, a new self-guided tour, Celebrate 100, suggests places to visit for those interested in the topic. Stops include Wesleyan Chapel (where the first convention was held in 1848), the National Women’s Hall of Fame in the rehabilitated Seneca Knitting Mill (opening this summer,) and the home of Elizabeth Cady Stanton, chief organizer of the convention. In Sherwood, N.Y., The Opendore Project, a restored Victorian dwelling that has witnessed abolitionist and suffrage activities, opens this year near the Howland Stone Store Museum. It has one of the most well-preserved collections of women’s suffrage posters in the country. Some operators have started to add relevant programming to the area in light of the centennial. JoAnn Bell of Road Scholar, a nonprofit educational travel organization, said that four new women’s suffrage trips have been added this year: Two are sold-out. “A lot of boomers have been interested in women’s rights,” she said. Each six-day trip combines a visit to upstate New York with classroom education and lectures (from $1,499 per person). Wisconsin, Illinois and Michigan — the first to ratify the 19th amendment — have created exhibitions highlighting local heroines. “All these states had a history with women’s rights; the race to get to Washington was a nationwide event,” said Christian Overland, who oversees the Wisconsin Historical Museum in Madison, Wis. An exhibition, “We Stand on Their Shoulders” opens this month and will run through the end of the year. Narratives of pioneers like Olympia Brown, who attempted to vote as early as 1887, and Ada James, who spearheaded a state campaign, are spotlighted. Visitors will see photographs, newspaper clippings and a diary of Carrie Chapman Catt, the founder of the League of Women Voters who hailed from Ripon. “We also have the telegram that Jessie J. Hooper received stating that Wisconsin had ratified the right for women to vote,” said Mr. Overland. Hooper became the first president of the Wisconsin League of Women Voters. Admission to the museum is free and the exhibition is on the fourth floor; free guided tours are available with a reservation. Montgomery, Ala., typically attracts visitors who come for the civil rights history, but Michelle Browder who started her company, More Than Tours five years ago, will do a special version of her walking and trolley tour in March by focusing on women’s rights. She starts in the heart of the city where slave auctions were held. Visitors will then learn about the black women who shaped the civil rights movement and see the home of Georgia Gilmore (she helped fund the Montgomery Bus Boycott by selling food), the apartment of Rosa Parks and meet Butler Browder, son of the African-American activist Aurelia Browder. “Aurelia Browder’s son is going to give a story that no one has heard about his mother, and how she was overlooked,” said Ms. Browder. Two-hour tours are $69.90 per person and are offered daily except on Mondays. National museums and institutions have created exhibitions to mark the centennial and procession that took place on Pennsylvania Avenue in 1913. The Library of Congress unveiled Shall Not Be Denied: Women Fight for the Vote that runs through September. It shows papers and records of Susan B. Anthony and Mary Church Terrell, an African-American activist who championed racial equality. More than 400,000 people have visited the exhibition already; it’s free to the public. The Smithsonian highlights women’s achievements in its Creating Icons: How We Remember Women’s Suffrage exhibition, opening on March 6. The curator Lisa Kathleen Graddy said it invites audiences “to explore the creation of the traditional story that emphasizes the contributions of Anthony, but also those who have been forgotten or silenced over time.” On June 10, the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, Pa., opens an exhibition, “The 19th Amendment: How Women Won the Vote” that features nearly 100 artifacts from the era, including a rare printing of the Declaration of Sentiments, a document signed from the first convention at Seneca Falls that demanded equality with men. “The right to vote is life-changing, but it didn’t come without a struggle,” said Mr. Overland, commenting on the reform as a whole. 52 PLACES AND MUCH, MUCH MORE Discover where you should go in 2020, and find more Travel coverage by following us on Twitter and Facebook.

2020,Where to Stream ‘Parasite’ and Other Big Oscar Winners,"Nearly all of the night’s winners are available online to stream, rent or buy. Here’s at look at what they are and where to find them. [Need help deciding what to watch on Netflix, Disney Plus or other streaming services? Subscribe to our Watching newsletter, which arrives twice weekly in your inbox.] For Oscar viewers eager to catch up with Bong Joon Ho’s “Parasite,” the first-ever non-English-language film to win Best Picture, the timing could not be better for streaming, because it’s just become available for rental. In fact, save for “Little Women,” “1917” and “Bombshell,” which only won in technical categories, every Oscar winner is currently streaming for a fee in digital media stores or on subscription services, and two of the three shorts are posted for free on YouTube. Bong’s twisty genre hybrid about a con that metastasizes into class warfare should be a priority, but it will be easier than usual to find out if the Academy got it right. transcript “Hello, this is Bong Joon Ho, director of ‘Parasite.’ This is the story about infiltration. One family infiltrates to other family. This is in the middle of that process. —that kind of moment.” “Simply speaking, it’s just something like ‘Mission: Impossible,’ the TV series when I was a little kid. I was a huge fan. And this some kind of nerdy family version of ‘Mission: Impossible.’” “In this moment for the young son, he is kind of manipulator. He controls everything. And he has a plan. When they rehearse, it looks like a kind of filmmaking. It is like the son is director, the father is the actor.” “I intentionally shoot those shots very quickly and some very spontaneous reaction and sudden, small, improvised. And something happened very naturally. Rolling the camera, that kind of momentary feeling is very important.” Won for: Best picture, director, original screenplay, international feature Where to watch: Rent it on iTunes, Amazon, Vudu, Google Play and YouTube. An underclass family infiltrates the home of a much wealthier clan in Bong Joon Ho’s impeccably orchestrated allegory about social inequality, which mixes and matches black comedy, social satire and the white-knuckle tension of a thriller. The less known about the plot, the better, given the escalating series of twists that Bong pulls off as the lives of his characters become more closely intertwined. His willingness to play with different genres and tones will be familiar to fans of his previous work, like “The Host” and “Snowpiercer,” (see where to stream those here) but rarely have they been more smoothly integrated. [Read the New York Times review.] transcript Hi, this is Todd Phillips. I’m the director of “Joker.” So this scene is interesting because it’s right after a life-changing cataclysmic event in Arthur’s life, and he’s found this little kind of rundown park bathroom to go in and collect his thoughts and get himself together. What’s interesting about this scene to me is it’s entirely different than what we had scripted. In the script, Arthur was to come into the bathroom, hide his gun, wash off his makeup, and staring at himself in the mirror like what have I done. And when we got to the set on the day, Joaquin and I just sort of stood around like, this doesn’t really seem very Arthur. Why would Arthur care to hide his gun? And we really kind of tossed around a million ways to just do something different. And it was about an hour into it and I said, hey, you know, I got this piece of music from Hildur. Hildur Gudnadottir is our composer, and she’d been sending me music throughout, while we were shooting. And I just wanted to play Joaquin this piece of music. And Joaquin just started to dance to the music, and it was just me and him alone in the bathroom. There’s 250 people on the crew waiting outside. And he just starts doing this dance, and we both kind of look at each other and said, O.K., that’s the scene. It made sense to us because when I first met with Joaquin and we first started talking about “Joker,” I talked to him that Arthur is one of those people that has music in him. So music and dance became a theme in the film. And this is the second time we see him dancing, and it’s a little bit of Joker coming out, a little bit more than the scene before and a little bit less than the next time we see him dance. [MUSIC PLAYING] Won for: Best actor, original score Where to watch: Rent it on iTunes, Amazon, Vudu, Google Play and YouTube. Films based on DC Comics have tended to go darker than their Marvel counterparts, but “Joker” goes one step further, dispensing of the standard conflicts between hero and villain in favor of a deeper sociological bent. Anchored by Joaquin Phoenix’s performance as Arthur Fleck, a part-time clown and full-time mope who lives with his ailing mother in Gotham City, the film grafts the urban alienation of Martin Scorsese’s “Taxi Driver” and “The King of Comedy” onto the origin story of DC’s most famous villain. Where Heath Ledger’s Joker in “The Dark Knight” reflects a broken system, Phoenix’s Joker is the product of it.

The Academy loves a splashy biopic performance, and Renée Zellweger locks into a doozy in Judy Garland, the transcendently gifted singer and actress whose triumphs on stage and screen were darkened by mental health issues and substance abuse. Rather than cover the full scope of her life, “Judy” focuses on her last year, when Garland’s sour reputation in America brings her to London in 1968. There, her efforts to revive her career are undermined by her persistent addiction. Zellweger captures both her vulnerably and her volatility as she struggles to put on one last great show.

When it was announced that Quentin Tarantino was going to make a film about Charles Manson and the Sharon Tate murders, surely no one expected anything like “Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood,” which builds to that fateful night on Cielo Drive, but approaches it from a side angle. Through the fictional characters of the fading Western star Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his faithful stunt double Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt), Tarantino revivifies Hollywood in the summer of ’69 and captures its turbulent undercurrents with the sensitivity of a seismograph. Before the inevitable spasms of violence, the film is a bittersweet elegy for the end of an era.

Divorce has colored the life and work of the writer-director Noah Baumbach, and he brings all that experience to bear on “Marriage Story,” a comedy-drama about the agonies and possibilities of uncoupling. Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson are both superb as a creative couple who cannot come to terms amicably on their own, so they engage in an emotionally and financially costly legal dispute. Baumbach makes an enemy of the process, which brings out the worst in both of them, but even the lawyers have a human dimension, especially Laura Dern as a powerful L.A. attorney who approaches the job with empathy and aggression.

Turning Adolf Hitler into a little boy’s imaginary friend sounds like an unworkable conceit, but Taika Waititi’s nervy crowd-pleaser treats Der Führer as a Beatles-like phenomenon that whipped young people like Jojo Betzler (Roman Griffin Davis) into a nationalist frenzy. Jojo’s time in a Hitler Youth camp is like watching “Moonrise Kingdom” with Nazis, but Waititi undercuts the absurdity by detailing the boy’s relationship with a Jewish girl his mother (Scarlett Johansson) has hidden behind his bedroom walls. In the battle for his conscience, Hitler proves to be a formidable adversary. [Read the New York Times review.] Won for: Best documentary Where to watch: Stream it on Netflix. When the Chinese glass company Fuyao reopens a Dayton, Ohio factory that once housed General Motors, many former G.M. employees return to the work force with the hope of renewed prosperity and cross-cultural harmony. The filmmakers Julia Reichert and Steven Bognar are present for that optimistic moment and they stay through the difficulties that follow, as differences in work ethic, employee safety and compensation open up a rift between Chinese management and disgruntled American line workers. The promise and peril of this globalist experiment is evoked through Reichert and Bognar’s compassionate eye.

The breakout character in this Pixar sequel is Forky, a humble and dimwitted little spork with pipe-cleaner arms, misaligned googly eyes and Popsicle sticks for feet. He’s a charming creation who doubles a signal for the low-stakes ambition of “Toy Story 4,” which includes the expected Rube Goldberg set pieces and heartstring-tugging of the previous three, but feels more like a stand-alone adventure. Here Woody and the gang are waylaid at a carnival, where they reunite with Little Bo Peep, but have to face the possibility that life may send them on separate destinies.

Cherry, Everett Downing Jr. and Bruce W. Smith, is about nothing more than a black father struggling to style his daughter’s seemingly untamable hair. But within that simple premise, played for equal parts whimsy and sentiment, the movie tells a story about black confidence and identity as well as the rewarding hard work of parenthood. Father and daughter don’t say a word to each other. They don’t need to. [Read a feature article on the film.] Won for: Best live-action short Where to watch: Stream it on YouTube. After three nominations for documentary Oscars — including one for “Street Fight,” about a young Cory Booker’s insurgent campaign for mayor of Newark — the director Marshall Curry finally wins one for a tight piece of short fiction that uses a “Rear Window” scenario to reflect on a rocky marriage. Maria Dizzia and Greg Keller star as the beleaguered parents of young children who naturally get jealous when a good-looking, amorous couple moves into the building across the street and doesn’t bother to put up drapes. But that grass-is-greener feeling dissipates as the strangers they’re watching turn out to have more complicated lives than they initially believe.

Founded in 2007, the nonprofit organization Skateistan has included skateboarding as part of a larger educational mission to serve disadvantaged children in Afghanistan, South Africa and Cambodia, 50% of them girls. Carol Dysinger’s 40-minute documentary short narrows the focus to Kabul, Afghanistan, where a brutal patriarchy has persisted after the Taliban. Many girls are denied access to schools and face restrictive and often violent conditions at home. At a secure facility, they’re taught how to read and write, but as the title promises, there are skateboarding lessons, too, intended to empower and delight them. transcript Hi, this is Jim Mangold, director of ‘Ford v Ferrari.’ As we begin this sequence, we’re at the top of the third act of the film, and Christian Bale, playing Ken Miles, is walking out about 10 minutes before the race begins to prepare to start a 24 hour race at Le Mans. My camera kind of tries to set up what this place looks like in the stands, and the spectacle of it. We’ve seen it earlier in the film empty, but never seen it in this moment in full flower, packed with crowds and about to go. The point for me, or the strategy here, was to kind of show the calm before the storm. There’s a lot of pageantry and everyone’s tense. Here’s Matt Damon, who plays Carroll Shelby, joining Christian, looking over the Ferrari cars as they go by, which are their chief nemesis in the race and the most brilliantly engineered cars that exist at that point, “Looks flash, don’t it?” “Eh, looks aren’t everything.” Enzo Ferrari in the stands watching over them. For me, the goal in this sequence was to show the kind of stress that everyone is living with, but playing down, going about their tasks, getting ready to start the race. “You can take ‘em. Four minutes, Ken. Four minutes, buddy.” “Live from Le Mans, France—” “Mom! Come on.” ”—it’s the world’s most—” - Alright, coming ”—brutal, torturous automobile race.” Here we see Ken Miles’ family back at home in Los Angeles watching. For all the characters you see, these Ford executives— that’s Jon Bernthal is Lee Iacocca, Enzo Ferrari— all the characters brought to this point in time with the fate and their future at stake in this race. That’s kind of the reason the whole film is building up to what becomes an almost hour long race of many chapters and many adventures, and the lead trading many times. Beautiful tradition at Le Mans that’s long since passed is that all the drivers start on the opposite side of the road from their cars. I thought this was a really unique opportunity to stage a kind of start of a race in a different way with each driver uncontained by the shell of their car, just left with their own thoughts standing there on the side of the road moments before they have to leap in the cars, turn the ignition, and begin what will be a 24-hour endurance test for them in the vehicle. [MUSIC PLAYING] [ANNOUNCER SPEAKING FRENCH] This next shot was a bear to get, but one I really wanted to get in one piece, which is feeling all the drivers leaping in and pulling out. What makes it difficult? Well, we shot with real cars, not digital ones. So getting 25 expert drivers to drive vintage and semi-vintage cars pulling out all in unison from the stands with 400 extras, is a challenge. And of course, the light’s beautiful. We waited for the right moment to do the shot. All of that to create a kind of moment of expectation as this race begins. “What happened to Miles?” [MUSIC PLAYING, TIRES SCREECHING] One of the very true and kind of interesting facts of the race that I wanted to very much replicate was that Ken Miles in his very first lap had a malfunction immediately with the door of his car. He couldn’t shut it. So he’s driving in excess of 150 miles an hour on a track with a door that won’t shut, and is already after— preparing for this race and preparing this car for so long, running into trouble in the most mundane of ways. You might notice that I’m shooting this sequence very much from the point of view of the driver or very close to the road. My goal was to somehow tell the story of an auto race, but not emulate the coverage you see on sports shows, but to put you much more behind the wheel and on the track so that you’re feeling much more what these drivers feel. Not only the harrowing nature of the speed and the thrills and the danger, but also the adrenaline and the excitement and the sense of even a kind of perfection that they’re chasing when the driving is going right for them. “Where the hell is Ken?” “I don’t know.” The actual work of the visual effects team in this sequence is much less about the cars and much more about the stands. We built about a football field length of grandstand, but obviously I couldn’t afford to shoot every day with 20,000 people in the stands, so the work of our many visual effects people are extending our backgrounds to the horizon and also populating the stands. “The bloody door won’t close. All right, all right.” I kind of saw this movie as a ‘Saving Private Ryan’ in reverse. It’s much more of a drama, I think, than many people expect when they see the film for 3/4 of the film, and we put almost all our resources into giving you kind of pretty intense action sequence at the third act of the film. “Go, go, go.” [TIRES SCREECHING, ENGINE REVVING] Won for: Best editing, sound editing Where to watch: Buy it on iTunes, Amazon, Vudu, Google Play and YouTube. The ultimate in Dad-friendly entertainment for a Sunday afternoon, James Mangold’s muscular gear head drama about the quest for supremacy between automakers in 1966 stays squarely within its lane, banking on nitro-charged racing sequences and old-fashioned star turns by Matt Damon and Christian Bale. Damon plays car designer Carroll Shelby, who’s commissioned by the Ford Motor Company to build a car fast enough to defeat the dominant Ferrari fleet at the 24 Hours of Le Mans. With the volatile Ken Miles (Bale) as his driver, Carroll and his team of engineers put together a winner through hard work, sweat and a lot of spit and bubble gum.

If this Elton John biopic feels like a more well-engineered piece of craftsmanship than last year’s Queen biopic “Bohemian Rhapsody,” it might be because Dexter Fletcher, who replaced Bryan Singer as the director of the earlier film late in production, was on board here from the beginning. “Rocketman” defies precisely none of the genre’s clichés, but the ascendence of young Reginald Dwight into the pop legend better known as Elton John is a satisfying arc nonetheless. Taron Egerton’s robust lead performance is one reason, but classic singles like “Saturday Night’s Alright for Fighting,” “Crocodile Rock” and “Your Song” give it the quality of a jukebox musical.

2020,Where to Stream ‘Spartacus’ and Other Great Kirk Douglas Movies,"The classic Hollywood star didn’t always play the hero. But whether good guy or heel, he brought a towering presence to the screen. Cast as a leading man from early in his career, Kirk Douglas, who died Wednesday at 103, commanded the screen with a booming voice and chiseled physique, but he also showed enough humility to allow for more complicated heroes — and even a couple of outright heels. At the height of his powers, Douglas broke away from his studio handlers, formed his own production company, and joined forces with Hollywood rebels and outsiders like Stanley Kubrick and Dalton Trumbo. Here are 13 films that illustrate his range, durability and swarthy magnetism. 1947 It’s a mark of Kirk Douglas’s charmed career that his second feature is widely considered a film noir staple, though his casting as a straight-up heavy would turn out to be a rarity. Of the beautiful shadows in Jacques Tourneur’s classic tale of double-crosses and bad romance, Douglas looms as the darkest, a crime boss who summons a small-town gas station attendant (Robert Mitchum) to do a job for him. The two men have a past together, when the gangster hired Mitchum’s then-private eye to track down his diabolical mistress (Jane Greer), who split to Acapulco with $40,000 of his money. The femme fatale puts them at odds. Where to watch: Rent it on iTunes, Amazon, Vudu, Google Play and YouTube. 1949 Based on a Ring Lardner short story, “Champion” is a boxing drama as tough and tormented as its hero, a poor Irishman (Douglas) who accidentally stumbles into the undercard of a fight and winds up brawling his way toward the top of the profession. Yet this isn’t the inspirational tale of an underdog made good, but a gritty film noir about an impulsive drifter whose moxie and ragged charm are short-circuited by a nasty temper and a stubborn pridefulness. When he fails to honor the dictates of the game’s corrupt elites, it threatens his career — and his life. Where to watch: Rent it on iTunes, Amazon and Vudu. 1950 As in “Champion,” Douglas plays a poor, willful iconoclast who refuses to play by the rules, but “Young Man With a Horn” has a more luscious, romantic quality, courtesy of the director Michael Curtiz (“Casablanca”). Inspired by the short and influential life of jazz soloist Bix Beiderbecke, the film starts with Rick Martin as an orphan who scrapes together enough money to buy a trumpet. Under the tutelage of an accomplished jazzman (Juano Hernández), he becomes a prodigy, but his improvisational flair, in music and in life, leads to strained relationships and a descent into alcoholism. Lauren Bacall’s turn as a woman of ambiguous sexuality is a fascinating footnote, but the alternately joyful and bittersweet performance sequences are most enduring. Where to watch: Rent it on iTunes and Amazon. 1951 Hays Code censors, Paramount Pictures and American moviegoers rejected Billy Wilder’s caustic satire in 1951, but time has only affirmed its ugly truths about tabloid journalism and its corrosive effect on society. Douglas’s willingness to play the heel, combined with his man-of-the-people charisma, made him the ideal choice to star as Chuck Tatum, a former big-city journalist who creates a media sideshow around a man trapped by a New Mexico cave-in. Feeding the story as much as reporting on it, Chuck gives himself scoop after scoop while turning the site itself into a tourist trap. “Ace in the Hole” decries journalistic malpractice, but it reserves plenty of contempt for the culture at large, which feeds off the story voraciously without thought to the human consequences Where to watch: Rent it on iTunes and Amazon. 1952 The director Vincente Minnelli’s highly charged drama about an unscrupulous movie producer and the three successful careers he both launched and sabotaged gets at the contradictions of Hollywood, where dreams are made and discarded with breathless speed. Gathered together at a studio office, a director (Barry Sullivan), an actress (Lana Turner), and a screenwriter (Dick Powell) each flash back to their experiences working with the producer (Douglas) who nurtured their talent, only to betray them. They swear off working with him again, but as the scorpion in this scorpion-and-the-frog scenario, Douglas is awfully persuasive. Where to watch: Rent it on iTunes, Amazon, Vudu, Google Play and YouTube. 1954 Photographed in CinemaScope and Technicolor, and supervised by Walt Disney himself, “20,000 Leagues Under the Sea” remains a model of Disney live-action cinema — broad, silly, colorful and loaded with wonders. The underwater discoveries of the Nautilus, a wondrous submarine commanded by the mysterious Captain Nemo (James Mason), may be the main attraction, but Douglas’s robust performance as a master whaler offered early proof that the force of his personality couldn’t be blunted by spectacle. His song-and-dance number, “A Whale of a Tale,” suggests a future in musicals that he never got around to pursuing. Where to watch: Stream it on Disney Plus. Rent it on iTunes, Amazon, Vudu, Google Play and YouTube. 1956 The same overweening passion that propels and destroys Douglas’s characters in “Champion” and “Young Man With a Horn” applies to his take on Vincent van Gogh in “Lust for Life,” a biopic that follows the artist deeper into an obsession that eventually kills him. Working again with the director Vincente Minnelli, whose eye for color aligns with van Gogh’s, Douglas opens the film as a Protestant missionary who devotes himself to helping the poor in coal country, then pivots when he discovers painting, a craft that leads to frustration, poverty and madness. “Lust for Life” is perhaps best remembered, however, for van Gogh’s contentious back-and-forth with Paul Gauguin (Anthony Quinn), a relationship in which shared interests curdle into vicious rivalry. Where to watch: Rent it on iTunes, Amazon, Vudu, Google Play and YouTube. 1957 Every bit as scabrous as his “Dr. Strangelove” — and nearly as funny, though the laughs stick in the throat — Stanley Kubrick’s antiwar film offers Douglas as a beacon of sanity and decency in the midst of an irrational, needlessly tragic situation. As leader of the 701st Regiment of the French infantry during World War I, Douglas’s Colonel Dax gets the order to attack a heavily fortified German position. When this impossible mission inevitably fails, his superiors try to save face by ordering three men to be executed for cowardice, and it’s up to Dax to defend them in court-martial. In measuring the absurdity of the situation against the human cost of war, Kubrick draws a stinging conclusion about how wars are waged and who pays the price. Where to watch: Rent it on iTunes, Amazon, Vudu, Google Play and YouTube. 1957 With slick-backed hair and an irrepressible grin, Douglas plays Doc Holliday as a quick-fingered outlaw who always has the drop on his enemies and looks pleased with his own virtuosity. “Gunfight at the O.K. Corral” pairs him with Burt Lancaster as Wyatt Earp, a lawman who steps down from his post and enlists Holliday in a showdown in Tombstone, Ariz, against the murderous Clantons. John Sturges’s unfussy telling of this famous Wild West story casts two legends-in-the-making as two legends-in-the-making and allows their chemistry to carry his diverting Western forward. Where to watch: Rent it on iTunes, Amazon, Vudu, Google Play and YouTube. 1960 Though stirring as a tribute to rebellion and justice against authoritarian rule, “Spartacus” doubles as a monument to Douglas himself: his chiseled physique, his booming voice, his noble bearing and his political sympathy toward the disenfranchised. Douglas would tweak that image throughout his career, but not in Stanley Kubrick’s sumptuous sword-and-sandal epic about a slave who leads a rebellion against the Roman republic. Spartacus isn’t a particularly rich character — Kubrick would later distance himself from the film for this reason — but the scope and grandeur of the production remains seductive, and its reputation has rightly improved since a 1991 restoration. Where to watch: Rent it on iTunes, Amazon, Vudu, Google Play and YouTube. 1962 Douglas helped end the blacklist by securing a screenplay credit for Dalton Trumbo on “Spartacus,” and their working relationship continued with this utterly unique western, which upends a conservative genre with a strong leftist bent and anticipates the revisionist westerns that would arrive later in the decade. Photographed in stark black-and-white, “Lonely Are the Brave” stars Douglas as a cowboy who first appears to be ambling through the Old West … until he directs his horse across a New Mexico highway. A rebel and an anarchist, he deliberately gets himself thrown in jail in an effort to break out a friend who’s been arrested for helping illegal immigrants. Where to watch: Rent it on iTunes, Amazon, Vudu, Google Play and YouTube. 1964 Fresh off his electrifying thriller “The Manchurian Candidate,” the director John Frankenheimer continued to engage in the insidious politics of the era with “Seven Days in May,” which imagines a plausible future when the military orchestrates a coup against a sitting American president. With Burt Lancaster as the general who spearheads the coup from his post on the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Douglas plays his Pentagon subordinate, who catches wind of the plot and works frantically behind the scenes to stop it. Frankenheimer’s no-frills, black-and-white, documentarylike style adds to the sensation that American democracy could collapse under the right circumstances. Where to watch: Rent it on iTunes, Amazon, Vudu, Google Play and YouTube. 1978 Douglas was 60 years old when “The Fury” was released to theaters, and the film’s director, Brian De Palma, allots much of his screen time to marveling over him as a physical specimen, whether he’s gunning down assailants in the Middle East or performing acrobatics across the elevated train tracks in Chicago. De Palma’s terrific follow-up to “Carrie” also delves into psychic powers, casting Douglas as a former C.I.A. agent trying to find his son, who’s been abducted by the government as part of a telekinesis program. Amy Irving plays a powerful young psychic who tries to help him, and John Cassavetes is delectably evil as the old colleague who’s behind the kidnapping.

2020,Where’s Tom Steyer? A Few People in Las Vegas Were Wondering,"Mr. Steyer did not make the cut for the Democratic debate. He was missed! LAS VEGAS — As six leading presidential candidates brawled onstage in a debate Wednesday night on the Las Vegas Strip, a handful of Nevadans supporting a man who didn’t make the cut were around seven miles away, puzzling over their evening plans. “Oh, he’s not?” asked an incredulous Cindy Yeargan, 71, when informed that the hedge fund billionaire Tom Steyer was not going to be onstage. She was preparing to walk into a Steyer campaign office here. “We were here for a debate watch!” Mary Holmes, 65, arrived soon after, also under the impression that an event was scheduled at the campaign office. “He’s a nice man,” Ms. Holmes said of Mr. Steyer. “I want to know exactly what he can do.” As Ms. Yeargan, Ms. Holmes and a few others would discover, there was not, in fact, a debate watch party happening at the campaign office, even as a truck bearing stacks of folding chairs rolled up early in the evening. But while Mr. Steyer did not poll high enough to make the debate stage this round after landing distant finishes in Iowa and New Hampshire, he has emerged as a genuine threat to a number of his rivals in South Carolina and, potentially, here in Nevada, as the largely self-funded candidate spends millions on the airwaves in both states. He is also spending his money on splashy campaign events: On Friday, he is set to rally here with the group TLC, known for 1990s hits like “No Scrubs.” Ms. Yeargan said the television advertisements had piqued her initial interest in Mr. Steyer, who was long a vocal advocate of President Trump’s impeachment and who supports progressive environmental and racial justice policies. “His environmental approach is to clean up air and water in black and brown communities,” said Jack Arte, 51, Ms. Holmes’s son. “He’s yes on reparations. Mentally — he’s helping people. It’s on his mind.” Mr. Steyer, a spokesman said, was spending the evening meeting with precinct captains and making calls to his teams around the state to encourage them in the homestretch before the caucuses. “Tonight’s debate helped one person — Donald Trump,” Mr. Steyer said in a statement after the debate, also saying it was “clear that Bloomberg is probably running in the wrong primary.” “Instead of focusing on how we can improve the lives of Americans and build a diverse coalition to beat Donald Trump,” Mr. Steyer said, “we saw a lot of bickering over policy discrepancies that won’t matter if we don’t win in November.” Some of the voters and volunteers who showed up throughout the evening at his bright office with large windows, located in a strip mall, had hoped to see Mr. Steyer discussing substantive issues with his fellow Democrats. “One of his things is the economy,” Ms. Yeargan said. “He knows it inside and out too, because he’s a businessman and can call Trump out on it.” Laura Flood, 68, said that she used to live on the same street as former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg on the Upper East Side of New York. She said she was supporting Mr. Steyer, citing his background as “a businessman” and saying “he worked extensively with race relations.” She was visiting Mr. Steyer’s office as a volunteer, arriving for training, but she also said she was curious to see how Mr. Bloomberg fared onstage, in his first debate appearance of the primary season. “He was a good neighbor,” Ms. Flood said. “A good mayor.” About a five-minute drive away, an actual debate watch party unfolded, hosted by the League of Conservation Voters and Chispa, a branch of the environmental group focused on Latinos organizing around climate action. Over nachos and pasta, attendees watched the debate and responded to candidates — especially, it often sounded, Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders — with scattered applause and approving snaps. Bertha Robledo, 85, said through an interpreter that she believed Mr. Sanders was having the strongest night, but she added that she was supporting former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. “He might have better ideas for our world,” said Ms. Robledo, a volunteer leader with Chispa and an advocate for electric school buses. “Others might be tired. Worn out.” Asked how he felt the debate was going, Joe Figlow, 70, a Buttigieg supporter, paused. “Well,” he said, laughing and saying the candidates were acting in self-defense, “It’s a lot of people getting a little nasty.” Updated Feb. 29, 2020",The New York Times

 newsletter.
 WUHAN, China — President Xi Jinping strode onstage before an adoring audience in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing less than three weeks ago, trumpeting his successes in steering China through a tumultuous year and promising “landmark” progress in 2020. “Every single Chinese person, every member of the Chinese nation, should feel proud to live in this great era,” he declared to applause on the day before the Lunar New Year holiday. “Our progress will not be halted by any storms and tempests.” Mr. Xi made no mention of a dangerous new coronavirus that had already taken tenacious hold in the country. As he spoke, the government was locking down Wuhan, a city of 11 million people, in a frantic attempt to stop the virus spreading from its epicenter. The coronavirus epidemic, which has killed more than 800 people in China as of Sunday and sickened tens of thousands, comes as Mr. Xi has struggled with a host of other challenges: a slowing economy, huge protests in Hong Kong, an election in Taiwan that rebuffed Beijing and a protracted trade war with the United States. The virus has sickened tens of thousands of people in China and a number of other countries. transcript [SPEAKING MANDARIN] I’ll say a few things. So it’s a rainy day. Very, very gloomy, rainy day. And it’s a little loud because we have to keep the windows open, because that’s the recommendation in these situations. You have to keep everything ventilated. Two weeks ago, our researcher Elsie and I went down to Wuhan, which is this major city in the center of China that has been the epicenter of the recent coronavirus outbreak. By then, it had been under lockdown for about a week. And we were really curious to see how people were faring and what was going on, especially at the hospitals there. We took the train from Beijing to Wuhan. And we got off, and what we saw was totally crazy. I mean, we’d never seen anything like it. This is a city of 11 million that had come to a complete standstill. It felt like being in a parallel reality. To see those streets completely empty was really striking. It was eerie to hear the silence. And the only time we heard anything was the occasional barking of a dog or an ambulance passing by. We were walking around this hospital and we walked into the courtyard in front of the outpatient department. And that’s where we came upon this very jarring scene. You had 30 or so patients that were all kind of sitting quietly in the courtyard, all hooked up to IV drips that were hanging from tree branches or in their cars. [SPEAKING MANDARIN] We meet this mother and her two children who are all hooked up to IVs. The mother’s name is Yang Ling. [SPEAKING MANDARIN] They tell me that they are actually a family of six. There’s Yang Ling. There is her husband, her husband’s parents and then their son and their daughter. And they have all been staying together. And she tells us that their grandmother got sick first and one by one, each of them has gotten infected by the coronavirus. And now, her husband is the only one that doesn’t have coronavirus. [SPEAKING MANDARIN] And then they tell me that just one week after the grandmother started showing symptoms, their grandfather died. [SPEAKING MANDARIN] She tells us that after the grandfather dies, the funeral home comes to take the body away — [SPEAKING MANDARIN] — and he is cremated immediately. And she says that — [SPEAKING MANDARIN] — he was taken away just like a dead dog or a dead pig. [SPEAKING MANDARIN] As she’s talking, her voice is starting to carry across the courtyard outside this hospital. And other people are starting to listen in and crowd around us, and she’s starting to get more and more upset. She was so palpably angry that at one point — [SPEAKING MANDARIN] — the mother was waving her arms around in frustration and almost ripped the IV needle out of her hand. [SPEAKING MANDARIN] I’ve been covering China for seven years. And I’ve heard people express frustrations with the government before, but really only in private. This was one of the few times that I’ve heard such raw anger toward the government publicly. [SPEAKING MANDARIN] And she basically says, is this really my country or is this some kind of [EXPLETIVE] up country — a country that doesn’t take care of anything? [SPEAKING MANDARIN]. And then she says, what kind of government is this? And after hearing that, that made me think that something was happening that was bigger than just an outbreak of a virus. From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” Today: Inside China, what began as a story of fear over the coronavirus has now become the story of fury over the government’s handling of the crisis. Beijing correspondent Amy Qin on what she saw in Wuhan. It’s Thursday, February 13. Amy, what is it about this moment that you think is making people like the Zhang family feel free to speak out about their anger and to pretty explicitly criticize the Chinese government? So for the Zhang family, this is for them a matter of life or death. And it was a common feeling I heard throughout the city. But there’s another added frustration boiling across the rest of the country about how the government is handling this crisis. And for them, it’s really been captured in the story of this doctor named Dr. Li Wenliang. And who is this doctor? So Li Wenliang is an eye doctor at a hospital in Wuhan. And he had heard about this virus back in December that was going around the hospitals in the city. And so he went on WeChat, which is this big social messaging platform, and sent in a private messaging group with some of his med school classmates a text message basically warning them to protect themselves. And a few days later after he sent that message, he was actually called in by the police in Wuhan. They brought him into the police station and they made him sign a statement saying that he was spreading false and illegal information — basically, that he was spreading rumors. Authorities say it is untrue and eight people were detained for spreading fake news online and no medical staff had been infected. But of course, it wasn’t a rumor. Chinese health authorities are still working to identify the virus behind a pneumonia outbreak in the central city of Wuhan. By the time Dr. Li was brought into the police station, 41 people had the coronavirus. And from there, it just spread. A SARS-like virus, which has infected hundreds in China, has now reached the United States. Now China has announced the first death from an outbreak of pneumonia caused by an unidentified virus. 121 people are under medical observation in Wuhan. Rumors on social media alleged that the outbreak in Wuhan could be linked to SARS. The World Health Organization says it’s a new type of coronavirus. And Amy, at this point, what is happening to Dr. Li? So after Dr. Li gets taken into the police station and forced to sign this statement, he was actually treating a patient for glaucoma. And she wasn’t showing any symptoms at the time, but he ended up contracting the virus from her. Wow. And from his sickbed, he starts to speak out again. In a matter of days, Dr. Li Wenliang went from treating patients to becoming one. He gives some interviews to Chinese media and he starts to become this public figure. Struggling to communicate, Li spoke with CNN briefly by phone. You can hear the hospital machines pulsing in the background. He becomes known as a whistleblower — Whistleblowers silenced by police. Calls for Li and the others to be vindicated grew online. — that the government didn’t act fast enough on information that they were given, and that they had missed this critical window of opportunity to get the outbreak under control. China’s Supreme Court even weighed in, adding quote, “It might have been a fortunate thing if the public had listened to this rumor at the time.” But for many — So he’s becoming a kind of spokesperson for a lot of frustrations. Exactly. [INAUDIBLE] [COUGHING] And so at this point, it just feels like there is no light at the end of the tunnel. Now, the death toll in the outbreak of a new coronavirus in China has jumped to 17. Hundreds of people have been diagnosed with a deadly virus known as the 2019 novel coronavirus. Overall, there are now more than 31,500 confirmed cases worldwide. More and more people are getting sick. We’re seeing the numbers just surge every day — 600 deaths. — people who are confirmed cases of the coronavirus, people who are dying of the coronavirus. Has jumped to more than 700. Everything felt so uncertain. Officials are imposing restrictions on travel out of Wuhan, China. And 13 cities in lockdown this morning. Near-empty shelves line supermarkets. A need for masks and protective suits. China’s health minister, Ma Xiaowei, has said that he expects infections to continue to rise. And of course, that has everyone here in the country even more nervous. The citizens are actually freaking out. China right now is being massively rocked by anger. And the State Department has said it is chartering a flight to evacuate Americans out of Wuhan. Justin, though, will not be on that — So foreign governments started pulling their citizens out of Wuhan, and that’s when I got the call. So it was late last week, and I had been on the phone all day with my editors. And I get a final call saying you need to go to the airport. There was one flight left that was being arranged by the U.S. State Department to go back to the U.S., so I start scrambling. I leave all my masks, my disinfectant wipes, my hazmat suit, my gloves with my colleagues. And then it’s about a 40-minute drive to the airport. O.K. So I am at the airport in Wuhan now. And it’s been a crazy, hectic day. I think that the next few weeks in quarantine on a military base will bring its own interesting moments. And what is the scene at the airport? The scene at the airport was a little bit frenzied. I mean, at this point, these are really some of the last flights out for these countries who are evacuating their citizens, so it wasn’t just the Americans. There were also the Canadians, the Japanese. And we didn’t even know at that point where they were taking us to. So I’m in the airport lobby and I’m waiting for my flight. And then my phone starts to buzz, and I’m seeing all these messages come through. And I look at them, and then I see that Dr. Li has just died. And I could sense that this was going to be a big moment, because I had started overhearing people talking about it in the airport terminal. But then I just had to leave. I had to get on the flight. We’ll be right back. So Amy, Dr. Li has died from the very virus that he alerted the government to, and you’re on a plane back to the U.S. from Wuhan. So what happens once you land? So once I land, I find that I am at the Miramar Marine base in San Diego, California. I’m carted off to quarantine, and then I turn on my phone and I start going through my messages. And I see this huge upswelling of outrage over Dr. Li’s death. People from every stripe of the political or social spectrum in China — so you have people who are business people, who are blue-collar workers, artists, lawyers — they’re all posting about Dr. Li’s death. And I’ve never seen people come together like this before — and people were so upset about his death. And what are they saying? A lot of people were posting candle emojis and other kinds of remembrances for Dr. Li. They were posting photos of him. He had taken a selfie of himself wearing a surgical mask and someone had recreated that image to replace the surgical mask with barbed wire to kind of indicate that he had been muzzled. Some people were posting the anthem from “Les Mis,” “Do you hear the people sing? Singing a song of angry men?” Wow. We actually saw the hashtag “I want freedom of speech” trending for five hours, which of course, it was quickly censored. And we saw petitions going up by Chinese academics calling for freedom of speech. And we even saw a local government social media account posting a portrait of Dr. Li, along with the lines, “Heroes don’t fall from the sky. They’re just ordinary people who step forward.” Wow. So the reaction is really remarkable. I mean, even the hospital where Dr. Li died posted an official notice of his death. And that had three million reactions and 300,000 comments. And so it was so clear that this was something that had really tapped into the frustration that was happening. And what do you make of those reactions? Because it feels like it no longer is really just about this virus and the way that it was handled? Yeah so at this point, it is clear that this is becoming so much bigger than just the virus. This is really about the government and this social contract that the people have had with the government, where they agree to keep silent as long as the government provides for their prosperity and health. It operates under this principle of stability at all costs. Right. And in their effort to create stability, in fact, they did the opposite. Yeah. I mean, I think that there’s this realization definitely that there is something wrong with the system. And I don’t think that it means that people are going out in the streets and calling for a revolution. But the fact that people are calling for freedom of speech, I mean, that’s really what this brought out. People in China are already used to a pretty high level of censorship, but when it comes to censoring a warning about public health, that goes too far. And the reaction is so overwhelming that the government quickly realizes that they need to do something. And that’s when we see China’s leader Xi Jinping come forward out of the shadows and try to take control of the situation [SPEAKING CHINESE] [LAUGHTER] He comes out and makes an appearance in Beijing. [SPEAKING CHINESE] He visits a community center and a hospital. He gets his temperature taken. He talks with local residents. [SPEAKING CHINESE] And he does a video conference with doctors in Wuhan. [SPEAKING CHINESE] [APPLAUSE] So by this point, the government has sent the nation’s top anti-corruption agency to go down to Wuhan and investigate Dr. Li’s death. And state media is calling Dr. Li a hero. This feels like a real shift for a government that originally reprimanded Dr. Li and is now sending a team to investigate why he was muzzled. It feels like a concession. It is. But at the same time, we have to remember that this is also part of the party’s ethos, which is to always try to control the narrative. And for them, the path of least resistance in this situation is to hold Dr. Li up as a hero, but also to do it in a way that coheres with the party narrative. Huh. Erasing the parts that might challenge their legitimacy or authority, which is the fact that he was punished by the government for trying to call attention to the fact that there was this virus going around. Do you think that the people in China view the government’s response as an attempt to protect them from the virus or to protect the government from the story of a situation that’s out of control? Both. People really believe that the government wants to get this epidemic under control. But at the same time, they know that the government is only going to do this in a way that does not threaten its own hold on power. And that means taking control of the narrative — sending in their own journalists to make sure that only the positive aspects of what they’re doing is being highlighted, and that people who are slipping through the cracks or all the failures of the policy are not being highlighted. Amy, I’m curious. Have you been able to speak to the Zhang family since you evacuated, since you took that flight from Wuhan to California? We have. The last time we checked in with them, their situation had changed. The mother and the daughter were both infected with the coronavirus and have finally been able to get into one of the makeshift quarantine centers set up by the government. Bella, the daughter, sent us a video of the center, and it just shows a huge exhibition center with beds crowded tightly together and all these sick patients in these beds. Meanwhile, Bella’s brother and their grandmother are still at home back in the family apartment sick and unable to get into a hospital. The grandmother is in very serious condition. She can barely get out of bed. And they’re also still living with their father, who is the only family member who hasn’t gotten infected so fae. Though they all think that it will be a matter of time. So basically, half the family is being cared for and the other half have been kind of abandoned. Right. And remember, their grandfather had died in their family apartment and was taken to be cremated immediately. And they still don’t even know where his ashes are. Is the reality that another death in the family could happen something that they are preparing for? Yes, they’ve been planning for it. They told us that when the grandmother dies, they’re not going to let her go to the crematorium. But actually, the mother said she’s going to drag her body to the local neighborhood committee and just put it there on the front steps to show them how their inaction has devastated their entire family. Do you know whether the family knows about Dr. Li’s death, or if they were able to watch that video of Xi Jinping in public addressing the situation? I think if they’ve seen, it’s barely registered. They are so consumed with just trying to survive right now, like so many other people in Wuhan, that they’re just putting their heads down trying to move forward. Amy, thank you very much. Thanks, Michael. On Thursday, nearly 15,000 new cases of coronavirus were added to the tally of infected people in the Chinese province where Wuhan is located — the largest one-day increase of the epidemic so far. That brings the total number of cases to more than 48,000. At the same time, 242 new deaths were also reported, bringing the total death toll in the province to 1,310. We’ll be right back. Here’s what else you need to know today. For the second day in a row, President Trump intervened in the prosecution of his longtime friend and adviser, Roger Stone, this time by attacking the judge in the case. On Tuesday, at the president’s urging, the Department of Justice recommended a more lenient prison sentence for Stone, who was convicted of obstructing a congressional investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. That move prompted four federal prosecutors to leave the case in protest. On Wednesday, Trump claimed without evidence in a tweet that the judge who will sentence Stone is biased against the president in what Democratic lawmakers said was a clear attempt to intimidate the judge before she sentences Stone. The president ran against the swamp in Washington, a place where the game is rigged by the powerful to benefit them personally. I ask my fellow Americans, what is more swampy, what is more fetid, what is more stinking than the most powerful person in the country literally changing the rules to benefit a crony guilty of breaking the law? In response, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called for an investigation into Trump’s conduct. As a result, I have formally requested that the inspector general of the Justice Department investigate this matter immediately. That’s it for “The Daily.” I’m Michael Barbaro. See you tomorrow. Now, Mr. Xi faces an accelerating health crisis that is also a political one: a profound test of the authoritarian system he has built around himself over the past seven years. As the Chinese government struggles to contain the virus amid rising public discontent with its performance, the changes that Mr. Xi has ushered in could make it difficult for him to escape blame. “It’s a big shock to the legitimacy of the ruling party. I think it could be only second to the June 4 incident of 1989. It’s that big,” said Rong Jian, a writer about politics in Beijing, referring to the armed crackdown on Tiananmen Square protesters that year. “There’s no doubt about his control over power,"" he added, “but the manner of control and its consequences have hurt his legitimacy and reputation.” Mr. Xi himself has recognized what is at stake, calling the outbreak “a major test of China’s system and capacity for governance.” Updated Feb. 26, 2020 Yet as China’s battle with the coronavirus intensified, Mr. Xi put the country’s No. 2 leader, Li Keqiang, in charge of a leadership group handling the emergency, effectively turning him into the public face of the government’s response. It was Mr. Li who traveled to Wuhan to visit doctors. Mr. Xi, by contrast, receded from public view for several days. That was not without precedent, though it stood out in this crisis, after previous Chinese leaders had used times of disaster to try to show a more common touch. State television and newspapers almost always lead with fawning coverage of Mr. Xi’s every move. That retreat from the spotlight, some analysts said, signaled an effort by Mr. Xi to insulate himself from a campaign that may falter and draw public ire. Yet Mr. Xi has consolidated power, sidelining or eliminating rivals, so there are few people left to blame when something goes wrong. “Politically, I think he is discovering that having total dictatorial power has a downside, which is that when things go wrong or have a high risk of going wrong, then you also have to bear all the responsibility,” said Victor Shih, an associate professor at the University of California San Diego who studies Chinese politics. Much of the country’s population has been told to stay at home, factories remain closed and airlines have cut service. Experts warn that the coronavirus could slam the economy if not swiftly contained. The government is also having trouble controlling the narrative. Mr. Xi now faces unusually sharp public discontent that even China’s rigorous censorship apparatus has been unable to stifle entirely. The death of an ophthalmologist in Wuhan, Dr. Li Wenliang, who was censured for warning his medical school classmates of the spread of a dangerous new disease in December, has unleashed a torrent of pent-up public grief and rage over the government’s handling of the crisis. Chinese academics have launched at least two petitions in the wake of Dr. Li’s death, each calling for freedom of speech. State media still portray Mr. Xi as ultimately in control, and there’s no sign that he faces a serious challenge from within the party leadership. The crisis, though, has already tainted China’s image as an emerging superpower — efficient, stable and strong — that could eventually rival the United States. How much the crisis might erode Mr. Xi’s political standing remains to be seen, but it could weaken his position in the longer run as he prepares to take a likely third term as Communist Party general secretary in 2022. In 2018, Mr. Xi won approval to remove the constitutional limits on his term as the country’s president, making his plan for another five-year term seem all but certain. If Mr. Xi comes out of this crisis politically insecure, the consequences are unpredictable. He may become more open to compromise within the party elite. Or he may double down on the imperious ways that have made him China’s most powerful leader in generations. “Xi’s grip on power is not light,” said Jude Blanchette, the Freeman Chair in China Studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “While the ham-fisted response to this crisis undoubtedly adds a further blemish to Xi’s tenure in office,” Mr. Blanchette added, “the logistics of organizing a leadership challenge against him remain formidable.” In recent days, despite a dearth of public appearances, state media have portrayed Mr. Xi as a tireless commander in chief. This week they began calling the government’s fight against the virus the “people’s war,” a phrase used in the official readout of Mr. Xi’s telephone call with President Trump on Friday. There are increasing signs that the propaganda this time is proving less than persuasive. The Lunar New Year reception in Beijing where Mr. Xi spoke became a source of popular anger, a symbol of a government slow to respond to the suffering in Wuhan. Mr. Xi and other leaders appear to have been caught off guard by the ferocity of the epidemic. Senior officials would almost certainly have been informed of the emerging crisis by the time national health authorities told the World Health Organization on Dec. 31, but neither Mr. Xi nor other officials in Beijing informed the public. Mr. Xi’s first acknowledgment of the epidemic came on Jan. 20, when brief instructions were issued under his name. His first public appearance after the lockdown of Wuhan on Jan. 23 came two days later, when he presided over a meeting of the Communist Party’s top body, the Politburo Standing Committee, which was shown at length on Chinese television. “We’re sure to be able to win in this battle,” he proclaimed. Back then, the death toll was 106. As it rose, Mr. Xi allowed other officials to take on more visible roles. Mr. Xi’s only appearances have been meeting foreign visitors in the Great Hall of the People or presiding over Communist Party meetings. On Jan. 28, Mr. Xi met with the executive director of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, and told Dr. Tedros that he “personally directed” the government’s response. Later reports in state media omitted the phrase, saying instead that Mr. Xi’s government was “collectively directing” the response. Since nothing about how Mr. Xi is portrayed in state media happens by accident, the tweak suggested a deliberate effort to emphasize shared responsibility. Mr. Xi did not appear on official broadcasts again for a week — until a highly scripted meeting on Wednesday with the authoritarian leader of Cambodia, Hun Sen. There is little evidence that Mr. Xi has given up power behind the scenes. Mr. Li, the premier in formal charge of the leadership group for the crisis, and other officials have said that they take their orders from Mr. Xi. The group is filled with officials who work closely under Mr. Xi, and its directives emphasize his authority. “The way the epidemic is being handled now from the top just doesn’t fit with the argument that there’s been a clear shift toward more collective, consultative leadership,” said Holly Snape, a British Academy Fellow at the University of Glasgow who studies Chinese politics. The scale of discontent and the potential challenges for Mr. Xi could be measured by repeated references online to the nuclear accident at Chernobyl. Many of them came under the guise of viewer reviews of the popular television mini-series of the same name, which is still available for streaming inside China. “In any era, any country, it’s the same. Cover everything up,” one reviewer wrote. The Soviet Union of 1986, however, was a different country than China in 2020. The Soviet state was foundering when Chernobyl happened, said Sergey Radchenko, a professor of international relations at Cardiff University in Wales who has written extensively on Soviet and Chinese politics. “The Chinese authorities, by contrast, are demonstrating an ability to cope, a willingness to take unprecedented measures — logistical feats that may actually increase the regime’s legitimacy,” he added. Mr. Radchenko compared Mr. Xi’s actions to those of previous leaders in moments of crisis: Mao Zedong later in the Cultural Revolution or Deng Xiaoping after the Tiananmen Square crackdown. “He’s doing what Mao and Deng would have done in similar circumstances: stepping back into the shadows while remaining firmly in charge.” Chris Buckley reported from Wuhan, and Steven Lee Myers from Beijing.

2020,Where’s the Best Place to Recover From Divorce?,"Calculator Just in time for Valentine’s Day, a new study finds the cities where you’re most likely to mend a broken heart. For the recently divorced, recovering one’s financial footing is often a priority — perhaps even more than finding new love. But how well people overcome the end of a marriage might depend on where they live, according to a new study by the website LendingTree. Using data drawn from the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2018 American Community Survey, the study determined scores for the nation’s 50 largest metro areas in three categories — one economic, two relationship-based — to arrive at a list of the best and worst places to bounce back from divorce. The economic category comprised three factors: the median income of divorced people and how it compared with that of other one-income families; homeownership rates among the divorced and the associated costs; and expenses faced by renters. One relationship category looked at the local dating pool, considering the percentage of single people in a given city and the gender balance. The other relationship category looked at each city’s “remarriage risk factor.” A higher percentage of residents who had been married at least three times lowered scores, as did a larger portion of divorced and separated people in general. The worst city in which to recover from divorce turned out to be New York, which is expensive and has fewer people, per capita, in the dating pool, according to the study. Minneapolis, with an excellent economic score, topped the list. Milwaukee was next, with excellent remarriage risk-factor scores. Detroit was third, also bolstered by its economic score. So sign the papers and head to the Midwest, perhaps, where the living is easier and the loving is better … according to the study. Below, the study’s 10 best and 10 worst cities, and their scores in each category. Each city’s scores (out of 100 points) in each of three categories. BEST DATING POOL REMARRIAGE RISK ECONOMY 1.

2020,"Whether Oscar-Nominated or Not, Black Actresses Will Throw Their Own Party","At two events during Oscar week, these stars spoke candidly about an awards season that sometimes excludes them. On Wednesday night, at a house party high in the Hollywood Hills, Alfre Woodard was trying to gather some of the world’s most talented black actresses for a group picture. “This is what we’re going to do,” she told a bustling crowd that included Cynthia Erivo, S. Epatha Merkerson, Lorraine Toussaint and Tiffany Haddish. As Woodard surveyed all the women, her eyes landed on the 21-year-old actress Amandla Stenberg, who had been chatting nearby with fellow ingénues Laura Harrier and KiKi Layne. “Amandla, hi, darling!” Woodard cooed to her, before joking to the rest of the crowd, “We’re going to have a kids’ table.” For the last 11 years, Woodard has been throwing this pre-Oscars party, which she named the Sistahs’ Soirée. “I’m gathering women who have been nominated in the acting category by the academy,” she explained over champagne, “as well as those who, in a perfect world, should have been.” That imagined world is often at odds with the real one, where two straight years of all-white acting nominees at the Oscars prompted the academy to launch a 2016 initiative meant to diversify its membership. Progress has come in fits and starts: Though a record number of black people took home Oscars at last year’s ceremony, the only actor of color nominated this year was Erivo, for her performance in the slavery drama “Harriet.” At the BAFTA Awards in London earlier this month, where Erivo was snubbed and all 20 acting slots were given to white actors, the best-actor winner Joaquin Phoenix even used his acceptance speech to challenge audience members about the ways they benefit from and perpetuate a system of white privilege. “I’m ashamed to say that I’m part of the problem,” Phoenix said, in remarks that went viral on social media. “It needed to be said,” Erivo told me at the Sistahs’ Soirée. “And it needed to be said by someone like him, because people like me are saying it all the time and it doesn’t get heard.” An Oscar nominee herself for the 1983 film “Cross Creek,” Woodard is no stranger to the joys and frustrations of awards season: She co-starred in the 2014 best-picture winner “12 Years a Slave” and earned Oscar buzz this past year for her lead performance in the death-row drama “Clemency.” Woodard was pleased that “Clemency” earned nominations from the Independent Spirit Awards, but when I asked how she felt about her performance being excluded from this year’s Oscar lineup, she demurred. “You know, it’s something entirely separate from what we do,” she said. “I liken it to the baby contests back in the Southwest when I was growing up. It was kind of a hilarious thing: ‘Look at this baby with the nice plump legs!’” Though the Sistahs’ Soirée orbits the Oscars, Woodard said that her goal was to foster camaraderie, not competition. “It’s important to me that when we hear our sisters’ names, we think good thoughts and feel protective of them,” she said, “so that we don’t get into that bogus sense of competition that the business wants to put you in by saying, ‘Too bad there’s only three roles for black women this year,’ and then they send everybody from KiKi Layne to Cicely Tyson up for the same role.” Sipping a glass of champagne, Woodard noted that Lupita Nyong’o, who won an Oscar for “12 Years a Slave” six years ago, was not handed a starring role until the horror film “Us” last year. “She is still the great mahogany hope, but you’ve seen Lupita more on magazine covers than you have onscreen,” Woodard said. “Every time out, Lupita is fabulous, but look at what she’s done since she won that Oscar and then look at the opportunities of a Scarlett or a Charlize.” To change the system, Woodard said, a black actress will need not just fierce advocates but also the sort of support that the Sistahs’ Soirée is uniquely positioned to provide. “If there’s 100 roles in a year for women on film, we should be up for 99 of those roles,” Woodard said. “We’ll let the Cates have the queens of England.” The next day, at a luncheon thrown by Essence to celebrate black women in Hollywood, Woodard was still beaming. She watched from her front-row table as one of the honorees, the “Queen & Slim” director Melina Matsoukas, told the crowd: “It feels incredible to be seen, respected, and have your work valued. It means more when that acknowledgment comes from your own community.” And when the “Pose” actress Mj Rodriguez began to cry onstage, Woodard darted out of her seat to sneak a tissue into the younger woman’s hand. When Woodard took the stage herself to introduce the “Captain Marvel” actress Lashana Lynch, she paused for a moment to once again survey the crowd of black women. For them, the 67-year-old actress had one simple commandment. “Stay busy, my daughters,” she said into the microphone. “Stay busy, and especially stay joyful doing it.”",The New York Times
2020,Which Art Fair Is for You? Let Our Critic Be Your Guide,"One of New York’s busiest art fair seasons kicks off this week with the Art Show at the Park Avenue Armory. Nine sprawling exhibitions will follow next week. Here’s our critic’s guide. The opening of The Art Show on Thursday kicks off a carnival of New York art fairs that won’t stop until March 9. The city will host at least 10, offering hundreds of booths of modern and contemporary art, from blue chip to brand-new, and even a sampling of antiquarian books. For the gallerists, the process can be nerve-racking. But for everyone else, it’s a blast. The more you see in a given day, the better the odds you’ll discover something to love — and even if you don’t, sensory overload has a thrill of its own. And with so many of the exhibitors flying in from abroad, you can essentially travel the world in an afternoon. Just don’t think you’ll get to everything. I recommend wearing sneakers, resisting the urge to over-caffeinate, and putting two — or at most three — of these fairs on your itinerary. Here’s an overview of some of the more substantial fairs. This fair is for you if you want a little bit of everything. The organizers of the enormous Armory Show call it “the essential New York art fair,” and they’re not wrong. Now for its 26th edition, the show includes nearly 200 exhibitors from 32 countries and deftly straddles art worlds past and future. It’s not just the historical work showing alongside paintings that are practically still wet. This year, all of Pier 90 will be devoted to the increasingly fashionable practice of curator-led presentations, with sections helmed by Anne Ellegood and Jamillah James, both of the Institute of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, and Nora Burnett Abrams of the Museum of Contemporary Art Denver, among others. On Pier 94, you’ll find the same exciting cacophony of multifarious booths that longtime attendees have come to expect. March 5-8; Piers 90 and 94 at 711 12th Avenue; thearmoryshow.com. This fair is for you if you’re in it for the excitement. Now that NADA is a “gallery open” instead of a fair proper, Spring/Break stands alone as the week’s cool-kid party — young, exciting and a little chaotic. This year its 100 or so emerging galleries and independent curators, all of them bringing projects on the theme of “excess,” will be rubbing shoulders across two floors of Ralph Lauren’s former headquarters on Madison Avenue, between 58th and 59th Streets. The quality of the works may vary, but the energy is undeniable. March 3-9; 625 Madison Avenue; springbreakartshow.com. This fair is for you if what you love is being part of a community. In 2019, the New Art Dealers Alliance had the kind of realization that seems obvious in retrospect: Manhattan itself is already the world’s biggest art fair, all year round. This year’s second annual New York Gallery Open will include artist talks, performances, and more than 60 member gallerists leading tours of gallery shows in Chinatown, Chelsea and the Lower East Side. It’s your chance to get the kind of personal attention they usually reserve for high rollers. March 5-8; various locations; 212-594-0883, newartdealers.org This fair is for you if you want nothing but the best. Carefully curated and stylish to a fault, TriBeCa’s Independent tends to feel more like a biennial than a trade show, with nearly a third of its exhibitors from outside the United States. The curation cuts both ways: You can be sure all the work will look good, but you won’t get the gambler’s high that comes from hunting through a noisy crowd for a piece that really strikes you. Look out this year for confidently colorful painting, especially the charming intricacies of the self-taught artist Dorothy Iannone, curvy brass sculpture by Hanna Sandin, and a reprise, in case you missed her show at Canada Gallery, of Katherine Bernhardt’s E.T. paintings. March 6-8; Spring Studios at 50 Varick Street; independenthq.com/new-york. This fair is for you if you love to travel. After last year’s edition of Volta was abruptly canceled and memorably reconstituted in Chelsea, the fair returns with new ownership, a new site, and a new director, Kamiar Maleki. Bringing together artists from five continents, including the self-taught Japanese artist Ayako Rokkaku, who will spend the fair painting with her hands and feet, Volta 2020 may represent a triumphant rebirth: We won’t really know till next week, but you can find out for as little as $25, if you book before March 3. March 4-8 at Metropolitan West, 639 West 46th Street; ny.voltashow.com. (It is a short walk from The Armory Show at Piers 90 and 94.) This fair is for you if you’re a sucker for sincerity. Paper, as opposed to canvas, plaster, or steel, has a special resonance for anyone who ever went to elementary school — it’s the medium that makes us all remember when we were artists, too. For professionals, though, paper offers a thousand possibilities, from quick sketches to works as powerful and distinctive as painting on canvas. March 6-8; just north of the Manhattan Bridge at Pier 36, 299 South Street; thepaperfair.com. This art fair is for you if you love magic. For more than two decades, this gallery has been hosting a kind of art-fair tasting menu in its Bleecker Street space. (It also has a location in Paris.) Something about the size, and the timing, gives it a magical appeal — it’s like a dollhouse come to life. This year’s edition, titled “The 11 Women of Spirit, Part 1,” is a compact group show of work by 11 female artists. (Part 2 comes in May, in concert with Frieze New York.) March 2-8; Zürcher Gallery at 33 Bleecker Street; galeriezurcher.com. This fair is for you if you’re in it for the history. A signed first edition of Allen Ginsberg’s “Howl,” an invitation to Beethoven’s funeral, a first edition of Kierkegaard that’s been to space — there are plenty of reasons to go to the Park Avenue Armory for the 60th anniversary edition of the world’s premier antiquarian book fair. But if you’re committed to a fine-arts tie-in, go for the debonair brass bullet signed by Andy Warhol for his 1982 “Guns Knives Crosses” show in Madrid. (You’ll find it at Schubertiade Music & Arts LLC.) March 5-8; Park Avenue Armory at 643 Park Avenue; nyantiquarianbookfair.com.Art",The New York Times
2020,Which League Is Best? The One Your Team Is In,"Rory Smith On Soccer Only Manchester City, of the Premier League’s elite, emerged victorious in the Champions League. But does that mean English soccer is now terrible? Not really. Enjoying this newsletter every week and eager to tell your friends about it? Good. Send them this week’s edition and tell them to sign up here: nytimes.com/rory. Thank goodness for those 10 minutes, when Gabriel Jesus and Kevin de Bruyne scored, Sergio Ramos walked, the Bernabéu fell silent and Real Madrid fell apart. Until then, this had been an ignominious round of Champions League fixtures for the Premier League. Liverpool, imperious in domestic games, had lost to Atlético Madrid, failing to muster a single shot on target. Tottenham, stripped of its two most potent strikers, had lost by 1-0 at home to RB Leipzig, which was playing its first knockout game in Europe’s elite tournament. And, most damning of all, Chelsea had been swept aside by Bayern Munich, losing at home, 3-0. Bayern had made all the right noises before the game: pointing out that Chelsea had the vim and verve of youth; suggesting that perhaps the English team’s strengths might exploit their weaknesses. It was all smoke and air. If there is one thing that is worse than losing, it is being patronized before it. For 75 minutes or so, it looked as if Manchester City might complete the set for England’s representatives: four games, four defeats, no goals. Eventually, though, the superiority of Pep Guardiola’s team told. Zinedine Zidane, his Real Madrid counterpart, has never failed to win the Champions League as a coach. That record, barring a remarkable turnaround at the Etihad Stadium — a two-goal victory, without either Ramos, his captain, or the injured Eden Hazard — has about three weeks to run. The prospects of the other English teams joining Manchester City in the quarterfinals are more distant. Chelsea, it has to be assumed, will travel to Munich with no greater ambition than saving face. Tottenham’s task in Leipzig is less daunting, but its form in recent weeks is not encouraging. Liverpool’s beating Atlético at Anfield is not impossible. Getting through the evening without a resurgent Atlético scoring — meaning the reigning European champion would need three goals against Diego Simeone’s obdurate defense — is a different matter. One year after the Premier League occupied all four slots in Europe’s major finals, it might find City its lone standard-bearer at the game’s highest level. That, of course, would dovetail nicely with the theory that the Premier League this year is poorer than it has been for some time. So far, the supporting evidence has been, in short, that Liverpool has too many points, and that the remaining members of the traditional Big Six have too few. The league, the conclusion goes, must therefore be diminished. Seeing Chelsea and Tottenham, in particular, knocked out of the Champions League would lend weight to that idea. Should Liverpool go, too, it might be seen as proof that Jürgen Klopp’s team is not quite as era-defining as reported. There are three problems with all this. One is that using the health of the Big Six to discern the strength of the Premier League is flawed. There is no debate that Manchester United, Tottenham, Arsenal and Chelsea are worse than normal. But Wolves, Sheffield United and Leicester are all far better than normal. No team has quite been detached — yet — at the foot of the table, either; the points total required to stay up is likely to be higher than it has been in recent years. A league can surely be measured as much by its strength in depth as by the quality of an arbitrary number of teams at the top. Personally, I would say the Premier League was at its strongest in the late 2000s and early 2010s, when Arsenal, Liverpool, Manchester United and Chelsea all reached Champions League finals, Manchester City was starting to emerge, and Everton and Aston Villa menaced the elite. But lower down the table, teams were much less sophisticated, much less adventurous, much more pliant. Perhaps this version has a far shallower peak. Its base, though, may be sturdier. The second problem is that the Champions League is an imperfect gauge, even for supporting evidence. With different draws, or better luck with injuries, both Chelsea and Tottenham might have made it through. One year is a tiny sample size, both to establish a league’s dominance and to assess its decline. The variation in any one season is simply too great. But the third and most important problem is that the whole subject is meaningless. The English are curiously obsessed with the idea of ranking leagues. It is, I suspect, driven by the relentless, screeching marketing of the broadcasters who show Premier League games. Each one costs them somewhere in the region of $13 million for 90 minutes of action — plus VAR delays — so they are going to tell you what you are watching is pretty damn flawless, whether it is true or not. Declaring the Premier League the best in the world inevitably suggests that all the others are in some way lacking, and it is natural that fans of those leagues should bridle at the suggestion. But the reality is that all of Europe’s top five leagues are similar: perhaps not in style, but in the level of quality. That is why Atlético can beat Liverpool, and Manchester City can beat Real Madrid, and Lyon can beat Juventus. It is, in essence, why the Champions League is so exciting. The raw output — the number of goals and shots and crosses — is broadly the same. There are variations in tempo and delivery, but they are preferences brought about by cultural conditioning. One is not objectively better or worse. The only differentiating factor, at heart, is how much all of it seems to matter, and that is personal. The one that you think is best, in all likelihood, is the one that has your team in it, because that is the one that has the most crucial ingredient of all: meaning. It takes a lot to force soccer to allow events in the real world to interfere with its single-minded, self-regarding focus. Ten years ago, when the ash cloud from the Eyjafjallajokull volcano grounded flights worldwide, soccer refused to be cowed: Barcelona took the bus to Italy to play Inter Milan; Liverpool took the train to Madrid to make sure a Europa League game could go ahead. (I was on that train, as it happens. Rafa Benítez gave his media briefing in a dining car, dictaphones flying off the table with every rattle. We all had to hurry through Montparnasse station in Paris at first light to make a connection to Bordeaux. It is quite refreshing, really, to be in a position where the journalists are much more at home than the players.) The reaction to the spread of coronavirus has, thus far, been broadly the same: a few games called off in northern Italy last weekend, and Sunday’s game between Juventus and Inter — like Inter’s Europa League match on Thursday — to be played behind closed doors, but for the most part the sport’s authorities are doing all they can to get on with things. It is simultaneously an impressive level of resilience and quite remarkably pigheaded: to see the World Health Organization warning of the threat of global pandemic at the same time as fans and officials debate when, exactly, Inter will make up its fixture deficit. You do get the impression that, when the apocalypse comes, as the bombs are raining down, someone out there will be asking how, precisely, this affects the Champions League semifinals (there will definitely be people complaining about VAR). But if the virus continues to spread at the current rate, serious questions will have to be asked, not only about the viability of allowing fans to travel for European games, but also about Euro 2020 itself. The tournament is scheduled to be held across the continent, after all, with fans flying from Bilbao to Baku and every point in between. At what point do we accept that something has to give? When Zlatan Ibrahimovic left Los Angeles, and Major League Soccer, late last year, he did so with another of those relentlessly workshopped quotes that have become his trademark: “I came, I saw, I conquered.” It is hard to tell, at first glance, precisely what he conquered: He did win the newcomer of the year award in his first season with the Los Angeles Galaxy, but it is hard to imagine a man who won the league title every year between 2003 and 2016 being impressed by that. Ibrahimovic did not conquer M.L.S., not really; he didn’t even come especially close. Which — because this is not just another bit of Zlatan-skeptical polemic — suggests M.L.S., which opens its 25th season this weekend, does not always go with the script. Last year’s final was a case in point: Los Angeles F.C. was, to most, the best team in the regular season, and Ibrahimovic was the biggest name. Neither made the league’s championship game, the M.L.S. Cup final: Instead, Seattle and Toronto made it, two teams that do not seem to attract quite as much attention as they might but who have made something of a habit of getting to finals. That makes predicting things in M.L.S. hard — for the record: The Galaxy, thanks to Javier Hernández and Cristian Pavón, should go far this year, and Rodolfo Pizarro, the midfielder now at Inter Miami, caught my eye when he was at Monterrey — but that is a trait M.L.S. should lean into. Most Europeans (and, as it happens, quite a lot of North Americans) are dismissive of the standard of play in M.L.S., but it is not just quality that makes a league enjoyable: It is unpredictability, too. A game can be good because it is accomplished, and it can be good because it is entertaining. Most, if pushed, would probably rather watch the latter than the former. M.L.S. is not of the same standard as the major European leagues, but then, it does not necessarily need to be. It helps to have big names, of course, and teams that have an air of dominance. But it can be even more compelling watching those big names, those feted teams, fail. M.L.S. still offers that, and should celebrate it. It is something increasingly missing on the other side of the ocean. An interesting note from David Post, who points out that it might be harder to be a Houston Astros fan at the moment than a Manchester City one. “In the Astros’ case, it was the players themselves engaged in the misbehavior,” he wrote. “City fans can at least say the back office and money guys cheated, but that doesn’t change what happened on the pitch. For the Astros, their in-game performances are now all tainted.” I understand his logic entirely: It’s hard to think of what Manchester City did as cheating in the same way that, say, doping is cheating. It all seems too detached from the actual business of scoring goals to be quite as severe. But rules — even rules you don’t like — are rules. There is no question about my favorite line of the week, which is so good James Thurber might have written it. A hat tip to Don Karon, writing about how we should change the offside rule. “I would suggest it to be if any part of a player’s foot is onside, the player is onside,” he wrote. “Otherwise, I envision players reaching back to grab some part of a defender’s jersey to ensure that their hand is onside and, therefore, they are onside. I expect this would result in fighting.” That’s all for this week. Thanks for all the correspondence, as ever. If there’s anything urgent, I’m on Twitter.

2020,Which States Are Doing the Most Sustainable Building?,"Calculator Here’s a look at the leading states for LEED certification in 2019, a measure of energy efficiency. With January 2020 registering as the hottest January on record, 2019 the second-hottest year on record and the 2010s the hottest decade ever, climate change is becoming harder for skeptics to ignore. The Trump administration’s cuts to environmental regulations further accentuate the need for sustainable building practices. Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) is the environmental rating system most commonly used to certify buildings as environmentally sound. To attain LEED certification, buildings must be constructed to reach sustainability goals including high energy and water efficiency, low carbon emissions, a healthy indoor environment and cost savings. Last year in this space, we reported on the states (and Washington, D.C.) with the most square feet per capita of LEED-certified new construction in 2018, as reported by the nonprofit U.S. Green Building Council. The 2019 results are in, and are the subject of this week’s chart. Properties included are mixed-use high-rises, condominium and apartment buildings, and institutional and commercial properties, but not single-family homes. Colorado came out on top in 2019, up from sixth place in 2018, with 102 projects totaling 23,962,344 square feet of LEED-certified construction, or 4.76 square feet per Colorado resident. Next were Illinois and New York. Despite the national policies emerging from Washington, D.C., the district itself has adopted aggressive sustainability strategies, requiring all nonresidential public buildings to meet LEED-certification standards. Those strategies, coupled with the capital’s comparatively small population, give it more than 10 times the LEED-certified square feet of new construction per capita than any state: 52.86. (Because it’s not a state, it’s been appended to the bottom of our list.) Washington, D.C., surpassed every state in LEED-certified construction per capita in 2019.

2020,"While Stained in History, Trump Will Emerge From Trial Triumphant and Unshackled","news analysis His acquittal in the Senate assured, the emboldened president will take his victory and grievance to the campaign trail, no longer worried about congressional constraint. WASHINGTON — Ralph Waldo Emerson seemed to foresee the lesson of the Senate impeachment trial of President Trump. “When you strike at a king,” Emerson famously said, “you must kill him.” Mr. Trump’s foes struck at him but did not take him down. With the end of the impeachment trial now in sight and acquittal assured, a triumphant Mr. Trump emerges from the biggest test of his presidency emboldened, ready to claim exoneration and take his case of grievance, persecution and resentment to the campaign trail. The president’s Democratic adversaries rolled out the biggest constitutional weapon they had and failed to defeat him, or even to force a full trial with witnesses testifying to the allegations against him. Now Mr. Trump, who has said that the Constitution “allows me to do whatever I want” and pushed so many boundaries that curtailed past presidents, has little reason to fear the legislative branch nor any inclination to reach out in conciliation. “I don’t think in any way Trump is willing to move on,” said Mickey Edwards, a former Republican congressman who teaches at Princeton University. “I think he will just have been given a green light and he will claim not just acquittal but vindication and he can do those things and they can’t impeach him again. I think this is going to empower him to be much bolder. I would expect to see him even more let loose.” Impeachment will always be a stain on Mr. Trump’s historical record, a reality that has stung him in private, according to some close to him. But he will be the first president in American history to face voters after an impeachment trial and that will give him the chance to argue for the next nine months that his enemies have spent his entire presidency plotting against him to undo the 2016 election. “This was clearly a political coup d’état carried out by a group of people who were amazingly, openly dishonest and I think it’s going to be repudiated,” said former Speaker Newt Gingrich, a strong ally of the president’s. “He’s been beaten up for three solid years and he’s still standing. That’s an amazing achievement if you think about it.” Even before a final vote on the impeachment charges on Wednesday, Mr. Trump has several high-profile opportunities in the next few days to begin framing the new post-trial environment to his advantage. On Sunday, he will be interviewed by Sean Hannity of Fox News during the pregame of the Super Bowl, one of the most watched television events of the year. Then on Tuesday, he will deliver his State of the Union address from the dais in the House chamber where he was impeached in December. A senior administration official briefing reporters on Friday said the president will use his State of the Union address to celebrate “the great American comeback” and present “a vision of relentless optimism” encouraging Congress to work with him. Mr. Trump plans to pursue an agenda of cutting taxes again, bringing down prescription drug prices, completing his trade negotiations with China and further restricting immigration. From there, Mr. Trump will head back to the campaign trail, starting with a rally in New Hampshire on Feb. 10, the night before the state’s first-in-the-nation primary race, an effort to upstage the Democrats as they try to pick a nominee to face him in the fall. Democrats insist that Mr. Trump has been damaged by the evidence presented to the public that he sought to use the power of his office to illicitly benefit his own re-election chances. Even as they line up to acquit him, some Senate Republicans have acknowledged that the House managers prosecuting the case proved that Mr. Trump withheld $391 million in security aid to Ukraine as part of an effort to pressure it to announce political investigations into his domestic rivals. But the public comes out of the impeachment trial pretty close to where it was when it started, divided starkly down the middle with somewhat more Americans against Mr. Trump than for him. When the House impeached him in December, 47.4 percent supported the move and 46.5 percent opposed it, according to an analysis of multiple surveys by the polling analysis site FiveThirtyEight. Now as the trial wraps up, 49.5 percent favor impeachment versus 46.4 percent who do not. Those numbers are strikingly close to the popular vote results from 2016, when Mr. Trump trailed Hillary Clinton 46 percent to 48 percent even as he prevailed in the Electoral College. That means that the public today is roughly where it was three years ago; few seem to have changed their minds. And the president has done nothing to expand his base and by traditional measures is a weak candidate for a second term, forcing him to try to pull the same Electoral College inside straight he did last time. Mr. Trump is the only president in the history of Gallup polling who has never had the support of a majority of Americans for even a single day, a troubling indicator for re-election. Nine months is an eternity in American politics these days and, given his history, Mr. Trump could easily create another furor that will change the campaign dynamics, the economy could become an issue, and with all the accumulated allegations some analysts anticipate a certain scandal fatigue could weigh him down. But Mr. Trump is gambling that he can rally his most fervent supporters by making the case that he was the victim and not the villain of impeachment while keeping disenchanted supporters on board with steady economic growth, rising military spending and conservative judicial appointments. He has made clear he will paint former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. as corrupt if he faces him in the fall and will assail other possible Democratic challengers as socialists. If Mr. Trump does win a second term, it would be the first time an impeached president had the opportunity to serve five years after his trial and Mr. Trump’s critics worry that he would feel unbound. He has already used his power in ways that presidents since Richard M. Nixon considered out of line, like firing an F.B.I. director who was investigating him and browbeating the Justice Department to investigate his political foes. While in theory nothing in the Constitution would prevent the House from impeaching him again, as a political matter that seems implausible given that he has demonstrated his complete command over congressional Republicans led by Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, leaving the president less to fear from a Democratic House. Some House managers warned that acquittal would lower the bar for presidential misconduct, meaning that Mr. Trump would feel even freer to use his power for his own benefit because he got away with it. “He is going to ratchet it up to another level now,” said Anthony Scaramucci, the onetime White House communications director who has broken with Mr. Trump. “He’s going to be Trump to the third power now. He’s not going to be exponential Trump because that’s not enough Trump. It’s going to be Trump to the third power.” But in that, Mr. Scaramucci said, are the seeds of Mr. Trump’s own downfall because he could go so far that he finally alienates enough of the public to lose. “The one person who absolutely can beat Trump is Trump,” he said. No other impeached president had the opportunity or challenge that Mr. Trump does. President Andrew Johnson, who was acquitted in 1868, was a man without a party, a Democrat who had joined the Republican Abraham Lincoln’s ticket, and was so disliked that both parties nominated other candidates shortly after his Senate trial, leaving him to finish his last 10 months in office a lame duck. Indeed, while Johnson was not removed from office, impeachment reduced him to a shadow president, said Brenda Wineapple, author of “The Impeachers,” an account of his trial. “The Republicans still had a majority in Congress so they could reject some of his appointments, which they did, and override his vetoes of their legislation — and they could allow the states that conformed to the Reconstruction Acts to re-enter the Union,” she said. “So in that sense, Johnson was hamstrung, if not powerless.” President Bill Clinton was in his second term when he was impeached and acquitted, never to be on a ballot again. With nearly two years left in office, he tried to move on from his impeachment, all but pretending it had not happened. On the day of his acquittal in 1999, he appeared in the Rose Garden alone and expressed regret rather than vindication. “I want to say again to the American people how profoundly sorry I am for what I said and did to trigger these events and the great burden they have imposed on the Congress and on the American people,” Mr. Clinton said, calling for “a time of reconciliation and renewal.” As he turned to leave, a reporter called after him. “In your heart, sir, can you forgive and forget?” Mr. Clinton paused as if deciding whether to take the bait, then turned and answered, “I believe any person who asks for forgiveness has to be prepared to give it.” Mr. Clinton, who unlike Mr. Trump admitted wrongdoing without agreeing that he committed felonies, never truly forgave his opponents, or reconciled with them, but for the most part he avoided expressing those feelings publicly. “Clinton saw the acquittal as a humbling end to that chapter and I think Trump sees it as a way to start his re-elect,” said Jennifer Palmieri, who was a top aide to Mr. Clinton. “He just wanted to shut the door on that and move on and have a fresh start. And Trump sees it as a jump start — ‘this is what I’m going to run on.’” Mr. Clinton had some help in that Republicans themselves emerged from his trial feeling bruised by their failure to remove him and the clear public repudiation of the impeachment in polls and the midterm elections. Unlike Mr. Trump, whose approval ratings remain mired in the mid-40s, Mr. Clinton’s popularity reached its highest level during impeachment, with 73 percent of the public backing him just days after the House charged him with high crimes. “I don’t think Clinton was emboldened. I think he was embarrassed about the mess he caused and he wanted to somehow move on and fix his own reputation,” said John Feehery, a Republican strategist who was a top adviser to Speaker J. Dennis Hastert at the time. And so did the Republicans. “I think both the president and the speaker had a vested interest in moving past impeachment to getting things done,” he said. “We were very conscious about how polarizing impeachment was and we were dedicated to healing the country and repairing the G.O.P. brand.” That does not seem like the likeliest path forward for Mr. Trump, more of a pugilist than a peacemaker. “He’s obviously legitimately pretty angry,” said Mr. Gingrich, who was forced out as speaker after Republicans lost the midterm elections during the drive to impeach Mr. Clinton. “Given that he’s a natural counterpuncher, he may decide to go after them.” “That’s not his best strategy,” Mr. Gingrich said. “His best strategy is to assume that the Democrats are totally out of control, that they will not be able to keep from fighting. If he appears conciliatory, they’re going to very badly damage themselves with average voters who are going to say these guys are pathological.” “He has that option,” he added. “I’m not saying he’s going to take it.” Updated Feb. 29, 2020",The New York Times
2020,Iowa Democratic Party Begins Releasing Caucus Results,"In a political era that can zag instantly from madcap to grave, somber introspection to sure-why-not nihilism, the Iowa caucus fiasco appears to have landed with uncommon force. At once, it deflated volunteers and voters whose earnest participation in democracy had by Tuesday hurtled quickly into tragicomedy and revived for some anxious Democrats a persistent pang that this moment can feel beyond repair. “It’s hard to look at Washington or look at Iowa and think that our national politics is working,” said Amanda Litman, the executive director of Run for Something, a group that encourages Democrats to seek local office. “If all they absorb is chaos, that further disillusions people.” Read more here.",The New York Times
2020,Whisky Knows Her Toys,"Trilobites A Border collie in Norway learned the names and categories of her many, many toys, just by playing a game with her owners. There’s something about a really smart dog that makes it seem as if there might be hope for the world. China is in the midst of a frightening disease outbreak and nobody knows how far it will spread. The warming of the planet shows no signs of stopping; it reached a record 70 degrees in Antarctica last week. Not to mention international tensions and domestic politics. But there’s a dog in Norway that knows not only the names of her toys, but also the names of different categories of toys, and she learned all this just by hanging out with her owners and playing her favorite game. So who knows what other good things could be possible? Right? This dog’s name is Whisky. She is a Border collie that lives with her owners and almost 100 toys, so it seems like things are going pretty well for her. Even though I don’t have that many toys myself, I’m happy for her. You can’t be jealous of a dog. Or at least you shouldn’t be. Whisky’s toys have names. Most are dog-appropriate like “the colorful rope” or “the small Frisbee.” However, her owner, Helge O. Svela said on Thursday that since the research was done, her toys have grown in number from 59 to 91, and he has had to give some toys “people” names, like Daisy or Wenger. “That’s for the plushy toys that resemble animals like ducks or elephants (because the names Duck and Elephant were already taken),” he said. During the research, Whisky proved in tests that she knew the names for at least 54 of her 59 toys. That’s not just the claim of a proud owner, and Mr. Svela is quite proud of Whisky, but the finding of Claudia Fugazza, an animal behavior researcher from Eötvös Loránd University in Budapest, who tested her. That alone makes Whisky part of a very select group, although not a champion. You may recall Chaser, another Border collie that knew the names of more than 1,000 objects and also knew words for categories of objects. And there are a few other dogs with shockingly large vocabularies, Dr. Fugazza said, including mixed breeds, and a Yorkie. These canine verbal prodigies are, however, few and far between. “It is really, really unusual, and it is really difficult to teach object names to dogs,” Dr. Fugazza said. Whisky’s achievement is even more surprising, Dr. Fugazza said, because she didn’t undergo the kind of intensive training received by Chaser, and by other animals, like baboons, that have shown an ability to group objects into categories. “The owner is not a trainer,” Dr. Fugazza said. “He reported that Whisky attended a puppy course,” she added, “but she didn’t go on with training.” That’s another encouraging part of the story. So what if you didn’t get an M.F.A., you might still be able to write that novel. Whisky learned the names of the objects in her cornucopia of fun by playing a game with her owners in which she would go fetch the toy they named. They played a lot. Dr. Fugazza and her colleague at the university, Adam Miklosi, wrote in the journal Scientific Reports that Whisky had 10 balls, seven rings, four ropes and four Frisbees. Since the names of the objects always included a specific adjective and general noun, like “small Frisbee,” Dr. Fugazza wanted to test if Whisky had gotten the idea of what a Frisbee was, and what a ball was, in a general, abstract way. The way the experiment worked was that Dr. Fugazza went to Whisky’s home. In initial tests Whisky fetched most of her toys successfully. Then, for the category test, Dr. Fugazza would try her on four new toys at a time, first letting her play with the new toys with her owners in one test, or just explore them herself, in another test. Then Dr. Fugazza set the group of new toys in one room while she and the dog’s owners waited in the kitchen. One of the owners would ask Whisky to bring “a ball” or “a rope.” She was successful about 50 percent of the time when she was given a chance to play with the new toys before the test. Given that she was choosing from four different items, that is much better than chance, Dr. Fugazza said. Her achievement meant not only that she could group objects in categories in her mind, but also that she knew the words for those categories. While Dr. Fugazza suggests that all dogs have the ability to think in categories, only a select few, either because of training, or natural ability, actually know words for categories. And she had learned all that “naturally, in a way that is actually a little bit similar to what happens to human children,” Dr. Fugazza said. Monique Udell, who studies dog behavior and cognition at Oregon State University, and who was not involved in the study, said that it’s hard to draw general conclusions from one dog. But, she said, “this study is an important reminder that animals are often learning from us even outside of formal training sessions.” She said the work suggests that scientists should keep in mind the whole learning history of a dog when they use canines as test subjects. And dog owners might remember that “our animals may be learning more from us than we think.” As a side note, no animals were harmed in this experiment. Dr. Fugazza said that Whisky quickly got the idea that if Dr. Fugazza showed up, it was time to play her favorite game, over and over again, something that Border collies like to do. “If we wanted to give Whisky a break,” she said, “we had to go out of the house because otherwise she wanted to keep playing.”",The New York Times
2020,White House Asks Congress for Billions to Fight Coronavirus,"The request arrived at the same time the Trump administration is proposing cuts to health programs across the government and as health officials across the nation struggle to keep up with costs. Get an informed guide to the global outbreak with our daily Coronavirus
 newsletter.
 WASHINGTON — The Trump administration, after weeks of pleading from lawmakers, asked Congress on Monday to allocate $1.25 billion in new emergency funds to bolster its coronavirus response. The request from the White House, which also called for $1.25 billion in money diverted from other federal programs, is a significant escalation in the administration’s response to the outbreak of the virus and a sign of how long the fight to stop it may be. The White House budget office also said it intended to move $535 million allocated for the prevention and treatment of the Ebola virus during the current fiscal year. Russell T. Vought, the acting director of the Office of Management and Budget, said in a letter to Congress obtained by The New York Times that the funds would be spent on emergency medical supplies, lab testing, the development of vaccines and other forms of monitoring, among other features. And it indicated that the Trump administration was prepared to send money to states helping with the national response. “I urge the Congress to take swift action to provide the additional funding requested,” Mr. Vought wrote. Since Congress will have to approve the $1.25 billion in new funds and permit the transfer of $535 million intended for the Ebola virus, lawmakers will most likely consider adding additional funds to replace the transferred money. Within hours of the request, Democratic lawmakers indicated their displeasure with the prospect of allowing existing funds to be repurposed instead of allocating separate funds. Representative Nita M. Lowey of New York, the chairwoman of the House Appropriations Committee, called the request “woefully insufficient to protect Americans from the deadly coronavirus outbreak.” “It is profoundly disturbing that their answer now is to raid money Congress has designated for other critical public health priorities,” she said in a statement. “Worse still, their overall request still falls short of what is needed for an effective, comprehensive government-wide response.” Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said in a statement Monday night that the emergency request was “too little too late.” “That President Trump is trying to steal funds dedicated to fight Ebola — which is still considered an epidemic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo — is indicative of his towering incompetence and further proof that he and his administration aren’t taking the coronavirus crisis as seriously as they need to be,” Mr. Schumer said. Updated Feb. 29, 2020 A spokeswoman for the Senate Appropriations Committee majority said the panel would take the administration’s input into account while determining what resources are needed. Frustration with what some see as a lackadaisical response mounted Monday as the toll of the virus rose. Senators are expected to attend a briefing on the coronavirus Tuesday morning, the latest in a series of them. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed 19 new cases in the United States on Monday, nearly all of them involving former passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise ship docked in Japan who are now quarantined on military bases. Stock prices tumbled on fears that the virus would do real harm to the global economy, and new hot spots expanded in Italy and Iran. Local health officials around the country are struggling to keep up with the costs of screening and monitoring passengers arriving from China and other parts of the world. As the coronavirus outbreak veers toward a global pandemic, lawmakers have been watching the White House for any sense of urgency. A White House Ebola response coordinator named in 2014 is no longer there, nor is a dedicated position at the National Security Council for global health security. In 2018, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention narrowed its epidemic work to 10 countries from 49, declaring victory on the global health security agenda started by the previous administration. On Monday afternoon, the acting deputy secretary of homeland security, Kenneth T. Cuccinelli II, complained on Twitter that he could not gain access to a Johns Hopkins University map of the spreading outbreak, leading critics to wonder why Mr. Cuccinelli, a member of the president’s coronavirus task force, needed the Hopkins data. A senior administration official on Monday dismissed Democratic concerns that the White House was unprepared. Global health is still being monitored; responsibility has simply been moved to the National Security Council’s programs to counter the proliferation of nuclear weapons and defend against biological attacks, the official said. Ronald Klain, who managed the Obama administration’s response to the Ebola virus, compared the move to abolishing the fire department and instead having people fight fires only when terrorists set them. “There are a lot of fires that terrorists don’t set,” he said. When he left the White House, Mr. Klain said, a permanent position was created to sustain the work he was doing overseeing the White House’s pandemic preparedness. Then John R. Bolton scrapped the role in 2018 when he was the national security adviser, hindering the White House’s ability to coordinate with other countries. “There’s no one in charge at the White House who’s prepared to respond to a naturally occurring pandemic,” Mr. Klain said. Mr. Trump defended his team’s handling of the outbreak on Monday, saying the virus was “very much under control” in the United States. “We are in contact with everyone and all relevant countries,” he wrote on Twitter. “CDC & World Health have been working hard and very smart. Stock Market starting to look very good to me!” [Read: Brazilian who visited Italy is feared to be first coronavirus patient in Latin America.] Before its request for emergency funds, the Trump administration had said it could shuffle money between accounts to fund its coronavirus response, pulling from a $105 million Centers for Disease Control and Prevention rapid response fund and upward of $136 million diverted from other federal programs. Senator Bill Cassidy, Republican of Louisiana and a physician who regularly works on health issues in Congress, said that when he met this month with Dr. Robert R. Redfield, the C.D.C. director, he was told that the funding it had then was sufficient. “There was no, ‘We need help,’” Mr. Cassidy said. Lawmakers have been skeptical. The president’s budget request for the fiscal year that begins in October would slash the C.D.C.’s budget by almost 16 percent, and the Health and Human Services Department’s by almost 10 percent. Tens of millions of dollars would come from the department’s Office of Public Health Preparedness and Response and its Hospital Preparedness Program, which helps hospitals handle surges of patients during disease outbreaks. The administration also proposed cutting more than $85 million from the C.D.C.’s National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases. The center directly works on outbreaks like the coronavirus, which is believed to have emerged from live animals in Wuhan, China. Before the coronavirus outbreak, the Trump administration had already narrowed its epidemic work in countries around the world. Its latest budget request included $3 billion in cuts to global health programs, including a 53 percent cut to the World Health Organization and a 75 percent cut to the Pan American Health Organization. At a Senate hearing this month, Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services, said that his budget prioritized the C.D.C.’s infectious disease program and his department’s hospital preparedness efforts, and that the C.D.C. had begun working with local health departments to test people with flulike symptoms for the coronavirus. A C.D.C. spokesman said on Monday that more than 800 people at the agency were working on the coronavirus, including more than 250 who had visited quarantine sites, airports and other state-level locations. Mr. Azar will appear this week before several House committees, and next week the Senate will question top health and human services officials. Meantime, local health departments have been scrambling to monitor the thousands of people returning to the United States from China. A bipartisan group of senators this month wrote to Mr. Azar asking how the federal government plans to reimburse states for costs that could already be in the tens of millions of dollars. Senator Brian Schatz, Democrat of Hawaii, said he began receiving text messages from local officials in his state weeks ago, pleading with him to ask the Trump administration to help with possible coronavirus cases. “We were having discussions and arguments and disputes about how to deal with a quarantine and where that quarantine would be while planes from China were in the air,” Mr. Schatz said. He accused the administration of “treating adverse information as if it is a political attack, and not something that they need to get on top of.” Last week, Mr. Cassidy, Mr. Schatz and four other senators introduced legislation that would automatically fund a permanent pool of public health emergency money. The health secretary could then dispense resources the way that the Federal Emergency Management Agency does with natural disasters, without as much dependence on congressional action. “We are taking the same paradigm and applying it to infectious diseases,” Mr. Cassidy said. More than two dozen Senate Democrats wrote this month to Robert C. O’Brien, the national security adviser, asking why he had not reinstated a pandemic response coordinator. Mr. Cassidy echoed those concerns. “There should be someone on the N.S.C. dedicated to this,” he said.",The New York Times
2020,White House Confirms Killing of Terrorist Leader in Yemen,"The statement came about a week after initial reports that the United States believed it had killed Qassim al-Rimi, the Qaeda leader in Yemen. WASHINGTON — The United States killed the leader of Al Qaeda’s affiliate in Yemen, the White House confirmed on Thursday. The confirmation came about a week after The New York Times first reported that the United States believed it had killed Qassim al-Rimi, the Qaeda leader, in January after months of tracing him. The C.I.A. carried out the airstrike using an unmanned drone, an intelligence official said. The White House statement had little detail about the operation, but said it was carried out at the direction of President Trump. The statement said Mr. al-Rimi’s death will degrade the Yemen affiliate and the global Qaeda movement and “brings us closer to eliminating the threats these groups pose to our national security.” Mr. Trump has highlighted his record of ordering the killing of terrorist leaders and other adversaries. In his State of the Union address, he highlighted the Army Delta Force raid that killed Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the Islamic State leader, as well as the drone strike in Baghdad that killed Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, Iran’s most important general. Mr. al-Rimi was one of the founders of Yemen’s Qaeda affiliate. Although the affiliate’s power and ability to conduct strikes in the West has diminished under the pressure of strikes by the American military and C.I.A. aircraft, it is still one of the world’s most potent forces. It remains to be seen how much Mr. al-Rimi’s death will set the group back. The C.I.A. learned of Mr. al-Rimi’s location from an informer in Yemen last November, allowing the government to begin tracking him with surveillance drones, an official said. Mr. al-Rimi, 41, was among the few remaining Qaeda leaders whose terrorist pedigree traces to the era before the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.",The New York Times
2020,White House Denies Claim That Trump Offered Pardon Deal to Julian Assange,"A statement in a London court put a twist on a previously known attempt by a Republican congressman to get the WikiLeaks founder to absolve Russia of election meddling. WASHINGTON — The White House on Wednesday denied an allegation that President Trump had offered to pardon Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder who is fighting extradition to the United States, if he absolved Russia of hacking Democratic emails during the 2016 campaign. Mr. Assange’s legal team told a court in London on Wednesday that Mr. Trump had made the offer in 2017 through Dana Rohrabacher, who at the time was a Republican congressman from California. Stephanie Grisham, the White House press secretary, dismissed the accusation. “The president barely knows Dana Rohrabacher, other than he’s an ex-congressman,” Ms. Grisham told reporters. “He’s never spoken to him on this subject or almost any subject. It is a complete fabrication and a total lie.” It is not a new revelation that the congressman tried to broker a deal in which Mr. Trump would make Mr. Assange’s legal troubles with the United States go away if he provided evidence disproving that the Russians had hacked the Democratic emails WikiLeaks published. But the claim, which came the day after Mr. Trump pardoned numerous high-profile white-collar criminals, grabbed attention because a lawyer for Mr. Assange portrayed Mr. Rohrabacher as acting on Mr. Trump’s instructions. Previous accounts have described Mr. Rohrabacher as freelancing an idea that he came up with on his own. On Wednesday, a lawyer for Mr. Assange, Edward Fitzgerald, referred in court to a statement by another lawyer for Mr. Assange, Jennifer Robinson, describing a purported quid-pro-quo offer conveyed by Mr. Rohrabacher, according to a Daily Beast account of a hearing on what evidence could be admitted at an upcoming extradition hearing. The statement by Ms. Robinson, he said, described “Mr. Rohrabacher going to see Mr. Assange and saying, on instructions from the president, he was offering a pardon or some other way out” of his legal troubles if Mr. Assange “said Russia had nothing to do with the D.N.C. leaks.” The Wall Street Journal reported in September 2017 that Mr. Rohrabacher — who lost his seat in the 2018 midterm elections — was trying to broker a deal for a pardon if Mr. Assange produced evidence absolving Russia of the hack. That would have also absolved the Trump campaign of suspicions that it conspired with Russia. But that article portrayed Mr. Rohrabacher as approaching the White House with an idea that he had come up with, not acting as Mr. Trump’s envoy. It said that he spoke with John F. Kelly, Mr. Trump’s chief of staff at the time, about the possibility of “a meeting between Mr. Assange and a representative of Mr. Trump, preferably someone with direct communication with the president,” but that Mr. Kelly had not passed that message on to the president. After the Journal article, a local news program for a CBS affiliate in Los Angeles, KCAL, interviewed Mr. Rohrabacher. He confirmed the account, saying that “The Wall Street Journal has the whole thing.” Mr. Rohrabacher also said in that interview that Mr. Assange “repeatedly told me that the Russians were not involved at all.” But a later indictment of Russian officials and a lengthy narrative report by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, provided extensive details about how the Russian government went about hacking the Democratic emails. Mr. Mueller, however, did not find evidence proving any conspiracy with the Trump campaign. Mr. Assange, who was holed up in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London to avoid extradition to Sweden for a sexual abuse investigation, was arrested and extracted from the embassy in April 2019. It was the same day that the Justice Department unsealed a narrow charge accusing him of a hacking conspiracy with Chelsea Manning, the former Army intelligence analyst who leaked archives of military and diplomatic documents to WikiLeaks. The next month, the Justice Department significantly expanded the case against Mr. Assange by adding charges under the Espionage Act that he solicited, acquired and published classified information. The decision to bring criminal charges for such journalistic activities — a separate question from whether Mr. Assange counts as a journalist — was groundbreaking and has surrounded his potential trial with novel First Amendment issues. But Mr. Assange is fighting the United States’ request that Britain extradite him, arguing that the Trump administration has brought charges against him for political reasons.",The New York Times
2020,White House Earmarks New Money for A.I. and Quantum Computing,"The technologies are expected to become an important part of national security, and some worry the United States is behind China in their development. SAN FRANCISCO — White House officials on Monday unveiled plans to increase federal funding for the development of artificial intelligence and quantum computing, two cutting-edge technologies that defense officials say will play a key role in national security. The funding, part of the Trump administration’s $4.8 trillion budget proposal, would direct more money for A.I. research to the Defense Department and the National Science Foundation. The administration also wants to spend $25 million on what it calls a national “quantum internet,” a network of machines designed to make it much harder to intercept digital communication. For several years, technologists have urged the Trump administration to back research on artificial intelligence — which could affect things as diverse as weapons and transportation — and quantum computing, a new way to build super-powerful computers. China’s government, in particular, has made building these machines a priority, and some national security experts worry that the United States is at risk of falling behind. The proposed spending follows earlier administration moves. In 2018, President Trump signed a law that earmarked $1.2 billion for quantum research. The Energy Department recently began distributing its portion of that money — about $625 million — to research labs in industry, academia and government. “The dollars we have put into quantum information science have increased by about fivefold over the last three years,” said Paul Dabbar, under secretary for science at the Energy Department, in an interview. Last year, Mr. Trump signed an executive order that made A.I. research and development a national priority. The new budget proposal would increase funding for artificial intelligence research at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, a research arm of the Defense Department, to $249 million from $50 million, and at the National Science Foundation to $850 million from about $500 million. The administration also vowed to double funding for A.I. and quantum computing research outside the Defense Department by 2022. Big tech companies have invested heavily in A.I. research over the last decade. But many experts have worried that universities and government labs have lost much of their talent to businesses. Under the new funding plan, the National Science Foundation would apply $50 million to help train A.I. experts. The world’s biggest technology companies, from Google in the United States to Alibaba in China, are also racing to build a quantum computer, a new kind of machine that could be used to break the encryption that protects digital information. Researchers are using the same scientific principles to create new technology that could withstand such an attack. In 2017, after four years of planning and construction, China unveiled a dedicated quantum communication network between Beijing and Shanghai. Two Chinese provinces invested $80 million in the project. It has also tested quantum encryption techniques via satellite. With the $25 million, the Energy Department would build a network connecting its 17 national research labs, which include Los Alamos in New Mexico and Argonne outside Chicago. Using this test network, researchers would explore quantum encryption technologies with an eye toward creating a secure network across the country. “This is a test bed for new technologies,” said David Awschalom, a professor at the University of Chicago who oversees much of the university’s quantum research and would play a role in the effort at the national labs. “We are using the power of the national labs to fuel the country.”",The New York Times
2020,White House Memo Justifying Suleimani Strike Cites No Imminent Threat,"A new report sent to Congress about the drone strike that killed Iran’s top general contradicted the original justification the administration provided. WASHINGTON — The White House told Congress on Friday that President Trump authorized the strike last month that killed Iran’s most important general to respond to attacks that had already taken place and deter future ones, contradicting the president’s claim that he acted in response to an imminent threat. In a legally mandated, two-page unclassified memo to lawmakers, the White House asserted that the strike that killed Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani was “in response to an escalating series of attacks in preceding months” by Iran and Iran-backed militias. “The purposes of this action were to protect United States personnel, to deter Iran from conducting or supporting further attacks against United States forces and interests, to degrade Iran’s and Quds Force-backed militias’s ability to conduct attacks, and to end Iran’s strategic escalation of attacks,” said the report, which was transmitted on Friday to the House Foreign Affairs Committee. The document confirmed what lawmakers had privately suspected as the Trump administration has offered a shifting set of justifications for the strike against General Suleimani in Baghdad — taken with no congressional consultation — which brought the United States and Iran to the brink of war. “This official report directly contradicts the president’s false assertion that he attacked Iran to prevent an imminent attack against United States personnel and embassies,” Representative Eliot L. Engel of New York, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, said in a statement. “The administration’s explanation in this report makes no mention of any imminent threat and shows that the justification the president offered to the American people was false, plain and simple.” In the days after the strike that killed General Suleimani, administration officials gave a variety of rationales for the action as they confronted questions about why the president undertook such a provocative move that could incite an escalation with a dangerous rival. Mr. Trump and other top officials, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, said the strike was conducted in response to imminent threats to American lives, but they declined to provide any evidence, leaving lawmakers in both parties irate. Pressed over several days, Mr. Pompeo conceded that the United States did not have specific intelligence on where or when an attack would take place. Mr. Trump claimed that four American embassies had been targeted for attacks, but under questioning during a television interview, Mark T. Esper, the secretary of defense, said he had seen no evidence of that. Mr. Trump later insisted on Twitter that General Suleimani had, in fact, been planning an imminent attack on United States forces, but added, “it doesn’t really matter because of his horrible past!” Representative Michael McCaul of Texas, the top Republican on the Foreign Affairs Committee, said in a statement that “U.S. intelligence indicated Soleimani was plotting more attacks on Americans and he was an authorized target in Iraq because of the ongoing threat he posed to Americans there.” “The administration would have been ‘culpably negligent’ if they hadn’t acted,” Mr. McCaul said, quoting Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. “It is unfortunate that Democrats continue to criticize the president for a successful U.S. military strike of this brutal terrorist with American blood on his hands.” The report on Friday came a day after the Senate passed a resolution aimed at restraining Mr. Trump’s war-making powers with Iran. The rare bipartisan vote illustrated the depth of the skepticism in both parties about the president’s strategy, and lawmakers’ frustration with the administration’s refusal to consult Congress on military matters. The House is expected to pass the measure soon, sending it to the president’s desk. Mr. Trump’s advisers have said he will veto it. The White House infuriated lawmakers in early January when it sent Congress a formal notification of the drone strikes required under the War Powers Act. Lawmakers had expected it to lay out a legal justification for the strike, but the entire document was classified, and officials who read it said it contained no information on future threats or an imminent attack. Lawmakers were further angered by a series of briefings delivered by top administration officials that they described as insulting and demeaning, complaining that they were dismissed for questioning the administration’s strategy. Friday’s report also only discussed previous acts of aggression by Iran. It cited as a legal framework the president’s constitutional powers as commander in chief and the authorization for the use of military force in Iraq that Congress passed in 2002, using two justifications the administration has previously mentioned. “Iran’s past and recent activities, coupled with intelligence at the time of the airstrike, indicated that Iran’s Quds force posed a threat to the United States in Iraq,” the report said. Congressional Democrats have coalesced behind a new push to repeal the 2002 law, which was passed to authorize a military response to Saddam Hussein and his government. They said Mr. Trump’s broad reading of it illustrated how the statute has been stretched and distorted to accommodate missions that Congress never envisioned when it was debated. “To suggest that 18 years later this authorization could justify killing an Iranian official stretches the law far beyond anything Congress ever intended,” Mr. Engel said. The House last month voted to repeal the 2002 law, with lawmakers in both parties arguing that the authorization had become outdated and been abused by presidents as a blank check to circumvent Congress in taking military action. During negotiations on the annual defense policy bill, the White House, focused on creating the Space Force as the sixth branch of military and maintaining the ability to divert military construction funds to pay for the border wall, was initially open to repealing the 2002 law, but the Pentagon intervened.",The New York Times

O’Brien, the national security adviser, is one of the sharpest public denunciations of the Chinese company by the Trump administration, and comes as the United States is reeling from the decision by Britain to allow Huawei to build part of their fifth-generation, or 5G, network. American intelligence officials have long said privately that Huawei has so-called back doors that could allow the company to obtain data that flows on the networks they build and maintain. But publicly, officials have spoken mostly about the potential that Huawei could provide Chinese officials with access to all kinds of data, without offering concrete proof. Mr. O’Brien said Tuesday that the United States had evidence that Huawei could “access sensitive and personal information” in the systems it maintains around the world. “This is alarming because Chinese companies, by law, must comply with directives of the Chinese Communist Party,” Mr. O’Brien said. “Strategically, we see a company that can use its position in the market to advance the aims of the Chinese Communist Party.” Huawei has insisted that it does not answer to the Chinese government and that it would not spy on its customers. The Trump administration has spent the past year trying to pressure its allies, with limited success, to prevent Huawei from building their next-generation wireless networks. The effort has included warning other countries that Huawei poses a risk and threatening them with a loss of access to American intelligence if they allowed the Chinese telecommunication company into their networks. Until recently, American officials have been unwilling to share technical details with allies. But that stance has changed in recent weeks, as American officials have sought to persuade German and British officials of the danger of Huawei. In the case of Britain, the strategy has failed, as officials there announced last month that they would allow some Huawei equipment into their networks. On Tuesday, lawmakers said that allies should reconsider their decisions to allow the Chinese company into their new networks. “The freedom-loving world can’t sit back and let surveillance state communists infect our infrastructure,” Senator Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska, said Tuesday. The United States decision to share more information about Huawei’s back door with allies was first reported Tuesday by The Wall Street Journal. Carriers in most countries have ways to give law enforcement officials access to parts of the network. But Huawei maintains access to those back doors, and can get data from them even without the permission of carriers, The Journal reported. Advocacy groups said the back-door access was why they had been pushing for the United States government and companies to do more to develop a strong competitor to Huawei. “We simply cannot risk allowing Huawei — and by extension the Chinese government — having back-door access to our telecommunications networks,” said Ian Prior, a spokesman for 5G Action Now, an interest group. “It is a danger to our national security, economic security and personal privacy.” The effort to understand security vulnerabilities in Huawei’s equipment goes back years, well before the development of the current 5G systems. The National Security Agency infiltrated Huawei’s systems years ago in a classified operation code-named Shotgiant. The effort was intended to determine if the People’s Liberation Army was the true owner of the company, but it also involved delving into the technology of the company’s switching systems including any back doors that the company maintained. The effort by the National Security Agency was revealed in 2014, as part of the documents leaked by the former contractor Edward J. Snowden. The Trump administration has taken steps to try to block Huawei from America’s next-generation mobile networks, and has also tried to stop companies from selling parts to the Chinese company. But an effort to close loopholes in those rules, for now, has been stalled. David E. Sanger contributed reporting.",The New York Times
2020,Highlights From a Day of Campaigning in South Carolina and Super Tuesday States,"Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina went on the Sunday talk show circuit to emphasize that the primaries are young and to caution against prematurely crowning Bernie Sanders as the Democratic nominee. “South Carolina has a demographic that lends itself well to Democratic voters especially, so I think that if you can win South Carolina decisively, I think you can set the stage for Super Tuesday and you will become the odds-on favorite,” Mr. Clyburn said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “I remember John McCain coming into South Carolina the odds-on favorite. He left South Carolina in bad shape,” he continued, arguing that his state had a history of changing the trajectory of presidential races. “We had Barack Obama win South Carolina and be launched all the way to the presidency. Hillary Clinton won South Carolina and became the odds-on favorite, and she won the nomination.” It’s true that black voters are the core of the Democratic base and that South Carolina is the first opportunity for them to participate in significant numbers, which means it absolutely has the potential to be a game-changer. But none of the examples Mr. Clyburn cited resemble the current situation, in which one candidate (Mr. Sanders) dominated the first three primaries and the candidates counting most on South Carolina (Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Tom Steyer) came nowhere near winning any of them. In 2016, a blowout victory in South Carolina gave Mrs. Clinton a big boost going into Super Tuesday, especially after Bernie Sanders won New Hampshire — but Mrs. Clinton had already won Iowa (albeit narrowly) and Nevada, and was already the favorite. In 2008, South Carolina did cement Mr. Obama as the front-runner, but he had already won an upset in Iowa and earned the most delegates in Nevada. As for John McCain, he ran in both 2000 and 2008. While Mr. Clyburn did not specify what year he was referring to, we can safely assume it wasn’t 2008, given that Mr. McCain didn’t leave South Carolina “in bad shape” that year; he won it. But in 2000, while Mr. McCain won New Hampshire, George W. Bush won the other early contests.",The New York Times
2020,Opinion | White Momentum,"It shouldn’t undermine Joe Biden. Opinion Columnist This article is part of David Leonhardt’s newsletter. You can sign up here to receive it each weekday. Joe Biden has a big lead among African-American Democrats — and African-Americans make up about 25 percent of the party’s voters. Among Latinos, who make up almost 10 percent, Biden is neck-and-neck with Bernie Sanders for the lead. Biden’s strength with minority voters is an enormous advantage in the highly diverse Democratic Party. And yet this morning some pundits are wondering whether Biden is finished — because he appears to have come a disappointing fourth in Iowa. That’s nuts. Readers of this newsletter know that I think Biden has weaknesses as a presidential candidate. But he also has major strengths, including his experience, his political skills, his middle-class image and his evident humanity. Democratic voters (and political journalists) would be making a mistake to disqualify him based on a disappointing finish in one fairly small, overwhelmingly white, highly unrepresentative state. For that matter, they’d be making a mistake to disqualify him if he also struggles in New Hampshire — which is likewise small, overwhelmingly white and highly unrepresentative. There is no perfect candidate. Bernie Sanders is a self-avowed democratic socialist who may turn off swing voters. Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar have drawn support almost exclusively from white voters. Elizabeth Warren hasn’t yet won over either progressives or moderate Democrats. Given President Trump’s advantages — and the confident case he made for re-election in last night’s State of the Union — Democrats should not be rushing to eliminate qualified candidates. The current nomination system is terribly flawed, precisely because it creates a narrative of disappointment around candidates who don’t fare well in two homogeneous states without a single major city. Biden will unavoidably suffer from that (as Cory Booker and Kamala Harris already have). But voters and journalists should fight the instinct to make it a defining feature of the next two weeks.

2020,"White Supremacist Groups Expand Propaganda Efforts, Report Finds","They have a renewed emphasis on spreading their message through pamphlets and stickers, often on college campuses, as large public protests diminish. They are a staple of any college campus: leaflets, posters and stickers promoting clubs, meetings and parties. From afar, they look innocuous — and most are. But upon closer inspection, a growing number are promoting white supremacist propaganda such as “America Is Not for Sale,” “One Nation Against Invasion” and “Reclaim America.” The distribution of such propaganda on college and university campuses nearly doubled last year, to 630 reported incidents from 320 in 2018, the Anti-Defamation League documented in a report released Wednesday. There were 410 reported incidents in the fall semester, it said, more than double any previous college term since the organization began its tally in 2016. The Anti-Defamation League attributed part of the increase to greater vigilance from those reporting the propaganda. “This is all about optics and entry points to a broader white supremacist movement,” said Oren Segal, vice president of the Anti-Defamation League’s Center on Extremism. “We need to understand that there is a connection, ideologically, from a piece of propaganda on these campuses to an attack in our communities.” The proliferation of propaganda can be traced to the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va., in 2017 that turned deadly when a man drove into a crowd of counterprotesters, said Brian Levin, the director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino. “After Charlottesville, white supremacist organizations were left reeling and splintered organizationally by adverse publicity, doxxing and legal woes,” Mr. Levin said. He added, “Pamphlets and stickers represent the biggest little bang for the buck, enabling them to stir the pot somewhat, but with little risk of arrest.” While a few alt-right groups still publicly protest, he said, most have increased their internet activity; others have shifted underground, using smaller encrypted online platforms. Mr. Levin said the propaganda intertwined hard-core racism with wedge issues like immigration to appeal to disenfranchised white people, particularly on school campuses. The Anti-Defamation League data shows that white supremacist propaganda is growing across the country, not only on college campuses. A total of 2,713 cases, an average of more than seven per day, were reported nationwide last year, compared with 1,214 in 2018. The highest activity was reported in California, Texas and New York. But every state except Hawaii reported at least one incident. Two-thirds of the incidents were attributed to the Texas-based Patriot Front, whose missives — like “Not Stolen Conquered” — are dressed up in red, white and blue and reflect the belief that their ancestors conquered America and granted it to them alone. The Patriot Front, the American Identity Movement and the New Jersey European Heritage Association were responsible for approximately 90 percent of the activity, the report said. Over a 48-hour span in Chicago in late September and early October, the Patriot Front barraged Wilbur Wright College, Moody Bible Institute and Northeastern Illinois University with messages, according to the Anti-Defamation League’s data. “In some ways, it’s one of the most basic forms of spreading hateful narratives and spreading anxiety in communities,” said Mr. Segal of the Anti-Defamation League. “Fundamentally, these are violent extremist movements. That’s why we feel that it’s important to document this. The stakes are too high.” The F.B.I. director, Christopher Wray, told the House Judiciary Committee last week that violent extremists motivated by race were now considered a “national threat priority” equivalent to foreign terrorist organizations such as ISIS. Extremist groups are doubling down to amplify their public activities, which are happening less frequently, Mr. Segal said. A flier posted on an online forum can resonate with some people, he said, motivating them to post physical propaganda in their community that spreads hateful narratives and anxiety. “Their ideas are seeping in,” he said.",The New York Times
2020,White Supremacist Guilty of Killing 2 Who Came to Aid of Black Teens,"Mr. Christian killed two men who had intervened to confront him as he went on an anti-Muslim tirade against two black teenagers. [For more stories on race from The Times, sign up here for our weekly Race/Related newsletter.] Walia Mohamed, a Somali immigrant to Portland, Ore., no longer rides the city’s light rail system. She has stopped wearing her hijab, too. These are simple things, but she no longer feels safe doing either of them. The last time she rode the train was nearly three years ago, on May 26, 2017, when she was 17. She hadn’t noticed Jeremy Christian on the train at first. But he saw her and another black teenager, and for reasons she still cannot fathom, he began bellowing “Muslims should die!” And “Go back to Saudi Arabia!” And “Kill yourselves!” A group of men intervened, confronting Mr. Christian. There were heated words and shoving. Only when Ms. Mohamed saw one of the men clutching at his neck, with blood running through his fingers, did she realize that Mr. Christian had a knife. “We started running,” Ms. Mohamed testified last month in the murder trial of Mr. Christian, an avowed white supremacist. “I thought he was going to come after us and kill us, too.” Mr. Christian stabbed three of the good Samaritans who intervened. Two died: Taliesin Myrddin Namkai-Meche, 23, and Rick Best, 53. The third, Micah David-Cole Fletcher, 21, was wounded in the neck but survived. On Friday, Mr. Christian, 38, was found guilty of two counts of first-degree murder and one of attempted murder. Mr. Christian, who has a history of making extremist statements on social media, previously served more than eight years in prison for armed robbery and kidnapping, according to court documents. In Portland, a city often portrayed in popular culture as a progressive paradise, the killing of the men provoked outrage, along with reassurances that the city would not tolerate hate. But it also set off a new round of questions about whether Oregon had fully shed the legacy of its founding as a racially pure Cascadia that white supremacists still fantasize about. Oregon was admitted to the Union in 1859 with a constitution that, uniquely, forbade black people from living, working, or owning property in the state; the provision was not repealed until 1926. In the 1920s, the state legislature barred Japanese immigrants from owning or leasing land. By the 1970s, extremist groups like the Aryan Nations had found fertile ground for their beliefs. “White supremacy has been indoctrinated,” said Zakir Khan, who leads the Oregon chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations. “That’s just the culture that people absorbed.” In recent years, Portland has been the site of white supremacist rallies and Antifa counterprotests. It has also seen a white man try to sic a pit bull on an African-American man who he said was “in the wrong neighborhood”; a driver screaming at a pregnant Muslim woman to remove her hijab; and the conviction of a white supremacist who deliberately plowed his Jeep into a black teenager. (He was sentenced to at least 28 years in prison, in what was believed to be Oregon’s first hate-crime murder conviction in more than three decades.) “The incident aboard the MAX train on May 26, 2017, left a deep wound in our community, a community that rejects hate, racism and violence in any form,” Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler, a Democrat, said in a statement after the verdict. “The conviction won’t fully take away the pain inflicted on the families, friends and loved ones of the victims in the MAX attack, but the hope is that they find relief in the legal justice that was served today.” Even so, civil rights advocates say they have seen few signs that Portland has reckoned with its racist history or is taking the necessary steps today to eradicate bigotry. “I’ve been in situations where I’ve been humiliated in public, and no one responds,” said Teressa Raiford, an African-American community organizer and mayoral candidate whose family has lived in Portland for four generations. “They are conditioned to feel safe, and we aren’t,” she said of white residents. Some observers have said that if the city took a more forceful approach to racist attacks, the train attack might have been avoided. The day before the attack, an African-American woman, Demetria Hester, reported that a man had harassed and assaulted her in an incident that began on a light rail train. Prosecutors later said that man was Mr. Christian. In his murder trial, the woman testified that Mr. Christian had been shouting epithets on the train, and she had asked him to lower his voice. When he followed her off the train, she said, the incident escalated: She pepper-sprayed him, and he threw a full bottle of Gatorade, hitting her right eye “like a bullet,” she testified. . Mr. Christian did not testify during his trial. His lawyers argued that he acted in self-defense when he felt threatened by the men confronting him, and that his words, vile as they may have been, were protected by the First Amendment. “Even if you decide that he’s a white supremacist or a bigot, or just a big jerk,” Greg Scholl, a lawyer for Mr. Christian, told the jury, “that doesn’t mean he committed all of the crimes he’s accused of. The issue is not the legality of racism.” Ms. Mohamed and the other target of his rant, Destinee Magnum, an African-American who was born in Portland, have said that they think constantly of the two men who lost their lives standing up for them. Mr. Namkai-Meche was a recent Reed College graduate working as a consultant. Mr. Best was an Army veteran who left behind a wife and four children. Some of Mr. Namkai-Meche’s last words were “I want everybody on the train to know, I love them,” according to a witness. “He was a hero and will remain a hero on the other side of the veil,” Asha Deliverance, Mr. Namkai-Meche’s mother, wrote in a Facebook post. “Shining bright star, I love you forever.” When cellphone video of Mr. Christian’s attack was played in court, Ms. Magnum wiped tears from her eyes as the recorded sounds of her screams became louder and louder. She recalled her fear in those moments. “I’m just trying to live life,” Ms. Magnum said, but Mr. Christian was yelling at her that “because of our religion or because of our color, that we don’t deserve to be here and we don’t deserve to live.” That made no sense to her, she said. “I was born and raised in Portland, Oregon, so I don’t feel like I should go somewhere else,” she said. “I don’t feel like I have to ‘go back to where I came from,’ because I was born here.” Vanessa Swales contributed reporting.",The New York Times
2020,"White Supremacists Targeted Journalists and a Trump Official, F.B.I. Says","In a continuing crackdown on violent neo-Nazi groups, prosecutors charged members of the Atomwaffen Division with harassing journalists, activists and others. SEATTLE — Federal prosecutors have charged five people tied to a neo-Nazi group with engaging in a campaign to intimidate and harass journalists and others, including a member of President Trump’s cabinet, a university and a church. The charges, announced on Wednesday in Virginia and Washington State, are part of a broader recent crackdown by federal law enforcement on violent white supremacists in the United States. Authorities said the individuals were associated with the Atomwaffen Division, a small but violent paramilitary neo-Nazi group. In the Virginia case, prosecutors accused John Cameron Denton, 26, whom they described as a former Atomwaffen leader, of harassment through a tactic known as “swatting” — calling the police and falsely describing an imminent threat at a specific location, causing the authorities to respond in force. In one instance, prosecutors said, Mr. Denton targeted an investigative journalist at ProPublica because he was angry that the news organization had named him in its reporting on Atomwaffen. In other cases in 2018 and 2019, Mr. Denton and others placed swatting calls that targeted Old Dominion University and Alfred Street Baptist Church, prosecutors said. According to a person familiar with the investigation who was not authorized to speak publicly, Kirstjen Nielsen, then the secretary of homeland security, was the cabinet official targeted by Atomwaffen. In January 2019, the police responded to her home in Alexandria, Va., after a swatting call. Last month, prosecutors said, Mr. Denton met with an undercover F.B.I. agent and described his efforts. “Denton said that if he was ‘raided’ for swatting ProPublica then it would be good for Atomwaffen Division because the swatting would be seen as a top-tier crime,” Jonathan Myles Lund, an F.B.I. agent, wrote in an affidavit. The affidavit named 134 law enforcement agencies that investigators believe received swatting calls from Mr. Denton and others. Authorities said Mr. Denton operated with others, including two foreign nationals who live outside the United States, and another man, John William Kirby Kelley, who was arrested earlier and accused of playing a role in the swatting incidents. Mr. Kelley was a student at Old Dominion University. In Seattle on Wednesday, prosecutors unsealed a conspiracy charge against Kaleb James Cole, 24, a leader of Atomwaffen’s chapter in Washington, accusing him of sending threatening mail and cyberstalking. The others charged were Cameron Brandon Shea, 24, of Redmond, Wash., described as a high-level recruiter for the group; Taylor Ashley Parker-Dipeppe, 20, of Spring Hill, Fla.; and Johnny Roman Garza, 20, of Queen Creek, Ariz. Authorities said the men took part in an operation called Erste Saule, or “first pillar” in German, which Mr. Shea described in an encrypted chat room as an effort to target “journalists houses and media buildings to send a clear message.” The goal, Mr. Shea said, was to “erode the media/states air of legitimacy by showing people that they have names and addresses, and hopefully embolden others to act.” Prosecutors said Mr. Cole and Mr. Shea were the primary organizers. When members of Atomwaffen suggested Jewish or black journalists as possible targets, Mr. Shea and Mr. Cole offered praise. Mr. Shea said he wanted his victims to feel “terrorized.” Mr. Cole suggested buying rag dolls and sticking knives through their heads and leaving them at the locations of their targets, according to the charges. Authorities said Mr. Cole and Mr. Shea created posters that included Nazi symbols, threatening language and masked figures with guns and Molotov cocktails, then printed and delivered or mailed the posters to their targets. Among the recipients were a broadcast journalist in Seattle who had reported on Atomwaffen and two people associated with the Anti-Defamation League. In Tampa, Fla., the group targeted a journalist but delivered the poster to the wrong address, and in Phoenix, a poster was sent to a magazine journalist, according to the Justice Department. Chris Ingalls, an investigative reporter with KING-TV in Seattle, said he was among the people targeted. Federal agents contacted him last month to warn him that Atomwaffen members might visit him in person, so he moved his family out of their home, he said. After returning, he said, he received a letter in the mail that included a depiction of a person with a press badge, his personal information and the words “Death to Pigs.” “I’ll be looking over my shoulder for a long time,” Mr. Ingalls said. Raymond Duda, the top agent in the F.B.I.’s Seattle office, said Atomwaffen surfaced on law enforcement’s radar in 2018, and members have gone on to participate in military-style training camps and “hate camps.” He said F.B.I. agents were continuing to investigate the group around the country and that others could be charged. “The network is clearly throughout the United States,” Mr. Duda said. “We have investigative activity from the East Coast to the West Coast ongoing.” Members of the Atomwaffen Division, which has been linked to a series of killings, have come under increased scrutiny from federal officials in recent months. Late last year, authorities in King County, Wash., charged Mr. Cole with unlawful possession of a gun after he was stopped by the police in Texas. Previously, authorities in Washington State had sought to take away Mr. Cole’s guns under a “red flag” law that allows a court to confiscate weapons from someone who is deemed to be a threat. Another member of Atomwaffen, Aiden Bruce-Umbaugh, who was traveling with Mr. Cole in Texas, pleaded guilty this month to possession of a firearm and ammunition by a prohibited person. Mr. Bruce-Umbaugh is also from Washington. The two complaints filed in Virginia and Washington State offer the most detailed official documents to date describing the group’s operating methods. The Atomwaffen Division is sometimes referred to as an “accelerationist” group, meaning it wants to instigate the collapse of the United States by sparking a race war that will eventually lead to the creation of a white ethnostate. Atomwaffen is German for “atomic weapons,” a particular interest of its founder. The fringe group is similar in its racist ideology to the Base, seven of whose members were arrested in an F.B.I. operation across several states last month. Atomwaffen first came into public view in May 2017 when a Florida teenager, Devon Arthurs, told the police that he had shot dead two of his roommates. The three had all been members of a neo-Nazi group founded by a fourth roommate, Brandon Russell, Mr. Arthurs told the police. Police officers found a cache of explosives, weapons and neo-Nazi and white supremacist paraphernalia in their apartment and garage. Mr. Arthurs said the group had planned to use the stockpile to attack the nation’s power grid, nuclear reactors and synagogues. In 2018, Mr. Russell, a member of the Florida National Guard, was sentenced to five years in prison for stockpiling the explosives. Mr. Denton then took over running the group, investigators said. Mr. Russell first announced the existence of Atomwaffen in October 2015 on a now-defunct online forum that emerged from Russia called Iron March, which is popular with neo-Nazis. “We are a fanatical, ideological band of comrades who do both activism and militant training,” he wrote at the time. “No keyboard warriorism.” Mike Baker reported from Seattle, Adam Goldman from Washington and Neil MacFarquhar from New York.",The New York Times
2020,Opinion | White Supremacy Goes Green,"Why is the far right suddenly paying attention to climate change? Ms. Gardiner is the author of “Choked: Life and Breath in the Age of Air Pollution.” As an environmental journalist, I’ve been covering the frightening acceleration of climate change for more than a decade. As a person who believes in the tenets of liberal democracy, I’ve watched the rise of white-supremacist, anti-immigrant and nationalistic ideologies with similar dread over the past few years. But I always thought of those two trends — looming ecological dangers and the gathering strength of the far right — as unrelated, parallel crises in a turbulent time. Only recently have I begun to understand that they are deeply interconnected, an ugly pairing of forces drawing power from each other. From France to Washington to New Zealand, angry voices on the hard right — nationalists, populists and others beyond conventional conservatism — are picking up old environmental tropes and adapting them to a moment charged with fears for the future. In doing so, they are giving potent new framing to a set of issues more typically associated with the left. Often, they emphasize what they see as the deep ties between a nation’s land and its people to exclude those they believe do not belong. Some twist scientific terms such as “invasive species” — foreign plants or animals that spread unchecked in a new ecosystem — to target immigrants and racial and ethnic minorities. And here’s what really frightens me: This dynamic is likely to intensify as climate change creates new stresses that could pit nations and groups against one another. Although the pressures of a warming planet are new, the deployment of environmental language for racist, nativist and nationalistic ends has a long, dark history. Before environmentalism became a mainstream and progressive cause in the 1970s, many American conservationists were also white supremacists, who argued that those they saw as outsiders threatened the nation’s landscape or lacked the values to care for it properly. Such thinking was common in Europe, too. The Nazis embraced notions of a symbiotic connection between the German homeland and its people. And while mainstream environmentalists have long since renounced such beliefs, “the far right is still aware of this tradition,” according to Bernhard Forchtner, an associate professor at the University of Leicester in England. The neo-Nazi group Northwest Front, which advocates expelling people of color from the Pacific Northwest, appropriated a flag designed by a left-wing activist, reframing it with the slogan “The sky is the blue, and the land is the green. The white is for the people in between.” In Slovakia, far-right activists invoking the centrality of forests to national identity accuse members of the Roma ethnic minority of damaging them with excessive firewood gathering, Balsa Lubarda, a Central European University doctoral candidate studying the radical right, told me. Of course, many on the nationalist right deny the scientific consensus on climate change, so the ecological concerns they cite are more local. Others, though, accept the reality of global warming and view it “through the prism of white nationalism. And the solution then becomes the exclusion of immigrants, people of color, the so-called ‘Third World,’ ” said John Hultgren, a faculty member at Bennington College and author of “Border Walls Gone Green: Nature and Anti-immigrant Politics in America.” President Trump tapped into this in December. Responding to a question about the climate during a visit to London, he added a point about pollution in the ocean. “Certain countries are dumping unlimited loads of things in it,” he said. “They tend to float toward the United States.” He did not specify particular countries, but the comment echoed plastic producers’ contention that much oceanic garbage comes from a handful of Asian nations that lack effective waste management. When I listened to Mr. Trump, I realized that what he said was freighted with something more than a corporate effort to pass the buck. He was casting plastic pollution as a threat that foreigners were visiting upon the United States. This thinking has also reached the top of the agency that manages a tenth of America’s landmass. When William Perry Pendley, acting director of the federal Bureau of Land Management, was asked about the ecosystem risks of constructing a wall on the southern border, he responded by addressing not the impact of heavy equipment or a large physical barrier, but harm done by desperate people crossing the desert, often on foot. “We’re tunnel-focused, laser-focused on one issue: What is the impact of unfettered immigration across our borders on B.L.M. lands?” Mr. Pendley said. “Our obligation is to protect those lands, protect their quality, protect the vegetation, protect endangered species there.” He did not say what damage he believed migrants were causing. The Fox News host Tucker Carlson has made similar arguments, falsely claiming in an interview with The Atlantic that the Potomac River has gotten dirtier “and that litter is left almost exclusively by immigrants.” The month before, he asked why environmentalists want to let refugees into the United States: “Isn’t crowding your country the fastest way to despoil it, to pollute it?” It is not hard to see why such ideas are making a comeback. As the relentlessness of environmental calamity — epic fires and floods, escalating extinctions, warming oceans — becomes impossible to ignore, the right needs a way to talk about it. Nationalistic framings fit comfortably with a worldview many already hold. And for the so-called alt right, they offer the bonus of a cudgel for bashing establishment conservatives as beholden to globalist, corporate interests. Some radicals are drawn to apocalyptic climate scenarios, seeing openings for authoritarianism or a complete societal breakdown. “They want to accelerate it,” said Blair Taylor, program director at the Institute for Social Ecology, a left-wing educational center, who has studied such groups. “So after the downfall they can set up their fascist ethno-states, they can be the Übermensch.” Violent actors are grabbing hold of such ideas. The killers accused of targeting Muslims and Mexican immigrants last year in New Zealand and Texas posted online manifestoes weaving white supremacy with environmental statements. The Australian man who allegedly murdered 51 people at two Christchurch mosques called himself an “ethnonationalist eco-fascist” and wrote that “continued immigration into Europe is environmental warfare.” The suspect in the El Paso shooting that killed 22 — modern America’s deadliest attack targeting Latinos — ranted about plastic waste and overconsumption. “If we can get rid of enough people, then our way of life can become more sustainable,” he concluded. If there’s one thing Americans have learned in the Trump era, it is that toxic ideas can move between the fringes and the political realm with stunning speed. Marine Le Pen, leader of France’s far-right National Rally — now the country’s main opposition party — has incorporated worries about the natural world into the party’s anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim ideology. She espouses an ideal of the French citizen as “someone rooted, someone who wants to live on their land and to pass it on to their children.” By contrast, she says, those who are “nomadic … do not care about the environment. They have no homeland.” “Borders are the environment’s greatest ally,” said Jordan Bardella, the party spokesman and a member of the European Parliament. In Hungary, the far-right party Our Homeland accused Ukraine of poisoning Hungarians by dumping waste in the Tisa River. Extremist Polish groups hurl similar charges at Germany. As climate change reshapes our world, we face a future filled with new pressures and constraints on resources, including arable land, food and water. Droughts, floods and storms are likely to push millions from their homes, some toward the relative safety and security of Europe, Australia and the United States. The upsurge of anti-Asian discrimination that has followed in the wake of fears about the coronavirus offers a glimpse of the ugly sentiments such external pressures can unleash. Without giving it much thought, I used to accept the framing of environmental problems as shared concerns we would have to work together to solve. Now I can see there is another path too, one in which dark forces wield real dangers as weapons to tear us apart, and scarcity fuels conflict, brutality and racism. Our future in a hotter world of rising seas and more powerful storms already felt terrifying. Unless we come together — and fast — behind serious action to check the existential danger of climate change, it could be darker still.

Only recently have I begun to understand that they are deeply interconnected, an ugly pairing of forces drawing power from each other. From France to Washington to New Zealand, angry voices on the hard right — nationalists, populists and others beyond conventional conservatism — are picking up old environmental tropes and adapting them to a moment charged with fears for the future. In doing so, they are giving potent new framing to a set of issues more typically associated with the left. Often, they emphasize what they see as the deep ties between a nation’s land and its people to exclude those they believe do not belong. Some twist scientific terms such as “invasive species” — foreign plants or animals that spread unchecked in a new ecosystem — to target immigrants and racial and ethnic minorities. And here’s what really frightens me: This dynamic is likely to intensify as climate change creates new stresses that could pit nations and groups against one another. Although the pressures of a warming planet are new, the deployment of environmental language for racist, nativist and nationalistic ends has a long, dark history. Before environmentalism became a mainstream and progressive cause in the 1970s, many American conservationists were also white supremacists, who argued that those they saw as outsiders threatened the nation’s landscape or lacked the values to care for it properly. Such thinking was common in Europe, too. The Nazis embraced notions of a symbiotic connection between the German homeland and its people. And while mainstream environmentalists have long since renounced such beliefs, “the far right is still aware of this tradition,” according to Bernhard Forchtner, an associate professor at the University of Leicester in England. The neo-Nazi group Northwest Front, which advocates expelling people of color from the Pacific Northwest, appropriated a flag designed by a left-wing activist, reframing it with the slogan “The sky is the blue, and the land is the green. The white is for the people in between.” In Slovakia, far-right activists invoking the centrality of forests to national identity accuse members of the Roma ethnic minority of damaging them with excessive firewood gathering, Balsa Lubarda, a Central European University doctoral candidate studying the radical right, told me. Of course, many on the nationalist right deny the scientific consensus on climate change, so the ecological concerns they cite are more local. Others, though, accept the reality of global warming and view it “through the prism of white nationalism. And the solution then becomes the exclusion of immigrants, people of color, the so-called ‘Third World,’ ” said John Hultgren, a faculty member at Bennington College and author of “Border Walls Gone Green: Nature and Anti-immigrant Politics in America.” President Trump tapped into this in December. Responding to a question about the climate during a visit to London, he added a point about pollution in the ocean. “Certain countries are dumping unlimited loads of things in it,” he said. “They tend to float toward the United States.” He did not specify particular countries, but the comment echoed plastic producers’ contention that much oceanic garbage comes from a handful of Asian nations that lack effective waste management. When I listened to Mr. Trump, I realized that what he said was freighted with something more than a corporate effort to pass the buck. He was casting plastic pollution as a threat that foreigners were visiting upon the United States. This thinking has also reached the top of the agency that manages a tenth of America’s landmass. When William Perry Pendley, acting director of the federal Bureau of Land Management, was asked about the ecosystem risks of constructing a wall on the southern border, he responded by addressing not the impact of heavy equipment or a large physical barrier, but harm done by desperate people crossing the desert, often on foot. “We’re tunnel-focused, laser-focused on one issue: What is the impact of unfettered immigration across our borders on B.L.M. lands?” Mr. Pendley said. “Our obligation is to protect those lands, protect their quality, protect the vegetation, protect endangered species there.” He did not say what damage he believed migrants were causing. The Fox News host Tucker Carlson has made similar arguments, falsely claiming in an interview with The Atlantic that the Potomac River has gotten dirtier “and that litter is left almost exclusively by immigrants.” The month before, he asked why environmentalists want to let refugees into the United States: “Isn’t crowding your country the fastest way to despoil it, to pollute it?” It is not hard to see why such ideas are making a comeback. As the relentlessness of environmental calamity — epic fires and floods, escalating extinctions, warming oceans — becomes impossible to ignore, the right needs a way to talk about it. Nationalistic framings fit comfortably with a worldview many already hold. And for the so-called alt right, they offer the bonus of a cudgel for bashing establishment conservatives as beholden to globalist, corporate interests. Some radicals are drawn to apocalyptic climate scenarios, seeing openings for authoritarianism or a complete societal breakdown. “They want to accelerate it,” said Blair Taylor, program director at the Institute for Social Ecology, a left-wing educational center, who has studied such groups. “So after the downfall they can set up their fascist ethno-states, they can be the Übermensch.” Violent actors are grabbing hold of such ideas. The killers accused of targeting Muslims and Mexican immigrants last year in New Zealand and Texas posted online manifestoes weaving white supremacy with environmental statements. The Australian man who allegedly murdered 51 people at two Christchurch mosques called himself an “ethnonationalist eco-fascist” and wrote that “continued immigration into Europe is environmental warfare.” The suspect in the El Paso shooting that killed 22 — modern America’s deadliest attack targeting Latinos — ranted about plastic waste and overconsumption. “If we can get rid of enough people, then our way of life can become more sustainable,” he concluded. If there’s one thing Americans have learned in the Trump era, it is that toxic ideas can move between the fringes and the political realm with stunning speed. Marine Le Pen, leader of France’s far-right National Rally — now the country’s main opposition party — has incorporated worries about the natural world into the party’s anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim ideology. She espouses an ideal of the French citizen as “someone rooted, someone who wants to live on their land and to pass it on to their children.” By contrast, she says, those who are “nomadic … do not care about the environment. They have no homeland.” “Borders are the environment’s greatest ally,” said Jordan Bardella, the party spokesman and a member of the European Parliament. In Hungary, the far-right party Our Homeland accused Ukraine of poisoning Hungarians by dumping waste in the Tisa River. Extremist Polish groups hurl similar charges at Germany. As climate change reshapes our world, we face a future filled with new pressures and constraints on resources, including arable land, food and water. Droughts, floods and storms are likely to push millions from their homes, some toward the relative safety and security of Europe, Australia and the United States. The upsurge of anti-Asian discrimination that has followed in the wake of fears about the coronavirus offers a glimpse of the ugly sentiments such external pressures can unleash. Without giving it much thought, I used to accept the framing of environmental problems as shared concerns we would have to work together to solve. Now I can see there is another path too, one in which dark forces wield real dangers as weapons to tear us apart, and scarcity fuels conflict, brutality and racism. Our future in a hotter world of rising seas and more powerful storms already felt terrifying. Unless we come together — and fast — behind serious action to check the existential danger of climate change, it could be darker still.

2020,White-Lipped Peccary Species May Be in Steep Decline,"Trilobites With forests depleted by development, the pig-like animals are disappearing rapidly, scientists have found in a new study. White-lipped peccaries travel in large packs throughout the forest. The hairy, pig-like creatures emit a distinctive musky smell that is not easy to forget, and play a crucial role in their ecosystems, dispersing seeds and creating habitats for insects and amphibians. Now, though, the species is facing a crisis. A recent study published in the journal Biological Conservation finds that the territory roamed by white-lipped peccaries in Mexico and Central America has shrunk by as much as 87 to 90 percent from their traditional range, and 63 percent from previous estimates. “It’s shocking for me how fast this population is declining compared to the last assessment,” said Harald Beck, chair of the peccary specialist group of the nonprofit International Union for Conservation of Nature. Dr. Beck was not involved in the new study but conducted a similar one in 2012 that found a habitat loss at the time of 21 percent. “We did not know it was that bad.” It’s not clear exactly how many animals remain, because of the difficulty of counting them, said Daniel Thornton, an assistant professor at Washington State University, who led the research. The new study relied on camera traps and local experts to identify territory where the social creatures still roam. White-lipped peccaries are extremely vulnerable to human activity. They need a wide territorial range, they move in big groups and aggressively face threats instead of fleeing to safety, and their meat is highly prized, Dr. Thornton said. “They have the trifecta of bad characteristics for a species that wants to survive in human-dominated landscapes, unfortunately for them,” he said. Development of land that used to be forested — for cattle ranches, and palm oil and sugar cane plantations — has substantially limited the white-lipped peccaries’ foraging grounds, according to Rony García-Anleu, a researcher based in Guatemala with the Wildlife Conservation Society who worked on the study. Unless hunting and habitat destruction are quickly controlled, it could mean the end of a species that once roamed much of the New World tropics, and will lead to substantial degradation of the handful of large forests that remain between Mexico and Panama, where most of the region’s white-lipped peccaries now live. “The implication is really dramatic for the whole ecosystem down there,” said Dr. Beck, also a professor at Towson University in Maryland. Their frequent mud baths create depressions in the soil that fill with water and become important breeding habitats for insects and amphibians, Dr. Beck said. His own research has shown that without these “ecosystem engineers” and the depressions they create, certain frogs can no longer breed and die out. Peccaries are among the only creatures with strong enough jaws to eat most palm species, he added, keeping those plants from growing out of control. The white-lipped peccaries are also important for dispersing seeds across the forest, constantly traveling in search of ripe food sources, Mr. García-Anleu said. And they are important in the forest food chain. In addition to people, the peccaries are hunted by wild jaguars and puma, who will also die off if they lack for protein, Mr. García-Anleu said. There are three species of peccaries in the Americas. Collared peccaries are smaller, less aggressive and less disruptive of the ecosystem than white-lipped peccaries, he said, and they travel in smaller groups. A third species lives in the deserts of Argentina, Paraguay and Bolivia. White-lipped peccaries traditionally were “bullies,” Dr. Beck said, traveling in packs of hundreds — or as many as 1,000. “I’ve been in the rainforest when they run through the understory. It’s really something,” he said. The animals click their teeth to communicate with one another and move like a tank across the forest floor. “The vegetation has to be adapted to the impact of those peccaries.” The species remains the strongest in the five remaining great forests that dot Mesoamerica. Those are the Maya Forest in Mexico, Guatemala and Belize; the Moskitia in Nicaragua and Honduras; the Indio Maíz-Tortuguero in Nicaragua and Costa Rica; the Talamanca Region in Costa Rica and Panama; and the Darien in Panama and Colombia. All three researchers said urgent action was needed to protect the peccaries by preserving the remaining forests and effectively restricting hunting. “We are in the precise moment to stop this,” Mr. García-Anleu said, “because we know now that they are in trouble, and we still have these five big forests.”",The New York Times

2020,"Who Are the Birds of Prey, Exactly? A Guide to Harley Quinn’s Team","With the movie “Birds of Prey” in theaters, we offer a character explainer. There’s a moment in DC’s “Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn)” you’d never see with the male-dominated teams of the Avengers or the Justice League. Midway through a wild brawl, the bubbly criminal-turned-mercenary Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) sees her ally Black Canary (Jurnee Smollett-Bell) struggling as her long hair gets in her eyes. Harley slides over and gives her a hair tie, and they get back to knocking down goons. Batman may have a lot in his utility belt, but definitely not a hair tie. Offering a uniquely female perspective on the genre, Cathy Yan’s movie takes its inspiration from the “Birds of Prey” comic series, which assembles a super group of characters from around the DC Comics universe. For those who don’t know a Black Canary from a Huntress, here’s a guide to who’s who. The de facto leader of the Birds of Prey, Harley Quinn had never officially been a member of the team before the film. She made her first appearance in 1992 on “Batman: The Animated Series” as the Joker’s girlfriend. Born Harleen Quinzel, she was the Joker’s psychiatrist at Arkham Asylum, but fell madly in love with him and joined him in a life of crime. Harley’s wacky personality, unique character design and vocal performance by Arleen Sorkin earned the character a cult following, and she was later added into the Batman comics. Harley and the Joker broke up repeatedly in the comics, yet she always returned to him convinced that he really loved her. But in 2013, DC premiered a solo “Harley Quinn” series that broke her up with the Joker for good. The comic, by Amanda Conner and Jimmy Palmiotti, serves as a major inspiration for the character in “Birds of Prey.” The success of the series led to a period where Harley was DC’s best-selling female character (outselling even Wonder Woman), and her appearance in the 2016 film “Suicide Squad” set the stage for her starring role in “Birds of Prey.” Huntress (portrayed in the movie by Mary Elizabeth Winstead) has a more complicated back story, as there have been several different characters to use the alter ego, including Helena Wayne, the daughter of an alternate-universe version of Batman and Catwoman. The “Birds of Prey” iteration is Helena Bertinelli, who was introduced to the comics in 1989. Helena was born into a prominent mob family, but they were murdered by their rivals. She was the only survivor of the attack, and dedicated her life to training to avenge her family’s deaths. Huntress joined the “Birds of Prey” comic series in 2003, and she’s remained a steady presence ever since. She’s known for being fairly ruthless in her methods, and even Batman has hesitated to work with her. After DC rebooted its comic book universe in 2011, Helena disappeared from comics for a few years, but she resurfaced as a secret agent. After another relaunch in 2016, Helena adopted the Huntress name again, and she reunited with her trusty crossbow for a new era of the Birds of Prey. Having debuted in the “Flash Comics” series in 1947, Black Canary is the longest-running character appearing in “Birds of Prey.” Originally, Black Canary was the alter ego of Dinah Drake, a florist who fought crime at night. Later, Dinah’s daughter, Dinah Lance, also took up fighting crime as Black Canary. But DC’s 2011 reboot merged the characters into Dinah Drake Lance. She has the longest history with the Birds of Prey, as she was present at the inception of the team in 1995. Dinah formed the Birds of Prey with Barbara Gordon (better known as Batgirl, though at that time going by the name Oracle), and she has since been present in almost every formation of the team. The film version of Black Canary is based on the most recent comics incarnation: she’s a singer who has the ability to emit a sonic scream that can shatter eardrums, though the original Black Canary was just a very skilled fighter without any super powers. She is also known for her longtime romantic relationship with the superhero Green Arrow. Though she has a lower profile than other DC heroes, she has appeared across various forms of media, including the TV series “Arrow,” which had multiple variations of the character. Like Harley Quinn, Renee Montoya (played by Rosie Perez in the film) was developed for “Batman: The Animated Series”; however, she debuted in a Batman comic released in January 1992 before making her television debut later that year. Montoya is a detective for the Gotham City Police Department who frequently assists Commissioner James Gordon. In the 2003 series “Gotham Central,” she was outed against her will as a lesbian, and the comic explored the ramifications of the event at a time when L.G.B.T.Q. characters were even rarer than today. In the comics, Montoya also develops a romantic relationship with Kate Kane, who moonlights as Batwoman. The film maintains Montoya’s sexual orientation from the comics, while also examining the indignities of being a woman in a male-dominated field. While Montoya lacks any super powers of her own, she has donned a mask on occasion, disguising herself as The Question. Montoya’s only other live-action appearance was on the TV series “Gotham.” Receiving the most dramatic reinterpretation for the big screen, Cassandra Cain (Ella Jay Basco) is a sullen adolescent pickpocket in the movie, while in the comics she’s a young trained assassin who takes over the role of Batgirl. The daughter of two assassins, Cain was rendered mostly mute by years of conditioning while being trained to become an expert killing machine. Cain first appeared in the “Batman” comics in 1999. She saves the life of Commissioner Gordon, and develops a friendship with Barbara Gordon, the former Batgirl. She gains the trust of Batman, and he gives her a Batgirl costume. Cain was the first Batgirl to get a “Batgirl” series, which lasted for 73 issues. Cain has since dropped the Batgirl name, fighting crime with the names Kasumi, the Black Bat and, currently, Orphan. Her Batgirl identity is not forgotten however, as she recently starred in a graphic novel for young readers called “Shadow of the Batgirl.”",The New York Times
2020,Who Can Beat Trump? Who Knows?,"On Politics The Democratic candidates are all debating a singular issue. New polls offer insights, not answers. Hi. Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I’m Giovanni Russonello, your morning newsletter writer taking over your afternoon edition. Sign up here to get On Politics in your inbox every weekday. At Wednesday night’s Democratic presidential debate, the candidates bickered and battled over health care policy; over Michael Bloomberg’s record and his right to represent a party that he only recently rejoined; over the possible dangers of nominating a democratic socialist. But in a way, it all seemed like just window dressing around one big question: Who has the best chance in November? Every policy critique seemed to lead inexorably back to this issue of electability. In his very first comments at the debate, Mr. Bloomberg didn’t just criticize Senator Bernie Sanders’s plan to create a single-payer health care system — he said it would cause Democrats to lose the general election. “I don’t think there’s any chance of the senator beating President Trump,” Mr. Bloomberg said. “You don’t start out by saying I’ve got 160 million people, I’m going to take away the insurance plan that they love.” Mr. Sanders shot back, arguing that Mr. Bloomberg, the former New York mayor, was “a billionaire saying that we should not raise the minimum wage or that we should cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.” “If that’s a way to beat Donald Trump, wow, I would be very surprised,” Mr. Sanders said. A wide majority of Democratic primary voters have said in poll after poll that they care about finding someone who can win the general election more than finding a candidate who agrees with them on the issues. But who is that candidate? It’s far from clear. Until recently, Democratic voters tended to see former Vice President Joe Biden as the strongest option. But after he failed to place in the top three in either Iowa or New Hampshire, he lost any veneer of invincibility. An ABC News/Washington Post poll released Wednesday showed that for the first time in the race, Democrats are most likely to name Mr. Sanders as the candidate with the best chance to beat Mr. Trump. Meanwhile, Mr. Trump’s approval rating has risen, most likely lifted by the strength of the economy and his acquittal in the Senate’s impeachment trial. His Gallup approval rating hit 49 percent this month — the highest number of his presidency. So while a majority of Americans still disapprove of him, he has the potential to win at least as much support as he did in 2016, when he lost the popular vote but pulled off a decisive win in the Electoral College. The ABC/Washington Post poll showed that in head-to-head matchups with all six of the candidates onstage at the debate, Mr. Trump would earn between 45 and 47 percent of the vote nationwide. The Democrats’ shares varied from 49 to 52 percent. The differences between each Democrat were all within the poll’s margin of error. This suggests that, despite Mr. Sanders’s claim that a “political revolution” would be needed to drive turnout, and in spite of his more moderate rivals’ argument that his left-wing proposals would alienate a huge swath of voters, any Democratic nominee would probably have a good chance of winning the popular vote. But Republicans have won the Electoral College three times this century, even though they have won the popular vote only once. So what really matters is who can beat Mr. Trump in a handful of key swing states. That’s why Quinnipiac University asked voters in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — three states that Mr. Trump narrowly flipped in 2016, giving him an Electoral College win — to choose between the president and each of the six leading Democratic candidates. The data from those polls suggests that Mr. Trump is in a very strong position to win Wisconsin, a heavily white state that was once solidly blue but has trended conservative over the past 10 years. None of the six leading Democratic candidates finished ahead of Mr. Trump there. Conversely, in Michigan and Pennsylvania, he didn’t have a lead against any of them. Mr. Biden beat Mr. Trump by eight percentage points in Pennsylvania — where he was born — and by four points in Michigan. Mr. Sanders was up by five points against the president in Michigan, and by four points in Pennsylvania. Mr. Bloomberg led Mr. Trump by six points in Pennsylvania, and by five points in Michigan. The other three candidates included in the poll — Senator Amy Klobuchar, Pete Buttigieg and Senator Elizabeth Warren — generally fared a little less strongly, though Ms. Klobuchar had a strong, seven-point lead over Mr. Trump in Pennsylvania, and none of them were behind him there or in Michigan. A University of North Florida poll released this week found meaningful differences between the candidates’ chances in that state. Mr. Bloomberg beat Mr. Trump by six points among registered Florida voters, thanks in part to the strength of his support among voters with college degrees, according to the poll. Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Klobuchar, both hobbled by relatively weak support from black and Latino voters, each finished four points behind the president. Mr. Sanders and Mr. Biden both ran neck-and-neck with Mr. Trump. Like all surveys, head-to-head polls are not actually able to predict the future. They simply show what might happen if the election were held today. A lot will change over the course of the campaign. Still, what happens in these bellwether states will determine the election — so you can expect these kinds of head-to-head polls to be more common as the primary season rambles on, and as Democrats continue to fret over their chances to take down Mr. Trump. Drop us a line! We want to hear from our readers. Have a question? We’ll try to answer it. Have a comment? We’re all ears. Email us at onpolitics@nytimes.com. In this new weekly feature, our colleagues from The New York Times’s Opinion section will share expert analysis and perspectives from across the political spectrum. In today’s installment, there’s more to read about why electability is so unpredictable. There is a home base that all the conversation about the Democratic presidential primary comes back to in the end: Primary voters prioritize, above all, someone who can defeat President Trump. In any election that features an incumbent president, the main goal of the out-of-power party is to nominate a candidate well-suited to defeating the incumbent. That’s why both Republican Party elites and less enthusiastic conservative voters got behind Mitt Romney after a series of polls in 2011 showed he was the only Republican beating President Barack Obama in head-to-head matchups. This year, Democrats’ desire to replace the incumbent has reached a fever pitch, arguably higher than it’s ever been for either party. But paradigm-shifting presidents have complicated the idea of electability, as Adam Jentleson, a former deputy chief of staff for Senator Harry Reid, pointed out this week in an Op-Ed. Mr. Obama won his first election despite being a “black man who had admitted to using cocaine, who was caught on tape calling working-class whites ‘bitter’ people who ‘cling to guns and religion,’ and who sat in the pews with a pastor who declared, ‘God damn America’,” Mr. Jentleson said. Mr. Romney, the Republicans’ supposed safe bet, lost despite running against the sluggish economy under Mr. Obama. And Hillary Clinton, another supposed safe bet, lost to Donald J. Trump. So does anyone know what electability even means anymore? Our columnist Bret Stephens believes that “of course Bernie can win,” but also thinks that the current front-runner’s democratic socialist vision may be disqualifying for many voters: “For some of us, none-of-the-above is a viable option. For far too many others,” he writes, Trump will “be the devil they know.” — Talmon Joseph Smith Thanks for reading.

2020,What Is Your Reaction to the Results of the Iowa Caucuses?,"student opinion Who do you think was the big winner on the night? Who was the biggest loser? How do you think the results will impact the rest of the presidential race? Find all our Student Opinion questions here. The 2020 presidential primary season began with the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 3. How much have you been paying attention to the presidential campaign? Do you discuss it with your friends and family or in school? Do you have a favorite candidate or issue? Although Iowa has only 41 out of the 1,990 delegates needed to win the Democratic nomination, it is seen as critical in “creating the kind of momentum that can propel a candidate into New Hampshire, Nevada, South Carolina and beyond with a burst of enthusiasm. After an embarrassing 20-hour delay, the Iowa Democratic Party released its first set of results from 62 percent of caucus precincts on Feb. 4. (You can find the latest results here.) Who do you think was the big winner on the night? Who was the biggest loser? How do you think the results will impact the rest of the presidential race? In “Iowa Democrats Release Partial Caucus Results, but No Winner Yet,” Alexander Burns and Shane Goldmacher write: Democratic officials in Iowa on Tuesday provided a measure of clarity to the muddled outcome of its statewide caucuses, releasing a delayed first wave of partial results that showed Pete Buttigieg and Senator Bernie Sanders with a preliminary lead and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. falling well behind the other top-tier candidates. The release of the partial data, which accounted for 71 percent of caucus precincts, came after a night and day of suspense, confusion and silence from the Iowa Democratic Party after major problems with its new results reporting system. Even as the party began preparing to release the partial results on Tuesday afternoon, it drew sharp criticism from several campaigns that wanted a complete result, either to have a definitive outcome or frame their Iowa performance in the best possible light. While the results of Monday night’s caucuses could change with more data, the highly competitive race between Mr. Buttigieg, a moderate, and Mr. Sanders, a liberal, reflected the divisions among Democrats about the ideological direction of the party, and sets up a crucial test for both wings of the party in the New Hampshire primary, on Feb. 11, where Mr. Sanders leads in the polls. The partial Iowa results also showed Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts in third place, with Mr. Biden trailing her by several points and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota behind him. Yet there was little evidence in the data released Tuesday that any candidate was on the way to the kind of dominant victory that would have a good chance of transforming the Democratic race. No one appeared on track to receive more than about a quarter of the vote, and five held support in the double digits — a further indication that the Iowa caucuses were unlikely to play a decisive role in deciding the Democratic nominee. Several other candidates, including Andrew Yang and Tom Steyer, registered about 1 percent support or less. The article continues: The halting and hectic process in Iowa was an unsightly spectacle for the Democratic Party at the start of its presidential nominating process, offering President Trump an easy target for gloating and ridicule and raising serious questions about whether Iowa would be allowed to retain its first-in-the-nation status in future elections. Troy Price, the chairman of the Iowa Democratic Party, appeared downcast on Tuesday as he described the process as “unacceptable” in remarks to reporters. “As chair of the party, I apologize deeply for this,” he said. Mr. Price repeatedly stressed that the data was accurate and said the security of the returns was his “paramount concern.” The returns posted on Tuesday largely mirrored the scenario that the leading presidential campaigns detected during the caucuses, gathering precinct-level information on their own and in some cases releasing it to the media to make up for the void of hard results. Should the rest of the Iowa results mostly mirror the data published on Tuesday, it could represent a significant embarrassment for Mr. Biden, who entered the race as a front-runner last spring but has struggled mightily in recent months to compete with fresher-faced and more liberal rivals in both Iowa and New Hampshire. For a period in January, his campaign had grown hopeful that he had a chance of winning Iowa and establishing early dominance, but by caucus night that seemed a remote prospect. Mr. Biden is aiming to retake control of the race later in February, when the competition moves to Nevada and South Carolina, two far more diverse states long seen as friendly to his candidacy. But first he may have to explain his Iowa slump to the political donors whose support he needs to compete in the larger primary states that vote at the beginning of March. Students, read the entire article, then tell us: What is your reaction to the results of the Iowa caucuses? Who do you think was the big winner on the night? Who was the biggest loser? How do you think the results will impact the rest of the presidential race? What is your reaction to the delays in reporting the results of the caucuses? How do you think the confusion and delays around the results will affect the Democratic Party and its presidential candidates? Do you think the 2020 presidential race is an important one? Do you think it will have a big impact on you, your family and your community? In “The Trouble With Iowa,” David Leonhardt questions why the small state always gets to go first in the primary season: The combined population of Iowa and New Hampshire is 87 percent non-Hispanic white, which is roughly what the United States was in 1870. The states are also disproportionately older and completely lacking in cities with more than 250,000 residents. And yet Iowa and New Hampshire are treated like a national microcosm every four years and given outsize influence in choosing the president. This makes no sense. I know the usual justifications — that the states’ citizens take their democratic responsibilities seriously. But when you boil down that argument to its essence, it’s really an argument claiming that Iowans and New Hampshirites are intellectually and morally superior to other Americans. Do you agree with Mr. Leonhardt that it is unfair that such a small, and primarily white, state should always go first? Or, do you think Iowa should continue to go first and play a pivotal role in the nomination process? We know it is very early in the process, but go out on a limb and make a big prediction: Who will win the 2020 Democratic nomination? Students 13 and older are invited to comment.

2020,Opinion | Who Has the Best Chance to Beat Trump?,"letters Reflecting recent polls, readers don’t agree on a particular candidate. To the Editor: The election is going to be won or lost depending on which party gets voters to show up to vote, and who sits at home. For over 30 years, the moderate wing has controlled the Democratic Party — sometimes successfully, too often not. Moderates have wasted valuable time and effort trying to negotiate with Republicans when Republicans see negotiation as a sign of weakness. Rather than leading with ideas, Democratic leaders check the latest polls before making a decision. Far too often they have run timid instead of standing up for what they believe. Now we are faced with the most important election of our lives, and moderates are telling us how terrible it will be if we nominate a liberal. I don’t agree with Bernie Sanders on a lot of issues and would much rather see Elizabeth Warren as the leader of the liberal wing of the party, but both have the passion and fight to stand up for what they believe. If we want minorities and young people to show up on Election Day, I would trust either of them over Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar, Michael Bloomberg or Joe Biden. I fear that a moderate candidate will lose to President Trump. John HallinanStoughton, Wis. To the Editor: If the Democratic Party goes into its convention with Bernie Sanders having a plurality while the rest of the votes are spread among more moderate candidates, it might be a perfect time to institute ranked-choice voting. This would ensure that the resulting candidate was backed by a true majority. Tim TaylorCorvallis, Ore. To the Editor: Re “The Democrat Who Can Beat Trump,” by Adam Jentleson (Op-Ed, Feb. 18): As to the question of who can beat President Trump, the best, most reliable and most obvious data is being ignored. The answer is, simply, whom do Mr. Trump and his team fear most? The president is salivating to run against Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren. His campaign will rip them to shreds, and his victory would be epic. The only candidate whom Mr. Trump has a visceral fear of is Michael Bloomberg. Mr. Trump has proved his instincts. Back the candidate who gives him night terrors. Charles BeckerNovato, Calif. To the Editor: Adam Jentleson writes that it’s not clear who has the best chance to beat President Trump. Au contraire. It’s coming into focus now: Amy Klobuchar is coming from behind and emerging as a very strong contender. A woman with the right temperament, a former prosecutor who will make mincemeat of the president, a Midwesterner, someone who understands government and knows how to get things done — she has the electability factor in spades. Look at her list of what she will do in the first 100 days. Come on, women, we are the largest voting bloc! Not only can a woman get elected, a woman who will not be labeled a socialist, Amy Klobuchar, is the most formidable candidate in the field and will make an outstanding president. Jan UptonRedwood Valley, Calif. To the Editor: Re “‘Mass of Dead Energy’ vs. ‘Barking Clown’: Trump and Bloomberg Swap Insults” (nytimes.com, Feb. 13): Instead of height, let’s compare tax returns, college transcripts and charitable donations. Then let’s decide who’s the bigger man. Leslie HodgeSan Diego",The New York Times
2020,Democrats Turn to Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan for Trump State of the Union Response,"Ms. Whitmer won in a state the president carried by focusing on roads, schools and political pragmatism. She will face a national audience in her response to the State of the Union. [What to expect at Trump’s 2020 State of the Union Address.] LANSING, Mich. — Gretchen Whitmer has only been Michigan’s governor for 13 months. She has yet to “fix the damn roads,” as she repeatedly promised on the campaign trail. Beyond her state’s borders, she is largely unknown. But Ms. Whitmer, who on Tuesday will give the Democratic response to the State of the Union, has something her party covets: proof that Democrats can still win in the Midwest. And those swing-state credentials help explain why Speaker Nancy Pelosi called to offer her a national audience. “She’s fresh, she’s smart, she’s witty, she’s bold — and she comes from a state that the Democrats need,” said Kym Worthy, a Democrat who is the elected prosecutor in Wayne County, which includes Detroit. That Democratic leaders in Congress looked beyond their chambers to select Ms. Whitmer for the speech underscores Michigan’s potentially decisive role in this year’s presidential race. Just four years ago, Democrats were confident they would win the state, and many of them dismissed Donald J. Trump’s frequent campaign visits as quixotic. But after Mr. Trump took the White House by narrowly carrying Michigan, along with Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, a Democratic reckoning ensued. The party’s answer to that reckoning was Ms. Whitmer, an ex-prosecutor and longtime state lawmaker who won the governor’s office in 2018 by 10 percentage points. Her victory ended full Republican control of Michigan’s capital and lifted Democrats’ hopes of reclaiming the state — and with it the presidency — in 2020. “People see that all roads to the White House go through Michigan,” Ms. Whitmer, 48, said last week at her office across the street from the white dome of the State Capitol, where she had started to work on a draft of her speech. “The message coming out of Michigan is important.” In ideology and public disposition, Ms. Whitmer is the president’s opposite. She is a traditional Democratic politician who spent years rising through her party’s ranks. She supports abortion rights, stricter gun laws and other liberal policies. But she speaks about compromise and bipartisanship, and sometimes sounds more like a political moderate. By putting that contrast on national display, Democratic leaders hope to elevate Michigan, where both parties have already mobilized for November, as well as a particular vision for how they want to win back the industrial Midwest. As a candidate, Ms. Whitmer emphasized issues with cross-party appeal like road repair and health care, and carried a mix of rural, suburban and urban counties that Mr. Trump also won. “One of the lessons, I think, from 2016 was that you really have to show up,” Ms. Whitmer said. “When you do that, you can’t really get distracted by things that aren’t really front-and-center for voters.” Ms. Whitmer — whose speeches often fuse folksy humor with biting criticism — takes a national stage with a mixed record from her first year as governor. She worked with Republicans, who control the State Legislature, to lower Michigan’s high auto insurance rates and to allow judges to sentence 17-year-olds as juveniles, not adults. She also received national attention as the first governor to announce executive action to ban the sale of flavored vaping products. But Ms. Whitmer angered Republicans by issuing nearly 150 line-item vetoes to the state budget and alienated some Democrats by pushing for the closure of the only public high school in Benton Harbor, a majority-black city whose residents eventually convinced her to reverse course. On her signature issue — filling the state’s lunar-looking potholes and repaving its threadbare highways — the governor has failed to broker a compromise. After Republicans rejected her idea for a 45-cent-per-gallon gas tax increase to fix the roads, Ms. Whitmer announced unilateral action last week to finance construction with bonds. “This is a temporary solution to take credit for orange barrels,” said Lee Chatfield, the Republican speaker of the Michigan House of Representatives. Mr. Chatfield said that he considered Ms. Whitmer a friend and met with her regularly, but that “I do wish she’d be less partisan.” As a state legislator, Ms. Whitmer emerged as a voice for women’s rights, publicly describing her own experience of sexual assault years before the #MeToo movement. She also gained prominence as an early supporter of gay marriage and a frequent, sometimes fiery, critic of Republican policies. But she ran to the right of her two closest challengers in the Democratic primary for governor, and has positioned herself as a more moderate-sounding figure. Ms. Whitmer, whose name has been floated as a possible vice-presidential nominee, insisted in an interview that she remained a progressive Democrat, not a moderate. “I’d say she certainly has matured in her political style since she was in the Legislature,” said John Sellek, a Republican strategist in Lansing, the state capital. “Her style as governor has been to be forceful, but to portray optimism.” Members of both parties in Michigan described Ms. Whitmer as a talented, personable politician who is well-versed in policy and formidable behind a lectern. “She can actually address things in a way that people can comprehend it,” said Mayor Sheldon Neeley of Flint, a Democrat who said the governor was skilled in speaking to voters who had lost faith in government. “She can reach and she can touch and she can articulate a message for those individuals to be able to re-engage.” But where liberals described a leader tough enough to not back down to Republican demands, conservatives complained about an unwilling negotiator whose actions as governor have veered to the left of her campaign rhetoric. “Governor Whitmer ran as a moderate who would fix the roads and build bridges,” said Tori Sachs, a former aide to Ms. Whitmer’s Republican predecessor who is now the executive director of Michigan Rising Action, a conservative advocacy group. But so far, Ms. Sachs said, Ms. Whitmer’s tenure has been defined by failure on the road issue and budget vetoes that she said displayed a level of “political vindictiveness” unfamiliar in Lansing. Ms. Whitmer’s roughly 10-minute rebuttal to the president, to be delivered from East Lansing High School, carries both potential pitfalls and the opportunity to elevate her national profile. Members of Congress frequently give the responses — including Representative Veronica Escobar, Democrat of Texas, who will give a Spanish-language rebuttal to the president on Tuesday. But both parties have at times tapped state-level politicians for the role, which is seen as an annual proving ground for up-and-coming politicians. Nikki Haley, then the governor of South Carolina, gave the Republican response to President Barack Obama’s speech in 2016, a year before she became Mr. Trump’s ambassador to the United Nations. Kathleen Sebelius, who once gave the Democratic response to President George W. Bush when she was governor of Kansas, was later named to Mr. Obama’s cabinet. And Stacey Abrams, a former Georgia state legislator who narrowly lost the 2018 race for governor, gave the Democratic response last year. But missteps in the speech can become a punchline for years, as Senator Marco Rubio of Florida learned when he reached for a sip of water during his 2013 response. And Ms. Whitmer’s speech comes at an especially fraught time, with an election looming, an impeachment trial fresh in mind and a president known for riffing. Ms. Whitmer said she was still considering having different pieces of material prepared for her speech, with the option of adding or subtracting based on what Mr. Trump says. “Depending on what’s going on in the Senate, I can envision lots of different wild scenarios,” Ms. Whitmer said last week. “And I think it would be a mistake to just give a prewritten speech and not acknowledge some of it. So I think we have to be nimble.” Updated Feb. 29, 2020",The New York Times
2020,Who Is Rod Blagojevich and Why Did Trump Commute His Sentence?,"Mr. Blagojevich, a Democrat and former governor of Illinois, was accused of trying to sell the Senate seat left open when Barack Obama went to the White House. CHICAGO — Rod R. Blagojevich, whose criminal sentence President Trump has commuted, became a household name when he was arrested 12 years ago on an explosive accusation: Prosecutors said he had tried to sell or trade to the highest bidder the Senate seat that Barack Obama was vacating to become the president. Mr. Blagojevich’s expletive-filled remarks about his role in choosing a new senator — caught on government recordings of phone calls — became punch lines for late-night television. “I’ve got this thing, and it’s golden,” he was memorably quoted as saying, using profanities. “And I’m just not giving it up for nothing. I’m not going to do it. And I can always use it. I can parachute me there.” In the years he has since spent in federal prison in Colorado, Mr. Blagojevich’s name has faded some. (So has his trademark pouf of black hair.) Mr. Blagojevich, a Democrat, was not only governor of Illinois and a former member of Congress, but also an undeniably flamboyant character. He was an Elvis Presley fan who was also known for eloquent recitations of anecdotes from leaders he admired, like Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan; a figure who protested his innocence at every chance, including on reality television and radio shows and in a book he wrote; and an isolated governor who was said to keep a hairbrush nearby at all times. On Tuesday, as word of the commutation of his sentence spread, crowds of reporters gathered outside Mr. Blagojevich’s house on Chicago’s North Side — where a supporter sang “God bless our president!” to the tune of “God Bless America” — and outside the federal prison in suburban Denver, where a car repeatedly drove by with a large “Trump 2020” flag waving from the rear window. By evening, Mr. Blagojevich, trim and silver-haired, arrived at Denver’s airport for a commercial plane ride home as news cameras caught up to him. He told reporters that he had learned about his commutation earlier in the day from other inmates who had seen television reports of it. Mr. Blagojevich said he was looking forward to a banana split. He said, as he said before prison, that he made mistakes but broke no laws. And then he worked the waiting area beside his gate, shaking hands with waiting travelers, including a pilot. About a month after Mr. Obama was elected president in 2008, Mr. Blagojevich, the sitting governor of Illinois, was arrested early one morning at his Chicago home. The accusations were stunning: Prosecutors said Mr. Blagojevich (pronounced bluh-GOY-uh-vich, though plenty of people, even in Illinois, still just call him “Blago”) had not only tried to crassly benefit from making an appointment to Mr. Obama’s vacant Senate seat, but had also sought millions of dollars from people with state business in all sorts of other scenarios. Federal prosecutors said the conduct was so abysmal that it “would make Lincoln roll over in his grave.” The state’s political scene was turned upside down. Lawmakers impeached and removed him, even as he defiantly fought back, seeming to embrace the spectacle. After two trials — jurors were deadlocked on most of the charges in the first one — Mr. Blagojevich was convicted of 18 charges and sentenced to 14 years in prison. (A judicial panel later ruled that five of the convictions were invalid, but the sentence stood.) He left Chicago for a prison in Colorado in 2012, and even down to the last day, he kept talking. When Mr. Blagojevich was awaiting trial, he did something lots of legal experts warned was a risky and unwise idea: He went out and talked about his innocence. A lot. He hosted a radio show. He agreed to appear in a spoof of his own political career (“Rod Blagojevich Superstar!”). He sang “Treat Me Nice,” a song Elvis Presley was better known for, at a Chicago block party. He had perhaps the widest audience, though, when he appeared in a season of “The Celebrity Apprentice,” hosted by Donald Trump. “You’ve got a hell of a lot of guts,” the future president told the former governor in one episode, according to a Chicago Magazine account. “You’re out there punching away.” “Governor, you’ve proven you have a lot of fight,” Mr. Trump said just before firing Mr. Blagojevich from the show, according to a Chicago Magazine recap. “I feel badly for him,” Mr. Trump said later on the show. “He tried, but I feel badly. It’s pretty sad.” Several years ago, when President Trump first suggested that he might consider commuting Mr. Blagojevich’s sentence, the former governor’s former lawyer, Sam Adam Jr., declared it good news. By April of 2018, Mr. Blagojevich’s many efforts at other legal appeals and options had run out. “It’s something I would love to see — for his children, for his family,” Mr. Adam said in 2018. “He got to know him and Donald Trump was someone who was fond of him. We got so much heat for letting him go out and do that stuff back then. How ironic if that turns out to be his saving grace.” As months passed with no commutation, his family kept pressing the case. Mr. Blagojevich’s wife, Patti, made frequent appearances on Fox News, appealing to the president for mercy and criticizing how federal prosecutors handled the case. “That Obama Justice Department locked him up and threw away the key,” Ms. Blagojevich said last year on Fox. She added that Mr. Trump’s public consideration of the case gave her “a tremendous amount of hope.” Deb Mell, who is Mr. Blagojevich’s sister-in-law, said on Tuesday that the family was thrilled with the news. Family members declined to speak in detail, but they scheduled a news conference for Wednesday morning. It was set for the same location — outside Mr. Blagojevich’s Chicago home — where he had appeared in 2012 on the day he left for prison. If the rest of the world has forgotten about Rod Blagojevich, Illinois has not. Some political leaders — Democrats and Republicans — had sharp critiques of President Trump’s decision to commute the former governor’s sentence. “In a state where corrupt, machine-style politics is still all too common, it’s important that those found guilty serve their prison sentence in its entirety,” said Tim Schneider, the chairman of the state’s Republican Party. “Rod Blagojevich is certainly no exception. The former governor’s proven record of corruption is a stain upon Illinois and its citizens. We must stand up and send the message that corruption will not be tolerated in Illinois.” And Republican members of the congressional delegation from the state said they were disappointed by the decision. “Blagojevich is the face of public corruption in Illinois, and not once has he shown any remorse for his clear and documented record of egregious crimes that undermined the trust placed in him by voters,” a statement issued by five members of Congress read. “As our state continues to grapple with political corruption, we shouldn’t let those who breached the public trust off the hook.” Some other Illinois politicians have questioned the severity of Mr. Blagojevich’s sentence. Roland W. Burris, whom Mr. Blagojevich ultimately appointed to the vacant Senate seat, said he was pleased that the former governor was coming home. A full pardon would have been even better, Mr. Burris said. “For him to be away for eight years for running his mouth — I just think that was excessive,” said Mr. Burris, who was never embraced by fellow Democrats during his stint in the Senate, and did not run for re-election; he has since retired as a lawyer in Chicago. “Patti stuck by him all the way,” Mr. Burris said, “and I just hope that he can settle in now and get his life back together.” But the state’s current governor, J.B. Pritzker, also a Democrat, was critical of the commutation. “President Trump has abused his pardon power in inexplicable ways to reward his friends and condone corruption, and I deeply believe this pardon sends the wrong message at the wrong time,” he wrote as part of a Twitter thread. And Jim Durkin, the Republican leader in the Illinois House of Representatives, told reporters on Tuesday that Mr. Blagojevich had been “rogue on steroids” and that he disagreed with the president’s decision. “It’s just because of the celebrity of Rod Blagojevich,” Mr. Durkin said. “And I think it’s wrong, and it sends a bad message to the people of this country, that, you know what, you don’t exactly have to pay your debt to society.” Ellen Almer Durston contributed reporting from Chicago.

2020,Who Is the Dalai Lama?,"Nonfiction When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. THE DALAI LAMAAn Extraordinary LifeBy Alexander Norman “Dalai Lama” is a foreign title. Tibetans refer to him with names like “Precious Protector,” “Wish-Fulfilling Jewel” and “the Presence.” The divide between the Tibetan Buddhist world — which often has included China and Mongolia — and the world beyond has rarely been of particular consequence to the Dalai Lamas, until this one, the 14th, who is the first to spend most of his life in exile; he fled to India in 1959 and has not returned. His biographer, facing the usual problems of recounting the life of a figure still living (the Dalai Lama will be 85 this year), is also faced with the dilemma of describing his life on the world stage (which has been fairly well documented) and his life inside the world of Tibetan Buddhism (which has not). This is the challenge that Alexander Norman, a longtime associate of the Dalai Lama, takes up in his new biography. Who is the Dalai Lama? Tibet is unique in the Buddhist world for its system of “incarnate lamas,” the idea being that advanced spiritual masters are able to choose the place for their next rebirth, returning to the world in lifetime after lifetime to teach the dharma. There were many such lineages of lamas in Tibet, and the Dalai Lama was just one of them until 1642. It was then that the fifth Dalai Lama was placed on the throne of Tibet by a Mongol khan, his successors becoming at least the titular head of state. The current incarnation took over the government in 1950 at age 15 when the People’s Liberation Army crossed into eastern Tibet. Like the authors of other biographies of the current Dalai Lama, Norman does not read or speak Tibetan. However, he has the advantage of being able to use histories published over the past two decades that draw on Tibetan and Chinese sources, none more important than the four volumes by Melvyn C. Goldstein, which provide 2,700 pages on the period from 1913 to 1959. Norman puts these to good use, as well as recently published books about the Dalai Lama’s two tutors, making this biography the most detailed and accurate to date. “The Dalai Lama: An Extraordinary Life” is strongest on the early period, starting, wisely, not with the 14th Dalai Lama, but the 13th (1876-1933), who faced so many of the challenges that his successor would inherit and who left a chillingly prescient prophecy of what lay ahead for his country. Norman makes clear that “old Tibet” was no Shangri-La, describing the corruption and intrigue of the Tibetan court and the sclerosis that the 13th and the young 14th tried, and failed, to cure. The book contains a number of errors, most of the minor variety, especially concerning the admittedly arcane world of Tibetan Buddhism; the Dalai Lama did not debate about colors — a topic for novice monks — during his examination for the highest monastic degree. Throughout, however, the biography is judicious on topics that often inspire hyperbole and mystification. For example, the Dalai Lama has navigated the modern world while consulting on all matters of import with oracles possessed by wrathful deities. Norman’s description of a crisis over which deity to propitiate, a crisis that began with the thirteenth and continues to the present day, is impressive in its clarity. He also reveals the Dalai Lama to be a sophisticated thinker and consummate scholar, one whose feet remain firmly on the ground, a trait often obscured by his broken English. In keeping with a religion so obsessed with prophecy, the book, written in an engaging prose, ends with an insightful prediction of the legacy of the fourteenth Dalai Lama, and a cleareyed assessment of the challenges that the fifteenth will face.",The New York Times
2020,Who Killed the Caucuses?,"On Politics With Lisa Lerer Everyone is really sorry about what happened in Iowa. But nobody will take the blame. Hi. Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. In Iowa, the buck stops with no one. We are now into the fourth day of what I’ve taken to calling the Great Caucus Catastrophe of 2020. There are still no definitive results. And so far, no one seems willing to take responsibility for the meltdown. Sure, there have been apologies. Regrets, they have a few. But no one has uttered three simple words: It’s my fault. The Democratic National Committee blames the Iowa Democratic Party. Today, Tom Perez, the D.N.C. chairman, called for a recanvass, a process the state party says it will undertake if specifically requested by a campaign. The state party, meanwhile, blames an app created by a Democratic tech firm to report the results. The coders say the problem was not with the app but their ability to transmit the results. They “sincerely regret the delay” and promise to “apply the lessons learned in the future.” Yet, the app is only one problem of many. Party officials bowed to pressure from Senator Bernie Sanders and his team to release three sets of results rather than just the traditional delegate count — yet they didn’t design a system that could handle the additional work of twice collecting the total vote count. They withheld the technical details of the app, making it hard for outsiders to vet it for security concerns and usability. And clearly the training was insufficient, considering that some of the precinct captains couldn’t even download it. Precinct captains who called a phone hotline to report results waited for hours on hold, with some repeatedly getting hung up on during caucus night. As we reported yesterday, the party set up 85 phone lines to handle calls from more than 1,600 caucus sites. Troy Price, the chair of the state party, blamed supporters of President Trump for flooding the line. “State parties don’t have the capacity to run a 21st century election,” said David Pepper, chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party. “I’m sure everyone worked hard, but it’s just not a good idea.” Even the results that Iowa Democrats have released are “riddled with inconsistencies and other flaws,” according to a New York Times investigation. “More than 100 precincts reported results that were internally inconsistent, that were missing data or that were not possible under the complex rules of the Iowa caucuses,” according to the analysis posted by our Upshot colleagues today. Mr. Price has offered an apology and promised a full independent investigation. But he has given no real explanation for what went wrong. Candidates are getting fed up with the uncertainty. “That screw-up has been extremely unfair to the people of Iowa, it has been unfair to the candidates, all of the candidates, and all of their supporters,” Mr. Sanders said at a news conference today. He’s right: The delay had a real impact on the dynamics of the race. The importance of Iowa stems from the momentum it can lend a candidate. Both Pete Buttigieg and Mr. Sanders, the two top finishers, lost some of theirs in the morass of mismanagement. But the fallout will last far past 2020. Already, officials in Illinois, Michigan and other states have barely suppressed their glee at the idea of jumping to the front of the primary calendar. How Iowa Democrats handle the next steps will affect their already-diminishing chances of keeping their first-in-the-nation voting status. Even if the caucuses go the way of the dodo, problems with technology and elections are only likely to multiply. Election watchers see the caucus meltdown as a giant warning sign about the dangers to come as new technologies complicate voting, making it easier for bad actors to tamper with the most basic building blocks of our democracy. Without a full accounting for what went wrong, a process that includes taking responsibility, it’s hard to identify those weaknesses — never mind figuring out how to avoid them in the future. So, Iowa, I’ll be waiting by the phone for your explanations. Probably on hold. Drop us a line! We want to hear from our readers. Have a question? We’ll try to answer it. Have a comment? We’re all ears. Email us at onpolitics@nytimes.com. When Tom Perez, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, demanded that Iowa Democrats double-check votes from Monday’s caucuses, he mentioned a “recanvass.” There is also the possibility of a “recount.” What’s the difference? In short: A recanvass involves checking the math on 1,756 precinct work sheets. A recount would require the hand-counting of about 180,000 preference cards from caucusgoers across the state and around the world. Here’s how we got to this point, and what would most likely happen if a recanvass or recount occurs: What, The New York Times’s banner headline — “SPLIT SENATE CLEARS TRUMP ON EACH COUNT IN FINALE OF A BITTER IMPEACHMENT BATTLE” — wasn’t catchy enough?

2020,Who Made My Puzzle?,"puzzle making This month’s constructor spotlight shines on Ross Trudeau. My objectively bad cat Ruby and I live in Cambridge, Mass. I pitched the great Lou Ann Walker on including a lit-themed puzzle in the journal she edits, The Southampton Review. She agreed, despite my lack of experience, because she’s a lovely human and she’s cuckoo bananas for crosswords. The Times first published one of my grids on Feb. 9, 2017. I was living with my good friend Alex J. Blenkinsop, an Englishman whose vernacular quickly wormed its way into my heart. The puzzle put the ATLANTIC OCEAN vertically down the middle of the grid, with Britishisms and their American “translations” occupying symmetrical spaces on either side, such as KNACKERED across from EXHAUSTED. I got into solving puzzles as a high school English teacher in Oakland. I was reading The Times before class one morning and a student asked, “Trudeau, do you ever do the crossword?” I said no, and she said that surprised her because I “taught English” and “used big words like ‘pedantic.’” She was trolling me, and it worked. I turned to the Arts section and failed spectacularly to solve half of a Tuesday puzzle. That was 2010, and the rest is history. I was inspired to try making a puzzle because of the elegance of Patrick Berry puzzles and the ingeniousness of Erik Agard’s. It’s a full-blown compulsion. My resting state these days is thinking about puzzles or anagramming whatever words drift across my field of vision. “No Parking,” I noticed the other day, anagrams to “a porn king.” As of this writing, I’m still happy in my addiction. I use CrossFire, loaded up with Jeff Chen’s word list over at xwordinfo.com. I add words manually on a pretty ad hoc basis, generally when I’m trying to develop more options for a theme set. This morning I added DRAG UNDER (“Pull to the depths”) — which hadn’t been in my word list — while trying to completing a SECRET SAUCE theme. (See it?)* I’ll be dead and buried before I put RUBY in a puzzle. I love my cat dearly, but it’d go straight to her pretty little head. And I should give a shout-out to my frequent collaborator Amanda Rafkin, who pestered me for months about putting KEN in a grid so she could use the clue “Toy made with no plastic junk.” (She recently got her wish in the Inkubator crossword.) In 2020, I’m limiting my number of submissions to The New York Times to no greater than the number of puzzles I’ve facilitated/collaborated on with underrepresented constructor groups: women and those who identify as such, people of color, and LGBTQ folk. If you fall into any of these categories, feel free to contact me on Twitter or Instagram, and I’d be honored to do what I can to help you get your puzzle published. Oh, and you can get a new free biweekly puzzle at my site, www.rosswordpuzzles.com. Get it?

2020,Who Needs Special Effects When You Have Arts and Crafts?,"The giant sea creature in the film “Wendy” isn’t a computer creation but a life-size puppet made by one of the screenwriters (and help from a sponge farm). Eliza Zeitlin was adamant: the puppet had to be life-size. In “Wendy,” a rustic adaptation of “Peter Pan” that opens Friday in theaters, a glowing underwater sea creature serves as a possible solution to growing up. Zeitlin, the production designer and screenwriter who co-wrote “Wendy” with her older brother, the director Benh Zeitlin, was certain that the mysterious being needed to be giant and as real-looking as possible. “A lot of people were not excited about that,” Eliza Zeitlin admitted in January after the siblings’s film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival. “Part of the magic of cinema is trickery, but I think you know when you’re looking at something that’s not real. I wanted her to be full size for the audience and also for the kids. I wanted the kids to be able to feel that this character is real.” So while the Zeitlins, who had previously collaborated on “Beasts of the Southern Wild,” took turns writing the script and scouting locations in Antigua and Montserrat, Eliza was busy creating a 30-foot long monster with a 12-foot gullet that the children characters could interact with. Made of plastic and silicone, “Mother,” as she is called in the film, was covered in real sponges — or rather remnants of the real thing — that the designer had trucked in. “We found a sponge farm in Florida that was willing to give us truckloads of all their sponge scrap,” she said. The sponges, which she painted to look like barnacles, created a soft enough surface that the children — most of whom were acting for the first time — could hug her without getting hurt. The creation of a malleable prop like Mother led to other challenges for crew members. To transport the giant beast, they had to cut it into five pieces (each carried by Eliza Zeitlin, who did a lot of the testing by herself) and reassemble it in the water. They also had to find underwater puppeteers, a job that doesn’t actually exist. The two settled on turning the engineers and fabricators of the creature into divers — and puppeteers. “Initially, we were trying to research who had done large-scale underwater puppets before and we were digging in, digging in,” said Benh Zeitlin. “And we were like, ‘Wow, this is amazing. No one has ever done this before. Great.’” The Zeitlins also needed to light the creature underwater, a challenge they solved by making casings for film projectors that would display slow-motion fireworks to gave the creature’s gullet both light and movement. (Visual effects were necessary on the back end to bring the whole film together, but that also proved challenging since VFX supervisors need a still point to do their work and the guiding principle of Mother was that she be in constant motion.) The biggest heartbreak for the siblings, who grew up in Sunnyside, Queens, with folklorist parents who encouraged their creative expression, came on an Antigua beach while filming the final scene. They had initially envisioned Mother on the shore surrounded by singing children, but changing surf conditions turned a low tide into formidable force that threatened to overwhelm the very location itself. “The puppet is sitting there on the shore, and one wave comes through and fills the entire face with sand,” Eliza recalled. “We just saw her getting torn apart,” Benh said. “That was definitely the darkest hour for me,” Eliza added. But they recovered quickly and rewrote the scene, making it puppetless. “In retrospect, we were just taking a much too literal approach to the storytelling,” Eliza said. “Even if the puppet had looked perfect and the location had worked, the scene is much better for not having the giant puppet in the middle of it.”",The New York Times
2020,Who Needs a Caribbean Yacht When You Can Take the Ferry?,"frugal Traveler In the British Virgin Islands, get cheap maritime thrills and rub shoulders with locals on one of the region’s most convenient ferry systems. The ferry dock in Road Town, Tortola, the capital of the British Virgin Islands.Credit...Anne Bequette for The New York Times Orion was shining brightly in the dark sky above Anegada in the British Virgin Islands. But the constellation had some electric competition in the band of bright mast lights bobbing offshore — “like a bejeweled Orion’s belt,” observed a new acquaintance who introduced himself as Spoons, the pilot of one of those yachts. He and his crew of five friends from the Boston area had paid $10,900 for eight days on a 45-foot catamaran to sail from island to island. Chartering a boat is one way to island hop in the B.V.I. — and a popular one. According to the tourism board, slightly more than half of all visitors to the British overseas territory’s 60 islands and cays stay on yachts. I, on the other hand, chose a far cheaper way to travel between islands. Using the B.V.I. ferry system, I spent $140 — not including accommodations, which added about $700 to my expenses — over a five-day trip, reaching four ports in bargain, connect-the-dots style. In the Caribbean, several ferry companies offer opportunities for multi-island vacations, such as the L’Express des Iles, which cruises from Guadeloupe to Dominica, Martinique and St. Lucia. Others offer domestic service, including ferries from St. Vincent to some of the outlying Grenadines, and those that link the United States Virgin Islands. But few Caribbean destinations offer a ferry system as extensive and convenient as the British Virgin Islands’. The tourism board details schedules and links to seven islands on an interactive web page devoted to island hopping. Loblolly Bay 10 miles Anegada Reef Hotel Atlantic Ocean anegada British Virgin Islands Virgin Gorda Cane Garden Bay Road Town Fast Ferry Charlotte Amalie Road Town Spanish Town tortola Caribbean Sea u.s. virgin islands Atlantic Ocean cuba haiti Guadeloupe Dominica Caribbean Sea st. lucia st. vincent and the grenadines 250 miles By The New York Times From my first childhood ferry trip to Mackinac Island, Mich., where cars are banned, I have had a romance with ships that fill in for roads, carry vital cargo and allow communities to thrive in isolated places. They are buses for commuters, trucks for suppliers and relatively cheap maritime thrills for travelers. Yes, cruise ships can actually be a rock-bottom ticket to the Caribbean — on my trip, I met a couple from South Carolina who spent only $600 each on an 11-day Norwegian cruise — but as an independent traveler, I find those affordable ships too big, and small charters too expensive. The ferry system seemed just right to this backpacking Goldilocks. Seeking a winter warm up and a budget tropical vacation, I went to the B.V.I. in January to test the convenience and cost of the ferry system, hitting the cruise hub of Tortola, the mountainous beauty of Virgin Gorda, and remote Anegada. Often, the cheapest flights from the United States that arrive nearest the B.V.I. land in St. Thomas (in the United States Virgin Islands), which is where I caught the 8:30 a.m. Road Town Fast Ferry from downtown Charlotte Amalie to Road Town, the B.V.I. capital, 50 minutes away on the island of Tortola ($60 round trip; the United States dollar is the official currency of the B.V.I.). A mix of day trippers, business commuters, yacht renters and one friendly couple from Tortola who helped me with my immigration form joined me on the windy trip aboard the 82-foot passenger ferry BVI Patriot. With four-foot waves and occasional sprinkles, I sat on the upper deck inside the cabin, which was both strangely ordinary — two flat screens tuned to CNN delivered news of the Democratic presidential debates and a snowstorm in New York — and wildly exotic as we passed leggy cactuses growing out of rock islets, forested hillsides of undeveloped islands and a few stands of barren mangroves, evidence of Hurricanes Irma and Maria, which struck in 2017. (The damage inflicted by those hurricanes brought the hotel room inventory to about 1,500, down from 2,700.) Two cruise ships in the harbor dwarfed the 149-passenger BVI Patriot when we arrived. After clearing immigration, I hired a taxi driver, Conrad “Dodgy” Lewis — “Dodgy doesn’t describe my driving,” he insisted — to take me from the congested capital over the island’s mountain spine to Cane Garden Bay, one of Tortola’s most popular beaches, and back several hours later, in time for my late-afternoon ferry to Virgin Gorda for $50. At Cane Garden Bay, lounge chairs and umbrellas colonized the sand in front of a series of restaurant terraces and beach bars, welcoming travelers from the cruise ships, arriving in open-air buses. On an overcast day, I walked the beach between sporadic downpours to the more than 400-year-old Callwood Rum Distillery where Matthew Callwood, a distiller, bartender, tour guide and member of the family that has owned the distillery since the 1800s, led me and two cruise passengers on a tour ($5) of the mostly outdoor distillery works, including a 19th-century sugar cane crusher originally powered by harnessed donkeys. “There used to be 28 distilleries on the island, and now there’s just us,” he said, pouring shots of Callwood’s four rums, including white, spiced and the smoother aged version he recommended. “It’s good for sipping, or putting in your coffee in the morning.” I stashed a pint ($12) in my pack and moved on down the beach, watching divebombing pelicans on the water and free-ranging chickens on land. Beachfront restaurants teemed with day drinkers, but I followed Dodgy’s advice for lunch and went to Banana’s Bar & Grill, a polished bistro where cabdrivers were stopping in for takeout chicken soup. I learned why. Inexpensive and delicious, my $9 bowl brimmed with root vegetables, spinach and large tender pieces of chicken, bones and all. If I had had time, I would have enjoyed outlasting the cruise passengers and staying on Cane Garden Bay at a place like Myett’s Garden Inn on the Beach, running $250 a night on Airbnb. But I had a ferry to catch. Racing to make the late afternoon Speedy’s ferry to Virgin Gorda ($30 round trip), I was joined by a day-tripping set of cruise passengers, another American couple bound for a week at a luxury resort, uniformed schoolchildren and several returning islanders clutching bunches of stuffed shopping bags. One visitor leaned over the port railing, welcoming the warm wind in his face for the entire 30-minute passage toward Virgin Gorda, said to have been named Fat Virgin by Christopher Columbus for its pregnant profile. You can tell a lot about an island by its ferry cargo. There were pallets of bottled water on the boat to Tortola. On Virgin Gorda, Speedy’s deckhands unloaded cases of Veuve Clicquot and Cakebread Cellars wines. Virgin Gorda has long attracted the rich and famous. Taxi drivers pointed out Morgan Freeman’s former home and Richard Branson’s two nearby islands. Recently reopened after the hurricanes forced substantial rebuilding, Rosewood Little Dix Bay has catered to the affluent since Laurance Rockefeller developed the resort in 1964. Consequently, a solitary backpacker seemed an usual sight in Spanish Town, the main settlement on Virgin Gorda. I declined taxi offers in favor of a 15-minute walk to Fischer’s Cove Beach Hotel, where blossoms were tucked in conch shells and towels in my tidy and spacious room ($175 a night). Only when I stepped onto the flamingo-pink patio and looked up did I realize there used to be a second story above, where rebar now pierced the blue sky. The Flax family, owners of the hotel, are gradually rebuilding after the hurricanes. Tropical foliage has sprung back on much of the mountainous island, home to a series of national parks, including Gorda Peak National Park, with its panoramic trail to 1,370 feet elevation. Staying overnight on Virgin Gorda offers a rare opportunity to visit its best-loved beauty spot — the Baths National Park, protecting a dramatic stretch of shore where massive granite boulders as big as 40 feet in diameter cluster in the shallows — before the cruise ship crowds arrive. At 7 a.m. when the first blush of light began pinking the clouds, I started down the park path past cactuses and the occasional orchid to Devil’s Bay where a septuagenarian foursome was quietly skinny dipping. I waited out a 10-minute rain shower in a shorefront cave weathered by the action of the waves. The path continued over and between the Baths’ boulders, sometimes with the assistance of steps or rope holds bolted into the rocks, walling off calm, shallow, swim-inviting pools. I saw evidence of other early birds at the Baths — “M + M 2020” seemed freshly written in the sand — but I never saw them until I completed the roughly mile-long circuit and returned to the entrance at 8:30 a.m. where a line was already forming. “Tortola is the big city to us,” Dawn Flax, one of the family members who runs Fischer’s Cove, told me when I checked in. “We go there when we need to go to the bank or the lawyer.” A day later, I ran into her at the ferry terminal on Tortola, returning home after a banking run. It was an unintended stop, but when the Wednesday departure from Virgin Gorda to Anegada was canceled, I was forced to the B.V.I.’s hub to catch Road Town Fast Ferry’s 300-passenger Lady Caroline from Tortola to Anegada ($50 round trip). Of the six of us scattered among 30 seats on the outside upper deck, five were returning islanders, quizzing two with roll-aboard luggage about their vacation abroad. Children scrambled up and down the stairs for vending machine snacks and teenage couples leaned into each other, sharing earbuds. But the high seas soon quelled conversation, abandoned to the rush of the wind, the rhythmic rise and fall of passing boats under sail and the shifting view of outlying islands. Sandy and flat where its sibling islands are steep and rugged, Anegada — the most northeastern island in the B.V.I., and the only coral island in the volcanic chain — resolved into view like an overgrown sandbar during the one-hour crossing. From the concrete ferry pier, I got the vaguest of directions to my hotel — walk down the pier and take your first left — which turned out to be accurate. By late afternoon, the outdoor, oceanfront bar at the Anegada Reef Hotel was packed, not solely with guests of the 10-room hotel (from $155 a night), but also with sailors from the many yachts moored in front of it. Other than the pre-sunset rush for rum-based Painkiller cocktails, the nightly hotel barbecue featuring the island’s renowned spiny lobster, and a D.J. blaring “Love Shack” from a bar at Potter’s by the Sea down the beach, Anegada is quiet. “You come to Anegada to swim and sleep under the sea grapes in the shade and wake up and swim and eat and drink and sleep again,” explained an islander at the bar. “No one will bother you.” I hoped not, especially when I rented a scooter the next morning for $50 a day from Michael Hastick, the co-owner of L&M rentals. He gave me, a scooter novice, a quick lesson in operating the vehicle and when I asked the speed limit, he smiled. “There’s only one cop on the island,” he said, pointing to the empty street. “It’s Anegada, and this is rush hour.” Technically, the speed limit is 30 m.p.h. And the occasional traffic obstacles were goats. Michael marked up a small map indicating where I would see the island’s flamingos (distantly, in an interior pond), its endangered Anegada iguanas (in conservation cages next to the police station) and its best beaches, especially Loblolly Bay on the north shore, home to beach bars for castaways (Flash of Beauty) and party people (Big Bamboo). Despite an open sign, Flash of Beauty was deserted at 10 a.m. Conch shells lined sand paths through the dunes to the beach, strafed by surf despite the barrier of distant Horseshoe Reef, visible in a line of frothy waves. I plunged in and immediately saw conch shells and rainbow-colored fish schooling around coral heads, but with the strong current I decided that as much as I love solitude, it wasn’t safe to swim alone. It was, however, completely safe to leave my cellphone, wallet and scooter keys, and walk for miles down the deserted beach, returning to find everything as I left it, Flash of Beauty still closed and no other visitors. Chased by another downpour, I stopped at nearby Anegada Beach Club, home to intriguing palapa-roofed beachfront tents, a kite-surfing school and a poolside restaurant where I met Paula and Michelle Mau, a couple from Omaha who regularly visit the island. “Anegada is the end of the world,” Michelle said. “There’s no one here. It’s magic.” The Maus spread some of that magic by inviting me, after just a five-minute chat, to join them on a private boat they had chartered to snorkel around the uninhabited east end of the island. We saw four-foot barracuda, green sea turtles and shy puffer fish. We froze in another pelting downpour and dried out in the sun. We cruised by 12-foot-high islands composed of conch shells that harvesters, dating back to the indigenous Arawak, cast off after taking the meat, creating pearly pink mounds where terns posed in profile. They wouldn’t take a dime in return, though the four-hour trip cost more than $300. Before leaving on the next day’s 8:30 a.m. ferry to Tortola and onward to St. Thomas, I walked the beach to Neptune’s Treasure resort where the aroma of cinnamon rolls from Pam’s Kitchen served as an olfactory siren to sailors aboard the 50-some yachts tied up offshore. The Caribbean is rarely a thrifty destination. Food can be expensive (I paid $40 for half a lobster at the Lobster Trap on Anegada). There were unexpected fees, including a B.V.I. environmental tax of $10 upon arrival and a $20 departure fee. My hotels would have been a better deal if split with a companion. I spent close to $1,000 on the trip. But the compensation of taking the ferries went beyond financial. I traveled with commuting islanders of all ages, passed the time in terminal waiting rooms with women doing word search puzzles and joined them in bringing my own lunch aboard. These regular sailors knew to sit starboard to avoid the sun on the afternoon Anegada run and to move to the exit before docking to beat the disembarking crowds at Tortola. Still, no one seemed to take this special means of transportation for granted. Like me, they tugged on sweaters, sat in the shade and watched the successive hues of blue streaming in and out of sight between water and sky.

2020,Who Really Killed Malcolm X?,"Fifty-five years later, the case may be reopened. For more than half a century, scholars have maintained that prosecutors convicted the wrong men in the assassination of Malcolm X. Now, 55 years after that bloody afternoon in February 1965, the Manhattan district attorney’s office is reviewing whether to reinvestigate the murder. Some new evidence comes from a six-part documentary called “Who Killed Malcolm X?,” streaming on Netflix Feb. 7, which posits that two of the men convicted could not have been at the scene that day. Instead it points the finger at four members of a Nation of Islam mosque in Newark, N.J., depicting their involvement as an open secret in their city. One even appeared in a 2010 campaign ad for then-Newark mayor Cory Booker. “What got us hooked,” said Rachel Dretzin, a director of the documentary along with Phil Bertelsen, “was the notion that the likely shotgun assassin of Malcolm X was living in plain sight in Newark, and that many people knew of his involvement, and he was uninvestigated, unprosecuted, unquestioned.” The case has long tempted scholars, who see a conspiracy hidden in unreleased government documents. A detective on the case, Anthony V. Bouza, wrote flatly a few years ago, “The investigation was botched.” Yet it has never sparked the widespread obsessive interest of the Kennedy assassination or the equally brazen killing of Tupac Shakur. Attempts to reopen the case — to uncover the possible roles of the F.B.I., New York Police Department and the Nation of Islam leadership, including Louis Farrakhan — have gotten nowhere. “The vast majority of white opinion at that time was that this was black-on-black crime, and maybe black-extremist-on-black-extremist crime,” said David Garrow, a Pulitzer Prize-winning civil rights historian. “And there was for decades a consensus in black communities that we are not going to pick up that rock to see what’s underneath it.” At the time Malcolm spoke at the Audubon Ballroom on Feb. 21, 1965, he was a marked man — spied on by the F.B.I. and the police, denounced as a traitor by the Nation leadership, viscerally hated and beloved. Mr. Farrakhan declared him “worthy of death.” A week before his assassination, his home in Queens was firebombed while he and his wife and four daughters slept inside. Seconds after Malcolm stepped to the lectern, gunfire rang out, then pandemonium. Talmadge Hayer, a member of the Nation of Islam from a New Jersey mosque, was arrested fleeing the ballroom, with a clip from a handgun used in the killing. Later the police arrested two men from Malcolm’s former Harlem mosque, Norman 3X Butler and Thomas 15X Johnson, both known as enforcers. At trial, Mr. Hayer, who later became Mujahid Abdul Halim, admitted his guilt but said the other two men were innocent. All three men were convicted and received life sentences. Mr. Johnson, who became Khalil Islam, died in 2009; Mr. Butler, who is now Muhammad Abdul Aziz, was granted parole in 1985 and still maintains his innocence. In the late 1970s, Mr. Halim filed affidavits naming four members of the Newark mosque as his partners in the crime. The civil rights lawyer William Kunstler moved to reopen the case but was denied. Since then, the legwork has fallen to biographers and independent researchers, including a Washington, D.C., tour guide named Abdur-Rahman Muhammad, the central figure in the new documentary series. “It bothered me that no one cared about it,” Mr. Muhammad said. “I didn’t get paid to do any of this. I’ve sold cars. I’m just a working-class guy.” Mr. Muhammad in 2010 uncovered the identity of one of the supposed assassins named in Mr. Hayer’s affidavit, William Bradley, who had changed his name to Almustafa Shabazz and was married to a prominent Newark activist. It was Mr. Bradley’s shotgun blast, researchers contend, that killed Malcolm. Mr. Shabazz, who died in 2018, denied any involvement in the murder, and lived in plain sight. “I knew him well,” Cory Booker says in the documentary, adding that he was not aware of Mr. Shabazz’s past identity. Mr. Muhammad published Mr. Shabazz’s name and photograph on his blog in 2010, and then shared his research with Manning Marable, who was working on his Pulitzer Prize-winning biography, “Malcolm X: A Life of Reinvention.” Mr. Muhammad believes that the other three men named in Mr. Hayer’s affidavits are dead. After the book came out, Alvin Sykes, a Kansas City activist who helped persuade the F.B.I. and Justice Department to create a cold case unit for civil rights-era killings, lobbied federal prosecutors to reinvestigate Malcolm’s murder. The department declined. When Mr. Shabazz died, the last remaining loose end was Mr. Aziz, the former Norman 3X Butler, now 81, who served 20 years for a crime he insists he did not commit. Lawyers for Mr. Aziz now hope the Manhattan district attorney will clear his name. A spokesman for Cyrus R. Vance Jr., the D.A., said in a statement that the preliminary review “will inform the office regarding what further investigative steps may be undertaken.” One of the prosecutors conducting the review, Peter Casolaro, played a vital role in throwing out the convictions of the five men wrongfully imprisoned for raping a jogger in Central Park in 1989. Mr. Aziz, who declined an interview request, has said he could not have been at the Audubon that day because security would have blocked his entry, and that anyway, he was nearly immobile from a police beating a short while before. In the documentary he expresses little hope for the process. “I just don’t believe in these people,” he says. “I got 20 years of my life to show that I shouldn’t believe in them.” Not all are convinced. Karl Evanzz, author of “The Judas Factor: The Plot to Kill Malcolm X,” cited film footage that he said shows Mr. Aziz at the Audubon, and dismissed Mr. Muhammad’s research as unreliable. David Shanies, who with the Innocence Project is representing Mr. Aziz, said only that the lawyers looked forward to working cooperatively with prosecutors “to see that justice is done.” Their case includes F.B.I. documents that were never shared with local police or prosecutors. Barry Scheck of the Innocence Project said that based on this evidence, “We are troubled that the conviction was not vacated in 1978,” when Mr. Hayer filed his affidavits. If the district attorney stands by the conviction, the lawyers can move to argue it in State Supreme Court. But even if Mr. Aziz prevails, it will not settle questions about the larger forces that many think contributed to Malcolm’s death — the law enforcement agencies that spied on him but failed to protect him, the Nation leaders who called tacitly for his head. That part of the story, along with volumes of unreleased F.B.I. files, may never fully surface. “When you’re dealing with a complex crime, and you simplify it to five members of the Nation of Islam walking into a ballroom, you don’t give people the context they need,” said Zak Kondo, author of “Conspiracys: Unravelling the Assassination of Malcolm X.” “A whole generation went to their graves knowing important information that people like me will never know,” he said. “That’s the most frustrating part.”",The New York Times
2020,Opinion | Who Says It’s Not Safe to Travel to China?,"The coronavirus travel ban is unjust and doesn’t work anyway. Ms. Spinks is the global tourism reporter for Skift. The coronavirus outbreak seems defined by two opposing forces: the astonishing efficiency with which the travel industry connects the world and a political moment dominated by xenophobic rhetoric and the building of walls. Respiratory infections, however, know no borders. The virus has spread regardless of extreme measures taken by governments around the world, which include the cancellation of flights, the shutting down of borders and the issuance of travel advisories usually reserved for conflict zones. Time and time again, destinations perceived as “Western” benefit from a kind of cultural familiarity and presumption of safety that so-called foreign or exotic places do not. When we, as travelers, decide what places are too unsafe to travel, those decisions are determined not just by actual conditions on the ground but also by perceptions shaped by the media, the travel industry and the foreign offices of governments. Whether travelers realize it or not, that is subtly informed by the same power structures that underlie much unfairness in the world. Valid arguments may exist for shutting down the world to travelers originating in China — and shutting down China to the world — as a reasonable public health response. But the World Health Organization explicitly did not advise that any restriction of trade or travel was necessary when it declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern last week, and it still doesn’t. Instead, it has called for exit screening in international airports and domestic hubs in China. The United States State Department is denying entry to foreign nationals who have recently been to China, is screening American citizens who arrive home from China as well as asking them to self-quarantine for 14 days. It has told American citizens not to visit the country at all. Major airlines including British Airways, Lufthansa and all three major American carriers have halted all flights to China, while the cruise line Royal Caribbean is denying boarding to any person who has traveled to, from or through China or Hong Kong in the past 15 days. Travel companies such as those airlines are motivated both by pressure from employees and by the falling demand for flights. Flying empty planes to and from China is, after all, not profitable. But what has motivated the response from governments? It doesn’t appear to be evidence. Measures like screening at airports, quarantining cruise ships or flights with confirmed cases and isolating communities at the center of an outbreak can be effective, said Erin Sorrell, an assistant research professor at Georgetown University who studies emerging infectious diseases. However, she and other experts say the available evidence suggests that total border shutdowns are not an effective means of containment of respiratory viruses. Resources are better used, she argued, treating sick patients and developing vaccines and other countermeasures. Sadly, one doesn’t have to look far for evidence of these top-down decisions morphing into outright racism within the general population, a trend that has a long history in the narrative of outbreaks such as this one. Coronavirus shares something in common with other kinds of civil disruption, natural disasters or emergencies that affect localized travel industries: Its destructive power lies not in the actual risk but in the perception of that risk. Numerous experts have said that the majority of people who contract coronavirus will experience it as a respiratory infection they will fully recover from. But the extreme reactions — the canceling of flights, closing of borders and level-four travel warnings — seem more appropriate for something much worse. Therein lies a familiar unfairness. When it comes to travel, the perception of risk is rarely meted out objectively. Consider the level-two travel warning imposed by the State Department last month in the wake of the continuing Australian wildfires. It advised travelers to consider postponing their trips because of extremely poor air quality and the threat of evacuation in the monthslong fires. Just a few days later, it was reduced to level one, reportedly in response to the direct appeal of Prime Minister Scott Morrison to the Trump administration. Similarly, in the 2017-18 flu season, when the United States had a particularly bad outbreak, the respiratory virus resulted in an estimated 61,000 deaths and 45 million symptomatic cases — but no travel warnings. Coronavirus is different from other tourism disruptions in a significant way: The potential loss of tourism revenue and gross domestic product will hurt not only China but also other countries. In the decade and a half since the SARS crisis, Chinese travelers have become the most powerful source market in the world, surpassing all other nations in its volume of outbound travelers in 2012. In 2017, Chinese citizens took more than 143 million trips abroad; in 2029, Skift Research predicts that figure will be 286 million. Luxury retailers all over the world rely on Chinese travelers for their consistent trip spending, and destinations develop and target sophisticated marketing strategies to cater to them. The world often thinks of travel and tourism as being a collection of different industries, operating separately yet alongside one another. But in reality, it’s a web of economically interconnected parts. While it is subject to the political environment it operates in, it also has a chance to stand up to the political norms of the day, especially when policy goes against best practices recommended by international agencies. With the rhetoric surrounding coronavirus, however, it appears the astonishing growth of the Chinese travel market in the past 15 years did little to rid the industry of the impulse to treat Chinese travelers as “others” in the face of doubt and uncertainty. Canceling flights, cruises and locking down borders when it’s not advised by international agencies will be not only an act of economic self-harm but also a wasted opportunity to learn from the mistakes of the past.

2020,Who Was Carlo Scarpa?,"His reimagining of ancient public buildings made him an Italian icon, but the 20th-century architect is perhaps best understood through the private homes he designed. In the garden room at the Zentner House, in Zurich, two ’70s-era paintings by Piero Dorazio hang over a LC4 chaise by Le Corbusier, Pierre Jeanneret and Charlotte Perriand.Credit...Ilaria Orsini. Paintings, from top: Piero Dorazio, “Untitled,” circa 1970 © 2020 SIAE, Rome/Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York; Piero Dorazio, “Di Tutti i Colori (Of Every Colour),” 1970 © 2020 SIAE, Rome/Artists Rights Society (ARS) WHEN MARIA CAGNOLI, a 63-year-old rheumatologist from the Northern Italian town of Bergamo, stepped off the elevator onto the top floor of a converted 17th-century Venice palazzo for a satellite exhibition a week before the 2015 Biennale, she had no idea she was about to become a caretaker of history. Even before she could survey the works on display, the apartment itself possessed her. One of a few dozen residences designed by Carlo Scarpa, the legendary Venetian architect known primarily for his reimagining of museums and other public spaces, it had been created in 1963 as an office and home for a lawyer named Luigi Scatturin. A well-connected art lover whose brother-in-law was Tancredi, the abstractionist known by his first name, Scatturin had long represented Scarpa. The attorney’s heirs had inherited the 2,700-square-foot residence after their father’s death in 2009 and were looking to sell it. They had agreed to host the show, hoping it would attract a buyer who might appreciate its extraordinary provenance and the unique — and consuming — challenges of owning an iconic property in a city that reveres Scarpa and cares deeply about preservation. As soon as Cagnoli, who had been searching unsuccessfully for a flat in Venice, entered the space, she knew she had found not merely a pied-à-terre but a calling. Scarpa’s oeuvre had long been integral to Cagnoli’s aesthetic. She already owned two of his daring Modernist glass works, from the period earlier in his career when the Murano-based glass company, Venini, hired him to revamp the island’s fusty image, which he did by encouraging artisans to deviate from their traditional ornate chandeliers in order to create contemporary shapes and saturated colors. But in her veneration of the architect, Cagnoli was ahead of the times: In the decades after his death in 1978, Scarpa largely had come to be regarded as an ingenious but inessential roadside attraction on the superhighway of organic Modernism, eclipsed by Frank Lloyd Wright and Louis Kahn. That may have been because he produced so few original structures; most of his work consisted of interventions in pre-existing public buildings. It didn’t help that he worked largely in Venice, a city which, unlike Milan, has never been known for nurturing the new. But in the past few years, as the idea of combining essentialist architectural geometry with handcrafted details has gained popularity worldwide, Scarpa has become something of a rediscovered obsession. Like the ’80s-era Milan-centered Memphis movement, with its Tinkertoy shapes and colors, which has been embraced as inspiration by designers searching for optimism and humor in a sobering age, Scarpa’s warm-blooded mix of the ancient and modern — buildings, objects and furniture laboriously handcrafted in stone, wood, forged metals, stucco and glass — has become newly relevant. In his time, his devotion to the mark of the hand separated him from the International Style that swept Europe and championed the machine-made and easily replaceable; today, his message — that true beauty endures, transcending global tumult and uncertainty — has never seemed more germane. His serene 1963 renovation of Venice’s Fondazione Querini Stampalia museum garden, in which water flows into a multileveled copper basin flanked by labyrinths of alabaster and Istrian stone, the Pop minimalism of his 1958 Olivetti showroom on Piazza San Marco, with Alberto Viani’s 1956 bronze sculpture “Nudo al Sole” in the entry set in a black Belgian marble basin, and his reimagining of the Castelvecchio Museum in Verona, completed in 1975, in which he incorporated excavated layers of the medieval building and put the art on easels to make it more accessible to the viewer, all seem prescient. In Venice itself, he has in just the past few years become something of a brand, with reproductions — some very bad — of his luminous glass vessels, Shaker-simple chairs and geometric tabletop sculptures seemingly everywhere: During the 2019 Biennale in June, the decorative and fine art gallerist Giorgio Mastinu passed out stickers in his space near Palazzo Grassi, declaring it “100% Carlo Scarpa Free.” BORN IN THE city in 1906 and raised largely in Vicenza, an hour away, Scarpa, who studied architecture at Venice’s Academy of Fine Arts but never became a licensed architect because he refused to take the government exam, idolized the work of the Vienna Secessionist Josef Hoffmann and Wright (who returned the admiration) and drew inspiration from abstract painters including Piet Mondrian and Mark Rothko. He traveled extensively in Japan, which helped inform his appreciation of humble materials like reclaimed timber and rusted metal, as well as his obsession with tiny details like hardware and nails. But despite his wanderings, his loyalty ultimately lay with the artisans of Venice, which had been, until the late 18th century, an independent city-state; he considered the region itself his canvas. Unlike Wright, he had a stable marriage (to the niece of his mentor, the architect Francesco Rinaldo; their son, Tobia, 85, is an acclaimed industrial designer), never demanded the fealty of acolytes and was notoriously private. It may be fitting, then, that despite his newfound mainstream popularity, a number of the architect’s most innovative structures remain off-limits to tourists. Highly personal and collaborative, private residences allowed Scarpa to experiment in the way a public building couldn’t. Only a few of the 30 or so he designed survive intact, down to the original furniture he selected or made. Their owners are their protectors, docents and, when the occasion calls, their caretakers. Cagnoli understood that buying the apartment also meant she would become a curator and preserver of Scarpa’s legacy: The lawyer had left little choice in the matter. Scatturin knew he had commissioned a work of art, and in 1999, he registered the apartment as “vincolo” at the Ministero per i Beni Culturali e Ambientali, meaning it is regarded as a heritage work, with the same protections that apply to the Basilica of San Marco. She wouldn’t be able to replace a door handle without permission from the ministry. “It was very difficult,” she acknowledges. “Nothing could be touched. We had to use wireless electricity because we couldn’t break the walls.” Her years of painstaking effort have restored the apartment to its 1960s luster. Scarpa understood firsthand how the lawyer’s work and life bled together, and the design reflects that knowledge. The space is divided into three interconnected zones: the law offices in the front, the social areas in the middle and the private quarters in the back. Scarpa’s touch is evident even before opening the front door. The apartment entrance walls are coral red and obsidian black, painted in the local style of stucco veneziano. This haptic, marble-smooth treatment was a favorite of the architect; he used it, in a similar palette, on the walls of the Castelvecchio Museum, a 1356 fortress he reinvented by exposing the foundation, filling gaping holes with glass panels and balancing an equestrian statue of Cangrande della Scala, a 14th-century ruler of Verona, on a concrete gangplank. His stucco expert was a Venetian named Eugenio De Luigi, who created the satiny finish by applying the plaster with tiny spatulas, not much bigger than a butter knife, a labor-intensive process that could take days to complete one wall. Then there were the furnishings, which Scarpa used sparingly but with great precision. Amid the pear-wood walls that line the front professional area, beneath a dark green ceiling, stands a semicircular desk that the architect made from Italian and Brazilian walnut. Scarpa, who often designed deceptively simple wooden furniture, titled it “Signori Prego si Accomodino” (“Ladies and Gentlemen, Please Make Yourselves Comfortable”). It is constructed without a single nail; the designer preferred to hide or altogether exclude joints. The result is a desktop that appears to be floating in space. In the roughly 400-square-foot central living room, light pours through casement windows, revealing another series of signature elements. Because the apartment is on the top floor and was originally inhabited by servants, the ceilings are only eight feet high. More conventional architects of the era might have tried to camouflage the lack of height with visual tricks, but Scarpa accentuated it. He had the ceiling slathered in a thick layer of cement, which is sponge-painted in shades of ocher, brick red and bluish-gray. Over the course of a single morning, the shifting light transforms it from a field of mustard to a meadow of lilac. At the back of the apartment, in the hallway that leads to the bedrooms, stands a Scarpa trademark: What initially seems to be a stack of wooden cabinets turns out to be a wardrobe that doubles as a vertiginous staircase to the rooftop terrace. “Start with your right foot,” Cagnoli instructs, “it’s much easier.” Above, the terrace offers a panoramic view of the city; the deck is oriented like an arrow, directing your gaze toward the Piazza San Marco, with its lead domes and spired campanile peeking from the terra-cotta tile rooftops, sea gulls’ nests all around. SCARPA RARELY WORKED outside Italy, but he was lured beyond its borders a year after he completed Casa Scatturin, once again for an emotionally resonant residential commission. Savina Zentner was 27 when her husband, Angelo Masieri, one of Scarpa’s protégés, died in a car crash in Pennsylvania while they were in the United States to meet Wright in 1952. Savina then married a Swiss banker, G. René Zentner, and called upon Masieri’s mentor to build the family villa. Today, Zentner’s eldest son, Edoardo, a private money manager, is responsible for the house. A longtime student of Buddhism who helps restore temples in the Northern Indian state of Ladakh, he sees the preservation of his family’s house as close to a spiritual mission. The 6,000-square-foot home is in a neighborhood overlooking Lake Zurich that was once a vineyard but is now arrayed with golf courses and polite villa-style mansions. “Zurich tends not to be a place for self-expression,” Edoardo says of the less-than-enthusiastic reception Scarpa initially received from the municipal building commission. Local regulations prevented him from drastically changing the overall proportions of the original two-story Italianate 1914 provincial house, but decades of transforming Renaissance buildings into minimalist enclaves had taught him how to work around and within existing structures, and today, almost no trace of the old rectangular structure remains in the striking geometric facade. The exterior is mostly covered in a soft pink-tinged stucco, with brass plating running along the edges to lend definition, while the top floor is clad in an African hardwood called afzelia. The concrete base is ribboned with Murano glass tiles in white, gold and green, and a strip of these tiles runs up the front of the concrete, ivy-covered elevator shaft that bisects the facade. With its calibrated contrast of materials, the house has a restrained, almost musical elegance. At the back, the base transforms into a Jenga-like formation, incorporating a cantilevered balcony and a second-floor overhang. Scarpa solved the regulation against substantially increasing the size of the house by stacking the upper floors in ever-smaller rectangles. From certain angles, the house resembles a ship. The architect lavished the same attention on the floors of the Zentner’s living room as he did on the ceiling at Casa Scatturin. Planks of dark brown wenge and yellow West African mansonia are laid in an irregular pattern, and a gray stone molding around the perimeter makes the floor appear to float. The ceiling is covered in a beige stucco veneziano, and here and there, nipple-like sconces shine light directly onto art from Zentner’s collection, which includes a canvas by the Surrealist Max Ernst and a drawing of a woman by Balthus, hung near an assemblage of skeletal bronze Diego Giacometti furniture. Scarpa’s custom pieces — a long, low sofa upholstered in midnight blue hand-woven silk in the living room and a rectangular wood and marble marquetry dining-room table — remain in their original spots. Everywhere are small, subversive details: a floating step between the dining room and a storage nook; light fixtures that slide into deep wall recesses to lend a softer glow. “Scarpa was like Mozart,” says Edoardo, “in his hyper-intense use of simple devices or ideas to create art.” IN 1968, SCARPA and his assistant Sergio Los broke ground on a residence outside Bolzano, in the South Tyrol province of Northern Italy, one of the few projects he was able to build from the ground up, and arguably his most avant-garde private work. Commissioned by Gianni and Laura Tabarelli, the owners of an eponymous Modern design showroom in Bolzano, the single-story house is situated on three staggered rectangular planes descending the hillside like stairs, and faces the Dolomites. Vineyards rake the valley below, and apple orchards zipper the hills above. Scarpa used these crop formations as the starting point for Casa Tabarelli. Constructed on a foundation of five parallel concrete slabs embedded in the hillside, the house appears almost suspended, mirroring the way grapes are trained to hang over the soil on wires. The asymmetrical roof is a series of undulating, overlapping platforms that mimic the mountain peaks. The Tabarellis, who had transformed Gianni’s family business from a staid furniture operation to a beacon of the post-World War II Italian design scene, had long wanted Scarpa to build them a house. The pair lived there for more than 30 years, until Gianni’s death in 2000; Laura sold it in 2012 to Josef Dalle Nogare, a contemporary art collector who runs his family’s stone business in the area. Dalle Nogare had visited Casa Tabarelli as a child with his parents. “I didn’t know what to make of it back then,” he says of the ultra-Modernist villa. In his early adulthood, however, he began collecting Scarpa-designed Venini glass, and though he later sold the pieces to focus on contemporary art, the architect’s influence lingered; when he heard that the Tabarelli house was for sale, he didn’t hesitate. The 3,400-square-foot home’s exterior, created to endure alpine winters, is covered in thick, textured concrete mixed in places with powdered brick for a deep salmon hue, or chalk for a bleach white. Typical of Scarpa, the outer concrete invades the interior, muting distinctions between inside and out; almost every room opens onto a private garden. Scarpa chose primary hues of blue, yellow, red and green for the driveway gate and front entrance; once inside, he let the palette explode. The ceiling is a pastel rainbow of glossy stucco veneziano. “The colors follow the path of the sun,” Dalle Nogare says, starting with a stripe of pale blue that spans the bedrooms, followed by an expanse of buttercup, Kelly green and crimson. Each segment responds to the sunlight, darkening and glowing through the day. Bare light bulbs hang intermittently from the ceiling by their cords, like the clustered grapes in the valley. Huge hunks of colored Venini glass glimmer in transom windows. While the Tabarellis acceded most of the time to Scarpa’s desire for radical beauty over practicality, they drew the line at his plans for a vast wooden living-room floor. “Laura didn’t want to do the waxing,” says Dalle Nogare. They settled instead on quartzite. But Scarpa couldn’t produce a simple stone floor: Here, there is no joint or mortar between the tiles; rather, the stones are wedged together, creating a surface like a choppy sea. In counterpoint to that turbulent texture, the architect used gray slate commonly used for blackboards to fashion sets of steps to the level above. The interplay of smooth and rough makes climbing just a few stairs akin to hovering between distinct environments. Dalle Nogare and Laura Tabarelli agreed she would leave many of the house’s original furnishings as a way to keep Scarpa’s vision intact. These include a 1965 Brionvega radio console, a gold velvet sofa by the Japanese industrial designer Kazuhide Takahama and a paper mobile by the Futurist artist and graphic designer Bruno Munari. Scarpa’s own works endure as well, from a cubic metal sculpture screwed into the concrete fireplace to the massive sliding gate between the office and master bedroom made of 70 rotating wooden squares that form a black-and-white abstraction. Dalle Nogare, who lives between Bolzano and Paris with his wife and son, has incorporated pieces from his own collection, including a papier-mâché sculpture by the late Austrian abstractionist Franz West, a display of vintage suitcases by the New York-based photographer and sculptor Zoe Leonard and a collage of pop-cultural detritus by the German-born sculptor Isa Genzken. He believes that the space, with its textured walls and extreme contours, is more suitable for three-dimensional works than as a place to hang contemporary painting. Like the Zentner house, Casa Tabarelli is not governmentally protected — its life depends on its owner’s maintenance and stewardship. Dalle Nogare has considered opening it to the public as an exhibition space for his collection one day, but nothing is certain except his determination that the house will remain, its dignity intact. Similar to Cagnoli, who owns Casa Scatturin, and Edoardo Zentner, he has no interest in turning his Scarpa work into a shrine, like Wright’s Fallingwater, with its lines of tourists. There are plenty of ways to experience the public side of Scarpa these days, but the architect’s private commissions and their intimate histories are likely to remain largely unseen. While maintaining such structures takes a great deal of money, patience and the sublimation of ego in an era when residences are often designed as elaborate expressions of self, the owners of these homes consider themselves heirs to Scarpa’s own humility and veneration of the past. To each house, they have added something of their own personality, as Scarpa himself left behind his mark while allowing the ages and the natural world to shine through. What remains is a palimpsest of culture and history, as layered as a cross section of the earth itself. “I’m going to protect it,” says Dalle Nogare. “Absolutely.”",The New York Times
2020,Opinion | Who Will Care For Society’s Forgotten?,"Opinion Housecall Providers, an organization in Portland, Ore., provides end-of-life care for the city’s most vulnerable residents. At her home in Portland, Ore., Tiffany Wicke, who developed cancer while she was incarcerated, writes a list of things she wants to do before she dies.Credit...Leah Nash for The New York Times Ms. Brown is a clinical faculty member at the University of Pittsburgh School of Nursing. PORTLAND, Ore. — Homeless people, when most of us think of them at all, seem to have no past and no future. It is hard to picture them as children who went to school, played games and, I hope, were loved. It is equally hard to imagine that they age, the way all of us do, and get sick, possibly very sick, just like the rest of us. We even rarely think about how they receive medical care — and yet how and whether we treat these patients, especially at the end of their lives, is a moral measuring stick that is all too often missing in our discussions about health care in America. Housecall Providers, a home care organization in Portland, provides palliative care to these very vulnerable patients, typically through Medicare, Medicaid or what’s called dual eligibility. The stories about, and photographs of, Housecall Providers’ patients illustrate a first principle in taking care of this unique patient population: Housing is health care. Without a secure address, it is almost impossible for a patient to receive consistent care. And these patients are so sick that living on the street would very likely end their lives. Take Aaron Lauderdale, who is 47 years old and has colon cancer. Aaron had persistent rectal bleeding during a past incarceration, but he told me that the prison system repeatedly refused his requests for a colonoscopy. On his release from prison, Aaron was diagnosed and received chemotherapy and radiation. But in part because of inconsistent care, he still needs surgery, and will end up with a colostomy. Aaron struggles with a heroin addiction, and has been homeless, though now he attends a methadone clinic and wants to do job training after his treatment finishes. For a time he lived in what he called a trap house: a place without running water. It is unlikely he could have managed his postoperative care, or his impending colostomy, without a working sink. But on the day I met him, he had just moved into a real apartment. Some people would look at his life and see a failure, a person who deserved what he got. I looked at Aaron and felt inspired. He was undergoing harrowing treatment for cancer (the radiation treatments were internal), adjusting to the idea of a colostomy, managing his heroin addiction and trying to hold on to his humanity. His prison experience had left him bitter — “I’m not worth a colonoscopy,” he told me. But he ended our interview with a sincere and generous wish for his parents: “I just want them to know that I love them.” Aaron was thriving in large part thanks to Housecall Providers. They match each patient with a primary staff member — a nurse, social worker or lay health worker. Through that relationship, these economically and psychologically vulnerable patients learn to trust, and to realize, from the care they receive, that they matter as human beings. Aaron’s primary caregiver, Melodie Kelly, a social worker, joined him at doctor’s appointments and helped him juggle his many concerns. “One trusting, caring relationship” is key for these patients, said Will Kennedy, the senior medical director of Housecall Providers. Archie Palmer, who is in severe heart failure and has schizophrenia, became homeless when his father died at 50, also from cardiac disease. But Archie has an identical twin brother, Michael. Michael is Archie’s “one relationship.” The brothers, who are 47, were homeless together for five years, and now live in a small apartment where Michael helps take care of Archie, while Nicole Saucedo, Archie’s nurse from Housecall Providers, manages his medications, diet and overall health. Another patient, Raven, is wheelchair-bound and has triple-negative breast cancer — a tough diagnosis. She can’t leave her basement apartment without physical assistance, but despite her challenges — “I miss the sky,” she said to me — was surprisingly upbeat. Raven credited her emotional stability to her case manager, Nicole. “In order to get good medical care, you have to have a trusting relationship,” she said. “Palliative has kept me sane.” Forty-seven-year-old Tiffany Wicke, like Aaron, had symptoms of cancer while incarcerated, but she said that the prison brushed off her complaints multiple times. She finally got treatment, was diagnosed with ovarian cancer and had a soccer-ball-sized tumor removed from her abdomen. But her chemotherapy was delayed until her release from prison six months later. Tiffany also had no place to go when she got out of prison, and would have been homeless had not a mentor taken her in. Housecall Providers recently helped Tiffany secure permanent public housing, and monitors her during her second round of a grueling chemotherapy regimen. The most heartbreaking story I encountered was that of Alicia Denzel, who became homeless, similar to Archie, when her father died, and had recently been homeless again. Forty years old with liver disease and liver cancer, Alicia needed a blood transfusion every few days to survive. She described Nicole, her nurse, and Lisa Pearlstein, a behavioral health specialist and her caregiver, as “a great gift I was given.” Alicia’s goal had been to live until her son graduated from high school this spring, but she died on Wednesday, Feb. 19. Why tell these stories? Every year, Americans pay what is essentially an $8,000-per-household poll tax to support the excessive profits of American health care, argue the economists Anne Case and Angus Deaton in their new book “Deaths of Despair and the Future of Capitalism.” Still, we speak disparagingly of those who can’t pay their way, of patients who receive Medicaid but don’t work for money, of the economically needy and ill. But then there’s that famous line from “King Lear”: “Oh, reason not the need!” Lear, a king who gave up his crown, beseeches his daughters as they strip him of his remaining trappings of royalty. And then Lear himself becomes homeless. Thrown out at night in a ferocious storm, he ends up losing his mind. Reason not the need to care for patients like Eugene Queen, who was homeless for decades and had a 15-year heroin addiction. Eugene is in heart failure; he’s 55 but looks older. When I asked him for any thoughts, he said, “I just want people to know there is hope.” Well, no one can reason the need of that. We all need hope, and care when we are sick, and shelter to make that care practicable. Reason not the need to care for our most vulnerable patients; it is the same need as with any of us. For that you need only one word: hope.

And then Lear himself becomes homeless. Thrown out at night in a ferocious storm, he ends up losing his mind. Reason not the need to care for patients like Eugene Queen, who was homeless for decades and had a 15-year heroin addiction. Eugene is in heart failure; he’s 55 but looks older. When I asked him for any thoughts, he said, “I just want people to know there is hope.” Well, no one can reason the need of that. We all need hope, and care when we are sick, and shelter to make that care practicable. Reason not the need to care for our most vulnerable patients; it is the same need as with any of us. For that you need only one word: hope.

2020,Opinion | Who Will Turn Out the Lights at Trump’s White House?,"The conversation The president’s tweets, Bill Barr’s doings and the contest for the Democratic nomination made for quite a week of political theater. Ms. Collins and Mr. Stephens are opinion columnists. They converse every week. Bret Stephens: Katie Barr the door, Gail! That was quite a public rebuke of Donald Trump from Attorney General Bill Barr, who said the president’s incessant tweeting was making his job “impossible.” Do you think this means Barr has finally drawn a line in the sand with his boss? Or was it just political theater to improve his standing within the Justice Department, after four career prosecutors resigned from the case in disgust when higher-ups in the department intervened to recommend a more lenient sentence for Roger Stone? Gail Collins: Will it surprise you that I’m going for political theater, Bret? Complaining about the president’s tweeting habits is the one thing people in his thrall feel they can do to create the semi-illusion of independence without actually doing anything … independent. I believe Mitch McConnell was in the too-many-tweets camp recently, too. How about you? And I liked your Katie joke. Whenever I hear that song now, I’ll think of Bill Barr hiding in his office, with a bunch of law books piled up against the door. Bret: I’m where you are. Barr’s complaint seems to be that Trump’s tweets deny him the opportunity to pretend that he’s acting out of conviction, not dictation. In other words, they expose what anyone who has been paying attention to his department — including the 2,000-plus former Department of Justice officials who have called for him to step down — has known all along: This is the least politically independent attorney general since John Mitchell ran the department in Richard Nixon’s first term. Bill Barr makes Jeff Sessions look principled. Gail: “Makes Jeff Sessions look principled.” A nightmare epithet for any attorney general. Or human being. Bret: That said, I’m betting President Leave-No-Grudge-Behind will find a way to make Barr’s job even more impossible. It happened to Sessions, to former chief of staff Reince Priebus, to former secretary of state Rex Tillerson, to former national security adviser H.R. McMaster, to former secretary of defense Jim Mattis, to former chief of staff John Kelly, to former secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen, to former national security adviser John Bolton. Gail: Here lie the reputations of everybody who had a decent one before they went to work for Donald Trump. Plus some who’ll just have to settle for “semi-disgraced former member of the Trump administration.” Bret: If Barr thinks his name won’t eventually land on this list, I have a portrait of Anne Boleyn to sell him. But we’ve got another caucus coming up, this time in Nevada. In early December, the front-runners were Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren. Not anymore. To what do you attribute the abrupt collapse in their support? Gail: Different stories. Biden started out running as Barack Obama’s vice president and of course that got a lot of traction — might still win him South Carolina. But the longer he campaigned the more he reverted to the guy who’s running for president for the third time and has yet to ever win a single primary. Ever. Or even come in third. Bret: My heart goes out to Biden, not least because he’s the sort of man who is more decent than he is clever, in an era which desperately needs a return to decency. That said, if he doesn’t win decisively in South Carolina he owes it to the party’s moderates to bow out graciously and immediately. Gail: Elizabeth Warren, as I’m sure you remember, is my favorite. But she’s run up against The Bern. One of them was going to have to take over the left side of the field and he’s shoving her out. Lots of reasons, but I do suspect gender is one of them. Bret: I’m sure you’re right on that score, which is quite a comment on the gender biases of the party’s left lane. But Warren also hurt herself in a bunch of ways, above all when she went after Pete Buttigieg at a December debate for holding a fund-raiser in a wine cave. His retort, noting that he was the only candidate in the stage who wasn’t a millionaire or billionaire and warning her about “issuing purity tests you cannot yourself pass,” was devastating. It exposed an ideological opportunism and factual slipperiness that left her exposed from both the left and right within the Democratic Party’s electorate. Gail: Warren has been righteously pursuing the cause of campaign finance reform — relying on small donors and trying to cut down on the influence of big-money donors with big-money interest in the federal government. One of the wine cave owners, I believe, was mixed up in the S&L bailout. And she didn’t start the fight with Buttigieg — he jumped in and announced that her criticism of candidates who take large chunks of money from billionaires was directed at him. After which it would have been hard for Warren to fail to mention the fabled wine caves. Not that I personally would turn down a chance to hang out in a cavern full of $900 cabernets. Bret: Me neither. I doubt she’ll recover, though this race has been full of surprises. Speaking of which: Mike Bloomberg. Judging by the harshness of the latest attacks on him, his political fortunes seem to be rising. How far might he go? Gail: I dunno, Bret. Bloomberg would of course not be on anybody’s radar if he wasn’t a multi-multi-billionaire spending his own cash on a flood of campaign ads. But here we are. His big plus — besides the cash — is that he’s a new face in a race that feels as if it’s been going on since the Eisenhower administration. His big minus is that he’s got a long history as an acerbic businessman who said some things to female employees we would now consider deeply, deeply offensive — and may have then. Not to mention his statements about black New Yorkers and crime, plus the virtues of redlining. Can he apologize for those failings in a way that sounds sincere and not smarmy? We’ll learn more now that he’s made it into tomorrow’s debate. I presume his billions aren’t a concern to you — but what about the wine cave thing? Do you think there should be any curbs on how much money candidates get from rich insiders? Bret: So here’s a piece of heresy: No. Eugene McCarthy would never have been able to challenge Lyndon Johnson in 1968 save for the support of a handful of big-money donors. Campaign-finance laws have had all kinds of perverse effects, including the fact that they force politicians to spend inordinate amounts of time raising money in relatively small increments. And, because rich people can spend unlimited money on themselves, they have a built-in advantage over candidates like Buttigieg. I’d like to see fewer limits on donations coupled with radical transparency about the sources of funding. Gail: I am closing my eyes and imagining a Congress composed of people who had to raise all their campaign money from small donors. We’d have a hell of a different tax code. And if it forced the members to spend their wine cave time talking to $50 contributors who got a glass of Blue Nun in the bargain, well, fine. But about billionaire presidential candidates — Bret: Regarding Bloomberg: I don’t think his problem is that he’s racist. If he were, he wouldn’t have won nearly 50 percent of the African-American vote when he ran for re-election as New York’s mayor in 2005, or be drawing considerable African-American support today. I think his problem is that he comes across as — and might well be — a big-league jerk, who thinks the police officers throwing minority youth up against a wall on mere suspicion is no big deal. His meanness toward women is part of the same picture. Gail: I’d say that’s fair. Bret: Right now, however, I’m willing to forgive many personal sins if I think a candidate can defeat Trump. And I remain fairly bullish on Mike’s chances if he gets the nomination — assuming (a very big if) that Sanders supporters wouldn’t sit out the election in protest over a contest of plutocrats. Gail: That’s one of the interesting arguments in the Democratic contests. A Buttigieg or Klobuchar supporter would say we need a moderate who can appeal to swing voters. The Bernie folk would argue that we need a nominee who can get people fired up and turn out the voters who might otherwise just yawn and stay home. Bret: I was on a TV show the other day in which Amy Klobuchar was the star guest. There is nothing yawn-ee about her. She’s funny, fierce, knowledgeable and quick on her feet. And she has a message of sanity and unity that should appeal to a lot of voters who desperately want to vote against Trump but whose attitude toward Bernie, as I pointed out on the show, is like the singer Meat Loaf’s attitude toward love: They’d do anything for it, but not that. The fact that her numbers are rising gives me hope, Gail. And it pretty much guarantees that we’ll have no shortage of political surprises coming up. No shortage of material for us, either.

2020,Who Will Win on Super Tuesday? Here’s What Polls Show in 6 Key States,"poll Watch With states like California and Texas voting next Tuesday, about one-third of all pledged delegates are up for grabs. Welcome to Poll Watch, our weekly look at polling data and survey research on the candidates, voters and issues that will shape the 2020 election. With three nominating contests down, 101 pledged delegates have been divided among the Democratic presidential candidates. On Saturday, 54 more will be up for grabs in South Carolina’s primary. But three days later, the stakes get a lot higher. More than 1,300 delegates — about one-third of the available total — will be in play on Super Tuesday next week, when 15 states and territories and Democrats abroad vote. That’s probably the biggest reason the outcome in South Carolina matters so much: Who succeeds there could have a big influence on what happens three days later. If former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. wins in South Carolina, where polls show him leading, he could ride that momentum into the most delegate-rich voting day on the calendar. If he does not win South Carolina, the weakness of his ground operation in most Super Tuesday states and the strength of his competition would put Mr. Biden at a disadvantage. Senator Bernie Sanders, the current front-runner, is well positioned in many of the Super Tuesday states; a few decisive victories in the biggest contests could make his path to the nomination much clearer. Then there’s former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York, who has spent more than $500 million on advertising and will be on the ballot for the first time on Tuesday after sitting out all four of February’s Democratic contests. Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota also see some bright opportunities, particularly in their home states, which both vote on Tuesday. (So does Vermont, Mr. Sanders’s home.) And former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., may also be able to score a meaningful number of delegates, although no particular state appears easily winnable for him. Here is a look at what polls are telling us about the six states with the most delegates on the Super Tuesday map. The big prize. California moved its primary up to Super Tuesday for 2020, and its enormous delegate haul makes this newcomer the instant star. With its relatively liberal, heavily Latino Democratic electorate, it is well suited to Mr. Sanders. And sure enough, after his big victory in neighboring Nevada, he holds a commanding lead in most California polls, including a CNN poll published on Friday — such that all of his opponents are at risk of falling short of the 15 percent threshold needed to claim any statewide delegates. (They could still win delegates in congressional districts.) In many polls, Ms. Warren is in contention for second place. As long as she hits the threshold, she could pick up a sizable chunk of delegates without winning the state. And Mr. Biden and Mr. Bloomberg are each within striking distance. Texas is Exhibit A for why the South Carolina primary matters. Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders are neck-and-neck in most polls, with both candidates relying on a diverse but fragile coalition. The results from South Carolina, expected to be the year’s first nominating contest with a majority-black electorate, have the potential to help tip the scales in Mr. Biden’s favor. Mr. Sanders has invested heavily in Texas, particularly seeking to drive turnout among the state’s large Latino population, which made up roughly one-third of the Democratic primary vote in 2016. He has a formidable opponent on the left in Ms. Warren, who grew up in neighboring Oklahoma and landed at 15 percent in a CNN poll of Texas released Friday. (Mr. Sanders led that poll with 29 percent, Mr. Biden had 20 percent and Mr. Bloomberg had 18 percent.) Mr. Bloomberg’s money is also a factor. He has flooded the airwaves in Texas, placing 80 percent of all political ads in the state, according to an analysis by The Dallas Morning News. Next door to Mr. Biden’s self-described South Carolina firewall, North Carolina long seemed like an almost equally safe state for him. But early this year, as Mr. Bloomberg’s campaign accelerated and Mr. Sanders consolidated his support among liberal voters (a more plentiful group here than in South Carolina), Mr. Biden dropped in the polls. All three of those candidates stand a good chance on Tuesday. A recent University of Massachusetts Lowell poll conducted by YouGov showed Mr. Sanders edging ahead with 23 percent support, Mr. Bloomberg at 19 percent and Mr. Biden at 16 percent. Along with North Carolina, Virginia probably offers Mr. Bloomberg his best shot at a significant victory. A Monmouth University poll earlier this month showed Mr. Sanders and Mr. Bloomberg tied at 22 percent, with Mr. Biden at 18 percent — technically a three-way statistical tie. In that poll, Mr. Biden maintained a two-to-one lead over both Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Sanders among black voters, but he significantly trailed both among voters making less than $100,000 a year, a demographic that has been crucial for both him and Mr. Sanders. In Ms. Warren’s home state, Mr. Sanders could play spoiler. The two liberal senators have been running about neck-and-neck, according to most recent polls — though a WBUR poll released Friday showed Mr. Sanders jumping out to an eight-point lead. Mr. Biden remains in the running, sustained by his lead among nonwhite voters, and Mr. Buttigieg is also polling consistently in the midteens. Ms. Warren received momentum from The Boston Globe on Wednesday, when the newspaper endorsed her, and the following day a super PAC announced that it would run $9 million of ads on her behalf through Super Tuesday. She affirmed this week that she planned to stay in the race if Mr. Sanders fell short of a delegate majority, and she has shown a sustained ability to fund-raise that could keep her in the running through the summer. So, in the event of a contested convention, she may seek to present herself as a consensus choice. By that logic, a victory on Tuesday in at least one state could be crucial to establishing Ms. Warren’s credibility as a candidate who can win. It’s a similar story in Minnesota, where Ms. Klobuchar was out front in her home state with 29 percent of the vote in a Star Tribune/MPR News poll. But Mr. Sanders, who enjoyed one of his most resounding victories of the 2016 primary campaign there, ran a strong second at 23 percent. Ms. Klobuchar may be banking on a similar argument to Ms. Warren’s should she make it to the convention. In a reflection of Ms. Klobuchar’s popularity among more middle-of-the-road Minnesota Democrats, none of her moderate rivals — Mr. Bloomberg, Mr. Biden or Mr. Buttigieg — scored higher than 8 percent in the Tribune/MPR poll. Ms. Warren came in at 11 percent. Updated Feb. 29, 2020",The New York Times
2020,Opinion | Who Won and Who Lost the Fiasco in Iowa?,"The biggest winner, Mayor Pete, loses the most from the debacle, while a big loser, Biden, welcomed the absurdity. Opinion Columnist The disaster in Iowa on Monday night exemplified so much about the American situation at the moment — the failure of our parties, the self-sabotage of our institutions, the disastrous interaction between creaking political systems and the flimflam “improvements” of the tech economy — that it’s tempting not to attempt political analysis at all and just let the thing stand as a kind of outrageous art installation, a fiasco that speaks for itself so completely that all commentary is superfluous. But the Democratic primary campaign will continue, and so punditry of some sort is required. So let’s try, in the shadow of absurdity, to figure out what was won and lost Monday night (at least based on the returns we have right now). Let’s start with one of the de facto co-winners, Pete Buttigieg. Strip away the tabulation problems, and he had a great night: not only outperforming expectations slightly to battle with Bernie Sanders for the top, but also watching Joe Biden sink dramatically, leaving the way clear for the erstwhile mayor to claim to be the viable moderate alternative to Sanders and socialism. As the biggest winner from the reported results, Buttigieg is therefore the biggest loser from the botched count. He’s deprived of headlines and momentum that both his own vote totals and Biden’s plunge should have earned him, and his decision to serenely claim victory in the midst of a massive technological “upgrade”-turned-meltdown, I’m afraid, played as a bit of an obnoxious McKinsey move. Even if Biden melts down, Buttigieg’s window to become the moderate choice could be a narrow one, lasting only until Mike Bloomberg’s money comes to bear — in which case every day we’re litigating outcomes is a lost one for his campaign. By contrast, for Buttigieg’s co-winner, Sanders, the botched count actually balances his apparent failure to win decisively, making him a winner in the voting and the fiasco both. Yes, it’s not as good an outcome for Sanders as a thumping 10-point win or a big delegate edge, but the solidity and national spread of his support means that he has the clearest path to the nomination in a permanently divided field, and if one of the main effects of the Iowa disaster will be to delay any winnowing, that’s almost certainly good news for him. And the fact that it’s Buttigieg rather than Biden sharing the win is also probably good news for Sanders, given that Mayor Pete has negligible support in many national polls and little traction with minority voters. A race where Biden collapses and Buttigieg and Bloomberg scramble to fill that space is almost certainly better for Sanders than a quick consolidation into a Sanders-Biden battle of the septuagenarians — and the first scenario just became a lot more likely. But less likely than it would have been without the fiasco, which is why Biden, the big loser of the actual voting, is probably the biggest winner of the tabulation debacle: It obscures just how much he slipped beneath his polling, lets Iowa be swallowed up by other stories (the State of the Union, impeachment, coronavirus and then … New Hampshire!), and makes it modestly more likely that he can limp through to South Carolina with a chance to make a stand. That effect is only modest because voters aren’t momentum-obsessed pundits, and if Biden’s support is as fundamentally weak elsewhere as it proved in Iowa, that will manifest itself going forward regardless of the caucus headlines. But at the very least we can say that Biden is the only candidate competing in Iowa for whom the delayed announcement of the victor is unqualified good news. For Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar, the disaster’s impact is somewhat less significant. Warren’s apparent third-place performance keeps her in the running, but if she can’t beat either Buttigieg or Sanders in the early states, then her campaign’s only purpose will be to accumulate delegates for a hypothetical brokered convention. In which case maybe the meltdown helps her a little, by making such a marathon more likely — but it might also just obscure her weaknesses relative to the top finishers, giving her a reason to burn donor cash a little longer than she reasonably should. That’s definitely the case for Klobuchar, whose failure to even come close to catching Buttigieg or Warren in her own Midwestern-High Plains territory should probably finish her campaign: The tabulation meltdown may be a useful excuse to keep her campaign going through New Hampshire and even all the way to South Carolina, but she doesn’t actually have a good reason to stay in. [Listen to “The Argument” podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.] Finally, for Iowa’s non-competitor, the other mayor in the race, the whole night went beautifully: A wounded Biden and a Buttigieg deprived of the full benefits of victory is pretty much all that Bloomberg could have hoped for in his apparent plan to be the last non-Sanders option standing when Super Tuesday rolls around in March. And if this also brings us closer to a scenario where Bloomberg succeeds only in pushing the Democrats into a brokered convention that fatally divides the party, helps re-elect the incumbent and makes the free-spending billionaire one of history’s goats? Well, that’s a risk Bloomberg is apparently willing to take — and one reason among many why the biggest winner last night was the man who has been profiting from folly and chaos and stupidity among his rivals since 2015, the president of the United States.

2020,Who Won in New Hampshire? Not the Establishment,"News Analysis Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg emerge at the top of the field as two former front-runners fade. MANCHESTER, N.H. — The revolution has not come. Bernie Sanders is looking like the front-runner anyway. The more moderate, non-Sanders alternatives combined to far outpace the liberal Vermont senator’s vote share here on Tuesday night, with Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of a small Indiana city, again holding him to a virtual draw. His predictions of runaway progressive turnout remain unproved. But the two fading former favorites who once seemed to have a hold on the liberal establishment and the moderate establishment — Senator Elizabeth Warren and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. — lost, badly. Two other professed unity candidates, Mr. Buttigieg and Senator Amy Klobuchar, performed well in New Hampshire but have shown little capacity to resonate with nonwhite voters so far. And with no consensus among his doubters about how best to stop him, and who is best positioned to do it, Mr. Sanders’s early hold on a fractured primary field has laid bare a distressing truth for some Democrats: The man who has long resisted the party’s label might just become the standard-bearer. Mr. Biden had spoken for months of his peerless ability to win. But his debacle in New Hampshire, after another in Iowa, had him hustling to South Carolina by Tuesday evening, hastily scheduling an event in a state where he hopes his standing with black voters can save him. “We’re still mildly hopeful here in New Hampshire,” Mr. Biden said earlier on Tuesday before jetting off. The adverb was doing a lot of work. Mr. Buttigieg, hoping to supplant his rivals as the most viable center-left choice, has often leaned on tone as much as substance — Democratic elevator music, some critics suggest — presenting himself as broadly palatable to less ideological voters. After a punchy final few days in New Hampshire, where he and Mr. Sanders traded insults over electability and fund-raising practices, Mr. Buttigieg appeared to land a gentle dig at Mr. Sanders’s age (smuggled in a compliment) in his remarks to supporters on Tuesday night. “I admired Senator Sanders when I was a high school student,” Mr. Buttigieg said. Mr. Sanders’s challenges remain legion. He is still a democratic socialist who recently survived a heart attack. He is still viewed skeptically across much of the Democratic electorate. He has, for the second state in a row, fallen well short of his support levels from the 2016 primary against Hillary Clinton, though the field was much smaller then. Yet “the establishment” of Mr. Sanders’s daily warnings is less a monolith than a collection of anxious officials and strategists, with wishes not necessarily decisive in a moment this chaotic. And if there are probably still a few smoke-filled rooms where party eminences gather to worry aloud about his chances in a general election against President Trump, recent history suggests that a coalition this ungainly — unbending progressives, disaffected moderates, Obama-Trump voters — cannot be herded with ease. transcript OK, so we are walking. We are walking into the Stan Spirou Field House in Manchester, a.k.a., the Bernie Sanders primary night rally spot. And there are a lot of people lined up outside, despite the fact that it is very cold and snowy on the ground. So we’re expecting a very large crowd. The crowd is counting down. 10, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one! [CHEERING] This crowd is loving these numbers. Bernie Sanders absolutely in the lead. (CHANTING) Bernie, Bernie, Bernie, Bernie, Bernie, Bernie! Something’s happening! (CHANTING) Bernie, Bernie, Bernie, Bernie, Bernie, Bernie, Bernie, Bernie, Bernie. Bernie is taking the stage right now. He seems very triumphant. Thank you, New Hampshire! Thank you, New Hampshire. From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” Today: Bernie Sanders wins the New Hampshire primary, with Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar following close behind him in second and third place, and Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden coming in a distant fourth and fifth place. Alex Burns on what that means for the rest of the race. It’s Wednesday, February 12. OK, Alex, I’m pleased to be sitting with you, albeit at 12:15 a.m., because we actually have election results to discuss this time. It’s sort of a novel experience, right, for the 2020 campaign? They just count the votes, and the person who got the most votes is the guy who won. And they count them on the same night — Right. — as the election. Right. So I want to start at the top of the results. Let me take this opportunity — Bernie Sanders. To thank the people of New Hampshire for a great victory tonight. On the one hand, that’s the expected result and it has been for months, right? And New Hampshire went for Sanders overwhelmingly in 2016 over Hillary Clinton. So how should we be thinking about the significance of this result tonight? Look, there’s no question that this is an important milestone for the Bernie Sanders campaign. Let me say tonight that this victory here is the beginning of the end for Donald Trump. It re-establishes him clearly as the leader of the left wing of the Democratic Party, which was not sure to be the case at this point in the race. But you saw Elizabeth Warren really recede as a competitor and Bernie Sanders consolidate his support in a way that positions him pretty well for the next couple rounds of this thing. At the same time, you saw him come out on top with about 26 percent of the vote. Mm-hm. Four years ago, he won 60 percent of the vote here. Now, there are many, many more candidates running this time, so it’s not an apples-to-apples comparison. But I do think that when you look at the results in both Iowa and New Hampshire, you see a majority of the Democratic electorate leaning towards those more moderate candidates and Bernie Sanders prevailing mainly because there are more moderates than there are progressives. Right, because one way of thinking about what happened tonight is that Bernie Sanders got around a quarter of the vote, 25 percent, and he won. But another way of thinking about it is that if you add up all the more moderate candidates’ vote tonight, they collectively got something like 70 percent of the vote. Right. Now, of course for Bernie Sanders’s purposes, winning is winning, right? Right. But, what that tells you is that as this race advances, if you end up with fewer and fewer moderate candidates, it could become harder and harder for Bernie Sanders to keep winning states. Right, because those votes would likely coalesce around one moderate. One or maybe two moderates, compared to the three, four, five moderate options we have had in the race up to this point. Sanders is going to need at some point to broaden his coalition within the Democratic Party. And delegate math is a boring and arcane subject. Says who? Well, I think that between friends, we can say that it’s an arcane subject. But the way the Democrats hand out delegates, which are ultimately the point system that determine who gets to be the nominee, is really proportional to the share of the vote you get. So it’s not like winning by 1 percentage point or 1.5 percentage point over Pete Buttigieg means you get all the delegates and he gets zero. Mm-hm. In other words, these kind of victories — 26 percent of the vote — means functionally you get something like 26 percent of the delegates. It doesn’t mean you’re collecting just a giant boatload in a state like New Hampshire or Iowa, for that matter. Right. There’s certainly a value in bragging rights and in momentum — Of winning. — and fundraising, for just winning. But in terms of winning delegates to claim the nomination, a larger share of the vote matters almost as much as just actually winning. Well, so when it comes to that question — to momentum — what does this mean for Sanders? There is now an 11-day sprint for the candidates until the next contest in Nevada. And what Bernie Sanders now has is an opportunity to try to broaden his support. And to try to go out and get some of those progressives who had been voting for Elizabeth Warren, or some more working-class voters who had been voting for Joe Biden and pull them into his camp, and make himself more formidable as not just a really strong candidate, but as a front-runner. To take control of this race and to do it before one of those moderate alternatives catches up with him. Right. Time here is of the essence for Sanders. Right. (CHANTING) All the way. Granite State, what do you say? Mayor Pete all the way. Granite State, what do you say? Mayor Pete all the way. So let’s talk about who is currently leading that moderate pack, Pete Buttigieg — And I don’t think you can beat what Pete’s talking about. He may not win tonight, but number two, that keeps him going. And that’s all we’re looking for. — who came in second tonight, just behind Sanders. Buttigieg came into this state with a whole lot of momentum coming out of Iowa. And just looking at his events, at his crowds over the last week in New Hampshire, you could see a lot of support moving away from Joe Biden and into the Mayor Pete camp. And, but for a couple moments in that debate last Friday, he might have won this state outright. In this election season, we have been told by some that you must either be for a revolution or you are for the status quo. But where does that leave the rest of us? Most Americans don’t see where they fit in that polarized vision. And we can’t defeat the most divisive president in modern American history by tearing down anybody who doesn’t agree with us 100 percent of the time. You really saw him take a beating on the debate stage for the first time from every direction. Senator Warren, is that a substantial answer from Mayor Buttigieg? No. Literally every other candidate on stage went after Mayor Pete. Mayor Buttigieg is a great guy and a real patriot. He’s a mayor of a small city who has done some good things, but has not demonstrated he has the ability to — and we’ll soon find out — to get a broad scope of support across the spectrum, including African-Americans and Latinos. And the one who probably went after him to the greatest effect was Amy Klobuchar. We have a newcomer in the White House, and look where it got us. I think having some experience is a good thing. Another moderate from the Midwest, who went out there and made a very, very blunt case that he’s just not qualified to be president. It is much harder to lead and much harder to take those difficult positions. Because I think this going after every single thing that people do, because it’s popular to say and makes you look like a cool newcomer — I just, I don’t think that’s what people want right now. And you think that was effective, or it just did enough to hurt him here? Well, when you look at how Amy Klobuchar finished in New Hampshire — I don’t want to jump the gun here — but she did pick up an enormous amount of momentum at the end. I think you do have to consider the strong possibility that a bunch of moderate voters who ended up with her after that debate would otherwise have been with Pete. So it may have been Klobuchar and her gain here that cost Buttigieg a victory here. I think that’s pretty likely. Mm-hm. I also think that she has really benefited from the decline of Elizabeth Warren. That there are a lot of voters out there who feel very strongly that they’d like to see a woman elected president, and particularly they’d like to see a woman go up against Donald Trump. And that was a big dynamic fueling Elizabeth Warren’s rise, and I don’t think that that demand has gone away. And part of what you saw here in New Hampshire was a lot of more moderate and older women — who may have been drawn to Warren but were concerned about whether or not she could win the general election — suddenly see this other alternative pop up, who is a woman, and a moderate, and from the Midwest, and has a much blunter electability argument in her arsenal. And what exactly is that argument? The argument is that she has won three statewide elections in Minnesota, which is on the verge of being a swing state. Hm. I’m the only one up on this stage, you can check it out, that has consistently won in red congressional districts. Not once, not twice but three times. And she likes to tick off — and she’s very, very happy to do it — the list of the numbers of counties that voted for Donald Trump in 2016 that she then carried when she ran for re-election in 2018. It’s a little bit of an oversimplified case, because she had a pretty weak opponent in 2018. It’s not like it was this battle of the titans thing that she somehow miraculously survived. But for voters, I think especially outside the Midwest, this notion that you’re from the part of the country that Democrats lost last time is really appealing. I think it’s also appealing to people when they hear Pete Buttigieg talking about his identity as a Midwesterner. You’re saying it should not be seen as a coincidence that two of the top three candidates here are Midwestern moderate Democrats. No, absolutely not. We’ll be right back. So the results are still coming in from across the state, but right now it is clear that Senator Sanders and Mayor Buttigieg had strong nights. OK. Fourth up, Elizabeth Warren. And I also want to congratulate my friend and colleague Amy Klobuchar for showing just how wrong the pundits can be when they count a woman out. You said that Klobuchar benefited from her decline, but help us understand Warren’s decline. She got 9 percent of the vote tonight, which was really pretty underwhelming. So I think part of why Elizabeth Warren became such a strong candidate for a long period of time in this race was that she managed to get out from under Bernie Sanders’s shadow. Because she got out there and defined herself so clearly in the eyes of Democrat voters as a daring leader, her own person, someone with big thoughts and big plans, she managed to appeal to a set of voters who weren’t accessible to Bernie Sanders in 2016, may not be accessible to him today, liberal women who voted for Hillary Clinton, and other people who are pretty progressive but not far left enough to feel comfortable going the full Bernie Sanders. Mm-hm. And she, for a while, was able to straddle these worlds and look like she was somebody who could bring together these disparate parts of the Democratic coalition. And then she was forced in the early fall to really choose a side over this question of “Medicare for all.” So yes, I’m with Bernie on Medicare for All. And let me tell you why. I spent a big chunk of my life studying why families go broke. And one of the number one reasons is the cost of health care, medical bills. And her decision was to align herself far more closely with Bernie Sanders. That leaves families with rising premiums, rising co-pays, and fighting with insurance companies to try to get the health care that their doctors say that they and their children need. Medicare for All solves that problem. That made it much tougher for her to continue being this unifying figure within the party. I do think Elizabeth Warren is still, for a lot of Democrat voters, a compelling enough personality and thinker and communicator that she may be tougher to push out of this race than someone like, say, Bernie Sanders would like her to be. But it’s really hard sitting here tonight to draw the path back to front-runner status for her. Mm-hm. Alex, what do you take away from what we’ve seen with Warren? What lesson is there when it comes to understanding the Democratic electorate in this race? I think you see a really low tolerance for anything that they perceive as risk. I think you see the Democratic voters are in a really unforgiving mood when it comes to candidates who they see as making a mistake of any kind, because they want a nominee who’s a sure thing for the general election. I think you have consistently seen and heard from voters anxiety about the implications of nominating a woman, even as there is still a lot of excitement about that idea. And I think you’ve seen the difficulty that candidates have had really up until the last week or so at carving out a durable space for themselves in a race where you have had, on the one hand, Bernie Sanders as this really tenacious leader on the left, and Joe Biden as, until recently, a pretty dominant figure on the political center. When you say low tolerance for risk, I guess I’m not understanding that. What makes them a risk? Well, in the eyes of voters, the notion that somebody could make a big misstep in a debate is anathema to Democrats at this point. The idea that somebody could fumble a big policy question when the hot lights are on, I think, is a hard thing for Democratic voters to process. And I think that you do see pretty conventional assessments of people’s electability kick in as we get closer to primaries. So coming from Massachusetts, not as appealing to somebody who’s thinking about electability as coming from Minnesota. Mm-hm. Somebody who maybe fits demographically a voter’s idea of what a president looks like may be an easier sell than somebody who would be a historic candidate. Well, I wonder if this low tolerance for risk, if that’s also a way of understanding what happened to Joe Biden. This is Tom Kaplan, and I’m at Joe Biden’s election night party in Nashua. This is a pretty strange party in that Joe Biden isn’t going to be here. He already left the state to go to South Carolina. He’s supposed to address the party via livestream. It’s fair to say the room here, it’s not exactly buzzing with excitement. There’s probably not going to be much to celebrate tonight if you’re a Biden supporter. We are in a battle for the soul of the nation. Now Jill and I are moving on to Nevada, and South Carolina and beyond, beyond. And we want you all to know how much we appreciate everything you’ve done. Look, we’re going to be back. We’re going to be back in New Hampshire. We’re going to be back there to defeat Donald Trump in November. Elect Jeanne the next senator again. And up and down the ticket. So don’t go away. You’re not getting rid of us. We’re coming back, and we love you. We’re going on and we’re going to win in Nevada and in South Carolina. Thank you. And I almost can’t believe we’re talking about the electability candidate, the guy whose ads declared him to be the one person who could beat Donald Trump, coming in fifth place here. It’s really staggering and such an abrupt decline for Biden in this race. I think for months you heard this from voters over and over again. They were willing to give Joe Biden a pass on a lot of stuff that they would not have tolerated from other candidates, because they did perceive him as the electability candidate. That if all they cared about was beating Donald Trump, then the fact that he wasn’t so impressive in debates and his message wasn’t so clear didn’t really matter all that much to them. Except to the voters who saw him the most up close, the people in Iowa and New Hampshire. And when you saw him come in fourth in Iowa, it set off just a devastating chain reaction in New Hampshire. That this was a guy who voters had already been suppressing a lot of anxieties about — because they thought he could win — suddenly losing and losing pretty badly in the first state. And what has happened here, just over the last eight days, is just a rushing of the air out of the balloon. His support has just scattered to other candidates, probably mostly Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar. It felt like Biden knew this was coming, right? He left New Hampshire today for South Carolina, didn’t even stay for the results. I think he did some streaming video to a crowd here in Manchester. Is there a version of this, where the story that Joe Biden has been putting forward — This is the long race. I took a hit in Iowa, and I’ll probably take a hit here. Traditionally, Bernie won by 20 points last time, and usually it’s the neighboring senators that do well. — that these first two states do not represent his greatest strength and his possibility — that that’s accurate? Absolutely. I don’t think we can sit here right now and say Joe Biden is totally finished. I think we can say that he’s entering by far the most difficult stretch of his campaign. Mm-hm. There are already signs that Biden’s support among black voters may be more vulnerable than he hopes that it will be. But we’re going to find out soon enough that he staked his claim pretty clearly on the idea that now the rest of the country — states that look like the country as a whole, Nevada and South Carolina — are going to have their say. And because he has put so much moral weight on those states, it would be very, very difficult, probably impossible, for him to shrug off another loss. OK, so you have brought us at long last to Mike Bloomberg. Help us understand how he fits into all this, particularly in light of what happened to Joe Biden today. Well, when Bloomberg got into the race in November, what his advisers said was that he wasn’t convinced that Joe Biden could make it out of the early states. And that he wanted to essentially be waiting in March if Biden took a dive before then, and you ended up either with Bernie Sanders emerging from February as a front-runner, or just a jumbled split decision among the other candidates running. How do you like that prediction? Well, I think Mike Bloomberg likes that prediction quite a bit right now. That if the idea for Bloomberg was Biden had to fall for him to rise, at least half of that has happened now. And so, help me understand what their vision of this race is. He’s not been on the ballot these first two states. Joe Biden is, as their prediction required, stumbling. So what needs to happen for the Bloomberg candidacy to take off? The Bloomberg theory of the case is that as moderates at the national level shift away from Joe Biden, and as people who don’t live in these small rural states tune in to his television ads — Mike Bloomberg started as a middle-class kid who had to work his way through college, then built a business from a single room to a global entity, creating tens of thousands of good paying jobs along the way. — check out his campaign appearances, that they will start to see him as the safe option in the race. The electable guy. The electable guy. Because there’s an America waiting to be rebuilt, where everyone without health insurance is guaranteed to get it, and everyone who likes theirs can go ahead and keep it. And there is some sign that that’s already happening. There’s at least some polling to suggest that a good number of moderate voters and a good number of black voters are shifting, at least somewhat, in Bloomberg’s direction. Hm. This is Matt Stevens. I’m here at Andrew Yang’s campaign party on primary night here in New Hampshire. So finally we’d be remiss if we didn’t mention the two candidates who dropped out tonight. Mr. Yang is going to announce that he’s dropping out of the race for president when he comes and gives his speech here sometime shortly after 8:00. Hello, New Hampshire, how are you? Well, we lost Andrew Yang and we lost Michael Bennet, the senator from Colorado. Though thousands of voters came out for our campaign tonight, tonight is not the outcome we fought so hard to achieve. And while there is great work left to be done, you know I am the math guy, and it is clear tonight from the numbers that we are not going to win this race. I am not someone who wants to accept donations and support in a race that we will not win. And so tonight, I am announcing I am suspending my campaign for president. We still love you, Andrew! [APPLAUSE AND CHEERING] Thank you. Thank you so much. (CHANTING) Andrew Yang, Andrew Yang, Andrew Yang! Hi, my name is Gene Bishop. I live in Ashland, New Hampshire. I’m 81 years old. And I’ve been a political junkie my whole life. And I never, ever, before Andrew came along, I never contributed to a candidate. I never worked for a candidate. But I saw him in March of 2018, 2019. And the first time I saw him, I knew he was something special. Very, very different. And I had to do what I could to help him be successful. So I just can’t believe that it’s over. Are you upset? Are you — Yeah, very upset. Probably just as — I’m being very selfish, because he’s probably very upset, too. It’s something that probably he never want wanted to do, but it just hurts. You think you’d ever get this connected to a candidate, where you’d feel this strongly when he drops out? Never, no never. He was a big part of my life. I do think that when you look at the Andrew Yang experience, he is somebody who comes out of this race as a political player in a way that he was not at all two years ago. That he has a following. And when you talk to Democratic voters, even voters who like most people supported other candidates, there is an interest in him. And almost a certain affection for him, that he was often the most lighthearted character in a debate. And people liked the way he talked about the economy. And the question is, if he does want to stay in politics, what does he do with that? Right, he seems to have “cabinet member” written all over him. If he wants it. If he wants it. What do we think happens to the Yang Gang? Where do they go? We don’t really know. Because he’s one of these candidates, and it’s a genre of candidate that crops up from time to time, who seems to draw on a constituency that isn’t really partisan, It isn’t ideological, in the sense that we think of it. They’re drawn to a candidate’s personality and world view and just the way they talk about things. I think of Ross Perot. Yeah, I think that’s a pretty good comparison in a lot of ways. And do they go to another candidate? If it’s anybody, it might be Bernie Sanders, because he does have this following of younger, disaffected liberal men that overlaps, at least somewhat, with the people supporting a Yang. But a lot of them also may just sit out the rest of the primaries, because they may have been drawn uniquely to Andrew Yang. Mm-hm. So it’s now a little after 1:00 a.m. on Wednesday morning. We had this absolute mess of a situation in Iowa. We have a quite real result in New Hampshire. What is Alex Burns thinking, beyond all the many thoughts that you have already shared with us? We are still in a really, really muddled race. I think last week we talked about how five candidates in Iowa cracked double digits, and nobody got more than about a quarter of the vote. Well, this time three candidates cracked double digits, and their vote shares were a little bit higher. But you still don’t have anybody here running away with the New Hampshire primary the way we saw both Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump do in 2016. So there are still a bunch of people in this race who have a great chance to make their case, a couple of people who have a less great chance to make their case, and then Michael Bloomberg sitting out on the horizon. And I think the next three weeks are going to be some of the most unpredictable and fluid that certainly I’ve seen in presidential politics. Thank you, Alex. Thank you. We’ll be right back. Here’s what else you need to know today. Four federal prosecutors have withdrawn from the case of Roger Stone, a longtime friend and adviser of President Trump, after senior officials at the Justice Department recommended a more lenient prison sentence for Stone. Stone was convicted last fall of trying to obstruct a congressional investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, a conviction for which prosecutors had originally sought a seven- to nine-year sentence. But in a surprise filing on Tuesday afternoon, the Department of Justice called that recommendation excessive, prompting the prosecutors to leave the case in protest. That’s it for “The Daily.” I’m Michael Barbaro. See you tomorrow. “This isn’t the Kremlin,” said Steve Israel, the former New York congressman and onetime chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. “The thought that Democrats are disciplined enough to march from orders on high is a fantasy.” So far, the orders from on low suggest that Mr. Sanders is doing something right. “We have an unprecedented grass-roots movement from coast to coast,” he said in Manchester on Tuesday. The best way to win is to win, generally speaking, but the primary now includes several campaigns arguing that the reality is more complicated. Hours before the polls closed on Tuesday, Ms. Warren’s team sent reporters a memo from her campaign manager, Roger Lau, maintaining that she is still the candidate “with the highest potential ceiling of support.” Michael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire former New York mayor, has wagered an entire candidacy on not bothering with the first four states and hoping for a messy February among his peers. (Iowa was particularly accommodating to his cause.) His nine-figure ad spending could further jumble the race in the coming weeks, as candidates like Ms. Klobuchar strain to establish a presence across the national map. Then there is Mr. Biden. Even when he has not attacked Mr. Biden directly, Mr. Sanders’s crusades against the establishment can feel precision-engineered to diminish the onetime front-runner. Mr. Biden is a proud capital wheeler-dealer, trumpeting his ability to find compromise in the decades since he was elected to the Senate at 29. To this day, Mr. Biden defaults to language befitting a longtime committee chairman: He sometimes seeks to take a “point of personal privilege,” he frequently references various pieces of legislation from years ago, and he has referred to at least one campaign rival as his “distinguished friend.” Some of his top 2020 surrogates were longtime Senate colleagues, including the Democratic Party’s 2004 nominee, John Kerry. At the debate last Friday, he sought at every turn to highlight his past political and legislative accomplishments. Take on gun violence? “I’m the only guy that beat the N.R.A. twice.” Campaign finance reform? “The way to deal with Citizens United is to pass a constitutional amendment I introduced 25 years ago.” Yet voters have so far rejected Mr. Biden’s insistence on Washington experience, and those who do believe in his message of bipartisanship have gravitated toward younger candidates offering their own versions of that pitch. Mr. Biden’s campaign was already in turmoil in recent days, on the heels of a significant leadership shake-up and pleas from some supporters to embrace sweeping changes in media and travel strategy: Make Mr. Biden more accessible to the reporters, they suggested. Engage in more retail politics, Mr. Biden’s greatest strength. Maybe even sharpen the message. (After spending a day lighting into Mr. Buttigieg on Saturday, complete with a digital ad that belittled the former mayor’s small-town experience, Mr. Biden was back to oblique swipes on Sunday.) Perhaps his most urgent concern now is financial: While Mr. Biden’s campaign worked to set expectations low for Mr. Biden in New Hampshire, some donors, alarmed by the Iowa result, have privately voiced nerves about another weak finish — and showed renewed signs of interest in Mr. Bloomberg. Mr. Biden’s allies hold no monopoly on political panic at the moment. For many Democrats, recent weeks have been pocked with reminders of a primary that could have been. After a midterm triumph that owed heavily to the success of female and nonwhite candidates, the contest has instead been dictated often by white men, including a few in their 70s. In particular, the stumbles of Ms. Warren, a polling leader for much of 2019, have registered as a startling disappointment for many supporters. In her closing days here, she had dwelled often on the third anniversary of the time Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, inadvertently coined the phrase “nevertheless, she persisted” inside the Capitol, a slogan now printed on T-shirts, embroidered on pillows and tattooed on bodies, as Ms. Warren has reminded voters. “Her life is her message,” said Allison Cutler, 63, who had traveled from Vermont to help as a Warren volunteer. “And her message is her life.” Addressing supporters on Tuesday night, Ms. Warren — whose allies have suggested all week that prognosticators are not to be trusted — was left to salute somebody else for defying predictions. “I also want to congratulate my friend and colleague, Amy Klobuchar,” she said, “for showing just how wrong the pundits can be when they count a woman out.” Updated Feb. 29, 2020",The New York Times
2020,Who Won the Las Vegas Debate? Experts Weigh In,"In the last few presidential debates, there was little consensus on a clear winner or loser. That changed on Wednesday night. Twitter can’t tell us whether, or how, Wednesday’s debate might change voters’ minds. But it can give us the perspectives of some of the people with expertise on primary races: veteran campaign strategists, consultants and analysts. Their consensus was great for Elizabeth Warren. For Michael R. Bloomberg, well, not so much. Here is a sampling of their assessments of each candidate. “Warren’s focus on Bloomberg is a pretty powerful electability play. She’s saying ‘don’t you want to see me do this to Trump next?’” — Jesse Lehrich, former foreign policy spokesman for Hillary Clinton “Difference in Warren tonight: she’s not recycling the same old same old lines. She sounds like herself — practical, prepared, and pissed off. It’s powerful.” — Ezra Levin, co-founder of Indivisible “Warren is giving the right answer to Klobuchar forgetting the Mexican president’s name and looks like a class act doing it. This dynamic between the two women is great: Warren hits Klobuchar as hard as any other candidate, but stands up for her when she’s being treated unfairly.” — Jill Filipovic, lawyer and former Guardian columnist “Warren already won this debate. MY GOD.” — Linda Sarsour, national surrogate for Bernie Sanders “Bloomberg is missing every single opportunity to pivot. Other than his first answer, he’s not going after Trump. He’s not going after Bernie. And he’s not making a compelling case that he’s the most electable.” — Mo Elleithee, Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service and former Democratic National Committee spokesman “Not the best answer from Bloomberg on tax returns. ‘I can’t just go immediately to turbo tax.’ Probably doesn’t play well with middle America. Klobuchar immediately pounces.” — Adrienne Elrod, former senior adviser to Hillary Clinton “Bloomberg is not very good at this. These folks have been doing this for months and you can tell he’s completely out of his depth.” — Zerlina Maxwell, senior director of progressive programming at SiriusXM “If @MikeBloomberg wants any hope of winning the Democratic nomination, he really needs to step up his #DemDebate game. He was a C+ tonight at his best moments. He doesn’t know his audience… He came in overconfident and underprepared.” — Frank Luntz, Republican consultant and pollster “No one shows indignation better than Bernie Sanders, at a time in the nation’s history when indignation is appropriate.” — Robert Reich, professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley, and former labor secretary “.@BernieSanders answer on fracking captures why his following is so devoted. Whether you agree or not, he didn’t trim his sails. Unflinching.” — David Axelrod, former senior adviser to President Barack Obama “With the #DemDebate almost over, @BernieSanders has the edge. He is not punching other Democrats too much (other than @MikeBloomberg, of course) and his core message appeals to the Democratic base.” — Frank Luntz “Someone switched @JoeBiden to high-test jet fuel. Excellent opening answer on why he is better to take on Trump than Bloomberg.” — Paul Begala, former adviser to President Bill Clinton “Joe Biden with the perfect comeback: I’m the only one on this stage who actually got something done on health care!” — Adrienne Elrod “Is Joe Biden even here?” — Rick Wilson, Republican strategist “I thought @JoeBiden was in great form tonight. He cares so deeply and it really came through.” — Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America “Smart approach by @PeteButtigieg. Everyone wants to make this a race between Sanders and Bloomberg. He tied them together, and then trained his fire on Sanders, going toe-to-toe. It’s early, but that could be very effective.” — Mo Elleithee “.@PeteButtigieg with what could be the best line of the night. “Let’s put forth an actual Democrat” referring to Bernie and Mike.” — Patti Solis Doyle, senior adviser to the 2008 Obama campaign “Nights like this are a good test of how candidates handle tremendous pressure. So far @PeteButtigieg has been best under pressure.” — Mike Murphy, Republican strategist “Amy K will not let her Mexico mistake define her experience and knowledge. Liz Warren defends against the pile-on.” — Jennifer Piscopo, political scientist at Occidental College “.@amyklobuchar is losing ground on this #Immigration question. @PeteButtigieg cannot represent with authority on this issue but his critique if her voting record landed.” — Anna Sampaio, professor of ethnic studies and political science at Santa Clara University “Moving up in politics is exhilarating. When you get to upper tiers, it gets harder. @AmyKlobuchar’s performance has been as bad tonight as she was good in New Hampshire.” — David Axelrod Updated Feb. 29, 2020",The New York Times
2020,Who Won the New Hampshire Democratic Debate? Strategists Weigh In,"A roundup of the Twitter reaction after seven candidates faced off Friday in New Hampshire. Twitter can’t tell us whether, or how, Friday’s ABC News/WMUR Democratic debate might change voters’ minds. But it can give us the perspectives of some of the people with expertise on primary races: veteran campaign strategists and consultants from both parties. Here is a sampling of their reactions to the candidates’ performances. Commentators were startled by former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s remark, “I took a hit in Iowa and I’ll probably take a hit here” — an unprompted declaration that he didn’t expect to do well in New Hampshire, even as he was ostensibly trying to do exactly that. But at least one thought he had a strong night over all — strong enough, in any case, to stop him from slipping further than he already has. “Does Biden just head to SC tonight and camp out there? Because it seems that he just gave his New Hampshire concession speech a few days early.” — Mo Elleithee, executive director of the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service and former Democratic National Committee spokesman “‘What’s so bad about the past’ isn’t the message I see winning back 2020 voters.” — Jess McIntosh, SiriusXM host and former spokeswoman for Hillary Clinton “.@JoeBiden has had a good night. Have to believe this will help keep some support that might otherwise got to @PeteButtigieg in NH on Tuesday.” — Jennifer Palmieri, former spokeswoman for Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama Former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., got good reviews for some of his responses but stumbled on questions regarding race — a serious weakness for him, based on polls, as the 2020 campaign heads into more racially diverse states like South Carolina. “.@PeteButtigieg turned the Soleimani question into a Commander-in-Chief answer that was very powerful.” — David Axelrod, director of the University of Chicago Institute of Politics and former chief strategist for Barack Obama “.@PeteButtigieg is better at diffusing the Hunter Biden scandal than Hunter’s own father is.” — Frank Luntz, Republican consultant and pollster “@PeteButtigieg started STRONG – but tough questions about race made him slide off the pavement.” — Van Jones, CNN commentator and founder of Dream Corps Strategists and commentators were generally in agreement that Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota had a strong debate. They were less united on how much difference it would make. “Very strong response from @amyklobuchar to @PeteButtigieg’s comments about the recent impeachment hearings. She’s having a good #DemDebate so far.” — Laura Belin, Iowa political commentator “.@amyklobuchar was a real star. Folks are voting in just a few days so think this will translate into support in the voting booth.” — Jennifer Palmieri “Klobuchar has had the most consistently solid debate performances that have consistently failed to move her into the top tier.” — Dave Wasserman, editor at Cook Political Report Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont was one of two winners in the Iowa caucuses, along with Mr. Buttigieg, and they both had targets on their backs as a result. But strategists — even ones who disagreed with him ideologically — thought Mr. Sanders handled it well. “.@BernieSanders speaks with passion and moral conviction, which is the core of his appeal, not his math.” — David Axelrod “Genuinely pleased to hear Bernie admit that his view on guns has changed as the world changed. I don’t think he made that concession in 2016.” — Jesse Lehrich, former foreign policy spokesman for Hillary Clinton “I apologize for those who will be offended/triggered: @BernieSanders is simply the best communicator out there for the things he believes in. It’s a perfect combination of politics, policy, and passion – the three P’s of great communication.” — Frank Luntz The former hedge fund investor Tom Steyer got somewhat mixed reviews, but he had a particularly well-received moment in response to a question about race, reiterating his support for reparations. “Really love @TomSteyer idea of setting up a national commission on race.” — Aimee Allison, founder of She the People “.@TomSteyer gets really wound up and then his delivery is hard to follow.” — Jen Psaki, former spokeswoman for Barack Obama “Again, actual campaign wisdom from Steyer. Either he has brilliant advisors and/or he has been doing excellent reading of the political science literature. Trump will win if the Dems don’t pull down approval of what he’s doing for the economy.” — Melissa Michelson, professor of political science at Menlo College Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts finished third in the Iowa caucuses but had the third-least amount of speaking time in the debate — less than Ms. Klobuchar, who placed fifth, and significantly less than Mr. Biden, who placed fourth. But there was broad agreement that she made the most of the time she had, particularly on the subjects of race and abortion. “This is when we see @ewarren shine. Her grounding & arc on explaining race analysis across policy areas is strong. It’s critical for eventual Dem nominee to do this well, not bc it sounds nice, but bc it’s key to building support in confronting systemic racism.” — María Urbina, national political director of Indivisible “Well-deserved cheers for that answer: Warren doesn’t just support reproductive rights, she has a broader solution for protecting them.” — Christina Reynolds, spokeswoman for Emily’s List “She’s doing more with less, which is probably a product of lived experience.” — Jess McIntosh The entrepreneur Andrew Yang had far less speaking time than any other candidate — only about eight minutes over the more than two-hour debate — and some commentators said that made it difficult to judge his performance. “You don’t have to hate anybody to be on @JoeBiden or @AndrewYang’s teams. I like that. If Yang’s mad at anyone, it’s robots. In the long run, he might have one of the most consequential voices. I wish he had more attention & a better night tonight.” — Van Jones “Has @AndrewYang gotten two questions? I feel like this is only the second time I have heard from him.” — Jennifer Palmieri Updated Feb. 29, 2020",The New York Times
2020,Who Won the South Carolina Democratic Debate? Experts Weigh In,"Campaign veterans reacted to how the Democratic presidential candidates fared Tuesday night. Twitter can’t tell us whether, or how, Tuesday’s debate might change voters’ minds. But it can give us the perspectives of some of the people with expertise on primary races: veteran campaign strategists, consultants and analysts. Here’s a rundown, with the candidates listed in alphabetical order. Mr. Biden has never needed a good debate performance as badly as he did tonight, heading toward a must-win primary in South Carolina with a zero-for-three record so far. And while commentators cringed at some moments — particularly when he claimed credit for writing a bill that Amy Klobuchar actually wrote — the consensus was that he got what he needed. “Strong answer from @JoeBiden on earning the African-American vote in South Carolina and throughout the country.” — Kurt Bardella, Democratic media strategist and former Republican congressional spokesman “.@JoeBiden interrupting @amyklobuchar to take credit for writing a bill he did not write (closing the boyfriend loophole — access to guns for domestic abusers) is not a good look.” — Kelly Dittmar, scholar at Rutgers University’s Center for American Women and Politics “@JoeBiden had a strong night, which was a must. He’ll win South Carolina on Saturday and change the trajectory of the race.” — John Weaver, co-founder of Project Lincoln and former strategist for John Kasich “Best debate performance yet from @JoeBiden — he’s best when his back is against the wall.” — Jennifer Palmieri, former spokeswoman for Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama Mr. Bloomberg had a disastrous showing in last week’s debate, a point he used for a self-deprecating punchline that did not land at all. This debate did not earn him great reviews, either — especially, in an echo of last week, when it came to his exchanges with Elizabeth Warren and to any discussion of stop-and-frisk policing. But the bar was pretty low after his first performance, and some strategists said he at least cleared that. “Bloomberg is trying to prove that his sexual harassment was nothing more than bad jokes by repeatedly telling bad jokes.” — Seth Masket, director of the Center on American Politics at the University of Denver “Bloomberg looks so agitated and uncomfortable when held accountable by Warren. His whole ‘enough is never enough for her’ line felt sexist and dismissive.” — Marc Lamont Hill, author and professor of media studies at Temple University “Bloomberg actually in this debate. Not a natural but slugging away. Solid improvement.” — Mike Murphy, Republican strategist “‘With this senator, enough is never enough.’ Is that the new ‘nevertheless she persisted’? Bloomberg is bad at this.” — Shaunna Thomas, co-founder and executive director of UltraViolet Mr. Buttigieg is heading into a tough stage of the race: If he wants to turn his strong performances in Iowa and New Hampshire into something lasting, he will have to gain a lot of support very quickly from people of color. Analysts generally thought he did well in the debate, but they were divided on how much it might help him. “Smart of Pete to keep hammering away on down-ballot races.” — Jesse Lehrich, former foreign policy spokesman for Hillary Clinton “‘How can we deliver a revolution if you can’t support a rule change?’ Killer line from @PeteButtigieg to @BernieSanders.” — Frank Luntz, Republican consultant and pollster “Good debate for Buttigieg. I doubt his hits on Bernie will hurt Bernie, though.” — Laura Belin, Iowa Democratic commentator “So the youngest guy on the stage has the most thoughtful and comprehensive answer on the threats we face. Imagine that.” — Jen Psaki, former spokeswoman for Mr. Obama Ms. Klobuchar drew praise for bringing up the coronavirus epidemic, and for encouraging viewers to visit not her own website, but the website of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But in a debate in which candidates seemed to be screaming over one another more often than not, she did not seem to break through very much. “Klobuchar’s answer on coronavirus was very strong … and driving viewers to the CDC site really drove home the seriousness of the situation.” — Mo Elleithee, executive director of Georgetown University’s Institute of Politics and Public Service and former Democratic National Committee spokesman “Amy Klobuchar’s success at positioning herself as a pragmatic moderate is interesting. … In low information environments, female candidates are perceived as more liberal than men, though Klobuchar’s candidacy shows that voters respond to candidate messaging.” — Erin Cassese, political psychology expert at the University of Delaware “All the blah blah blah from candidates who have next to no black support. @amyklobuchar keeps touring winning ‘the middle’ of the country and she means white voters like her Uncle Dick. She doesn’t mean Philly, Detroit, Milwaukee.” — Aimee Allison, founder of She the People As is inevitable for a front-runner, Mr. Sanders fielded a lot of attacks on Tuesday, and his responses did not always land. More than once, the audience booed him, which seemed to surprise him and throw him off his stride. Still, he parried other attacks well, and strategists noted that given his position in the race, he could weather a less-than-stellar performance. “Bernie just got booed for the second time tonight. This is his worst #DemDebate so far — he’s not reading this audience. He’s not listening.” — Frank Luntz “Tonight just underscores how big a missed opportunity last week was for all the candidates who ganged up on Bloomberg and left Bernie alone. Bernie is on the defensive and struggling to turn it around. And the audience reaction is catching him off guard.” — Mo Elleithee “Bernie is the most likely nominee. No one who needed a home run achieved it, though there were more effective attacks on Bernie since Bloomberg was ignored more.” — Matt Grossmann, director of the Institute for Public Policy and Social Research at Michigan State University “At the end of the day @BernieSanders once again escapes relatively unscathed from a contentious debate while still enjoying the most speaking time.” — Anna Sampaio, professor of political science and ethnic studies at Santa Clara University The commentariat didn’t have much bad to say about Mr. Steyer. But the hard truth was that they didn’t really have much to say about him at all. “In the battle of the billionaires … Tom Steyer is so much better on the debate stage than Mike Bloomberg is.” — Mo Elleithee “Thank you @TomSteyer for speaking up about #CyberSecurity and protecting the integrity of our elections.” — Donna Brazile, former Democratic National Committee chairwoman “Steyer had good moments but I didn’t hear a compelling case for his candidacy.” — Laura Belin Expectations were high for Ms. Warren going into Tuesday’s debate, given both the high stakes (she is behind in the polls and in delegates) and her dominant performance at last week’s debate. She did not replicate that performance, and some strategists criticized her decision to once again focus on Mr. Bloomberg instead of the front-runner, Mr. Sanders. But she did have several strong moments, and commentators praised her ability to cut through the free-for-all onstage. “The @ewarren ‘strategy’ befuddles me. This is about winning and not sure where she is trying to gather votes. A feather duster on Bernie, who is going in for the kill against her with rallies in Massachusetts.” — John Weaver “So far Warren is the only candidate hasn’t lost their cool and stayed focused.” — Karen Finney, Democratic consultant “Warren is the only candidate who can fundamentally cut into Bernie’s base & she understands exactly how to do it.” — Jesse Lehrich “‘This is a moment to choose hope over fear. This is our moment.’ @ewarren gets in one of the few clear, calm and uninterrupted responses before the #DemDebate break.” — Kelly Dittmar transcript Senator Bernie Sanders won the primary last night and will take that momentum into Nevada. [CHEERING] And now, I’m delighted to bring you some pretty good news. We have now won the Nevada caucus! Well, all eyes are turning to South Carolina, the next battleground state in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. Bernie Sanders is the undisputed front-runner among Democratic presidential candidates hoping to challenge Donald Trump, Hey, it’s Alex Burns in New York. So last week in Nevada, we saw the candidates start going after each other more intensely than ever before days before the caucuses there, as Bernie Sanders was emerging as a progressive front-runner, with none of the more moderate candidates willing to drop out and Mike Bloomberg fragmenting the vote even further. Good evening, and welcome. The Democratic presidential primary here in South Carolina, the first primary in the South, is just four days away. And Super Tuesday is just a week away. And this is the biggest primary day of the year, as voters in 14 states cast ballots and many of them tell us they have not actually made up their mind. This week, with days to go until the South Carolina primary and signs that Sanders is gaining among African-American voters, things were even more wild. And the debate moderators totally failed to keep control of the event, which didn’t help. Mr. Steyer, Mr. Steyer — I think we’re talking about math. We’ll get to you, Mr. Sanders. Let’s talk about it. Mr. Steyer — Look, first of all — No, let me go. Let me go. No, I think — Tom, I think she was talking about my plan, not yours. I think we were talking — Right away, as expected, it was a Sanders pile-on. Bernie and I agree on a lot of things, but I think I would make a better president than Bernie. And the reason — The candidates were trying to convey that nominating Bernie Sanders would be dangerous, that to nominate a Democratic socialist is to deliver a second term to Trump — We will elect Bernie. Bernie will lose to Donald Trump. And Donald Trump and the House and the Senate, and some of the state houses, will all go red. And then, between gerrymandering and appointing judges for the next 20 or 30 years, we’re gonna live with this catastrophe. — and cost Democrats their House majority, and imperil their efforts to win the Senate in 2020. — Democratic hands. The time has come for us to stop acting like the presidency is the only office that matters. Not only is this a way to get Donald Trump re-elected, we’ve got a House to worry about. We’ve got a Senate to worry about. And this is really important. Pete mentioned — I’m hearing my name mentioned a little bit tonight. I wonder why? And maybe, you know — But what we saw from Sanders was a candidate totally claiming his mantle and digging in on some of his most controversial positions. On Medicare for All. What we need to do is to do what every other major country on Earth does: Guarantee health care to all people. On Israel. I am very proud of being Jewish. I actually lived in Israel for some months. But what I happen to believe is that right now, sadly, tragically in Israel, through Bibi Netanyahu, you have a reactionary racist who is now running that country. One of the most revealing exchanges was on Cuba. You’ve praised the Chinese Communist Party for lifting more people out of extreme poverty than any other country. You also have a track record of expressing sympathy for socialist governments in Cuba and in Nicaragua. Can Americans trust that a Democratic socialist president will not give authoritarians a free pass? I have opposed authoritarianism all over the world. Now I was really — When Sanders is asked why he had praised some accomplishments of the Castro regime there — — dictatorship there? Of course you have a dictatorship in Cuba. What I said is what Barack Obama said in terms of Cuba, that Cuba made progress on education. Yes, I think — [BOOING] Really? [BOOING] Really? Literacy programs are bad? Yes, because there’s no comparing those two [INAUDIBLE]. What Barack Obama was doing was opening [INAUDIBLE]. What Barack Obama said is they made great progress on education — What you were doing is making excuses. — and health care. That was Barack Obama. Occasionally — I talked to Barack Obama. Excuse me. And rather than try to back away from it, Sanders is essentially saying, yes, I said it. I stand by it. I was right, and I’m not pivoting. Occasionally, it might be a good idea to be honest about American foreign policy, and that includes the fact that America has overthrown governments all over the world — in Chile, in Guatemala, in Iran. And where dictatorships, whether it is the Chinese or the Cubans, do something good, you acknowledge that. But you don’t have to — This is a core tenet of Sanders’s worldview — his belief that the United States has often been a disruptive or even a destructive force overseas. And by standing by that view, even as he becomes a front-runner for a major party’s presidential nomination, he is reinforcing one of his essential political calling cards. His consistency, his ability to say, these are the views I’ve had for decades. I’m right now. I’ve been right for 40 years. And many voters really admire this about him. Mr. Steyer, thank you. Your time’s up. Vice President Biden? But the latest is that there’s one issue where Sanders can’t claim that kind of consistency and didn’t try. You know, we talk about progressive. Let’s talk about being progressive. Walking distance of here is Mother Emanuel Church. Nine people shot dead by a white supremacist. Bernie voted five times against the Brady Bill and wanted a waiting period. [APPLAUSE] No, let me finish. And waiting — a waiting period of 12 hours. I’m not saying he’s responsible for the nine deaths, but that man would not have been able to get that weapon with the waiting period had been what I suggest, until you are cleared. For most of his career, Sanders opposed crucial forms of gun regulation, including a landmark Brady Bill in 1993. And he voted to shield gun manufacturers from lawsuits. I want allow Senator Sanders to respond, because you’ve gone after the insurance industry, you’ve taken on pharmaceutical companies and you’ve taken on big tech. Why did you vote repeatedly to give gun manufacturers a pass? Well, you know, Joe has voted for terrible trade agreements. [BOOING] No, no, no, no, no. Sanders seems to know this is a problem. Whereas on all these other issues, he’s just digging in his heels under attack, here he says, yes, I made a mistake. I have cast thousands of votes, including bad votes. That was a bad vote. And this is the rare part of his record that undercuts his claim to total consistency and authenticity over the years. I have today a D- voting record from the N.R.A. But Sanders’s opponents didn’t let him off the hook. It’s a chance for even candidates like Bloomberg, a former Republican, to question Sanders’s claims to progressive purity and to total consistency over a long career. And to do it heading into this critical next state. The issue of gun control has hurt Sanders badly in South Carolina in the past. It’s an issue that matters a lot to African-American voters there, and in 2016, Hillary Clinton used it to great effect in the state. This time, even Mike Bloomberg managed to get his footing in a handful of important exchanges, including one in which he accused Sanders of having supported the N.R.A. — supported the N.R.A. And certainly Senator Sanders has supported the N.R.A. But we can do this. So that’s the latest. We’ll see on Saturday whether Sanders can manage a decisive breakthrough in South Carolina, or whether Joe Biden or someone else might still make a comeback. Updated Feb. 29, 2020",The New York Times

2020,Saturday in New Hampshire: Democrats Start Unloading on One Another,"MANCHESTER — Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders spoke back to back to New Hampshire Democrats at a party dinner tonight, grounding their appeals in two very different themes — both of which have a history of success here. Ms. Warren, speaking first, embraced the role of the underdog. Having come in a distant third in Iowa to Mr. Sanders and former Mayor Pete Buttigieg, and with polls indicating she could face the same fate in New Hampshire, she boasted: “I’ve been winning unwinnable fights pretty much all my life.” Ms. Warren recalled how she confronted executives from her perch in Congress. “Yes, I’m looking at you, C.E.O. of Wells Fargo who got fired,” she said, before invoking her 2012 Senate triumph: “Bye-bye, Scott Brown.” The message was hard to miss: I’ve been counted out before and overcame the odds. If Ms. Warren’s pitch recalled the turnaround of Hillary Clinton, who in 2008 won New Hampshire after being trounced in Iowa, Mr. Sanders evoked memories of past Iowa winners who came into this state with a head of steam, such as John Kerry in 2004. His supporters erupted when he recalled his 6,000-vote margin in the raw vote in Iowa and roared again when Mr. Sanders said he was “confident we’re going to win here in New Hampshire, as well.” The message was hard to miss: Keep up the momentum and they can’t stop us.",The New York Times
2020,Who the Heck Is That?,"words to know A look at one of the entries from last week’s puzzles that stumped our solvers. While the entry IDAS has primarily been clued collectively to the actress Ida Lupino and the writer Ida Tarbell in the New York Times Crossword, it can also be clued as the Greek mythological character who slew Castor. Idas was the brother of Lynceus, and together, the two were the suitors of Hilaeira and Phoebe. The women were also being courted by the brothers Castor and Pollux, and the feud between the men ended with the death of Castor. Idas also participated in the Argonautic expedition to help Jason find the Golden Fleece. “Actress Lupino and others,” “One of the Argonauts,” “Writer Tarbell and others,” “Lupino and Tarbell,” “Argonaut who slew Castor”",The New York Times
2020,Opinion | Who’s Afraid of Gwyneth Paltrow and Goop?,"The long history of hating on “woo.” Ms. Albert is a novelist. Ms. Block writes frequently about women’s health. When Netflix announced the trailer for Gwyneth Paltrow’s “The Goop Lab” in early January, the media and #medtwitter made dire predictions for both the streaming service and for humanity itself. The show would surely promote “dangerous pseudoscience,” peddle “snake oil,” and be “undeniably awful for society.” Longtime Paltrow critic and health law researcher Timothy Caulfield was among the many opiners who warned on Twitter of the “spread of health misinformation” and the “erosion of #criticalthinking.” Other relevant hashtags included #PostModernDarkAge and #saynotogoop. Six episodes of the show finally dropped late last month, and so far civilization seems to be more or less intact. The show explores cold therapy, energy healing, longevity diets, and therapeutic use of psychedelics, all of which may sound esoteric to the uninitiated, but none of which actually lack sound evidence of benefit. The episode on female pleasure, led by masturbation queen Betty Dodson, is downright radical, featuring a vulva montage, naked women of various shapes and ages talking openly about their bodies, and a woman bringing herself to orgasm so that other women might learn how. “We’re very dangerous when we’re knowledgeable” says Ms. Dodson. Ms. Paltrow nods: “Tell me about it.” So what underlies all the overwhelming, predictable, repetitive critiques? What exactly is so awful about a bunch of consenting adults seeking self-knowledge, vitality and emotional freedom? Yes, the rich, willowy blonde at Goop’s helm is an easy target. No, the average Jane can’t afford plasma facials or a trip to Jamaica to drink magic mushroom tea under the guidance of a legitimate shaman. And sure, we know all about the Yoni Egg Debacle, wherein the company had to pay a hefty fine for making unsubstantiated medical claims. Disclaimers are now rightfully in place all over both the site and the show, and obviously we should always practice good hygiene, but it’s worth repeating that so far there are no documented reports in the medical literature of yoni eggs causing anybody harm. The tsunami of Goop hatred is best understood within a context that is much older and runs much deeper than Twitter, streaming platforms, consumerism or capitalism. Throughout history, women in particular have been mocked, reviled, and murdered for maintaining knowledge and practices that frightened, confused and confounded “the authorities.” (Namely the church, and later, medicine.) Criticism of Goop is founded, at least in part, upon deeply ingrained reserves of fear, loathing, and ignorance about things we cannot see, touch, authenticate, prove, own or quantify. It is emblematic of a cultural insistence that we quash intuitive measures and “other” ways of knowing — the sort handed down via oral tradition, which, for most women throughout history, was the only way of knowing. In other words, it’s classic patriarchal devaluation. When 19th-century medicine men were organizing and legitimizing their brand-new profession, they claimed the mantle of “science” even though there was no such thing as evidence-based medicine at the time. In order to dominate the market, they slandered all other modalities as “quackery,” including midwifery, which we know achieved safer birth outcomes back then, as it still does today. Pejoratives like “woo” or “pseudoscience” are still often applied to anything that falls outside of the mainstream medical establishment. (Think about this the next time you hear something harmless or odd or common-sensical dismissed as an “old wives’ tale.”) Our society likes to conjoin the concepts of science and health, but the two do not always overlap. Peer-reviewed, lab-generated, randomized, controlled, double-blinded evidence will always be the gold standard, but such studies aren’t always fundable, or ethical. We kiss our children’s boo-boos even though there’s no gold standard evidence that it will make them feel better. We just know that it does. Which in turn makes us feel better. That’s “wellness.” We understand the concern that a person with cancer might choose to forgo chemo in favor of Ayurveda. But just as there are wannabe gurus selling snake oil, there are irresponsible, unethical physicians, as well as physicians with a shameful incapacity for nuance or empathy. Reiki is not proven to shrink tumors in any double-blind trials, but it, along with yoga and mindfulness and acupuncture, is being used in integrative cancer therapy at major institutions all over the world, because there is evidence that it has benefits, and no adverse side effects. To return to the yoni egg: Witness the public outcry over therapeutic use of polished gemstones to tone the pelvic floor, as compared with relative silence about the documented harms of gynecological devices like Essure and pelvic mesh. (To say nothing of what underlies our high rates of hysterectomy, cesarean section and untreated endometriosis.) To be clear, we aren’t looking to Goop for scientific rigor (or political consciousness, for that matter). But it’s condescending to suggest that if we are interested in having agency over our bodies, if we are open to experiencing heightened states of awareness and emotion, if we are amazed by and eager to learn more about the possibilities of touch and intention and energy, and if we’d like to do everything within our power to stay out of doctors’ offices, we are somehow privileged morons who deserve an intellectual (read: patriarchal) beat-down. Openness to intuitive measures that might help us avoid or ameliorate chronic despair and disease does not make us flat-earthers. The word “science” has morphed into a virtue signal, but science is simply a tool, and it can be used for both good and ill. “Science” was used during the first half of the 20th century to stop women from breastfeeding, encouraging them to turn to highly profitable, shelf-stable formula and jars of baby food instead. Traditionally, “woo” modalities have been practiced and taught in relative secret, which protected practitioners but limited their reach. When we become empowered to learn more about our bodies, our instincts, our emotional landscapes and the connections therein, maybe we’ll begin to demand that our complex and (still!) mysterious physiologies are treated with respect, dignity, and humility in the realms of medicine and science. Until then, we’ll take the curiosity and experimentation of a celebrity luxury capitalist whose good fortune it is not to have to worry about actual burning at an actual stake.

2020,Opinion | Who’s Profiting From Your Outrageous Medical Bills?,"The same people who should be fixing them. Ms. Rosenthal, a journalist and physician, is a contributing opinion writer. Every politician condemns the phenomenon of “surprise” medical bills. This week, two committees in the House are marking up new surprise billing legislation. One of the few policy proposals President Trump brought up in this year’s State of the Union address was his 2019 executive order targeting them. In the Democratic debates, candidates have railed against such medical bills, and during commercial breaks, back-to-back ads from groups representing doctors and insurers proclaimed how much the health care sector also abhors this uniquely American form of patient extortion. Patients, of course, hate surprise bills most of all. Typical scenarios: A patient having a heart attack is taken by ambulance to the nearest hospital and gets hit with a bill of over $100,000 because that hospital wasn’t in his insurance network. A patient selects an in-network provider for a minor procedure, like a colonoscopy, only to be billed thousands for the out-of-network anesthesiologist and pathologist who participated. And yet, no one with authority in Washington has done much of anything about it. Here’s why: Major sectors of the health industry have helped to invent this toxic phenomenon, and none of them want to solve it if it means their particular income stream takes a hit. And they have allies in the capital. That explains why President Trump’s executive order, issued last year, hasn’t resulted in real change. Why bipartisan congressional legislation supported by both the House Energy and Commerce Committee and the Senate Health Committee to shield Americans from surprise medical bills has gone nowhere. And why surprise billing provisions were left out of the end-of-year spending bill in December, which did include major tax relief for many parts of the health care industry. Surprise bills are just the latest weapons in a decades-long war between the players in the health care industry over who gets to keep the fortunes generated each year from patient illness — $3.6 trillion in 2018. Here’s how they came to be: Forty years ago, when many insurers were nonprofit entities and being a doctor wasn’t seen as a particularly good entree into the 1 percent, billed rates were far lower than they are today, and insurers mostly just paid them. Premiums were low or paid by an employer. Patients paid little or nothing in co-payments or deductibles. That’s when a more entrepreneurial streak kicked in. Think about the opportunities: If someone is paying you whatever you ask, why not ask for more? Commercial insurers as well as Blue Cross Blue Shield Plans, some of which had converted to for-profit status by 2000, began to push back on escalating fees from providers, demanding discounts. Hospitals and doctors argued about who got to keep different streams of revenue they were paid. Doctors began to form their own companies and built their own outpatient surgery centers to capture payments for themselves. So today your hospital and doctor and insurer — all claiming to coordinate care for your health — are often in a three-way competition for your money. As the battle for revenue has heated up, each side has added new weapons to capture more: Hospitals added facility fees and infusion charges. Insurers levied ever-rising co-payments and deductibles. Most important they limited the networks of providers to those that would accept the rates they were willing to pay. Surprise bills are the latest tactic: When providers decided that an insurer’s contracted payment offerings were too meager, they stopped participating in the insurer’s network; either they walked away or the insurer left them out. In some cases, physicians decided not to participate in any networks at all. That way, they could charge whatever they wanted when they got involved in patient care and bill the patient directly. For their part, insurers didn’t really care if those practitioners demanding more money left. And, for a time, all sides were basically fine with this arrangement. But as the scope and the scale of surprise bills has grown in the past five years, more people have experienced these costly, unpleasant surprises. With accumulating bad publicity, they have became impossible to ignore. It was hard to defend a patient stuck with over $500,000 in surprise bills for 14 weeks of dialysis. Or the $10,000 bill from the out-of-network pediatrician who tends to newborns in intensive care. How about the counties where no ambulance companies participate in insurance, so every ambulance ride costs hundreds or even thousands of dollars? These practices are an obvious outrage. But no one in the health care sector wants to unilaterally make the type of big concessions that would change them. Insurers want to pay a fixed rate. Doctors and hospitals prefer what they call “baseball- style arbitration,” where a reasonable charge is determined by mediation. Both camps have lined up sympathetic politicians for their point of view. So, nothing has changed at the federal level, even though it’s hard to imagine another issue for which there is such widespread consensus. Two-thirds of Americans say they are worried about being able to afford an unexpected medical bill — more than any other household expense. Nearly eight in 10 Americans say they want federal legislation to protect patients against surprise bills. States are passing their own surprise billing laws, though they lack power since much of insurance is regulated at a national level. Now members of Congress have yet another chance to tackle this obvious injustice. Will they listen to hospitals, doctors, insurers? Or, in this election year, will they finally heed their voter-patients?

2020,Opinion | Who’s Really Shredding Standards on Capitol Hill?,"Naming the alleged whistle-blower is much worse than tearing up a speech. Dr. Freeman is a historian at Yale. Last week, the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, said a lot without speaking a word. At the close of President Trump’s State of the Union address, she calmly, deliberately and now famously tore her copy in two and tossed it down with a shrug, declaring her disdain for its contents with aplomb. This simple gesture sent a strong message. Most speakers are expressionless during State of the Union addresses or they come close; Speaker John Boehner couldn’t quite mask his “micro-expressions” of frustration during President Barack Obama’s address in 2015. Speaker Pelosi offered a cri de coeur in comparison, as she intended. The speech was “a manifesto of mistruths,” she said during a news conference two days later. “It was necessary to get the attention of the American people to say, ‘This is not true.’” And she succeeded, perhaps beyond her expectations. Violating congressional traditions to make a point is itself a longstanding tradition for good reason. Republicans heard that message loud and clear, denouncing her incivility, accusing her of shredding “decades of tradition” and demanding her resignation. It was the “most classless act ever conducted in Congress,” Ian Miles Cheong, the managing editor of the conservative website Human Events, charged. But was it? Not by a long shot; when it comes to misconduct, Congress has a long history. Congressmen have pulled guns on each other. They’ve shoved and punched each other, and smacked at foes with fireplace tongs. They’ve engaged in mass brawls, toppling desks, tossing spittoons and, in one case, yanking off a toupee. The most famous violence in congressional history is the caning of the abolitionist Senator Charles Sumner of Massachusetts by Representative Preston Brooks of South Carolina on the Senate floor in 1856, but it was not an anomaly. Nor is Ms. Pelosi alone in violating traditions for all to see; it was far from the first time that members of Congress met alleged lies with bold displays of open contempt. In 1790, Representative Aedanus Burke of South Carolina showed his feelings with a flourish after Alexander Hamilton, the Treasury secretary, slurred the Southern militia during an Independence Day speech. Hamilton had said that Southern troops were dispirited and in disarray before the arrival of Gen. Nathanael Greene. Burke — outraged and hoping to impress folks back home — used the theater of Congress to have his say. Turning toward the visitor gallery, he declared, “In the face of this assembly and in the presence of this gallery … I give the lie to Colonel Hamilton.” Onlookers were stunned. Representative Louie Gohmert of Texas did much the same when President Obama discussed his health care plan before the House in 2009, waving a handwritten sign that read, “What Plan?” “The things he was saying were certainly not true of the only bill we had at the time,” Mr. Gohmert later said. On that same night, Representative Joe Wilson of South Carolina shouted “You lie!” at the president for a similar reason. By far, the most skilled practitioners of this showy statecraft were Southern slaveholders in the decades leading up to the Civil War. Threatened by even the hint of opposition to slavery, they used bold public threats during debate to frighten their foes into compliance or silence, tossing off insults or dangling duel challenges to set an example. Faced with the choice of a fistfight or a duel — or the humiliation of avoiding one — most men backed down or held back. For Southerners, transgressing rules was part of the point; it was a show of power. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky used the same form of showmanship when he exposed the alleged whistle-blower’s name during impeachment proceedings last Tuesday. Days after Chief Justice John Roberts refused to read a question from Mr. Paul that revealed the name, Mr. Paul did the deed himself. During a period reserved for impeachment speeches, he read his question aloud while standing next to a large blue poster with the name in bold yellow, endangering the whistle-blower and violating the spirit of whistle-blower protection laws in the process; although those laws are meant to protect informants from retaliation, they don’t explicitly stop members of Congress or the president from revealing names. Tradition and ethics alone keep them silent. Although not strictly speaking illegal, Mr. Paul’s actions were wrong, and some Republican colleagues said as much, privately admitting that they “probably” wouldn’t have done it. But for Mr. Paul, violating norms was the point. By exposing the name — and getting away with it — he was warning off potential whistle-blowers-to-be. Did he succeed? We don’t yet know, though the bar of success is low; prevent one potential informant from stepping forward, or even give one pause, and Mr. Paul has scored a victory. President Trump’s public name-calling and bullying have done much the same, frightening people into compliance for fear of vengeance in Washington or back home. Mr. Paul’s stunt shows us the real power of such transgressions. Incivility is one thing; bullying people into silence is quite another. The former scores points. The latter potentially warps the balance of power between Congress and the executive branch, and smothers the protections that make government go. These are the sins that should merit our outrage, get us out campaigning and march us to polling places. The defense of our system of government demands no less. Joanne B.

2020,Who’s Who in the Harvey Weinstein Trial,"After a monthlong trial in which six women testified that Mr. Weinstein sexually assaulted them, a jury found the once powerful Hollywood producer guilty of two felony sex crimes. After a week of deliberations, a Manhattan jury reached a verdict in the trial of Harvey Weinstein, the powerful film producer whose downfall over sexual misconduct helped ignite the global #MeToo movement. On Monday, the jury convicted Mr. Weinstein of two felony sex crimes — criminal sexual assault in the first degree and rape in the third degree — but acquitted him of the most serious charges against him, predatory sexual assault. Mr. Weinstein, 67, had pleaded not guilty in State Supreme Court in Manhattan to five felony charges, including rape, criminal sexual assault and predatory sexual assault. His lawyers argued that his accusers engaged in consensual and often transactional relationships with him to advance their careers. The monthlong trial has been seen as a critical test of the judicial system to hold powerful men accountable of sexual harassment. After receiving the jury’s verdict, the judge ordered Mr. Weinstein to go to jail, where he faces a sentence of five to 25 years. Mr. Weinstein also faces a second trial in Los Angeles, where prosecutors have charged him with rape and sexual battery by restraint. Here’s a look at some of the key figures in the Manhattan trial. THE JUDGE The task of presiding over the trial fell to James M. Burke, a former prosecutor appointed to the bench in 2001. Justice Burke clashed with Mr. Weinstein’s lawyers early in the trial after the judge suggested that Mr. Weinstein might end up in prison for life for repeatedly violating an order not to use his cellphone in court. Mr. Weinstein’s lawyers argued that the comments were evidence of bias and asked the judge to recuse himself. Justice Burke refused, saying he was merely using “hyperbolic language.” The 12 jurors who decided Mr. Weinstein’s fate were chosen after an arduous two-week process during which the prosecution argued that the defense was systematically eliminating white women from the panel, even though a majority of Mr. Weinstein’s accusers were from that demographic. In the end, the jury included seven men and five women, two of them white women. Among them are a public housing worker, an Upper East Side businessman, an East Harlem security guard, the managing partner of an investment firm, a banking executive, the co-founder of a start-up, a real estate tax accountant and a lawyer whose sister is a federal prosecutor in Chicago. THE DEFENSE Donna Rotunno, Mr. Weinstein’s lead defense lawyer, is a brash and outspoken combatant in the cultural wars and in the courtroom. A former Illinois prosecutor, she has been hailed as “a bulldog” by the men she has defended from sexual misconduct charges. Ms. Rotunno has lost only one sex-crime trial, and has been known to wear a gold chain to court bearing the proclamation “Not Guilty.” She has assailed the #MeToo movement, arguing that it has wrecked reputations and careers without due process, and has contended that women bear equal responsibility for protecting themselves from sexual assault. In a recent interview on “The Daily,” she said she had never been sexually assaulted “because I would never put myself in that position.” Damon Cheronis, Ms. Rotunno’s frequent legal collaborator, is a Chicago lawyer who specializes in defending clients against serious state and federal charges. He has called the trial of Mr. Weinstein the “type of case that trial lawyers live for.” Arthur Aidala, the sole New York-based lawyer on the team, is a frequent commentator on Fox News who has defended other prominent men accused of sexual misconduct, including Roger Ailes, Alan Dershowitz and Lawrence Taylor, the former N.F.L. linebacker. Defense witness Among the key witnesses called by the defense was Talita Maia, a former friend of one of Mr. Weinstein’s two main accusers, Jessica Mann. Ms. Mann has said that Mr. Weinstein raped her, but Ms. Maia testified that Ms. Mann had described Mr. Weinstein as her “spiritual soul mate” and had never said that he had assaulted her. “She would say he is a wonderful person,” Ms. Maia said. “There was flirtation between them since the first day.” Mr. Weinstein’s lawyers also called several other witnesses to bolster their claim that the relationships were consensual or cast doubt on his accusers’ accounts. One of those witnesses was Elizabeth Loftus, a cognitive psychologist who suggested that Mr. Weinstein’s accusers might not recall incidents from years ago. “It doesn’t take a Ph.D. to know that memory fades over time,” she said. The defendant Harvey Weinstein was for years a Hollywood kingmaker, turning out Oscar-winning movies and presenting himself as a champion of liberal causes, even as he was shadowed by sexual misconduct allegations. Then, in October 2017, an investigation by The New York Times found previously undisclosed allegations against Mr. Weinstein stretching over nearly three decades. Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie, Ashley Judd and Rosanna Arquette were among the actors who accused Mr. Weinstein of misconduct. More than 90 women have since come forward to allege sexual misconduct by Mr. Weinstein, though the trial hinges on accounts from just two key accusers, Jessica Mann and Miriam Haley. Mr. Weinstein has maintained that all the encounters were consensual. THE PROSECUTION The trial represented a critical test for Cyrus R. Vance Jr., the Manhattan district attorney, who has been criticized for not pursuing charges against Mr. Weinstein in 2015. Mr. Vance has said there was not enough evidence to prosecute the case, despite an audio tape that an Italian model, Ambra Battilana, made for the police on which Mr. Weinstein apologized when she asked him why he had touched her breasts. Mr. Vance, who was elected in 2009 on a promise to aggressively pursue sex crimes, has worked to clear a backlog of rape-evidence kits and convict people charged with the sex trafficking of minors. The conviction of Mr. Weinstein could help restore his reputation as a champion of women’s issues. Regarded as one of the most successful prosecutors in the Manhattan district attorney’s office, Joan Illuzzi has been in charge of Mr. Weinstein’s case since April 2018, when the allegations against him were still under investigation. She is known for securing the 2017 conviction of the former bodega stock clerk who killed Etan Patz, the 6-year-old boy who disappeared in 1979 as he walked to his school bus stop in SoHo. In 2016, she ran unsuccessfully as a Republican candidate for district attorney on Staten Island. Meghan Hast, the second prosecutor on the team, has offered graphic details in the trial, such as when she said Mr. Weinstein injected erection medication into his genitals and showed up in his underwear outside the hotel room of the actress Annabella Sciorra, with baby oil in one hand and a videotape in the other. Ms. Hast joined the Manhattan district attorney’s office in 2007. In 2018, she was named deputy chief of the Violent Criminal Enterprises Unit, which prosecutes interstate gun traffickers, armed street gangs and drug dealers. Six women testified for the prosecution that Mr. Weinstein attacked them, though the charges he faces were based on the allegations of two main accusers: Jessica Mann and Miriam Haley. Ms. Mann, an aspiring actress raised in Washington State, said Mr. Weinstein raped her in a Manhattan hotel room in 2013. Her case was challenging for prosecutors because she said she was assaulted during a long relationship with Mr. Weinstein that included some consensual sex. Ms. Mann said she had maintained the relationship to protect her career and defuse Mr. Weinstein’s “unpredictable anger.” Ms. Haley, a former assistant on a TV show produced by Mr. Weinstein, said he forced oral sex on her at his home in 2006. Two weeks later, Ms. Haley said, she reluctantly had sex with Mr. Weinstein in a hotel. She said she also sent him emails, took a work meeting and approached him at film events because she wanted to “just put it away in a box and pretended like it didn’t happen.” The actress Annabella Sciorra, known for her work in “The Sopranos,” testified in detail about the night in late 1993 or early 1994 when she said Mr. Weinstein shoved his way into her Manhattan apartment and sexually assaulted her as she tried to fight him off. The incident was too old to be prosecuted under state law. But prosecutors obtained an indictment from a grand jury that let Ms. Sciorra testify in support of the predatory assault charge, which requires the state to prove that Mr. Weinstein committed a serious sexual offense against at least two people. Three other women — Dawn Dunning, Tarale Wulff and Lauren Young — also appeared for the prosecution as so-called Molineux witnesses, testifying about alleged sexual assaults that are not part of the indictment; their testimony was sought to demonstrate a pattern of predatory behavior by Mr. Weinstein. Molineux witnesses, also known as prior bad act” witnesses” were used to help convict Bill Cosby of sexual assault during his second trial in 2018.

2020,"Who’s Your ‘Train Daddy’? On Byford’s Last Day, N.Y. Leaves No Doubt","Cheers, selfies and bagpipers as Andy Byford departs as the leader of the city’s subway. It looked more like a reception for royalty than a farewell party for a bureaucrat. Throngs of clambering fans fought to take selfies and screamed words of praise. Bagpipers serenaded the crowd. And a modest man in a sharp suit floated through a sea of fans. This was the scene on Friday, as Andy Byford, New York City’s departing subway chief, left his office for the last time. Mr. Byford announced his resignation four weeks ago, dismaying many workers, and riders, and ending a two-year tenure marked by repeated conflicts with Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who controls the subway and recruited Mr. Byford to New York. “Is there any work being done at New York City Transit at the moment?” Mr. Byford said to the hundreds of workers who had filled the lobby at the Manhattan headquarters of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs the subway. He then listed the goals he had set during his 766 days in the job. “I think we’ve done pretty well actually, what do you think?” he said. The crowd erupted in cheers and applause. It was a strange scene: an outpouring of affection rarely bestowed on any government official in New York, much less one at an agency often disparaged by subway riders and even transit workers. Mr. Byford had started the day in typical fashion, by doing the rounds at various subway stations. Popping into the 23rd Street Station in Manhattan on the F line, he met with Germaine Jackson, one of the 22 so-called group station managers who are responsible for ensuring that stations are clean and that MetroCard machines and escalators are working. Mr. Byford created the positions in 2018, and he had visited almost every manager since then. Ms. Jackson was the last on the list. “He’s known for putting his people first,” she said. “We’re all very sad to see him go.” Mr. Byford said in an interview on Friday that when he took the job, he had hoped to lead New York City Transit, the division that oversees the subway and buses, for five or even 10 years. He inherited a system in crisis, crippled by constant delays that left riders feeling that they could not rely on the subway to get them where they needed to be on time. Things had grown so dismal that Mr. Cuomo declared a state of emergency and committed over $800 million to improvements. Mr. Byford focused on basics like signal upgrades and train maintenance to help reverse the system’s steep decline. When he arrived in New York, only 58 percent of trains ran on time. Today, the rate is better than 80 percent. Still, despite Mr. Byford’s accomplishments, the subway remains far from the kind of modern system vital to New York’s future. And Mr. Byford, despite winning over riders and workers, was unable to win over the man who hired him. He and Mr. Cuomo never seemed to agree. They clashed over the high cost of Mr. Byford’s “Fast Forward” plan for overhauling the archaic system, which technology was best for upgrading signals and how to repair the L train, a key link between Brooklyn and Manhattan. Behind the disputes was a competition between two commanding personalities to fill the same role: the person New Yorkers would credit with fixing the subway. On an F train on Friday, many New Yorkers made their choice known. “Thank you!” some shouted to Mr. Byford. “We’ll miss you!” others yelled. “You did the best job, and I’m a second generation New Yorker,” said Matt Rosenberg, 51, approaching Mr. Byford to shake his hand. “I still remember the tokens.” As he left the Delancey Street Station in Lower Manhattan, Mr. Rosenberg expressed a worry shared by many who believe that Mr. Byford’s leadership had turned the system around. “I don’t think service will degrade immediately,” he said, “but long term, I’m concerned about how the governor will keep what he’s done moving forward.” Mr. Byford said the authority faces a major challenge in carrying out its ambitious $54 billion capital plan, the largest such initiative in the agency’s history. The authority must still raise all the money it needs to finance the plan. He also said that focusing on basics and keeping morale high among workers would be crucial to continue improving the subway. “Maintaining the upward trajectory that we are now on, we cannot regress, we cannot slip backwards,” he said. Although Mr. Byford said he was uncertain about what he might do next — several would-be employers have contacted him, he said — he plans to stay in New York. On Friday, he devoted much of his time to transit workers, some of whom have expressed concern that his departure will take a heavy toll on morale at the agency. He chatted with tollbooth clerks. He shared fist bumps with cleaners. He congratulated a worker at the Delancey Street signals tower who had worked for the agency for 34 years. Mr. Byford, whose fans gave him the affectionate nickname “Train Daddy,” marveled at the man’s decades-old switchboard and mused about putting it in his apartment one day. “My wife would kill me,” he said. “She already says our apartment is turning into the transit museum.” Taking one of his last glimpses behind the curtain and into the labyrinthine subway underworld, his attitude was equal parts transit nerd and charming riders’ ally. “I’m proud to have run New York City Transit; it’s the pinnacle of any transit professional’s career,” he said, before walking through layers of dust in an abandoned concourse beneath the East Broadway Station in Manhattan. “It was my life’s ambition.”",The New York Times
2020,Who’s on the U.S. Coronavirus Task Force,"Several of the nation’s top health officials are among those sitting on an advisory panel formed by President Trump. Get an informed guide to the global outbreak with our daily Coronavirus
 newsletter.
 President Trump formed a coronavirus task force in late January, and members have been meeting regularly. But as the virus began to spread around the globe and infections were confirmed in the United States, Mr. Trump named Vice President Mike Pence as his point person at the end of February, and more administration officials were added to the panel. Among them are internationally known AIDS experts; a former drug executive; infectious disease doctors; and the former attorney general of Virginia. The new coronavirus response coordinator for the White House, Dr. Deborah L. Birx, also holds the rank of ambassador as the State Department’s global AIDS director. An experienced scientist and physician, Dr. Birx will report to Vice President Pence, though White House officials did not specify how her duties will differ from those of Mr. Pence or Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services who is the chairman of the nation’s coronavirus task force. Nominated by President Obama in 2014 to the State post, Dr. Birx has spent more than three decades working on HIV/AIDS immunology, vaccine research and global health. For the past six years, Dr. Birx, a former Army colonel, has been in charge of the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief and America’s participation in the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. From 2005 to 2014, she also was director of the division for Global HIV/AIDS at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A biography distributed by the White House said she had “developed and patented vaccines, including leading one of the most influential HIV vaccine trials in history.” During her confirmation hearing in 2014, Dr. Birx spoke with admiration of the government’s ability to come together to confront a deadly disease that threatened the health and welfare of people around the globe. “The history of the end of the 20th century will be forever recorded with the emergence of a new and deadly viral plague that challenged us scientifically, socially and politically,” she told members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. “Fortunately, that history will also record that — eventually — we faced our own fears of the disease and embraced those infected and affected with the open arms of compassion, creative research and determined solutions.” Dr. Birx majored in chemistry at Houghton College and received her medical degree from Penn State University’s Hershey School of Medicine. — Michael Shear Alex M. Azar II became secretary of health and human services in January 2018, arriving with a background in government and industry and presenting himself as a problem-solving pragmatist. Updated Feb. 26, 2020 He replaced Mr. Trump’s initial pick for the job, Tom Price, who had resigned in September 2017 in the face of multiple federal inquiries into his use of private and government planes for travel. Mr. Azar, a former top executive at Eli Lilly, has navigated a series of high-profile issues since taking the job, from attempting to scale back the Affordable Care Act to overseeing the shelters that have housed the thousands of unaccompanied minors separated from their parents during border crossings or who entered the United States alone. He has also sought to address rising drug prices and public health initiatives such as improving the care of people with chronic kidney disease, although many of those policies have not come to fruition. And he has clashed with top health officials, including with Seema Verma, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, in a power struggle that required the intervention of the White House. From 2012 to early 2017, Mr. Azar was president of Lilly USA, a unit of Eli Lilly and Company, a major producer of insulin. That history as a drug company executive came under criticism during his Senate confirmation, when Democrats questioned whether he would take the industry’s side on the issue of rising drug prices. Republicans cited that experience as an asset, arguing that it would help him better understand the problems. Mr. Azar, 52, was a law clerk for Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. He joined the administration of President George W. Bush as general counsel of H.H.S. in 2001 and became deputy secretary four years later. While there, he helped carry out a 2003 law that added a prescription drug benefit to Medicare, one of the most significant changes in the history of the program. Mr. Azar graduated from Yale Law School and grew up in Maryland, where his father was an ophthalmologist and his mother a registered nurse. — Katie Thomas A longtime AIDS researcher, Dr. Robert R. Redfield has served since March 2018 as the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and administrator of the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. As such, he is the nation’s chief public health officer, overseeing government response to crises like the opioid epidemic or Ebola, and has had primary responsibility for supervising the federal response to the coronavirus cases in the United States, reporting to Mr. Azar. Dr. Redfield has already been the target of criticism for some of the C.D.C.’s decisions — including testing protocols that may have missed infections, flawed testing kits for the virus and the repatriation of infected patients from the Diamond Princess cruise ship — although it is not clear whether his was the final word on these and related actions. Before taking his post, Dr. Redfield was a professor at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, where he co-founded the Institute of Human Virology, and served as chief of infectious diseases. The institute provided treatment for H.I.V., the human immunodeficiency virus, to more than 6,000 patients in the Baltimore-Washington area and more than 1 million people in Africa and the Caribbean. Earlier in his research career, Dr. Redfield advocated broad testing for H.I.V. and the screening of military personnel for the virus — and faced renewed criticism for those views when he was nominated to the C.D.C. post. A native of Chicago, Dr. Redfield grew up in Bethesda, Md., where both of his parents worked at the National Institutes of Health. He graduated from Georgetown University and its School of Medicine, and did his residency at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, then continued as a researcher there, focusing on AIDS. He launched the virology institute with Dr. Robert C. Gallo, who developed the blood test for H.I.V. in 1996. — Sheila Kaplan As head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health since 1984, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci has played a central role in research of disease outbreaks, and the search for cures, since the emergence of HIV/AIDs — as he is doing now with the coronavirus. He testifies regularly to Congress about the threat of emerging diseases and has been one of the most prominent leaders of the government’s front line on public health. Behind the scenes, though, is where Dr. Fauci is considered most influential: He helps shape the decisions about where research should be directed in search of a response or cure. Overall, Dr. Fauci oversees an agency with a budget of $5.9 billion for 2020. Dr. Fauci grew up in Brooklyn. His father was a pharmacist. attended Holy Cross College and was graduated from Cornell University Medical College in 1966. His life shifted significantly in 1981, when he was working at the N.I.H. and gay men began showing up with devastated immune systems. Dr. Fauci, while certainly not known in popular culture circles, carries a kind of celebrity status among scientists. That might stem in part from the amount of research money he controls but also because of his ease with communicating deep science both with nuance and accessibility, making him a translator of sorts during times of crisis. Kenneth T. Cuccinelli II, one of the top immigration officials in the United States, has brought his firebrand approach to Mr. Trump’s coronavirus task force. He leads the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, the agency overseeing legal immigration, while simultaneously working as acting deputy secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. In nine months, the former attorney general of Virginia has gone from defending Mr. Trump’s aggressive immigration policies on Fox News to representing the Homeland Security Department on virus response. Mr. Cuccinelli coordinates the screening of travelers at airports, and land and maritime ports, and has overseen the monitoring of people who have recently traveled to China or shown signs of illness. In his short time with the Homeland Security department, Mr. Cuccinelli has irked other agency leaders with his aggressive communication to the public — including when he said the sonnet on the Statue of Liberty poem referred to “people coming from Europe.” Mr. Cuccinelli was similarly criticized on Monday afternoon when he complained on Twitter that he could not gain access to a Johns Hopkins University map of the spreading coronavirus outbreak. “I’m sure it’s jarring to the public to see a very high ranking federal official sending out an S.O.S. on Twitter,” said January Contreras, who was a senior adviser to Janet Napolitano, his predecessor at the homeland security agency. After Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader from New York, said Mr. Cuccinelli’s appointment to the task force showed how “hollowed out” federal agencies are, Mr. Cuccinelli pointed the finger at Mr. Schumer for not attending a briefing on the virus. In an interview with The New York Times earlier this month, Mr. Cuccinelli said he spent much of his time since being appointed to the task force calling hundreds of local politicians to coordinate their responses to the virus. Born in Edison, N.J., Mr. Cuccinelli was raised in Virginia. He graduated from the University of Virginia with an engineering degree and from George Mason University with a law degree. — Zolan Kanno-Youngs [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]",The New York Times
2020,Why Are African-American Families Leaving Chicago?,"“It’s an American tragedy,” said a pastor whose congregants have been disappearing for years, heading to cities throughout the Midwest and the South. It has been 10 years since Isabel Wilkerson’s award-winning “The Warmth of Other Suns” told the epic story of the Great Migration, the decades in the 20th century during which six million black Southerners relocated from the rural South to the North, Midwest and West. Chicago, of course, was one of the great beneficiaries of that exodus. In the book, Ms. Wilkerson, a former Chicago bureau chief of The New York Times and Pulitzer Prize winner, accompanied Ida Mae Gladney, back to a field in Mississippi where Ms. Gladney used to pick cotton. They also visited a cemetery, where she was asked by a relative: “Ida Mae, you gonna be buried down here?” She answered: “No, I’m gonna be in Chicago.” But today, many black Chicagoans are leaving the city. Since 2015, almost 50,000 black residents have left; 200,000 have moved out in the last two decades. Julie Bosman, a correspondent in our Chicago bureau, and the photographer Todd Heisler documented a reverse migration, which was published in The Times this week. They profiled three generations of the White family to show what goes into the decision to leave or to stay. They found that some families took only small steps away from the city, resettling in nearby suburbs in Illinois or Indiana that offer more highly rated schools and a lower cost of living. But plenty of others have made homes in places like Atlanta, many decades after black families came to Chicago and other Northern cities in search of opportunity. “It’s an American tragedy,” the Rev. Marshall Hatch, a pastor on the West Side, told her. His congregants have been disappearing for years, heading to cities throughout the Midwest and the South. “Look at the legacy that the African-American community had in national politics, in culture, with blues and gospel and jazz, and sports, from Michael Jordan to Ernie Banks,” he said. “African-American Chicago is being destroyed.” [Read more] “We need to remind them that this can’t happen again,” said 96-year-old Kiyo Sato, as he watched California’s legislators on Thursday unanimously pass a resolution, 72-0, apologizing for discriminating against Japanese-Americans and for the state’s role in moving 120,000 of them into internment camps nearly 80 years ago.

2020,Why Are Nevada Caucus Results Coming in So Slowly?,"Hours after the caucuses closed we still don’t know the final results. HENDERSON, Nev. — It took four hours on Saturday afternoon to count just 4 percent of the results from the Nevada caucuses. That didn’t stop The Associated Press from calling the state for Senator Bernie Sanders, but it did cause a lot of confusion — and continued to do so late into the night — about why counting caucus results takes so long. Officials with the Nevada Democratic Party and the Democratic National Committee stressed all week that they had gone to school on lessons learned from the bungled Iowa caucuses, when a smartphone app for reporting results crashed and phone lines to report results were jammed for hours. But by 8:30 a.m. Eastern time on Sunday — more than 17 hours after Nevada’s caucuses began, and 14 hours after most of them closed — Nevada Democrats still have only reported results from about half of the state’s precincts. The tardiness stems from new caucus rules mandated by the D.N.C. that require the state party to collect more than 100 data points from each of Nevada’s 2,097 precincts. The state party also installed a duplicative reporting system to try to prevent Iowa-style mishaps that led to a litany of mathematical errors that had to be corrected later. Nevada’s protracted vote-counting served to rob several Democratic candidates who had hoped to claim a second-place finish on Saturday night and position themselves as the moderate alternative to Senator Bernie Sanders, who won what appears to be a commanding victory in Nevada. transcript And now I’m delighted to bring you some pretty good news. According to three networks and the AP we have now won the Nevada caucus. In Nevada, we have just put together a multi-generational, multi-rich racial coalition, which is going to not only win in Nevada, it’s going to sweep this country. Now Trump and his friends think they are going to win this election. They think they’re going to win this election by dividing our people up based on the color of their skin, or where they were born, or their religion, or their sexual orientation. We are going to win because we are doing exactly the opposite. We’re bringing our people together. You all did it for me. Now we’re going on to South Carolina and win, and then we’re going to take this back. I ain’t a socialist, I ain’t a plutocrat — I’m a Democrat. We have a lot of states to go and right now I can feel the momentum. So let’s stay in this fight. But here’s the thing: it’s not enough just to fight. You’ve got to fight and have a plan to get things done. As usual, I think we have exceeded expectations. Ours is the only campaign that has beaten Senator Sanders anywhere in the country during this campaign cycle. The dearth of results didn’t stop both former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., from declaring that their internal figures showed them finishing in the next slot after Mr. Sanders. Nevermind that even under their sunny projections, each would be some 20 percentage points behind the Nevada winner. The vote-counting was slow, in part, because for nearly two hours after most caucuses were completed, the state party’s results hotline was so jammed that callers found themselves getting busy signals or messages that their calls could not be completed as dialed. A little after four hours after the caucuses began, volunteers received a text from the state party with three new phone numbers to call to report results. Caucus precinct chairs found these numbers had operators who answered the phones and could take their results. After Iowa’s caucus reporting system crashed with about 80 phone operators in Des Moines earlier this month, Nevada had 200 operators on site at the Rio Convention Center in Las Vegas. When reports came in about phone lines being jammed, the party texted its volunteers with the three new phone numbers — a move precinct leaders said made it far easier to reach an operator to report results. “They did gave three different numbers and said if we couldn’t get through they would call us back,” said Ruben Murillo, a precinct chair at Coronado High School in Henderson. Phil Sobutka, who spent more than 30 minutes dialing and redialing the party’s results hotline after his Henderson caucus finished, said the new number worked the first time he tried it. Still, the process of reporting caucus results under the current D.N.C. rules is a long one. Nevada’s caucus had 12 names on its ballot — 11 candidates and uncommitted. (Several candidates who have dropped out of the race remained on the ballot.) For each candidate, Nevada precinct leaders had to report six sets of results — early votes, in-person votes and total votes for both the first alignment and second alignment. Then the precinct leaders had to report delegate totals for each viable candidate, as well the viability threshold for the precinct. The phone operator would confirm each number with the precinct volunteer. And then once the data had been collected by phone, it would be checked against a photograph of worksheet the precinct volunteers were instructed to text to party headquarters. In an echo of Iowa’s slow reporting process, Nevada volunteers estimated it took them between 10 and 15 minutes to read through all the results with the phone operators at party headquarters. In its past caucuses, Nevada reported results much faster in part because it had to report only one set of numbers from each precinct: how many delegates each viable candidate won. This was typically three, or maybe four numbers, depending on how many viable candidates there were. But allies of Mr. Sanders, who still believe they would have won Iowa and other caucus states in 2016 had the system been more transparent, forced the D.N.C. to adopt new rules requiring 2020 caucus states to report not just the number of delegates each candidate won — the traditional metric of measuring caucus success — but also the number of supporters each candidate had on the first and second alignment. Several unknowns remained late Saturday night, not least the timing of the full results and the breakdown in delegates won by each candidate. But probably the biggest unknown: Whether the Nevada result tabulations would end up rife with errors and inconsistencies like the Iowa results were. Updated Feb. 29, 2020",The New York Times
2020,Opinion | Why Are Nonprofit Hospitals So Highly Profitable?,"These institutions receive tax exemptions for community benefits that often don’t really exist. Dr. Ofri is a physician at Bellevue Hospital and a clinical professor of medicine at New York University Grossman School of Medicine. “So, how much money do you guys make if I do that test you’re ordering for me?” This is a question I hear frequently from my patients, and it’s often followed by some variant of, “I thought hospitals were supposed to be nonprofit.” Patients are understandably confused. They see hospitals consolidating and creating vast medical empires with sophisticated marketing campaigns and sleek digs that resemble luxury hotels. And then there was the headline-grabbing nugget from a Health Affairs study that seven of the 10 most profitable hospitals in America are nonprofit hospitals. Hospitals fall into three financial categories. Two are easy to understand: There are fully private hospitals that mostly function like any other business, responsible to shareholders and investors. And there are public hospitals, which are owned by state or local governments and have obligations to care for underserved populations. And then there are “private nonprofit” hospitals, which include more than half of our hospitals. Nearly all of the nation’s most prestigious hospitals are nonprofits. These are the medical meccas that come to mind when we think of the best of American medicine — Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic, Johns Hopkins, Mass General. The nonprofit label comes from the fact that they are exempt from federal and local taxes in exchange for providing a certain amount of “community benefit.” Nonprofit hospitals have their origins in the charity hospitals of the early 1900s, but over the last century they’ve gradually shifted from that model. Now their explosive growth has many questioning how we define “nonprofit” and what sort of responsibility these hospitals have to the communities that provide this financial dispensation. It’s time to rethink the concept of nonprofit hospitals. Tax exemption is a gift provided by the community and should be treated as such. Hospitals’ community benefit should be defined more explicitly in terms of tangible medical benefits for local residents. It actually isn’t much of a surprise that nonprofit hospitals are often more profitable than for-profit hospitals. If a private business doesn’t have to pay taxes, its expenses will be lower. Additionally, because nonprofit hospitals are defined as charitable institutions, they can benefit from tax-free contributions from donors and tax-free bonds for capital projects, things that for-profit hospitals cannot take advantage of. The real question surrounding nonprofit hospitals is whether the benefits to the community equal what taxpayers donate to these hospitals in the form of tax-exempt status. On paper, the average value of community benefits for all nonprofits about equals the value of the tax exemption, but there is tremendous variation among individual hospitals, with many falling short. There is also intense disagreement about how those community benefits are calculated and whether they actually serve the community in question. Charity medical care is what most people think of when it comes to a community benefit, and before 1969 that was the legal requirement for hospitals to qualify for tax-exempt status. In that year, the tax code was changed to allow for a wide range of expenses to qualify as community benefits. Charitable care became optional and it was left up to the hospitals to decide how to pay back that debt. Hospitals could even declare that accepting Medicaid insurance was a community benefit and write off the difference between the Medicaid payment and their own calculations of cost. An analysis by Politico found that since the full Affordable Care Act coverage expansion, which brought millions more paying customers into the field, revenue in the top seven nonprofit hospitals (as ranked by U.S. News & World Report) increased by 15 percent, while charity care — the most tangible aspect of community benefit — decreased by 35 percent. Communities are often conflicted about the nonprofit hospitals in their midst. Many of these institutions are enormous employers — sometimes the largest employer in town — but the economic benefits do not always trickle down to the immediate neighborhoods. It is not unusual to see a stark contrast between these gleaming campuses and the disadvantaged neighborhoods that surround them. In some communities, nonprofit hospitals are beloved institutions with a history of caring for generations of families. In other communities, the sums of money devoted to lavish expansions, aggressive advertising and eye-popping executive compensation are a source of irritation. The average chief executive’s package at nonprofit hospitals is worth $3.5 million annually. (According to I.R.S. regulations, “No part of their net earnings is allowed to inure to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual.”) From 2005 to 2015, average chief executive compensation in nonprofit hospitals increased by 93 percent. Over that same period, pediatricians saw a 15 percent salary increase. Nurses got 3 percent. A number of communities that think nonprofit hospitals take more than they give back have started to sue. The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center fought off one lawsuit from the city’s mayor to revoke its tax-exempt status. Last year it faced another from the Pennsylvania attorney general, alleging that the medical center, valued at $20 billion, did not fulfill “its obligation as a public charity” (the lawsuit was dismissed). Morristown Hospital in New Jersey lost most of its property-tax exemption because it was found to be behaving as a for-profit institution. The judge in the case wrote that if all nonprofit hospitals operated like this, then “modern nonprofit hospitals are essentially legal fictions.” It’s important to recognize the extreme variance in hospitals’ financial status. Many nonprofit hospitals, especially in rural areas, struggle mightily; scores of rural hospitals have closed — and hundreds more are teetering — leading to spikes in local death rates. At the other end are hospitals that earn several thousand dollars in profit per patient. The most profitable nonprofit hospitals tend to be part of huge health care systems. Consolidations are one of the driving forces behind the towering profits, because monopoly hospitals are known to charge more than nonmonopoly hospitals. Should these highly profitable institutions be exempt from the taxes that pay for local roads, police services, fire protection and 911 services? Should local residents have to pay for the garbage collection for institutions that can afford multimillion-dollar salaries for top executives? Tax exemption needs to be redefined. Low-impact projects such as community health fairs that function more like marketing shouldn’t be allowed as part of the calculation. Nor should things that primarily benefit the institution, like staff training. Additionally, hospitals should not be allowed to declare Medicaid “losses” as a community benefit. While it’s true that Medicaid typically pays less than private insurance companies, Medicaid plays a crucial role for private insurance markets by acting as a high-risk pool for patients with severe illness and disability. Hospitals benefit mightily from this taxpayer-funded arrangement. These large medical centers also enthusiastically accept taxpayer money for research, something that burnishes their image and bolsters their rankings. That enthusiasm needs to be mandated to extend toward Medicaid patients and the face value of their insurance. The I.R.S. states that charitable hospitals “must be organized and operated exclusively for specific tax-exempt purposes.” Thus charitable care should be front and center. Spending on social determinants of health can also be a legitimate community benefit, but the community that is footing the tax break needs to have a forceful say in how this money is spent, rather than leave it solely up to the hospital. As many policy scholars have noted, tax exemption is a blunt instrument. For struggling hospitals, particularly in communities with a shortage of health care resources, tax exemption can make sense. In medically saturated areas, where profits and executive compensation approach Wall Street levels, tax exemption should raise eyebrows. If society decides that tax exemption is a worthwhile means to improve health — and it certainly can be — then our regulations need to be far stricter and more explicitly tied to community health. As the United States continues to fall behind its international peers in terms of health outcomes in local communities, there is certainly no lack of opportunity.

2020,Opinion | Why Are You Still Packing Lunch for Your Kids?,"While parents have been focusing on creating Instagram-friendly school lunches, the quality of cafeteria food has improved significantly. Ms. Gaddis is an expert on school lunch policy. Parents today face a steady stream of advice about how best to care for their children. Mothers, in particular, are pressured to be the perfect parent: Most of the advice on social media and parenting blogs is directed at them. How to feed the kids gets a lot of the attention. Sending children off to school carrying a healthy, made-from-scratch lunch is one of the ways that (mostly) mothers are encouraged to protect their children from the harmful effects of the industrialized food system. Middle- and upper-middle-class women especially are encouraged to pack lunches made from pricey local organic and fair-trade ingredients — these women are assumed to have financial resources and time to make healthy lunches every morning. [The topics parents are talking about. Evidence-based guidance. Personal stories that matter. Sign up now to get NYT Parenting in your inbox every week.] It rarely gets said outright, but the subtext is clear: Don’t let the lunch lady feed your child. For many parents, school cafeterias evoke memories of subgrade hamburger meat, soggy tater tots and grilled cheese sandwiches that taste like warmed-up cardboard. But in recent years, while some parents have been focusing on creating Instagram-friendly packed lunches, the quality of school-cafeteria food has improved significantly. The passage of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act in 2010 was a major step forward, requiring schools to serve lunches made with more whole grains, a wider variety of fresh fruits and vegetables and less salt and trans fat while creating opportunities for schools to serve free meals to all students. Yet the progress K-12 schools have made toward serving healthier and more appetizing lunches may stall unless more middle- and upper-middle-class parents can be persuaded to let their kids buy lunch at school. Without greater participation from children paying for lunch, local school districts will lack the funds to maintain the gains in quality. In fact, if we could muster the political will, increasing the financial and public support for subsidized lunches would secure a future for healthy school food that would improve public health, create better jobs for school cafeteria workers (some 90 percent of whom are women) and help the country transition to a more sustainable food system. Ninety-five percent of public schools participate in the government-subsidized National School Lunch Program, which was created in 1946 to improve children’s health and support American farmers. On a typical school day, roughly 30 million children, mostly from lower-income households, eat lunch through this program, which sorts students into different payment categories, depending on their family income. Children from a family of four that earns more than $47,638 per year pay full price, while lower-income families pay either 40 cents per lunch or nothing at all. The average cost for a full-price elementary school lunch is about $2.50, but local districts set their own prices. Some high school lunches, with prices as high as $5 per lunch, exceed the limits of affordability for many families. Putting healthier food on school cafeteria menus has done little to change school lunch participation rates: By my calculation, roughly 20 million eligible children, mostly from middle- and upper-middle-class families, continue to opt out of the national program by bringing lunch or by buying special à la carte food items not covered by the program. As an individual family decision, packing lunches might seem like the best option, especially for children with special dietary needs. But when millions of families do so, their actions reduce the political will and financial resources necessary to make public school lunches better for everyone. The Trump administration isn’t much help. According to Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, providing schools with the flexibility to plan menus that appeal to students’ taste preferences is a way to attract more paying customers to the federal program and reduce food waste. Mr. Purdue has pursued this strategy for making school lunch “great again.” In practice, this has meant enacting policies that loosen restrictions on the amount of sodium, flavored milk and refined grains that can be served in school meals. The department’s own data shows that participation in the national lunch program is higher in cafeterias that serve healthier meals, yet the administration’s latest proposal, released last month, would allow schools to serve more French fries and fewer green vegetables. Despite these setbacks, in recent years, community activists have won universal free school meals in many of the nation’s poorest schools and in some large districts like Boston and New York City public schools. Many more districts have started robust farm-to-school programs that support local food and farm economies. And Democrats are talking about universal free lunch on the campaign trail. There are limits, however, to what even the most progressive school food service programs can achieve when roughly 40 percent of eligible students continue to opt out of the national program. The food-service director of the Austin Independent School District, Anneliese Tanner, told a local news outlet that the district could afford to serve grass-fed beef if the kids who currently opt out of the national program would eat school lunch just once a week. All families stand to benefit from making a public investment in high-quality, universal free school meals. Mothers, in particular, would benefit far more than we might realize: According to the American Time Use Survey, women spend more than twice as much time per day preparing family meals as men. Preparing school lunches cuts into their already limited leisure time and adds to the mental load they disproportionately shoulder. The solution is right in front of us. When kids eat school lunch, they and their parents are supporting the efforts to improve the national program for current and future generations.

2020,Opinion | Why Bernie Sanders Praised Amazon,"My company deserves scrutiny. But we have already done many of the things politicians demand of America’s leading businesses. Mr. Carney is the senior vice president for global corporate affairs at Amazon. “Hello, Jay?” The voice on the line was instantly recognizable. “It’s Bernie Sanders.” Given that Senator Sanders is a frequent critic of Amazon, you might think he was calling to complain about something my company had done — or wasn’t doing. But on this day, in November 2018, his message was different. “Listen,” he told me, “I just want to congratulate Amazon for raising your minimum wage to $15 an hour. That’s good for your workers. It’s the right thing to do. Please thank Jeff Bezos for me.” To be sure, Senator Sanders’s appreciation for Amazon and our founder, Mr. Bezos, didn’t last long. He and Senator Elizabeth Warren, both candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination, regularly attack the company on the campaign trail, other candidates sometimes echo them. Still, his call at least recognized a reality often forgotten or ignored in debates about the role a company like ours can and should play in the economy. This year’s elections will center, as they almost always do, on the economy — specifically, on jobs and how things like health care and training opportunities affect the way American workers feel about their economic circumstances. As the employer that has added more jobs to the American economy over the last decade than any other, we at Amazon have a unique perspective. Critics and reporters often categorize Amazon as a big tech company, and it is true that digital technology powers much of our businesses. But in today’s economy, phrases like “big tech” and the “tech industry” obscure more than they enlighten. Our core business, consumer retail, involves hundreds of thousands of employees who store, ship and deliver billions of physical goods — not bits of data — via airplanes, trucks and vans around the world. We are not a social media company, a news aggregator or a forum for political advocacy (or disinformation). While we fully agree that a company of Amazon’s size should be scrutinized, we also believe people should know that Amazon is doing exactly what many lawmakers and critics insist the private sector should do. And because Amazon is a large company with hundreds of thousands of employees, as well as contractual relationships with hundreds of thousands of other businesses of all sizes, what we do can generate positive ripple effects across the country. When Amazon raised its minimum wage to $15 an hour, we made sure that every one of the company’s warehouse workers, known as fulfillment center associates, got a pay increase. But the change wasn’t just good for our associates. We have 500,000 employees in 40 states; when a company our size increases wages, competitors feel pressure to do the same for their own workers, or risk losing them. Indeed, after our wage-increase announcement, we received a record 848,775 applications for hourly positions. We know $15 is not a lot. In fact, we believe $15 should be the minimum anyone in the United States is paid for an hour of labor, and in most areas of the country our starting wage is even higher. But while the debate about Amazon’s impact at times focuses on how our hourly jobs compare to jobs of the past, or to an idealized vision of the future, the truth is that more than 40 million Americans earn less than the lowest-paid Amazon associate. For many people, a job at one of our fulfillment centers is by far the best option available in their region. And we are proud of that — even as we agree that our political and business leaders must work together to create more and better options for all America’s workers. One place to start: Raise the federal minimum wage to $15 from its current rate of $7.25 — something only members of Congress like Senator Sanders can do. If Congress were to follow our lead, all it would take to greatly improve the lives of America’s lowest-paid workers is the president’s signature. In keeping with what political leaders say they want to see from companies, Amazon has plowed $270 billion into the domestic economy since 2010. In economically struggling areas like Fall River, Mass., and the Inland Empire in California, our recent investments and hiring have helped to drive down the local unemployment rate and added hundreds of millions of dollars to local economies. Improving the lives of American workers is about more than wages. We compete fiercely with Silicon Valley companies to hire the best software engineers, computer science Ph.D.s and data scientists. That means offering generous health care and other benefits on top of highly competitive pay. To cut costs, we could follow the model of some other companies by giving cheaper, basic benefits to our hourly work force. Instead, we not only pay our hourly workers significantly better than most of our consumer retail competitors, we also provide the same comprehensive health insurance and parental leave benefits to our lowest-paid associates as we do our most senior executives. While the United States may never restore the manufacturing sector to its 20th-century heights, we can train Americans for the high-paying jobs of tomorrow. With that goal, Amazon offers fulfillment center workers the chance to learn new skills and earn certificates in high-demand fields that offer better-paying job opportunities. Our Career Choice program prepays up to 95 percent of tuition and fees — making it almost free for employees to learn new skills. In most cases, associates who finish Career Choice become eligible for jobs that double or triple their current pay — either within Amazon or, if they prefer, with another employer. Overall, Amazon is investing $700 million to provide training to 100,000 of our domestic employees by 2025. Once again, the scale of Amazon’s investment in its own work force will influence other major companies to follow suit. All big institutions, public and private, merit scrutiny. At Amazon, we welcome it — from lawmakers, regulators and customers. And we know that our critics will at times have good ideas about how we, and other major companies, can do both more and better. But we also hope that, in examining what we already do, those critics at least acknowledge this: When it comes to creating jobs, raising wages, providing benefits and training employees for higher-paying jobs, Amazon is doing many good things — for the economy, and for American workers.
