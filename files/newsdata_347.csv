2018,"Failed by Facebook, We’ll Return to the Scene of the Crime. We Always Do.","DealBook As Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s co-founder, begins two days of testimony on Capitol Hill, where he will undoubtedly face withering criticism over his site’s handling of user data, millions of people will spend the day the way they always do: scrolling through their News Feeds, sending each other messages and “liking” posts, oblivious to any privacy concerns. The reality is that when it comes to privacy, the trade-off has already been made: We decided long ago to give away our personal information in exchange for free content and the ability to interact seamlessly with others. With the latest disclosure about Facebook’s data missteps — that the personal information of some 87 million users had been improperly harvested and shared with a British analytics firm — politicians can scream from the rooftops about privacy, and they should. But the public has proved over and over again that it doesn’t care. The evidence is all too clear: After just about every big privacy hack over the past decade, people quickly returned to the scene of the crime, using the same store or online site that had been compromised. Remember the massive breaches at Home Depot, Target and Yahoo? The number of consumers who never went back is minuscule. Perhaps Facebook’s latest privacy scandal — combined with its role in the spread of false news and in foreign interference in United States elections — will be a turning point in consumer behavior. But if history is any guide, we won’t do anything differently, unless regulators take steps to save us from ourselves. For all the head-scratching and criticism over Facebook’s slow response to various breaches and privacy fiascos, it wasn’t completely irrational. The incentive for companies to go to great lengths to protect our data — with the exception of banks and financial firms — just isn’t there. Benjamin Dean, the president of Iconoclast Tech, a technology consulting firm, and a former fellow in cybersecurity and internet governance at the Columbia School of International and Public Affairs, has studied some of the biggest data hacks, poring over companies’ financial records before and after a breach. The financial pain they experienced was small, he found. “The actual expenses from the recent and high-profile breaches at Sony, Target and Home Depot amount to less than 1 percent of each company’s annual revenues,’’ he wrote in a 2015 article titled “Why Companies Have Little Incentive to Invest in Cybersecurity.’’ “After reimbursement from insurance and minus tax deductions, the losses are even less.” When Google first introduced Gmail in 2004, this newspaper raised questions about the prospect of users objecting to a service that displayed advertising to them based on the content of their email: “For many, the bottom line appears to be that sifting through personal email with an eye toward making a sale is beyond the pale.” Well, now more than 1.2 billion people have active accounts with Gmail, a service that until the end of last year sifted through your private messages. Apparently, it wasn’t beyond the pale. For consumers, the transaction has always been pretty clear: The convenience of free service in exchange for information that allowed advertisers to specifically target us. The distinction in that equation was motivation; we figured our data was being used by benign companies seeking to sell us that pair of sneakers we wanted, not by bad actors trying to influence our political votes — or incite violence in places like in Myanmar. None of this is to suggest that Facebook handled these situations properly; it clearly did not. And over the past week, Mr. Zuckerberg has repeatedly said as much to just about anyone who would listen. The problem is that Mr. Zuckerberg has been apologizing for years for all sorts of breaches of trust with his “community.” And guess what? After each mea culpa, the Facebook community has grown. Notwithstanding the #DeleteFacebook campaign, the only way companies are going to change the way they protect our data is if users abandon them — or if regulators step in. Perhaps the biggest obstacle to behavioral change — besides our insatiable desire for all things “free” — is that it is unusual for most consumers to truly feel the effects of a massive data breach. For most people, it’s a theoretical problem — the way some people view climate change or the growing national debt. The people who are most directly affected by privacy breaches are those who have had money stolen or whose email was exposed. But in huge data breaches, those people are a statistical anomaly. Amy Pascal, the former of top film executive at Sony Pictures, has an authentic claim to being a victim of a data breach; she suffered national embarrassment when her emails were revealed, and she later lost her job. John D. Podesta, Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman in 2016, also had his email compromised, to deleterious effect. But most people don’t feel it. Over the weekend, I asked users on Twitter whether they had deleted their Facebook accounts or reduced their activity on it. Nearly 700 users replied. For every one saying they were spurning Facebook, there were more saying they were continuing to use it. “Understand nothing in social media is truly private and recognize that in most areas of life someone is trying to sell you something or affect your behavior,” one user wrote. Another wrote: “People love the service they get from Facebook but forget nothing is free. We pay for using it by providing our demographic and personal information so that they can sell ads to businesses to better understand and target us. We benefit by getting more relevant ads sent to us.” And while a number of people said they were distancing themselves from Facebook, they cited not only privacy concerns but said the service had become less relevant to them. In 2010, Mr. Zuckerberg was asked about privacy during an interview. His answer reflected where we are right now. “People have really gotten comfortable not only sharing more information — and different kinds — but more openly with more people,’’ he said. “And that social norm is just something that’s evolved over time. And we view it as our role in the system to constantly be innovating and updating what our system is, to reflect what the current social norms are.” Unless our social norms change, Facebook and other sites probably won’t, either. An earlier version of this article misstated Google’s policy on scanning the content of its Gmail service as a way of directing advertising to specific users. It no longer scans emails for advertising purposes; it discontinued the practice last year.",The New York Times
2018,"Faith Spencer, James Armstrong","Faith Dana Spencer and James Warren Armstrong were married April 7 at Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church in New York. The Rev. Beverly A.

2018,Fake Experts Abound. Here’s How to Find (and Be) a Real One.,"Sketch Guy There are two types of experts in the world: real experts, and fake ones. The real experts are the people who spend many years refining their knowledge and skill set in a particular area and become masters of pattern recognition. But all too often, they end up toiling away in relative obscurity and poverty, neither maximizing their opportunity for impact nor earning the money they deserve. This makes me sad. Real experts deserve so much more, and they could make so much more of a difference in the world if they could just figure out how to be heard above the clamor of … Fake experts. This group makes me mad. You know the type. These are people, as the writer Sean Blanda put it in describing certain other writers, whose “interest is not in making the reader’s life any better, it is in building their own profile as some kind of influencer or thought leader.” Your inbox is probably full of fake experts and their garbage. They are people like the speaker I heard at a conference who claimed that all you had to do to be an expert was raise your hand. That’s not expertise. It’s snake oil. Both of these groups share one problem: They misunderstand the business of expertise. One group undervalues real knowledge; the other group overvalues fake knowledge. I didn’t realize that there was a way to fix this problem. In fact, I didn’t even know exactly what the problem was until I read David Baker’s new book, “The Business of Expertise.” What’s so compelling about Mr. Baker is that he’s an expert on being an expert. And because he is so knowledgeable about what true expertise entails, he is able to help both real and fake experts alike. If you’re a fake expert, this book will teach you how to become a real expert (assuming you actually care about that). And if you’re a real expert, this book is a road map to converting your insight into greater impact and financial security. One of Mr. Baker’s key insights is the decoupling of time and results. Experts can often see a problem and quickly provide a solution, and that makes them valuable, even though it appears easy and quick in each instance. In fact, it’s not easy at all. You become an expert through repeated exposure to similar patterns. After doing hundreds of financial planning meetings with new or potential clients, I started noticing those patterns. Eventually, I got to the point where in the first 10 minutes of asking about people’s goals, I often knew exactly where they were headed, what sort of risk they might be comfortable with and where the challenges might be. Don’t worry that you won’t be rewarded for your speed, once you do get faster. Recall the tale of the old lady with the squeaky floorboard. It had been squeaky for 20 years. She finally called the wise old carpenter. He came in, stepped on the floorboard once and then twice, then took out a hammer and nail. Finally, he pounded the nail into the floorboard. He handed the lady a $100 invoice, and she wanted to know why 10 minutes of his time required such a big payment. “Oh,” said the carpenter. “I forgot to itemize that.” Nail: $1.00 Knowing where to pound nail: $99.00 She paid. And Mr. Baker taught me much more about the value of knowing exactly where to pound.",The New York Times

GOING FOR A BEER Selected Short Fictions By Robert Coover 432 pp. W. W. Norton & Company. $26.95. Robert Coover’s new collection of short stories, “Going for a Beer,” is a mixtape of variations and a fugue on time from a postmodern master. The prismatic repertoire of nearly six decades, it comprises something old, something new, something borrowed and something dark and blue. The book begins with an alternative flood fable that first appeared in 1962 and ends with an alien invasion tale from 2016. That range, from primal myth to science fiction, is representative. In Coover’s fictional universe, familiar tales and conventional genres are made new, tinged with shuddering wonder and titillating humor. Coover is revered as a writer’s writer for his mythic vision and experiments with literary form. In the 1960s and 1970s, he was associated with a group of postmodern writers — Thomas Pynchon, William Gass, John Barth, Donald Barthelme — who questioned the limitations of realism and explored metafiction and self-reflexivity. Later, Coover was a pioneer of electronic literature who established the first hypertext workshop in 1990 at Brown University. Yet Coover’s starting point has always remained classical, biblical and Continental. He has a background in Slavic studies and draws inspiration from mythology, folklore and fairy tales. He is intimate with Ovid, Cervantes and Rabelais; from Beckett he learned minimalism, from Kafka the absurd. He denounced Christianity at an early age, but his work is rife with apocalyptic visions and paradises lost. In “Pricksongs & Descants” (1969), his first story collection, Coover borrowed the musical proposition from medieval music that was written on “pricked” or dotted sheets. He created a theme for each story, then improvised variations in each — a technique that repeatedly appears in his later fiction. “Going for a Beer” encompasses work from that book as well as “In Bed One Night and Other Brief Encounters” (1983), “A Night at the Movies” (1987), “A Child Again” (2005) and two stories recently published in The New Yorker, including the title story. While stories are presented in chronological order by publication date, the recurring themes become so visible that they create a form for this collection and denote Coover’s literary trajectory. Coover’s most anthologized story, “The Babysitter,” is composed of more than 100 paragraphs, separated by dots, to elaborate a scenario: A father lusts after his teenage babysitter, alone with her young charges, while her boyfriend and his buddy make plans to rape her that night. The story proceeds not in linear time but around the architecture of time. In baroque prose, Coover subtly criticizes the zeitgeist, loose morals, juvenile delinquency and parental negligence. Fairy tales, adapted and reversed, have long recurred in Coover’s work. “The Gingerbread House” and “The Magic Poker,” dark riffs on “Hansel and Gretel” and “The Frog King,” are filled with sex, violence and incest. In “The Dead Queen,” Prince Charming finds Snow White in bed with all seven dwarves and vows, “Whatever those freaks could do, I could do better!” “The Brother” and “The Wayfarer,” from a series dedicated to Cervantes, are stories that play with narrative frame and voice. The most Cervantean story is “Going for a Beer,” a picaresque about a modern drunk who is easily captivated by random women in bars. Abandoned by his wife and teased by her lover, he refuses to change even though “he has had enough trouble for one lifetime.” The story, which ends when his life does, presents the narrative through his blurry mind and blinded view; his sense of time is only tangential. Throughout, there is Coover’s customary humor. Fixated on becoming a writer, Adam forgets about Eve and the kids and the boiling coffee on the stove, and he invents “a story with several narrators, each quoting the next, the last quoting the first and telling the story being told.” Similarly, a film projectionist in one story cuts and pastes his own reels, using “multiple projectors to produce a flow of improbable dissolves, startling sequences of abrupt cuts and freeze frames like the stopping of a heart, disturbing juxtapositions of slow and fast speeds, fades in and out like labored breathing.” This mirrors Coover’s technique, with its cinematic swerves and pop sensibilities (as when he imagines what goes on offscreen between Rick and Ilsa in “Casablanca”). “Going for a Beer” presents the garden of intertextuality in Coover’s fictional universe. Words imitate cinematic techniques. Characters in early stories might have cameo roles in later ones. When Stick Man is forced to have sex with Stick Woman on reality TV in a 2005 story, Cartoon Man — the superhero protagonist of a 1987 story — alights on set to save them from the havoc, deus ex machina. The book reaches its final crescendo when a Texas senator is emasculated by Martians and discovered by his intern, who starts to broadcast this inconvenient truth. The senator rebuts her claims on a medium that might have sprung from the hypertext mind of Coover himself: He tweets it.",The New York Times
2018,Family Identifies Dismembered Body in Brooklyn Park: ‘It Was My Chocolate’,"The description on television news reports was vague, except for one detail: The woman whose dismembered body was discovered in Canarsie Park in Brooklyn this week had a tattoo of the word “Chocolate” above her left breast. When the woman’s grandmother heard that on Tuesday, she told her daughter, Nicole Odom, who looked up who was investigating the case and went to the 69th Precinct station house. “So I can find out if this is my child,” Nicole Odom, said on Wednesday. She brought a picture of her daughter, Brandy Odom, 26. Detectives showed her a picture of the body they found in the park. The arms and legs had been cut off; they were later found in plastic bags nearby. “It was my kid. It was my Chocolate,” Ms. Odom said. The killing has deeply unsettled people living near the park, a stretch of woods and playground bordering Jamaica Bay, and set questions swirling around what happened. Investigators determined Brandy Odom’s limbs were cut off after she had been killed, a city official said. But the medical examiner has not said how she was killed, and the police have not made any arrests. On Wednesday, investigators in white protective coveralls sifted through a garbage can within a perimeter of yellow caution tape strung from trees in a different part of Canarsie Park. On the grass below them stood yellow evidence markers. A woman walking her dog on Monday had noticed the head and torso, face down and partly covered in leaves. On Tuesday, a half mile away in the same park, investigators found plastic bags with other body parts. Investigators from the medical examiner’s office were expected to do a skeletal examination, and police investigators were combing the area for video and trying to trace Ms. Odom’s whereabouts before her death. Raised in Crown Heights, Ms. Odom was a former security guard who had trained in cosmetology after high school and recently passed the exam to become a city school safety agent, her mother said. Nicole Odom got a letter from the city in March telling Brandy to come in for an interview for the school safety job, and she called her daughter with the good news. It was the last time they spoke. Ms. Odom was living in Queens, her mother said. She often visited her aunt and cousins in their apartment in the Bayview Houses in Brooklyn, less than a mile from where her body was found. She stopped by on the weekends, talking, laughing, listening to reggae music and cooking West Indian food with two cousins, said Madonna Alfred, 41, a neighbor. Ms. Alfred said Ms. Odom sometimes wore scrubs for a job as a home health aide, and talked of rising higher: She said she wanted to become a flight attendant and get her own apartment. “She had ambitions, she had a game plan,” Ms. Alfred said. “She wanted to work and take care of herself.” Ms. Alfred didn’t see any regular boyfriends coming by. “Pretty girl. She had the biggest smile ever,” Ms. Alfred said. “She was a sweetheart.” Neighbors there said they had not seen her for months. Her mother remembered her as “her own kind of independent woman” who moved out at 18 years old and started chasing various job-training certificates. “She liked to be her own boss,” Nicole Odom said. She said she was eager for the police to tell her how her daughter was killed and to arrest her killer. “Nobody should have to go through such a tragedy as I’m going through right now because, you know, she was a bright kid,” Ms. Odom said. “I just want to get down to the bottom of it. I just want justice done.”",The New York Times
2018,"Family’s Fatal Plunge Off Cliff May Have Been Intentional, Authorities Say","A crash in which a sport utility vehicle carrying a family plummeted off a California cliff overlooking the Pacific Ocean last week may have been intentional, the authorities said on Monday. The vehicle, carrying Jennifer and Sarah Hart and at least three of their six adopted children, had stopped on a dirt pullout off Highway 1 on March 26 before accelerating about 70 feet to the edge of the cliff, the California Highway Patrol said, citing an analysis of the vehicle’s onboard computer. Investigators also did not find skid marks at the scene that might have indicated a collision. “It was pure acceleration from the last brake application until it hit the bottom of the cliff,” Greg Baarts, the acting assistant chief of the California Highway Patrol’s northern division, told reporters on Sunday night. Preliminary evidence indicated that when investigators reached the S.U.V., its speedometer showed a reading of 90 miles per hour, Mr. Baarts said. But the authorities cautioned that did not mean that the vehicle reached 90 m.p.h., because the S.U.V. could not have reached “a significant speed” from the spot where it stopped and the edge of the cliff. The speedometer reading, rather, could have been affected by the crash or the recovery effort, the authorities said. The Mendocino County Sheriff’s Office said it was alerted to the wreck along Highway 1 last week by an individual who was using a pullout and spotted the vehicle upside down on the rocks below. The crash occurred more than 500 miles south of the Harts’ Washington home and about 200 miles north of San Francisco. Investigators have so far recovered the bodies of the parents, both 38, and three of their children: Markis, 19, Jeremiah, 14, and Abigail, 14. The authorities were still searching for the other three children. They are Hannah, 16; Devonte, 15; and Sierra, 15. While it wasn’t clear why the family was so far south of their home, it appeared they were on a short trip because they had left behind many belongings, a pet and some chickens, the Mendocino County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement. Just days before the crash, the family had been reported to the state for alleged abuse or neglect, according to a spokeswoman for the Washington State Department of Social and Health Services. The department tried to reach the family at home the day that it received the complaint, on March 23, but no one answered the door. It tried again on the day of the crash and once more the day after that. “There was no findings made because we had not made any contact with the family,” the spokeswoman, Norah West, said. She declined to describe the nature of the referral. Dana DeKalb, who lives near the Harts’ home, told the NBC affiliate KGW that she had called child services after one of the children, Devonte, had visited her and her husband, Bruce, multiple times asking for food, which he said was being withheld as punishment. Soon after the visit from child services, the family and their car were gone, Mr. DeKalb said. “We figured that they saw the business card and loaded up the kids as quick as they could and took off,” he told KGW. Sarah Hart was convicted of misdemeanor domestic assault in Minnesota in 2011, according to court records. A copy of the complaint shows that she had initially been charged with a count of malicious punishment of child. According to the complaint, Ms. Hart admitted to spanking one of her children, then 6 years old, and said that marks on the child’s stomach were probably from having been bent over the edge of a bathtub while being spanked, according to the complaint. “The defendant admitted that she let her anger get out of control,” the complaint said. Public records show that Sarah Hart had lived in Minnesota for years before moving to West Linn, Ore., and finally Woodland, Wash. The family spent a fleeting moment in the global spotlight in 2014, thanks to a widely shared photograph of Devonte, who is black, tearfully hugging a white police officer at a rally to protest police violence in Portland, Ore. The officer, Sgt. Bret Barnum, told The Oregonian at the time that he had spotted Devonte carrying a “Free Hugs” sign, called the boy over and asked him why he was crying. The photograph of their embrace, captured by a freelance photographer, was shared around the world and may have driven the family to relocate to Washington from Oregon, the Mendocino County Sheriff’s Office said. An earlier version of this article, using information provided by the Mendocino County Sheriff’s Office, incorrectly stated Sierra Hart’s age at the time of the crash. She was 15 years old, not 12.",The New York Times
2018,"Farewell, My Lovely Inheritance","I Was Misinformed I have been interviewing architects for the memorial I plan to build to my inheritance. The site will of course be the grounds of my mother’s nursing home in Westchester, and given her diminishing funds, I fear it will be rather small: The size of a birdhouse, I’m thinking. Not just any birdhouse, a birdhouse for old, infirm birdies, with a special area for art therapy and birdie bingo. Having just written the monthly check for my mother’s medical care, I anticipate I’ll be able to spend as much as $280. I hope, nonetheless, to erect a monument that will equal the Taj Mahal in terms of loss and despair. Goddamn it, I wanted that money. I know, I know. It’s appalling to be thinking about an inheritance; my thoughts should be on my 91-year-old mother, who had a stroke and for the last three and a half years has required round the clock medical care. I was shocked by the craven, venal thoughts oozing out of my brain, too. But there they were on the pillow when I woke up one morning; nobody else was in the bed, and as Freud so famously said, “The unconscious, she is like a septic tank. Nobody wants to look at it too close, you hope it stays covered up, but when it starts seeping out on the lawn and even the neighbors can smell it, you don’t have a choice. Thank God, you live in an apartment in New York where you have municipal sewage.” Where was I? Oh, yeah, my rapidly disappearing inheritance. My inheritance — is there a more entitled phrase? It was my feeling for most of my life that anyone who counted on an inheritance was a moral and financial failure, that as an adult you are responsible for yourself. Those bumper stickers in Florida that read, “I’m spending my children’s inheritance?” My feeling was, “You go, Granny, and better make it snappy, because the way you drive, you don’t have long. My suggestion for living it up: Hire a driver.” I am good with money, my mother was great with money, and we rolled around in what we’d socked away like Scrooge McDuck and his fiscally conservative journalist niece, Joyce McDuck. Conversations about big expenses often ended with the same happy credo. Ma: “You know what they say, ‘Rich or poor, it’s good to have money.’ ” Me and Ma, together: “Muh-ney is huh-ney.” Have I mentioned what the bills are for my mother’s excellent nursing home? $16,895 a month. I write those checks and I see hundred dollar bills flapping off on big, Canada goose sized wings. Sometimes, I wave: Ta ta, summer estate. Excuse me, I have an urgent P.M. from my Better Self: As ever, you disgust me. This is our mother’s one precious life. That money you keep thinking about is to make it as good as it can be given the lousy medical deal she’s been dealt; to make sure there’s someone to get her to the garden on a beautiful day; to get her to art classes; to have someone run to her bed if she cries in the middle of the night. That’s your job: To be her advocate and protect her. I see sick, homeless women in the street who don’t even have a safe place to sleep let alone 24-hour medical care and devoted children — Oh, there’s a sale at the Eileen Fisher outlet. Can I get back to you? I’m hung up on this inheritance thing now, I think, only because I write the checks and see the funds evaporating. Before she got sick, I always encouraged my mother to spend more on herself. Then again, maybe I didn’t worry about an inheritance in the past because I knew I would have one. My mother had a Depression-era attitude about money; she was never going to spend what she could, no matter how much I nagged her. Look, Ma, I know you get a kick out of finding a place you can get a $12 haircut, but you can afford something nicer. Look, Ma, I know you never buy anything that has to be dry-cleaned, but I’m buying it for you and it’s a $180 skirt and you can’t throw a $180 skirt into the washing machine. So what if it will cost $7 to dry-clean it? Be a sport. My mother’s only indulgence — her passion, actually — was travel, and even there she insisted on flying tourist. When she was 88 I finally convinced her that for a 17-hour flight to Egypt a business ticket would not be throwing money away; she could sleep, she’d arrive rested. Three weeks before departure she collapsed in the kitchen of her Daytona Beach apartment with a brain bleed and lay there for five hours before anyone found her. Now she is in the nursing home with dementia, unable to walk, never acknowledging that she is unable to walk or perhaps not comprehending she cannot walk — I genuinely have no idea which. I bring her the newspaper travel section every Sunday when we have lunch and we discuss future trips: Cuba, Brazil, Mars. Whatever interests her, I say she can afford. Once in a while we even chant our jolly ode to capitalism, the one we’d be singing if two made a parade and we were marching off to the airport, a gay green flag with a dollar sign rippling before us: Rich or poor, it’s good to have money. Muh-ney is huh-ney. Then I go home and write the checks and think what a good daughter is never supposed to think: Farewell, my lovely inheritance.",The New York Times
2018,Farmers Hit the Road to Reach Shoppers Before Amazon Does,"EAST SMITHFIELD, Pa. — Huge retailers like Walmart, Amazon and Peapod are fighting for a piece of the online food delivery business. So is David Nowacoski, a chicken and pig farmer here in East Smithfield. Last month, Mr. Nowacoski started a service that delivers locally produced meats, cheeses and vegetables across three counties in northern Pennsylvania. His start-up collects food from far-flung farms and transports it weekly to residents who place their orders online. We recently spent the day with Mr. Nowacoski and his wife, Marla, traveling about 92 miles in the family minivan, picking up and dropping off food from three farms, one cheese room, one tavern and a bakery. Even in this rural patch of natural gas fields and deer hunting grounds, where the closest Whole Foods is more than 100 miles away, Amazon’s influence is deeply felt. Mr. Nowacoski says Amazon and other big retailers have conditioned consumers to expect a higher level of convenience. “This is where society is going, and we have to figure out how the small farm plays a role in it,” he says. A day on the road with the Nowacoskis shows how exhausting and costly e-commerce can be. The couple rise at dawn to feed the chickens, then battle icy roads, burning through gasoline — all to “build baskets” of items like cheese curds, lettuce and sourdough loaves for a relatively small number of families who are willing to pay for the service. Dressed in overalls and a purple sweatshirt, Mr. Nowacoski walks over to a shed that smells like diesel fuel, dirt and garlic. He mixes garlic powder into the chicken feed as a natural antibiotic. Mr. Nowacoski raises about 4,000 chickens a year for meat and an additional 600 hens for eggs. In warmer months, the birds live in fields, eating grass, herbs and insects. But on a morning like this — with the temperature around 18 degrees and a snowy mist making it feel even colder — the chickens are kept in a coop with a vaulted ceiling and walls made of clear plastic. Mr. Nowacoski walks among the birds, carrying a blue feed bucket in each hand. The hens flock to him, while the rooster hangs back, crowing with jealousy and alarm. “That bird hates me,” Mr. Nowacoski says. With the chickens fed, we walk down a winding dirt road to the pig pen. The sky has gone from light purple to blue-gray, and the snow has stopped. The pigs are still sleeping when we poke our heads into their hut, carpeted with hay. They lie side by side like a band of brothers — warm, plump and blissfully unaware that they have about three weeks left on earth. “Yeah, boys. Yeah, boys,” Mr. Nowacoski calls to them. Most of the 300-pound pigs are opting to sleep in, but a few amble out onto the snowy ground, grunting, snorting and looking for breakfast. Mr. Nowacoski rubs and scratches their haunches vigorously, sizing up their meat. Confirmed. Three weeks left. A pot of coffee brews in the kitchen, and bacon sizzles on the stove. Ms. Nowacoski stands at the counter organizing online orders on her tablet. There are two dozen orders this week, up from just two during their first week in business. The Nowacoskis grew up in East Smithfield, a town of about 200 residents 75 miles west of Scranton. Friends since high school, they got married and moved to Princeton, N.J., where Mr. Nowacoski worked for an employee benefits firm. In 1993, they returned to East Smithfield and bought 80 acres of rolling fields, maple groves and a swamp that they dug out into a lake stocked with catfish and largemouth bass. Like many farms in the area, the Nowacoskis’ land sits above the Marcellus Shale formation, a huge natural gas deposit. The couple lease some of their land to gas companies for hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. When gas prices were high, the Nowacoskis received enough money to send two of their three children to college without amassing debt. But as prices slumped, the infusion of wealth from the fracking boom all but evaporated. “Everyone thought they would be millionaires,” Mr. Nowacoski says. “Then it just stopped.” The gas money is vanishing while milk prices are also low, putting pressure on farms and the broader economy. The Nowacoskis hope their e-commerce business, Delivered Fresh, can help farmers find new markets for their milk, meat and produce. Every week, shoppers can log into the Delivered Fresh website and pick from a range of locally produced foods. The offerings will grow more bountiful as the weather turns warmer — carrots, beets, kale and potatoes. The Nowacoskis spend Wednesdays picking up food from as many as 20 farms — a loop that sometimes totals 300 miles. They make deliveries on Thursdays and Fridays. For now, most orders are dropped off at central locales like farm stands or church parking lots. Eventually, Mr. Nowacoski hopes to expand delivery directly to the homes of as many customers as he can. He buys the items from the farmers at a discount and charges a premium to customers, generating a 25 percent margin that pays for gas, the software he uses to process the orders and advertising. It’s not clear how many shoppers can afford “pasture raised” chicken breasts that cost $7.95 a pound in an area where household incomes are far below the national median. “People ask, ‘Why do you cost so much?’” Mr. Nowacoski says. “The better question is how are others like Walmart able to sell it so cheaply?” With the minivan loaded with three large coolers, the Nowacoskis pull out of their driveway and head west. The first stop is a small dairy farm about 35 minutes away in Roseville, to pick up cheese. To reach the farm, we climb a long, lonely hill that cuts through a snow-encrusted field. Near the top of the hill, we turn right and glide down a paved road that resembles a bobsled run. The cheese shop is at the bottom of the driveway, next to a barn. Amanda Kennedy is in her “cheese room,” wearing a white smock. She got up at 1:30 in the morning to start making the cheese. She milked the cows at 3 and helped her three children onto the bus at around 7. Ms. Kennedy, who was raised on a farm down the road, hopes that she can weather the turmoil in the dairy industry — which has been roiled by years of low milk prices — by finding a market for her specialty Cheddar and dill cheese curds. Most people are not going to make regular trips to a local farm for a block of cheese, Ms. Kennedy says. “The biggest thing I struggle with is getting the cheese into the customer’s hands,” she says. Ms. Nowacoski packs the curds into a cooler and leaves Ms. Kennedy a check for $24, and we are back on the road. After dropping off chicken thighs at a tavern along the way, the Nowacoskis drive to Milky Way Farms in Troy, Pa., to pick up bottles of milk for the week’s online orders. The lunch menu at the Milky Way restaurant features broccoli salad, vegetable beef soup, lemon pineapple cake and gluten-free bread. The hamburgers are made from beef raised at a farm next door. We arrive at the restaurant, two weeks before it closes for good. The couple who own it, Ann and Kim Seeley, decided to shut down the family business after 55 years. “It is the middle of lunch time,” Ms. Seeley says, taking our order. “And there is nobody here.” Tourist traffic to the area has dropped, her husband says, and most people no longer take time to sit down for lunch. Even as the restaurant fades, Mr. Seeley will keep running a store at the farm that sells his chocolate milk, ice cream and egg nog. He’s counting on online deliveries to extend his reach farther. “We have high hopes,” he says. Fred McNeal, another farmer, joins us for lunch. He runs a farm market in Towanda, Pa., called Farmer Fred’s that sells everything from lawn furniture to turkey bone broth and garden seeds. Mr. McNeal says he never worried about competition from Amazon until the company bought Whole Foods last June. He is convinced that Amazon will find a way to deliver fresh food locally, eating into the market for local goods. “We see this coming,” Mr. McNeal says. “We have to figure out how to give customers what they want or we are going to be another story about a business that didn’t adapt.” After lunch, the Nowacoskis return to their farm to pick up heads of lettuce and then drive to a bakery, minutes before it closes at 4:30 p.m. The couple have been on the road for more than six hours. They will visit more farms the next day.",The New York Times
2018,Farmers’ Anger at Trump Tariffs Puts Republican Candidates in a Bind,"WASHINGTON — As President Trump moves to fulfill one of the central promises of his campaign — to get tough on an ascendant China — he faces a potential rebellion from a core constituency: farmers and other agricultural producers who could suffer devastating losses in a trade war. Mr. Trump’s threat to impose tariffs on Chinese goods came with a presidential declaration that trade wars are good and easily won. But the action has injected damaging uncertainty into the economy as Republicans are already struggling to maintain their hold on the House and the Senate in a difficult election year. While the battle for control of the House will be waged in large part in the suburbs, rural districts in Southern Illinois, Iowa, Arkansas and Missouri could prove important. And control of the Senate could come down to Republican efforts to unseat Democrats in North Dakota, Indiana, Missouri and Montana — all states staring down the barrels of a trade war’s guns. With farmers angry and worried as China vows to retaliate, many Republicans find themselves torn between loyalty to a president who remains broadly popular in rural states and the demands of constituents, especially farmers, to oppose his tariffs. In North Dakota, a major soybean-producing state, Representative Kevin Cramer, a Republican who is running for the Senate, sounded restrained this past week when he urged Mr. Trump to “take a more measured approach” to China. By Friday, he sounded panicked. “I contacted @SecretarySonny to urge him to use every tool in the Farm Bill, including Commodity Credit Corp programs, to protect ag producers from effects resulting in potential trade actions against China,” he wrote on Twitter, referring to Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue. “Farmers must know the Admin has their back & I urge them to act swiftly.” China’s aggressive response to Mr. Trump’s tariffs is aimed squarely at products produced in the American heartland, a region that helped send him to the White House. A trade war with China could be particularly devastating to rural economies, especially for pig farmers and soybean and corn growers. Nearly two-thirds of United States soybean exports go to China. The tariffs have not yet gone into effect, and the administration is engaging in back-channel talks with the Chinese to try to resolve their differences. In the meantime, Mr. Trump has been escalating his threats, and shows no sign of backing off. On Thursday night, he threatened to impose tariffs on an additional $100 billion in Chinese products. Trump administration officials argue that the tariffs on Chinese goods, while not intended to help certain American industries, are necessary to prevent China from continuing to violate international trade rules. They say that less aggressive measures by past administrations failed, and that China has stolen American jobs and technology that are the key to future prosperity. “It’s not possible to have true gain without the pain,” said Dan DiMicco, a trade adviser to Mr. Trump during the presidential campaign. “The battle is worth the victory, and we will win.” But farm-state Republicans like Mr. Cramer believe that their constituents could be a casualty, and they are begging the Department of Agriculture to intervene. Mr. Trump has directed the department to implement a plan to help farmers cope with the damage from tariffs. But few details have been forthcoming about how such a program would work or how much it might cost. And it is not clear how much the Agriculture Department could do to remedy the damage done to key trading relations in a global economy. The secretary of agriculture has some authority to help farmers by creating new programs that could draw on funds from the Treasury. For instance, the secretary could direct the Commodity Credit Corporation, a government-owned entity, to purchase soybeans to buoy farmers’ revenues, said Kent Conrad, a former Democratic senator from North Dakota. In the past, these powers have been used to provide relief from wildfires and other natural disasters, farm groups said. But such a program could be time-consuming and costly. “All of that has serious consequences,” Mr. Conrad said. “It has costs to the government at a time when the deficits and debt have already soared, and we are going to have a trillion-dollar deficit.” The federal budget deficit, despite the strong economy, reached $598 billion for the first half of the current fiscal year, the Congressional Budget Office said on Friday, $71 billion more than was recorded during the same period last year. If the White House does end up subsidizing farmers, that may open trade conflicts on other fronts. Chad P. Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said that such a measure could spark trade challenges from countries beyond China, which would object to unfair competition from American agriculture. Patrick Delaney, a spokesman for the American Soybean Association, said his group was still focused on trying to prevent the tariffs from going into effect, rather than examining what kind of measures the administration might take to support farmers. “It’s a whole lot easier not to wreck the car in the first place than it is to think about what a repair might look like,” he said. Farmers have been among the most organized groups in lobbying the administration about its trade policy. But as trade tensions with China have escalated, farmers say these complaints appear to be falling on deaf ears. Many of them are now complaining to Congress. For Republicans like Mr. Cramer, who is in a tough race against an incumbent Democrat, Senator Heidi Heitkamp, the president’s threat to sharply escalate the administration’s tariffs on Chinese imports — and China’s threat to retaliate against American farm products — spells trouble in this year’s midterm races. Mr. Cramer’s aides did not respond to requests for comment. “There’s no question that it puts Republicans in a tough spot, because they’ve got to talk to their farmers and affected business owners about the negative impact of the tariff, which I’m sure they are hearing complaints about,” said Scott Jennings, a Republican strategist in Kentucky. “On the other hand, they’ve got constituents who probably think it’s a good idea for the president to stand up to China.” A number of Republicans are pushing back against the president. In Iowa, Representative David Young, who represents a district that Mr. Trump carried by just four percentage points, has publicly urged Mr. Trump to negotiate before imposing tariffs. His state is a major producer of soybean, grain and pork products, and farmers there are already seeing prices drop. “I respect the president and what he’s trying to do — trying to level the playing field, trying to get those trade deficits down — but it always comes at the cost of agriculture,” Mr. Young said in an interview with NPR. “And can we start just by sitting down at the table?” Iowa’s senators — Joni Ernst and Charles E. Grassley, both Republicans — have called on Mr. Trump to reconsider. In a statement, Ms. Ernst cited the “real danger that increased tariffs on U.S. exports will harm Iowa producers and undermine the rural economy,” and she said she had spoken directly with the president about it. The clash with China began last month, when Mr. Trump imposed tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum, fulfilling a central promise of his campaign. China responded with tariffs on $3 billion worth of American products, including pork, fruit and other items. Then, in late March, the president announced plans to impose tariffs on $50 billion worth of goods from China. Once again, China retaliated; this past week, it proposed its own tariff measure on $50 billion in American products, which, in turn, goaded Mr. Trump to propose the additional tariffs on Thursday night. It remains to be seen if China will answer Mr. Trump’s latest tariff threat with an escalation of its own. In addition to soybean farmers, carmakers and Boeing would be hit hard by China’s tariffs. Many American companies purchase products from Chinese factories, while others rely on the country’s vast consumer market to sell their goods. The trade spat with China also comes on the heels of Mr. Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade accord that was to rope in countries on both sides of the Pacific in an alliance against a rising Beijing. The administration is also renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement. Both were valuable deals for American farmers, and Mr. Trump’s move to upend them had already set agricultural producers on edge. Suffering has come quickly for the sector on the stock market. Investors dumped stocks linked to agriculture on Friday. Deere & Company and the fertilizer giant Mosaic dropped nearly 4 percent, while the fertilizer maker CF Industries fell by 4.5 percent. While some farmers and lawmakers have expressed hope that Mr. Trump’s threats are merely a negotiating tactic, administration officials insisted this past week that was not the case. “There is the potential of a trade war,” Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said in an interview with CNBC. “There is a level of risk that we could get into a trade war.” Mr. Mnuchin said he was hopeful that talks with his Chinese counterparts could avert a damaging escalation of tit-for-tat tariffs, but he declined to elaborate on the status of talks and whether he thought an agreement could be reached. The president’s new economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, said Mr. Trump’s threat to China was not a bluff. “Trump is not just using tariffs as a negotiating card. He said that to me,” Mr. Kudlow told reporters on Friday. But the White House strategy to press China to reform its economic behavior seemed unclear. Mr. Kudlow said that the administration was holding back-channel talks with the Chinese, but that he would not characterize them as negotiations. He added that the United States was considering providing China with a list of the changes the United States would like to see, but that it had not yet done so. “I cannot guarantee that, but it’s something that is under discussion,” Mr. Kudlow said.",The New York Times
2018,Farmland Birds in France Are in Steep Decline,"Trilobites Birds in farming regions of France are in trouble, and that may indicate problems in similar areas across Europe. Scientists involved in long-running regional and national bird-counting surveys in France have reported precipitous declines in agricultural regions, even among common birds well adapted to human activity — the generalists, like blackbirds, that seem to do well in most circumstances. This finding follows news of a devastating loss of insects in Germany, a decline of nearly 80 percent over the last 40 years. The drop is thought to be occurring throughout Europe. The loss of birds has been going on for a long time. And in a sense it is no surprise that birds — as well as amphibians, reptiles and mammals — face population declines around the world because of habitat loss and other problems. But the most recent results from two surveys — one nationwide in France, the other limited to one region — caused scientists to sound an alarm, because the results suggest that agricultural methods are hurting birds, according to Benoit Fontaine, a conservation biologist at the National Museum of Natural History in Paris and a leader of the national survey, conducted twice a year by volunteers. “In the agricultural land,” he said, “there is something really bad going on.” Over the past 17 years, the numbers of birds in farming areas have dropped by a third. Some of the species have declined even more: Meadow pipit populations, for example, fell by 68 percent. Dr. Fontaine described the situation as “catastrophic.” He suspects that pesticides used in agriculture and intensification of land use are linked to the decline, although neither survey comes to conclusions about causes or makes any policy recommendations. But he pointed to the loss of insects, the major food source for many birds, as a likely result of pesticide use. Vincent Bretagnolle, an ecologist at the Centre for Biological Studies Chizé, led the other survey, which has been conducted by scientists in the Deux-Sevres region in the western part of the country for 24 years. “Our results are completely in agreement with national and European surveys,” he said. The trend is long-term, he said, except that recently, particularly at the national level, the dip has been steeper, and the more generalist bird species have been affected as they weren’t in the past. Dr. Bretagnolle also suspected pesticides and more intensive use of land by farmers as a culprit, and said farmers in the area he surveys are trying different methods aimed at saving some species. Worldwide, birds, like other wildlife, face a variety of threats. And not all species are in trouble. A report two years ago said that the problems for about a third of North American birds were urgent. Some migratory birds, like the spoon-billed sandpiper in Asia, are down to perhaps fewer than 250 breeding pairs. And yet some migratory species, like snow geese in North America, are booming, to the detriment of their Arctic breeding grounds. Farmland birds aren’t the only ones are in trouble in Europe. Another recent analysis of a number of studies showed that in northeastern Europe, birds were in a general decline, both residents and migrants. Four species were in the worst trouble: the ortolan bunting, the ruff, the golden oriole and the greenfinch. Dr. Fontaine said, “There are solutions.” For one thing, he said “We have to change completely the way we do agriculture.” He recommended ways to reduce pesticides and leave more land uncultivated and undeveloped.",The New York Times

2018,Fear and Hope in South Korea on Eve of Summit With Kim Jong-un,"SEOUL, South Korea — As South Koreans prepare for their president to meet Kim Jong-un on Friday, many are left scratching their heads about the motives of a North Korean leader who has abruptly pivoted from threats of nuclear annihilation to offering warm peace overtures. Many older South Koreans feel they have seen this before: a member of the Kim dynasty gets rewarded for coming to the bargaining table, the talks sputter, and the North goes back to its old ways. But this time, the North’s 34-year-old leader comes equipped with a fearsome nuclear stockpile as he walks into the summit meeting with the South’s president, Moon Jae-in. “The North Koreans are cheating again, putting up this show so they can buy time and ease sanctions, never intending to abandon their nuclear weapons,” said Kim Chang-guk, 73, who joined other older citizens in downtown Seoul on a recent weekend to protest the inter-Korean summit meeting. “I would rather believe a woman who has given birth to a baby and still insists that she is a virgin than Kim Jong-un.” The peace overtures come after Mr. Kim kept the Korean Peninsula on the edge last year, testing missiles and what he said was a hydrogen bomb. He claimed to have a “nuclear button” on his desk that could launch missiles that could hit anywhere in the mainland United States. [Read more about the “nuclear button.” For starters, there’s no button.] But in recent months Mr. Kim has turned on a charm offensive as breathtaking as his bellicosity last year. He capped weeks of diplomacy with Saturday’s announcement of an end to nuclear and long-range missile tests and the shutting down of a nuclear test site, saying he would now focus on rebuilding the economy. And he earlier told American and South Korean envoys that his country was willing to give up nuclear arms if it received the right incentives. Choi Hae-jong, 55, who runs a gas station in the provincial city of Ulsan, said he believed that Kim Jong-un would indeed bargain away his nuclear weapons if given the aid and security guarantees that he needed to rebuild the economy. “He knows he can’t feed his people with nuclear weapons and tanks,” Mr. Choi said. With Friday’s meeting, Mr. Kim will become the first North Korean leader to cross the inter-Korean border, sitting down with Mr. Moon on the South Korean side of Panmunjom, a “truce village” straddling the border. President Trump plans to meet Mr. Moon weeks later at a time and place still to be determined. The flurry of diplomacy has left South Koreans guessing at Mr. Kim’s intentions and debating the wisdom of negotiating with him — and wondering what lies in store for the future of the Korean Peninsula. For generations, it has been an article of faith among South Koreans that they should eventually reconcile and reunify with the North. But after seven decades of division, the capitalist South and the totalitarian North have drifted so far apart that the yearning for reunification is not what it used to be, especially among young South Koreans. “Unlike those in their 60s and older, who still shared a sense of national identity with the North Koreans, many in their 20s merely perceived North Korea as an ‘enemy’ or a ‘stranger,’” said a study published last week by Kim Ji-yoon, Kim Kil-dong and Kang Chung-ku for the Asan Institute for Policy Studies, based in Seoul. “Many in their 20s were indifferent to unification and did not view it as an urgent matter.” Mr. Kim’s recent behavior has led to some paradoxical findings in public opinion surveys. One poll last month showed that more than 81 percent of South Koreans supported holding a summit meeting with Mr. Kim. But another survey this month showed that more than 70 percent doubted that Mr. Kim would give up his most dangerous weapons. [Read our profile of Kim Jong-un, a moody young man with a nuclear arsenal.] “When dealing with North Korea, there is always this nagging feeling that they may stab us in the back again,” said Choi Hae-pyeong, 55, a businessman from south of Seoul. In 1991, the two Koreas signed a nonaggression agreement. In 1992, they jointly vowed not to seek nuclear weapons. After an inter-Korean summit meeting in 2000, South Korea shipped billions of dollars’ worth of aid and investment, but the North still went on to develop a nuclear arsenal, inviting a conservative backlash in the South. Indeed, many older conservatives fear that North Korea has developed its nuclear weapons to drive American troops from the South and reunify the peninsula under its rule. But others see the North’s nuclear program as rooted in the Kim dynasty’s insecurity following the collapse of the Soviet bloc, which left North Korea more vulnerable and isolated in its standoff against the United States. And a peace deal could be one way out of that predicament. “The North Korean nuclear and missile problem is a byproduct of hostile relations between the United States and North Korea,” said Lim Dong-won, a former unification minister and intelligence chief of South Korea. “It can be resolved only in the context of ending the Cold War enmity and establishing peace on the peninsula, through a comprehensive deal of formally ending the Korean War and normalizing ties.” Progressive South Koreans like Mr. Moon argue that the only realistic and peaceful way of removing the North’s nuclear weapons is to persuade the government that it can survive without them. While conservatives prioritize the alliance with Washington, the progressives like to see their country as finally “in the driver’s seat” in managing the precarious situation on the peninsula. “We are at the crossroads where it will be decided whether denuclearization and permanent peace is possible by peaceful — not by military — means,” Mr. Moon said on Monday. But Mr. Moon acknowledged that the nuclear crisis could ultimately only be resolved between North Korea and the United States. The best he can do, he says, is to serve as a “guide” to help Mr. Kim and Mr. Trump reach a “comprehensive” deal to trade the North’s nuclear weapons for security guarantees from Washington, such as a peace treaty to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War. [Read what it might mean for the Koreas to finally reach an official peace.] Some conservatives, having been burned before, remain deeply skeptical of that approach. “The current government turned the table, claiming to be ‘a driver’ just when the North began feeling the pain of sanctions,” Lee Bong-bok, a well-known right-wing expert on North Korea, told the conservative daily Chosun Ilbo. Mr. Trump has threatened to walk out of his planned meeting with Mr. Kim if he refused to denuclearize. Should that happen, South Koreans fear, calls for military action in Washington, and the risk of war in Korea, could grow greater than ever. Last year, South Koreans fretted as they watched Mr. Trump threaten to “totally destroy” North Korea; Mr. Kim, in turn, called him a senile “dotard.” But many now hope that Mr. Kim’s daring style and Mr. Trump’s unpredictability combine to offer the chance to break the decades-old nuclear stalemate in Korea. Mr. Trump is the first American leader to agree to sit down with a North Korean leader. “When I said I supported President Trump’s election because it would be a great opportunity for us, people called me crazy,” said Mr. Lim, who leads a panel of senior nongovernmental advisers to Mr. Moon. “No matter what people say about him, here is an American leader who wants to overturn the status quo.” Mr. Kim himself has been overturning some of the conventional wisdom about North Korea. His pledge to stop conducting nuclear and missile tests is the kind of concession that would have taken Washington years of haggling to extract from the North in the past — and only with promises of aid. Mr. Kim announced it Saturday without any conditions attached. Park Sang-min, 39, a marketing official in Seoul, said he sees in the North Korean leader “a confidence and eagerness to negotiate.” “He has completed his nuclear weapons and long-range missiles so that the Americans would have no option but to take him seriously and pay the prices he wanted,” he said. An earlier version of this article misidentified a Seoul-based research center. It is the Asan Institute for Policy Studies, not the Asian Institute for Policy Studies.",The New York Times
2018,"Fearing Chaos, National Democrats Plunge Into Midterm Primary Fights","FULLERTON, Calif. — The Democrats’ message to Mai Khanh Tran was polite but unsparing. With half a dozen Democrats running for Congress in her Orange County district, they showed her a discouraging poll and argued that she could not win — and risked fracturing the party in the June primary election. Ms. Tran pointedly replied that she was “the only qualified woman, the only immigrant and the only physician in the race.” “I said to them, frankly, let the voters decide,” recalled Ms. Tran, a pediatrician. The national Democratic Party was not chastened: On Wednesday, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee took sides in that House race and backed Gil Cisneros, a Navy veteran and former Republican. With their forceful intervention in Orange County, national Democrats have lunged into an impatient new phase of the 2018 primary season — one in which they are clashing more openly with candidates and local political chieftains in their drive to assemble a slate of recruits for the midterms. In districts from Southern California to Little Rock, Ark., and upstate New York, the party has begun interceding to help the Democrats it sees as best equipped to battle Republicans in the fall. The approach is laced with peril for a party divided over matters of ideology and political strategy, and increasingly dominated by activists who tend to resent what they see as meddling from Washington. A Democratic effort to undercut a liberal insurgent in a Houston-area congressional primary in March stirred an outcry on the left and may have inadvertently helped drive support to that candidate, Laura Moser, who qualified for the runoff election next month. But in some areas, Democratic leaders have concluded it is worth enduring backlash to help a prized recruit or tame a chaotic primary field. They are moving most aggressively in California, where the state’s nonpartisan primaries present a unique hazard: State law requires all candidates to compete in the same preliminary election, with the top two finishers advancing to November. In a crowded field, if Democrats spread their votes across too many candidates, two Republicans could come out on top and advance together to the general election. There are at least four races in California where Democrats fear such a lockout, including the 39th Congressional District, where in addition to Mr. Cisneros and Ms. Tran there are two other Democrats running: Sam Jammal, a youthful former congressional aide, and Andy Thorburn, a wealthy health insurance executive who is backed by allies of Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont. The district is among the most coveted for Democrats nationwide — a seat left open by the retirement of Representative Ed Royce, a popular Republican, in an area Hillary Clinton won by about 8 percentage points. National Democrats may also intervene in the Southern California districts held by Representatives Dana Rohrabacher and Jeff Denham, where multiple Republicans and Democrats are running, and in the seat held by Representative Darrell Issa, a Republican who is retiring. Voters receive mail-in ballots starting in early May, making the next few weeks exceptionally important. House Majority PAC, a heavily financed Democratic group that spends millions in congressional elections, recently polled all four races and has been conducting digital surveys that simulate the complicated California ballot, according to people briefed on the group’s strategy. The super PAC has run ads in California in the past when Democrats have faced disaster in primary season. Representative Judy Chu, a Los Angeles-area Democrat, said the open primaries had led Democrats to take unusual steps to prevent Republicans from dominating the first round of voting. “That would stop our goal of taking the House back,” Ms. Chu said. “We have to have a viable candidate, and I think that if it does turn out to be a Democrat versus a Republican, the Democrat will win.” Ms. Chu said the campaign committee’s endorsement of Mr. Cisneros was a signal to donors and volunteers that it was time to close ranks. But picking favorites is not easy for Democrats: Until mid-March, Southern California lawmakers were divided in the 39th District race between Mr. Cisneros, who is backed by Representative Linda T. Sánchez, an influential member of the Democratic leadership team, and Jay Chen, another Democrat who was endorsed by Ms. Chu. It was only after Mr. Chen opted against running, with a call for party unity, that Ms. Chu and other Democrats swung behind Mr. Cisneros. Ms. Sánchez said the glut of Democratic candidates remained concerning across California, and acknowledged having lobbied the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee to back Mr. Cisneros. National leaders, Ms. Sánchez said, had “a role to play in terms of trying to talk to nonviable candidates and urging them to be team players.” Meredith Kelly, a spokeswoman for the committee, said the group was taking action in California because voters “deserve to have a Democrat on the ballot in November.” “Any decision to get involved in these races is toward that goal and based on intelligence from the ground in California, extensive data and partnerships with as many local allies as possible,” Ms. Kelly said. In the 39th District, Democrats went beyond prodding underdogs like Ms. Tran, 52, to stand down. Mr. Thorburn said the D.C.C.C. presented him with polling that suggested attacks on his finances and business record would be damaging in the general election — data Mr. Thorburn dismissed out of hand. He said the committee clearly indicated its preference for Mr. Cisneros. Mr. Thorburn, 74, is now the most unsettling rival for Mr. Cisneros and national Democrats, pairing a pointed ideological message with a personal fortune to spend on advertising. Deriding Mr. Cisneros as a “wishy-washy” newcomer to the party, Mr. Thorburn said he would strike back hard if the committee were to attack him, as it did Ms. Moser. “I’m much more of a fighter than the national party,” Mr. Thorburn said, warning: “If they do something like they did in Texas, we would come back guns blazing.” Mr. Cisneros has won over important state groups, including the muscular California Labor Federation. But his campaign office, at a strip mall in Brea, about 30 miles southeast of Los Angeles, showcases his national allies: One wall boasts an enormous sign from the gun-control group Giffords, which supports him, while another displays photographs of Mr. Cisneros with Barack and Michelle Obama. Mr. Cisneros, a soft-spoken 47-year-old who became a philanthropist and Democratic donor after winning the California lottery in 2010, said his unlikely biography was at the core of his message, along with issues like gun violence and health care. He said his views on those subjects had been consistent, though his party registration had changed. “From the beginning,” Mr. Cisneros said, “it’s always been about getting my story out.” Interviews with voters in the Republican-held district revealed why the race is so promising and tumultuous for Democrats. A labyrinth of highways and shopping centers and residential developments, the district has shifted in recent years as its Latino and Asian-American communities have grown. But a dozen voters there said they were not following the race or remained undecided. At a shopping mall in Fullerton, a hospital worker named Lynn — who declined to give her surname because she did not want to be identified at work — said she wanted to repudiate Republicans but had not picked an alternative. An Asian-American woman in her 40s, she said she was alarmed by President Trump’s environmental policies and what she described as an outpouring of overt bigotry. “It’s not because I want a Democrat — I just don’t want a Republican,” she said. “Ever since you-know-who became president, people are really racist and it’s really, really obvious.” Some voters sounded unlikely to take their cues from national parties. Outside a Fullerton coffee shop where Mr. Jammal was greeting voters, Adam De Leon said he was suspicious of the candidates using personal wealth to sway the race. Mr. De Leon, 72, said he favored Mr. Jammal, 36, because of his government experience. “What does it tell you when people spend millions of dollars to get into a position that pays maybe $140,000 a year?” Mr. De Leon said, somewhat underestimating the $174,000 congressional salary. “It’s all about power and connections.” The Republican field is in flux, too. Young Kim, a longtime aide to Mr. Royce, is the front-runner but has several candidates challenging her from the right. With Republicans in Washington focused on defending beleaguered incumbents, they have been less intent than Democrats on shaping open primaries. For Democrats, that project extends beyond California: On the same day the D.C.C.C. endorsed Mr. Cisneros, it also boosted candidates in New York and Arkansas who face contested primaries. In New York, the committee enlisted Juanita Perez Williams, a former candidate for mayor of Syracuse, to challenge Representative John Katko this month, though a lower-profile Democrat was already running with the support of local party leaders. That kind of big-footing may be trickier in California. Mr. Chen, the Democrat who opted out of the 39th District race, said the party still faces a “precarious situation” there. He said he had decided against running after conducting a poll that showed him neck and neck with Mr. Cisneros and Mr. Thorburn — but with Democratic voters fragmented enough to create an all-Republican general election. He predicted none of the remaining Democrats would follow his lead and get out. “If you’ve never been involved in the party before and you just ran because you want to run, then you don’t really have those considerations,” Mr. Chen said. “They are new to this. They don’t have bridges to burn.”",The New York Times
2018,"Fearing Death, and Photographing the Rituals That Surround It","LENS The question of what awaits after death has obsessed humanity for millennia. The Korean photographer Chanho Park’s fixation took root when he was 11 and his mother, who suffered from pancreatic cancer, was hospitalized. Much of his time was spent at her side, where he heard the anguished screams of the dying and their mourning families and saw the beds of gaunt patients become empty from one day to the next. “I began to feel more afraid of the pain and screams that they were experiencing than the death itself,” Mr. Park said. After his mother died, he was adrift and bereft. Discord with his father led him to run away from home when he was 14. By his late 30s, he fell into depression, which he sought to ease by taking pictures. Without meaning to, he found himself drawn to burial plots, ritual sites, and places of prayer — synonymous with marking the end of life or remembering those who died. While sorting through his photos, he was struck by a commonality: the image of mothers praying. “To the tree, to the stone, to the sea, to the stone Buddha, and to the tombstone,” said Mr. Park, explaining that however they prayed, the women had the same wish: that their children were happy. The revelation was so powerful, he said, that it unleashed decades of pent-up pain and yearning for his mother. Afterward, he felt completely healed. But a new burden took its place — the understanding that his own death would bring a similar pain to his wife and children. “When we recover from the trauma from the deaths of our parents, we face the reality of our own deaths,” Mr. Park said. “Perhaps we live a trauma of death for an entire life.” To overcome that fear, he needed to better understand it. He considered that the Korean word for “death” also connotes “rebirth.” And he knew that a similar concept — reincarnation — was a tenet of Buddhism and that monks who practice asceticism to attain “buddhahood” have shed their fear of dying. Mr. Park set out to capture the elements and rituals of traditional Korean funerals, as well as Confucian and Buddhist rites, in a series he calls “The Returned.” It was important to put the “emotion” and the “enlightenment” of each experience into the frame. “I hope to search for and think about the meaning of death through the acts on death, acts of remembering death, and the record of those acts,” Mr. Park said. Since most of what he sought to photograph involved rituals held on sacred ground and sometimes hidden from the outside world, it took time to find and gain access. As an outsider, Mr. Park needed to talk with the “gatekeepers,” people who confided heartbreaking, personal life experiences. “Their sad stories remained and accumulated in my heart,” said Mr. Park. “Listening to them and photographing them all became too painful.” He became so overwhelmed at one point, that he was hospitalized and put down his camera for a bit. When Mr. Park resumed the work, he confronted a new question: “How can we exist forever?” He believes the answer to that is simply: memory. “We exist as a memory in others’ mind,” he explained. “’How are we going to be remembered?’ It is the same question as: ‘How should we live the rest of our lives?’ Serious thoughts on death could turn the human life from greed and selfishness to respect and sincerity, from worshiping gold to pursuing reason.” Mr. Park has found solace from the small insights his work has revealed — and from the camera’s therapeutic power. “I believe that photography has some healing power,” said Mr. Park. “Photography helps us to face the trauma. If one can face his own trauma through my works, I think it can help to heal and cure the trauma.” Follow @nytimesphoto on Twitter.

2018,"Fed Officials Have Concerns About Trade, March Meeting Minutes Show","WASHINGTON — Federal Reserve Board policymakers raised concerns at their March meeting about the prospect of the United States heading into a global trade war, zeroing in on potential harm to American farmers such a clash would cause, according to minutes of the meeting released by the Fed on Wednesday. The officials also expressed uncertainty about how newly enacted tax cuts would affect the economy, partly because the cuts are expected to exacerbate the swelling of federal budget deficits, and because some of the cuts are to expire in the years ahead. Policymakers also expressed unanimous, increased confidence in the strength of the country’s economic recovery, even accounting for trade and tax uncertainties. The minutes of the meeting, on March 20 and 21, provide more detail into the concerns being raised by the farm industry about the potential domestic impact of President Trump’s plan to impose a 25 percent tariff on imported steel and 10 percent on aluminum. “Participants did not see the steel and aluminum tariffs, by themselves, as likely to have a significant effect on the national economic outlook,” the minutes read, “but a strong majority of participants viewed the prospect of retaliatory trade actions by other countries, as well as other issues and uncertainties associated with trade policies, as downside risks for the U.S. economy. Contacts in the agricultural sector reported feeling particularly vulnerable to retaliation.” Fed policymakers also said at the meeting that they expected the combination of the tax cuts signed by Mr. Trump last year and a bipartisan congressional deal this year to increase federal spending to give economic output “a significant boost” in the next few years. However, the minutes reflect officials’ uncertainty about how big that boost might be, and when it might come, because there is little historical precedent for such fiscal stimulus when unemployment is so low. The minutes also show that policymakers “suggested that uncertainty about whether all elements of the tax cuts would be made permanent, or about the implications of higher budget deficits for fiscal sustainability and real interest rates, represented sources of downside risk to the economic outlook.” The meeting was the first under the Fed’s new chairman, Jerome H. Powell. At the session’s conclusion, officials announced that they would raise interest rates for the sixth time since the end of the Great Recession, in the range of 1.5 to 1.75 percent. Officials released economic projections indicating that they expected to raise rates three times next year, more than the two increases in 2019 that they had forecast in December. The Fed said at the time the economy was continuing to get stronger and that the central bank remained on track to keep raising rates gradually. Mr. Powell echoed those sentiments at a news conference after the meeting. The minutes suggest that decision on interest rates generated little controversy: “All participants agreed that the outlook for the economy beyond the current quarter had strengthened in recent months,” and that they expected the annual inflation rate to rise in the months to come. But the minutes say that a “couple of participants” suggested the Fed would benefit from holding off until a future meeting to raise rates, in order to wait for more data to confirm evidence that the rate of inflation was approaching the Fed’s target of 2 percent annual growth. Officials also debated the benefits of the economy’s running hot — with unemployment very low and growth above forecast trends — for a prolonged period of time, weighing the potential for drawing more workers back to the labor force against the risk of financial instability and “significant” inflation growth. Officials seemed to shrug off the increase in stock market volatility in February, attributing it in part to Labor Department reports that the suggested growth in wages — and, with it, inflation — was gaining steam, which could force the Fed to raise rates faster than expected. “Many participants reported that their contacts had taken the previous month’s turbulence in stride,” the minutes read. The official statement released immediately after the March meeting did not mention trade policy concerns, which roiled financial markets after the Trump administration announced its plans to impose tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, as well as on some other Chinese goods. Mr. Powell acknowledged those concerns at his news conference, saying that trade policy had begun to worry business leaders who speak with Fed officials. Still, he played down any immediate threat to growth. “There’s no thought that changes in trade policy should have an effect on the current outlook,” Mr. Powell said at the news conference, adding that could change if a global trade dispute escalated. In a speech in Chicago last week, Mr. Powell elaborated on the Federal Open Market Committee’s concerns during a question-and-answer session. “The discussion about tariffs is at a relatively early stage, and we talked about this at the F.O.M.C. meeting a couple of weeks ago now,” he said. “And people really don’t see yet any implications in the near term for the outlook, because we don’t know the extent to which the tariffs will actually come into effect and, if so, how big will that effect be and what will the timing of it be.” Any negative effects from tariffs could put the Fed in a bind, forcing policymakers to break what Mr. Powell and his predecessors have repeatedly characterized as a delicate balance between supporting economic growth and job creation, and holding inflation to the target growth rate. Economists generally view tariff fallout as stagflationary, meaning it hurts growth and also feeds inflation. Taxes on imported goods raise prices for businesses and consumers, pushing up the inflation rate, while also dampening consumption and economic growth. The minutes suggest that Fed officials are worrying more about that possibility than they have acknowledged publicly: “Most participants also cited trade policy as a source of either uncertainty or downside risk,” the minutes say.",The New York Times
2018,Fed Officials Worry the Economy Is Too Good. Workers Still Feel Left Behind.,"WASHINGTON — Ann Jacks quit her job as a restaurant chef in North Carolina, started her own business and worked 80 hours a week for two years, before exhausting herself and her patience. She shut down the company and, in November, returned to her old job. It paid a dollar an hour more than it did when she left it. Ms. Jacks, who now earns $22,000 a year and said she couldn’t afford her health insurance deductible, is one of many Americans still waiting to feel the effects of an improving economy nearly a decade after the Great Recession. “I don’t see evidence of the wages getting higher, except for specific types of jobs, like management, banking,” she said. “My attorney friends aren’t hurting.” Yet Federal Reserve officials are beginning to worry about a possibility that seems remote to workers who still feel left behind: the danger of the economy’s running too hot, destabilizing financial markets and setting off a rapid escalation in wages and prices that could force the central bank to slam the brakes on growth. Officials at the Fed have in the last few weeks escalated a public and private debate over how close the economy is to “overheating,” a condition when abnormally low unemployment can trigger spikes in inflation and destabilize financial markets. The Commerce Department will report its first estimate of first-quarter growth on Friday, and economists expect it will register around 2 percent, short of the 3 percent that President Trump has promised will deliver large wage increases to workers across the board. Forecasters expect growth to accelerate later this year, though. Those predictions, along with a recent uptick in the inflation rate, are prompting some Fed officials to push the bank to raise interest rates at a faster pace than it has been, in order to reduce the risk of overheating. Fed officials have raised their benchmark rate to a range of 1.5 to 1.75 percent in a series of carefully orchestrated increases. Their most recent economic projections suggest they expect to raise rates two more times this year and three times next year. While officials worried about overheating are pushing a faster pace of increases, other officials say it’s way too early to turn down the heat on the economy — and on workers who are still waiting for big wage increases to show up. Both camps say they are concerned for workers like Ms. Jacks. “When we think about the economy from the aspect of monetary policy, we can’t get it right for everybody,” Eric Rosengren, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, said in an interview last week. “We can get it right for the overall economy.” Mr. Rosengren is among those pushing for the Fed to raise interest rates more quickly than some of his colleagues would prefer, in part because he fears a situation in which rapid inflation forces the bank to raise rates drastically, tipping the economy back into recession. In that case, he said, “the people who feel already like they’re not keeping up with the rest of the economy would probably be the first ones laid off in an economic slowdown.” Other Fed officials want to let the economy run hotter, longer, contending that economic data suggests today’s low unemployment rates are not necessarily harbingers of high inflation. Charles Evans, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, warned in a speech this month that Fed officials should not assume that just because low unemployment spurred double-digit inflation in the 1970s and ’80s the same situation would occur today. He suggested that structural changes in the economy, such as a disconnect between the areas where job openings are and where prospective employees live, and the reluctance of workers to move to chase those openings, could be distorting the labor market. “While it is incumbent upon policymakers not to forget the painful lessons of the 1970s and 1980s, we are living under different circumstances today,” Mr. Evans said. “I think we have the opportunity to more patiently read — and react to — the incoming data. That is, I think we can undertake more moderate monetary policy adjustments today than often was the case in the past.” White House officials side firmly with the “not overheating” camp, arguing that Mr. Trump’s mix of deregulation and tax cuts will increase investment and productivity in the economy, yielding faster growth while suppressing inflation. “Our view is that most of our policies are going to create growth for the economy on the supply side, and that when the supply-side growth comes, then that’s actually good for inflation, because if you increase supply, it puts downward pressure on prices,” Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, told reporters in February. “And so we think that we can get the 3 percent economic growth that we forecast without a big pickup in inflation.” The group of Fed officials worried about overheating point to several economic data points. The unemployment rate is 4.1 percent, near the lowest level recorded in a half-century, and it is below what Fed officials judge to be the sustainable long-term unemployment rate. Forecasters expect the recent injection of fiscal stimulus, from tax cuts and increased federal spending, to drive that rate down even further. Inflation expectations are rising in financial markets, as measured, in part, by how much the government must pay investors to borrow money. Stock values remain high by historical standards, even with the recent dips in the market. In similar periods in American economic history, “there have been heightened risks either of inflation, in earlier decades, or of financial imbalances more recently,” Lael Brainard, a Fed governor, said in a speech last week. Many Fed officials worry that by raising rates too slowly, they risk having to move quickly in the event of an inflation spike or financial turmoil. Such abrupt action, they fear, could snuff growth and plunge the economy into a recession. Other officials, such as James Bullard of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis and Neel Kashkari of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, say officials should keep to the current course of rate increases, particularly because inflation remains below the Fed’s target of 2 percent annual growth. Polling and interviews suggest that American workers are worried about rising prices but far more concerned about job and wage growth. In polling in March for The New York Times by the research firm SurveyMonkey, 62 percent of respondents said consumer prices had risen faster than wages over the preceding year. Only 4 percent said inflation was the largest economic problem facing the country. Twenty-five percent named the cost of health care as the largest economic problem, 21 percent said the gap between the rich and everyone else, and 10 percent named stagnant wages and benefits. Constance Bevitt, who does freelance work in Montgomery County, Md., said Fed officials were wrong to be worried about overheating. “When they talk about full employment, that ignores almost all of the people who have dropped out of the economy entirely,” she said. “I think that they are examining the problem with assumptions from a different economic era. And they don’t know how to assess where we are now.” Ms. Jacks said she was struggling with a low salary after closing her locally sourced food company and returning to restaurant work. She also said she had noticed vacancies in the industry going unfilled, because restaurants could not find workers. Their owners, she said, cannot afford to raise wages in order to attract talent.",The New York Times
2018,"Federal Agencies Lost Track of Nearly 1,500 Migrant Children Placed With Sponsors","WASHINGTON — A top official with the Department of Health and Human Services told members of Congress on Thursday that the agency had lost track of nearly 1,500 migrant children it placed with sponsors in the United States, raising concerns they could end up in the hands of human traffickers or be used as laborers by people posing as relatives. The official, Steven Wagner, the acting assistant secretary of the agency’s Administration for Children and Families, disclosed during testimony before a Senate homeland security subcommittee that the agency had learned of the missing children after placing calls to the people who took responsibility for them when they were released from government custody. The children were taken into government care after they showed up alone at the Southwest border. Most of the children are from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala, and were fleeing drug cartels, gang violence and domestic abuse, government data shows. From last October to the end of the year, officials at the agency’s Office of Refugee Resettlement tried to reach 7,635 children and their sponsors, Mr. Wagner testified. From these calls, officials learned that 6,075 children remained with their sponsors. Twenty-eight had run away, five had been removed from the United States and 52 had relocated to live with a nonsponsor. But officials at the agency were unable to determine with certainty the whereabouts of 1,475 children, Mr. Wagner said. The new details come as Congress is examining safeguards put in place by the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Homeland Security to make sure children who show up alone at the border are turned over to relatives, and not human traffickers. Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio and the chairman of the subcommittee, said he was shocked that government officials did not know the whereabouts of hundreds of migrant children released from their care. “H.H.S. has a responsibility to better track these children so they aren’t trafficked or abused, and so they show up to their court hearings,” he said. Two years ago the subcommittee released a report detailing how health and human services officials placed eight children with human traffickers who forced the minors to work on an egg farm in Marion, Ohio. The report found that department officials had failed to establish procedures to protect the unaccompanied minors, such as conducting sufficient background checks on potential sponsors and following up with sponsors. As a result, the children were turned over to the people who contracted them out to the egg farm. To prevent similar episodes, the Homeland Security and Health and Human Services Departments signed a memorandum of understanding in 2016, and agreed to establish joint procedures within one year for dealing with unaccompanied migrant children. More than a year after the new guidelines were due, the two agencies have not completed them, Mr. Portman said. Children who show up at the border by themselves are usually apprehended by Border Patrol agents or turn themselves in to customs officers at the Department of Homeland Security. Once they are processed, they are turned over to the custody of the Department of Health and Human Services’ refugee office. The office runs more than 100 shelters around the country where it houses children and provides care until they can be turned over to a sponsor while awaiting their immigration hearings. The sponsors are usually parents or family members already residing in the United States. The sponsors are supposed to undergo a detailed background check. After the children have been placed with sponsors, workers at the department follow up with calls to ensure that the minors continue to live with the sponsors, are enrolled in school and are aware of their court dates. But several immigration advocates who work with unaccompanied children said the department did little follow-up. Allison E. Herre, a lawyer with Catholic Charities of Southwestern Ohio, said she had seen sponsors who forced the children to work instead of attending school and who failed to ensure that the children attended their court proceedings. Since 2016, health and human services officials said they have started calling sponsors to check on children 30 days after placement. But the agency said it was not legally responsible for children after they had been released from its refugee office. Mr. Wagner said the agency was re-examining its interpretation of existing laws to make sure that migrant children were not turned over to smugglers or human traffickers.",The New York Times
2018,Federal Budget Deficit Projected to Soar to Over $1 Trillion in 2020,"WASHINGTON — The federal government’s annual budget deficit is set to widen significantly in the next few years, and is expected to top $1 trillion in 2020 despite healthy economic growth, according to new projections from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released Monday. The national debt, which has exceeded $21 trillion, will soar to more than $33 trillion in 2028, according to the budget office. By then, debt held by the public will almost match the size of the nation’s economy, reaching 96 percent of gross domestic product, a higher level than any point since just after World War II and well past the level that economists say could court a crisis. The fear among some economists is that rising deficits will drive up interest rates, raise borrowing costs for the private sector, tank stock prices and slow the economy, which would only drive the deficit higher. “Such high and rising debt would have serious negative consequences for the budget and the nation,” said Keith Hall, the director of the budget office. “In particular, the likelihood of a fiscal crisis in the United States would increase.” The budget office forecast is the first since President Trump signed a sweeping tax overhaul, then signed legislation to significantly increase military and domestic spending over the next two years. The figures are sobering, even in a political climate where deficit concerns appear to be receding. The tax overhaul, which includes permanent tax cuts for corporations and temporary ones for individuals, will increase the size of the economy by an average of 0.7 percent from 2018 to 2028, according to the budget office. But that added economic growth does not come close to paying for the tax overhaul, which the budget office said would add more than $1.8 trillion to deficits over that period, from lost tax revenue and higher interest payments. Many Republicans have said the tax overhaul would vault economic growth over 3 percent a year for a sustained period, generating more revenue than the tax cuts would cost. But the budget office expects the economy to grow at an annual average rate of 1.9 percent over the next decade. Growth would start strong, at 3.3 percent this year and 2.4 percent next year, but then slow considerably. And if the temporary tax cuts for individuals are extended past their scheduled expiration at the end of 2025, the price tag for the tax overhaul would be even greater. Mr. Trump has talked about embarking upon “Phase 2” of tax cuts, which could include making those individual tax cuts permanent. Democrats jumped on the projections to castigate Republicans over their economic record. “From Day 1,” the Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, said, “the Republican agenda has always been to balloon the deficit in order to dole out massive tax breaks to the largest corporations and wealthiest Americans, and then use the deficit as an excuse to cut Social Security and Medicare.” Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader, was equally harsh: “The C.B.O.’s report exposes the staggering costs of the G.O.P. tax scam and Republicans’ contempt for fiscal responsibility.” For their part, Republicans were remarkably quiet: “Without question, we have challenging work ahead,” said Representative Steve Womack of Arkansas, the chairman of the House Budget Committee. This fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30, the budget deficit is expected to total $804 billion, up from $665 billion last fiscal year, according to the projections. In a decade, the red ink is expected to reach $1.5 trillion. The forecast is considerably bleaker than the budget office’s projections in June last year, before Congress approved the tax cuts and agreed to increase spending. The $804 billion projected deficit for the current fiscal year is $242 billion larger than what the budget office had expected in June. In addition, the budget office now projects a cumulative deficit of $11.7 trillion over the next decade, an increase of $1.6 trillion from last June’s projection for that time period. By 2023, according to the budget office, interest costs are projected to exceed what the government spends on the military. By 2028, interest payments will reach $915 billion, more than triple the interest costs last year. The government’s mounting debt has seemed of little consequence on Capitol Hill in recent months as Republicans in Congress passed a sweeping package of tax cuts. But in a sign that Republicans are growing concerned about the political liability of soaring deficits, the House will vote Thursday on a constitutional amendment to require balanced budgets. Representative Jeff Duncan, a conservative Republican from South Carolina, took to Twitter to say, “To every House Democrat on social media today complaining about the debt and deficit for the first time: I look forward to seeing you vote for the balanced budget amendment later this week. That is of course assuming you are actually serious about addressing our debt.” Since such constitutional amendments require two-thirds of the House and Senate to agree, it is unlikely to pass Congress, let alone be ratified by the states. But the flurry of recent legislation is making it difficult for Republicans to continue blaming President Barack Obama and Democrats for the government’s fiscal condition. This year, lawmakers approved a two-year budget deal that raised strict caps on military and domestic spending by a total of about $300 billion. That deal paved the way for Congress to pass a $1.3 trillion spending bill last month. Before passing the tax overhaul and the spending legislation, lawmakers were already facing worrisome projections about growing deficits, driven by increased spending on Medicare and Social Security as well as growing interest costs. The budget office now projects that the deficit will top $1 trillion two years sooner than it had expected last June. The budget office did project economic benefits from the tax overhaul. Analysts said the law will increase employment by 1.1 million jobs over the next decade. The law will also raise Americans’ wages and salaries by an average of 0.9 percent annually, a less optimistic projection than White House economists offered last year when the bill was being considered. The budget office analysis also projects that the law will result in interest rates that are a half percentage point higher than they would have been without it. In its early years, the budget office said, the law will boost the strength of the dollar, allowing Americans to buy more imports and sell fewer exports to the rest of the world — and thus, increase the national trade deficit, counter to Mr. Trump’s desire to reduce it. Michael A. Peterson, the president and chief executive of the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, which advocates reining in budget deficits, said the report “confirms that major damage was done to our fiscal outlook in just the past few months.” Mr. Hall, the budget office director, said that beyond a decade, the debt would continue to rise compared with the size of the economy. He warned of the possible consequences if lawmakers put off addressing the trajectory of the government’s finances. “The longer you wait,” he said, “the more draconian the measures have to be to fix the problem.”",The New York Times

I started Facebook, I run it, and I’m responsible for what happens here.” Facebook is entering a week of intense scrutiny in Washington, with Mr. Zuckerberg scheduled to testify before congressional committeeson Tuesday and Wednesday. The company is confronting a surge in criticism over how it handled the private data of as many as 87 million users that was harvested by Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm tied to President Trump’s 2016 campaign. Mr. Zuckerberg, in his prepared remarks, addresses the scandal, saying that Facebook must do more to protect its users’ personal information. The company, he says, will block app developers from gaining access to the data of users who have been inactive for three months; restrict the ability of users to inadvertently share information about others in their networks; and adopt stricter permissions guidelines and search features. In a separate post on Facebook on Monday, he also said that Facebook would form an independent commission of academic researchers to study social media’s impact on elections. His appearances on Capitol Hill starting Tuesday will be one of the Facebook mogul’s most public challenges to date. Here’s what to expect, according to Kevin Roose, Cecilia Kang and Sheera Frenkel of the NYT: Democrats are expected to grill Mr. Zuckerberg about the privacy scandals, and how the social network is guarding against possible interference in this fall’s midterm elections. Republicans are expected to be more reticent about privacy regulations, and may use the hearings to raise suspicions of political bias on the social network. Mr. Zuckerberg has prepared for his testimony with a crash course in charm and humility. The goal is to look humble and forthright — and definitely not like the “S.N.L.” parody of him. (“S.N.L.”-Zuckerberg on user data: “It’s mine — you gave it to me, no backsies.”) • Facebook has suspended another data analytics company for misleading users. It will start notifying users today about what data was shared with Cambridge Analytica. (Some affected users contacted by the NYT were angry.) The company will require political ad buyers to verify their identities and locations. What Facebook’s tightening of its privacy controls to a new European standard means for you. And Facebook’s viral stars want a bigger cut of ad revenue. • Tim Cook of Apple took a shot at Facebook’s business model in an MSNBC/Recode interview: “We’re not going to traffic in your personal life. I think it’s an invasion of privacy.” • Jack Ma, the chief executive of Alibaba, also weighed in: “It is the time to fix it. It is the time for the CEO to really take it seriously. I think the problems will be solved.” Elsewhere in data privacy: Consumer advocacy groups are expected to complain to federal regulators that YouTube is violating a children’s privacy law. And India’s plans to connect residents’ fingerprints, eyes and faces to everything from welfare benefits to mobile phones has horrified civil libertarians.

The Information and Social Capital just released their third survey of diversity at the big investment firms in the tech world. Here are some of their findings: • Canvas Ventures and Kirsten Green’s Forerunner Ventures tied for first place on The Information’s V.C. Diversity Index, while Tiger Global Management and Slow Ventures tied for last place. • The number of women in senior positions at U.S. venture firms rose to 14.2 percent last year, from 10.7 percent. The percentage of Hispanic decision makers rose to 2.3 percent from 1.9 percent, while that of black senior leaders stayed roughly flat at just over 1 percent. More from The Information: “Overall, there has never been a time where we have seen so much focus on diversity. Those who believe in it and verbally commit to it will do it.” — Beth Haggerty, co-founder and C.E.O. of Parity Partners, said in an interview. — Michael J. de la Merced Meet Christian Sewing, a Deutsche Bank lifer who most recently oversaw the firm’s retail operations. Mr. Sewing’s biggest priorities include: • Deciding how to scale back international banking and trading ambitions (though focusing on the overcrowded German retail market has issues, too) • Convincing investors and regulators that the firm would shed risk • Calming the waters at a firm troubled by internal squabbles, while also making deep cuts More on Mr. Sewing: He apprenticed with the bank and gradually added responsibilities like overseeing an internal money-laundering inquiry into the Russia unit. But Gadfly warns that it isn’t clear how much institutional support Mr. Sewing will have. Peter Eavis’s take: A resolute plan to shrink Deutsche Bank’s huge but unexceptional Wall Street businesses makes sense. But downsizing could mean lost revenue, executive departures and even surprise losses. If the next C.E.O. plays down the pain of such an adjustment, be skeptical. Uber started a pilot program in San Francisco to allow its customers to reserve “pedal-assist” electric bicycles within its ride-hailing app in January. Now, Uber says it plans to buy the company behind the bike-sharing service and bring that capability to other cities around the world. In a blog post Monday morning, Uber said it reached an agreement with Jump Bikes, a provider of battery-powered bicycles, for an undisclosed sum. It would be the first acquisition for Uber since Dara Khosrowshahi took over as the company’s chief executive in August. Uber did not say how much it paid for the bike start-up, but TechCrunch reported earlier that Jump was considering an acquisition from Uber for more than $100 million. Even as Uber is backing away from some international markets, the Jump acquisition shows the company is still willing to invest in new ways to reach customers. — Daisuke Wakabayashi How fast are homes in San Jose appreciating? At nearly $100 per hour, according to data from Zillow. To put that in perspective, San Jose’s minimum wage is $13.50. From Zillow: “In San Jose, the heart of Silicon Valley where the median home value has soared above $1 million over the past year, owners of the typical local home earned more than $200,000 in equity last year – almost $100 for every hour spent at the office last year. Even considering the legendary perks of Silicon Valley’s office culture, that kind of “income” is probably more than enough to make some local homeowners consider a new twist on “working from home” – ie, giving it up and letting their home do the work instead.” In fact, homes are appreciating at a faster per hour than minimum wage in half of America’s largest cities. They include San Francisco ($60.13), Seattle ($54.24), New York City ($42.17), Oakland ($38.57), San Diego ($30.86), Los Angeles ($26.35), Long Beach ($18.64), Honolulu ($17.44), Boston ($16.91), Las Vegas ($16.87), Denver ($15.91), and Sacramento ($15.62). More context from Zillow: “The median U.S. household earned roughly $60,000 in 2017 ($58,978 to be exact) or a little more than $28 per hour.” The investment firm of Byron D. Trott, BDT Capital Partners, announced this morning that it would buy a majority stake in Casa Dragones, the high-end tequila producer. (A bottle of the Joven would set you back almost $300.) It’s the latest sign of growing interest in the Mexican spirit. Founded in 2008, Casa Dragones’ sales have grown 50 percent by volume over the last three years. The back story: The Casa Dragones co-founder Bertha González Nieves (the other is Bob Pittman, the media veteran), got to know BDT over the past year, and began negotiating a deal last fall. “To have a partner that believes in entrepreneurship and is a long-term investor enables us to continue to write our growth chapter,” she said. Mr. Trott told Michael, “Bertha is just one of these great, passionate visionary entrepreneurs.” The context: Casamigos sold to Diageo for as much as $1 billion, but both Ms. Gonzalez and Mr. Trott said that wasn’t a factor in striking this deal. What comes next: Ms. Gonzalez said that the new money will help Casa Dragones expand internationally, especially helpful as countries outside Mexico and the U.S. become more interested in tequila. And Mr. Trott said that while today’s deal was BDT’s first foray into the spirits industry, his firm had been looking at investing into the business for some time — and could end up doing more deals. Trump administration officials sought on Sunday to play down the prospect of a trade war with China, with President Trump tweeting that he and President Xi Jinping “will always be friends.” But behind the scenes, White House officials are reportedly fighting over who is to blame for the situation. More from Jonathan Swan of Axios: Several senior officials blame [Steven] Mnuchin for the messy rollout. One source ripped him for “hiding the ball” by not looping enough people in after getting such a significant request from Trump. Another senior administration official defended Mnuchin, noting that after getting the order from Trump, he told the Staff Secretary and had multiple conversations with trade representative Bob Lighthizer, who worked in lock step with him on this.

2018,Opinion | Federal Prison Reform,"Letter To the Editor: Re “Kushner Spars With Sessions, in Whiplash on Prisons Policy” (front page, March 31): Prison Fellowship has long championed federal sentencing reform, but the push for federal prison reform is also a matter of justice, not to mention human dignity. A “front-end sentencing reform or bust” mentality fails to acknowledge that the federal system offers drastically less opportunity for prisoners to transition to community corrections before the end of their sentence compared with almost all states. Of more than 35 jurisdictions with codified “earned time” and “good time” policies, we found that the federal system ranked second lowest in the country in terms of the maximum amount of time possible to earn off one’s prison sentence. This is for multiple reasons, including having only one federal prison program that qualifies for credit. The Prison Reform and Redemption Act would expand earned-time credit opportunities to include any program proved to reduce recidivism. By allowing lower-risk individuals to serve the final terms of their sentences under community corrections supervision or in-home confinement, we can allow incarcerated men and women to reunite with their families sooner and create a smoother and safer re-entry transition.

2018,"Felder, a Democrat, Says He Will Remain With Republicans","ALBANY — State Senator Simcha Felder, a Democrat from Brooklyn, announced on Tuesday that he will continue to caucus with the Republicans, short-circuiting hopes of a new Democratic majority in Albany’s upper chamber. Mr. Felder, who has repeatedly said he actually has no loyalty to any party, said in a statement that he would continue to sit with the Republican majority regardless of the outcome of two special elections being held in the Bronx and Westchester County. If Democrats win both seats, the party would gain a numerical edge in the Senate, theoretically giving them control — but only if Mr. Felder returns to the fold. Instead, Mr. Felder said that he believed the issue would be “best resolved outside of the legislative session,” which ends in June. “I believe it is my obligation to prevent an unprecedented and uncertain late-session political battle that will only hurt my constituents and New Yorkers,” Mr. Felder said. “Political gamesmanship must not be allowed to jeopardize the leadership, committee structure and staff of the New York State Senate and push this institution into turmoil.” The decision by Mr. Felder was not totally unexpected; he had suggested on several prior occasions that he was happy with his arrangement with the Republican majority, where he represents the decisive 32nd vote in the 63-seat Senate. Democrats, besides Mr. Felder, currently hold 29 seats. Still, his formal announcement is a blow to any illusion that Democrats — who far outnumber Republicans in a deep blue state — might emerge from Tuesday’s elections in control of the Senate, a body that they have not ruled since 2010. Since then, the party has been in the minority and vexed by the Independent Democratic Conference, a breakaway group of Senate Democrats that collaborated with the G.O.P. Scott Reif, a spokesman for the Senate Republicans, said that his conference was “thrilled with Senator Felder’s decision,” calling him “an important and trusted member of our conference.” “We look forward to continuing to work with him to move his district and our entire state forward,” Mr. Reif said. Democratic officials have been laying the groundwork for a deal to reunite the fractured Democratic Party since last fall, dependent on various factors, including the outcome of Tuesday’s elections. But it wasn’t until early April, after negotiations on the state budget were complete and amid pressure from Democratic activists and a surprising primary challenge from Cynthia Nixon, that Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo announced the dissolution of the I.D.C. The group was soon absorbed into the larger bloc of Senate Democrats led by Andrea Stewart-Cousins, a senator from Westchester County. But Mr. Felder, who was elected in 2012 as a Democrat but almost immediately declared his intentions to sit with Republicans, remained an outlier. On Tuesday, the governor’s press secretary, Dani Lever, said the governor continued to argue in favor of Democratic unity. “This conversation will continue in the morning,” she said. Mr. Felder, however, apparently unswayed by the governor’s previous entreaties, said he had to do what was best for his constituents, which includes a large community of Orthodox Jews, though he stressed he had “great respect for my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and this institution.” “I intend to work with all of them in the remaining days of session and move the people’s work forward in an effective and orderly manner,” he said. A spokesman for the Senate Democratic conference did not mention Mr. Felder in a statement, but predicted victory in both races on Tuesday and expressed scorn for any member of the party who cooperated with the Republicans. “Today’s wins will once again give Democrats a numeric majority, and come November we will win even more seats,” said the spokesman, Mike Murphy. “The voters are sick and tired of Democrats that empower Trump Republicans.”",The New York Times
2018,"Female Senators, Their Ranks Increasing, Reflect on Breaking Into the Boys’ Club","WASHINGTON — It has been 86 years since Hattie Wyatt Caraway of Arkansas became the first woman elected to the United States Senate, and women remain woefully underrepresented in the chamber. Women make up nearly 51 percent of the United States population but just 23 percent of the Senate, an all-time high, nonetheless, after Cindy Hyde-Smith was sworn in as the new senator from Mississippi this month . They form something of a tight-knit club. They have bipartisan dinners that make their male colleagues jealous. They have banded together to solve seemingly intractable problems; in 2013, when Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, led a move to shut down the government, the women of the Senate cut a bipartisan deal to reopen it. And they have pushed their colleagues to tackle issues like sexual harassment, domestic violence and sexual assault in the military. On Sunday, four female senators — Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, Heidi Heitkamp, Democrat of North Dakota, Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, and Joni Ernst, Republican of Iowa — discussed women in politics, public policy, and the special bond among women in the Senate at a TimesTalks forum in New York. (Ms. Ernst, waylaid by an Iowa snowstorm, arrived toward the end.) Here are some of the session’s lighter moments, offering a peek behind the scenes of life as a woman in the Senate: Ms. Collins says she is often called upon to recruit women (and men) who are thinking of running for office. Many women tell her that they do not feel quite ready. “I have never, ever had a man say that to me, that he wasn’t quite ready,” she said, adding, “I think there’s a self-doubt and a hesitancy to take risks that we need to overcome.” Women have also historically had a tougher time raising money, said Ms. Klobuchar, who in 2006 became the first woman elected to the Senate from her state. On that score, she said she believes she set a record during her first run for Senate: “I raised $17,000 from ex-boyfriends.” It is not uncommon for women in the Senate to suffer from a case of mistaken identity. When Ms. Klobuchar arrived, in 2007, she stepped onto the senators-only elevator, only to be confronted by a male colleague. “This is a senators-only elevator,” she recalled him telling her. “I looked at him and I said, ‘And who are you? I AM a senator.’” Not much had improved by the time Ms. Heitkamp arrived in 2013. She recalled trying to step onto the subway that connects Senate office buildings to the Capitol. A guard asked for her identification, which she produced. “So you’re a Senate spouse?” she said he asked. “I went, ‘No. I am THE United States senator from my state.’”. For a long time there was no women’s bathroom on the second floor of the Capitol, off the Senate chamber. Ms. Klobuchar said that when she arrived, there was a small bathroom, not large enough to accommodate the Senate’s growing female population. So she and then Senator Barbara Mikulski, the Maryland Democrat who was regarded as the dean of female senators until her retirement last year, “self-appointed ourselves to the ‘expand the woman’s bathroom’ committee.” The architect of the Capitol presented them with a plan to add one stall. Ms. Mikulski, Ms. Klobuchar recalled, was not impressed. “She says, ‘You know what this is? This is a glass-ceiling bathroom.’” The men also have a better gym than the women and the men’s gym has a pool. When then-Senator Kay Hagan, the North Carolina Democrat, arrived in the Senate in 2009, she wanted to swim there, only to be greeted with a sign on the door that said “men only.” There was a reason for the sign, Ms. Collins said. There were at least two male senators — she would not name them — who enjoyed swimming in the nude. Today, women can use the pool, and the sign says “Proper Attire Required.” When Ms. Hagan lost her race in 2014, the women of the Senate threw her a goodbye party — at the pool. Ms. Heitkamp boasted that she ran the “most fun” dinner; she took the women of the Senate bowling at the White House bowling alley, and bought her colleagues bowling shirts. “And we got in big trouble,” she said, “because we stood on the lanes, and they had to resand the lanes afterward.” Senator Tammy Duckworth, Democrat of Illinois, recently became the first female senator to give birth while in office. She is now pushing to change the rule that bars senators from bringing children onto the Senate floor. Ms. Klobuchar, the senior Democrat on the Senate Rules Committee, is working with her. “Of course,” the senator said wryly, “my husband does joke, ‘Well what do you mean? There’s a lot of babies on the floor already.’” Watch the full discussion, below. Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the newest female senator and the time of her swearing-in. She is Cindy Hyde-Smith of Mississippi, who was sworn in earlier this month.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Feuding Politicians: Cuomo and de Blasio,"Letters To the Editor: Re “Cuomo vs. de Blasio: One of the Country’s Ugliest Political Feuds” (front page, April 23): No need for New Yorkers to look to the White House to find a selfish, megalomaniacal, petty, childish leader who is concerned only about himself, his image and his political viability. We have two such men much closer to home. Is there any wonder that our streets are dirtier, our subways are falling apart, our infrastructure is crumbling, the number of homeless on the streets is climbing and our children are not being well educated? All of these concerns apparently are not as important as the fragile egos of the men elected to address them. I have only two words for Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio: Grow up! CAROL NADELL, NEW YORK To the Editor: The bitterness of feuds between governors and mayors over the years points to an institutional source for these conflicts. That source is the state’s control over many city functions and undue influence over others. The framework is dysfunctional: Governors can interfere when it is convenient for their personal political agendas and neglect legitimate city needs when it suits them. Forty-three percent of the state’s population lives in New York City, and millions more in the near suburbs depend on city services for work or well-being. Yet the governor has no meaningful obligation to partner in the development and execution of effective policies for the city. If called to account for city problems, the governor can always blame the mayor. Somewhere, Norman Mailer and Jimmy Breslin — who when running for mayor and City Council president in 1969 called for New York City to become the 51st state — are saying, “I told you so.” PHILIP SILLER, NEW YORK To the Editor: The citizens of New York City must demand that Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio appear at a public forum to explain to the residents of the city — as well as to tourists and to commuters who work in the city — why the transit system is utterly dysfunctional and why they are not able to come to an agreement about how and when to fix it. Millions of us depend on the Metropolitan Transportation Authority every day, yet none of us can reliably predict whether or not we will be able to arrive at our workplaces, meetings, job interviews, court appointments, doctor appointments or children’s schools on time. For many of us, the unreliability of the subways and buses results in docked wages, extra child care costs, lost jobs, evictions and other grave consequences. Neither of them will take responsibility for a situation that, if not fixed, will cripple the city and eventually the state economy. AMY WILKINS, BROOKLYN",The New York Times
2018,"Fidel Died and Raúl Resigned, but Castros Still Hold Sway in Cuba","MIAMI — For the first time in decades, Cubans have a president whose last name is not Castro. But as the new president, Miguel Díaz-Canel Bermúdez, who turns 58 on Friday, takes his first strides to govern an economically distressed country that is perennially in crisis, he will do so with a ring of Castros, and their various spouses and children, around him. Fidel Castro died in 2016 at 90, and his eldest son, nicknamed Fidelito, killed himself this year. But Raúl Castro, who stepped down on Thursday after two terms as president, remains the leader of the Communist Party and the head of the armed forces. And other Castros run the intelligence services and the vast military conglomerate that manages most state business. One of them is Raúl Castro’s most trusted bodyguard. Another is a lawmaker who supports gay rights. They are the defenders of a dynasty that is ostensibly there to support Mr. Díaz-Canel — but also to scrutinize him. As an era comes to a close, these stalwarts and heirs of the Cuban revolution will be members of an inner circle that aims to guarantee the succession of a socialist state — all while managing the delicate task of not creating the appearance of a family dynasty reaching into its third reign. “Don’t anyone get their hopes up,” said María C. Werlau, a Cuba researcher who studies the violent legacy of the Cuban revolution. “Díaz-Canel is purely there for a cosmetic change; he is an offshoot of Raúl and has no power or perceptible source of power. The succession is well underway, and the second generation of Castros is well lined up to take control when Raúl is really out of the picture.” Here are some prominent members of the clan: Raúl Castro, 86, stepped down after 12 years as president. He was defense minister for nearly five decades, from 1959 to 2008, and has led the Communist Party since 2006. He retains the title of first party secretary, which he has held since 2011, and which is “where true power resides,” Ms. Werlau said. But even Mr. Castro, with his revolutionary credentials and fraternal connections, could not pull off all of the changes he had set out to make. Too many old-guard associates put up obstacles when they saw the widening inequalities that accompanied economic reforms. So although Mr. Castro is widely believed to be planning a move from Havana to Santiago de Cuba — on Cuba’s southeastern coast, the other side of the country — he is not expected to leave Mr. Díaz-Canel entirely to his own devices. Mr. Castro was credited with strengthening institutional control and formalizing the concept of consensus governing. He believes in delegated authority. He has made sure that there are enough internal checks and balances to keep an eye on any successor with big ideas, while still watching this one’s back. Mr. Díaz-Canel was a handpicked successor, and it is not in Raúl Castro’s interest to see him fail. “Raúl will be watching,” said Andy S. Gómez, a Cuba expert, now retired, who worked at the University of Miami. “Raúl, as first party secretary, will be not only watching him, but, more importantly, being there for him, symbolically, so he can move forward.” Alcibíades Hidalgo, who was Raúl Castro’s chief of staff for a dozen years, believes that his former boss will hold on to power “until the day he dies.” Alejandro Castro Espín, 52, is Raúl Castro’s son. Mr. Castro Espín runs the intelligence services for both the armed forces and the Interior Ministry. That is a big task in a country that works hard to stifle dissent and sniff out spies. Mr. Castro Espín was part of the team that negotiated with President Barack Obama’s administration over restoring diplomatic ties with the United States, a sign that he is part of the most trusted inner circle. But he also has serious anti-imperialist credentials: The title of a book he wrote in 2009, “Empire of Terror,” offers a not-very-subtle clue of his opinion of Cuba’s big neighbor to the north. “The most important of the younger generation is Castro Espín,” said Brian Latell, a former C.I.A. analyst who has closely watched the Castro family. “I think he has a lot of influence with his father.” Juan Juan Almeida, the son of a Cuban revolutionary war hero, grew up with Mr. Castro Espín and lived in his house when they were children. He said he was not convinced that his former best friend had the skills to succeed after his father dies. “He’s powerful, but his power was given to him by his father,” Mr. Almeida said. “He will last as long as his father’s power lasts.” Some experts believe that Raúl Castro would have liked to have made his son president, but that it would have looked bad internationally to have another Castro take over. Gen. Luis Alberto Rodríguez López-Callejas was a Castro by marriage — he used to be married to Raúl Castro’s daughter Débora, and is the father of Mr. Castro’s favorite grandson. General Rodríguez is president of Gaesa, the holding company that controls the military’s business interests. The military runs all of the hotels and state-run restaurants, convenience stores and gas stations, making General Rodríguez one of the country’s most powerful men. “He must have 1,200 companies under him,” said Guillermo Fariñas, an outspoken critic of the government who lives in Villa Clara Province. “I think the one who manages the country economically is him.” Raúl Rodríguez Castro, General Rodríguez’s son, is Raúl Castro’s bodyguard, the kind of position that lends itself to knowing all kinds of secrets, Mr. Fariñas said. Mariela Castro is Raúl Castro’s daughter. A member of Parliament, she enjoys an international and domestic following, largely because of her support for gay and transgender rights. “Mariela is part of the scenery,” Mr. Hidalgo said. “She’s a decorative figure with a nice cause. In terms of power, she is far from the role of her brother or her ex-brother-in-law.” Mr. Almeida said it boiled down to appearances. “In terms of becoming a vice minister or joining the Council of State, I don’t see her doing that,” Mr. Almeida said. “The idea is to present a democratic face and erase the faces of the past. For the international community, they need to offer a nice friendly face of Cuba, which means not putting forth a Castro.” Mr. Hidalgo, a former ambassador to the United Nations who later defected and now lives in Miami, does not think it will work. “They are trying to give an appearance of change to what is fundamentally the same,” he said. “They are trying to continue Castroism without Castros in the near future, which is practically impossible.”",The New York Times
2018,"Fight Over Alfie Evans, a Brain-Damaged Baby, Divides U.K.","LONDON — Alfie Evans does not know it, but he is the subject of a national debate in Britain, international diplomacy and a bitter legal dispute. He is held up as a tragedy, a beacon of hope and an object lesson. And he might not live to turn 2 years old. The hospital and doctors treating him in Liverpool say that Alfie suffers from a degenerative neurological condition that is certainly fatal, that he is in a semi-vegetative state and that the only humane course of action is to let him die. His parents, supported by the Italian and Polish governments and the pope, are not convinced that he is beyond hope, or even that the doctors understand his condition, and they want to continue his care. On Wednesday, the British Court of Appeal upheld a ruling that not only approved the withdrawal of care and sustenance, but also prohibited his parents from seeking treatment elsewhere, despite an invitation to take him to a hospital in Rome. The decision is wrenching to the parents, the courts have said, but prolonging Alfie’s life would prolong his suffering, and so it would be contrary to his interests. The staff of Alder Hey Children’s Hospital took Alfie off a ventilator on Monday, but defying expectations, he kept breathing on his own. The parents’ lawyers from the Christian Legal Centre have said they will continue their appeals. “For the third day now, there’s been not one single problem with him,” his father, Tom Evans, told reporters outside the hospital on Thursday, insisting that Alfie was not suffering, despite what doctors have said. “It’s not a miracle, it’s a misdiagnosis.” [Do you think parental feelings or government decision-making should prevail in cases like that of Alfie Evans? Please share your thoughts in the comments.] Mr. Evans said he had started legal action against three doctors, accusing them of conspiracy to murder. He and Alfie’s mother, Kate James, met on Thursday with hospital officials to discuss the possibility of taking the infant home. The painful back-and-forth has been fodder for the British news media for weeks, with much of the coverage sympathetic to the parents. A group of people siding with the parents, called Alfie’s Army, has gathered daily outside Alder Hey, waving signs, cheering and jeering, and hospital officials say they and their employees have been subjected to a torrent of abuse. The court rulings barring continued medical care may sound jarring to Americans, who are accustomed to the idea that a family has the right to keep a patient alive, even if doctors disagree with the decision. Far more familiar in the United States are the cases in which family members have fought for the right to let their loved ones die. But in Britain, rulings like those in Alfie’s case date to at least the early 1990s, and there have been more than 20 of them in the past decade, said Dominic Wilkinson, a professor of medical ethics at the University of Oxford. Last year, as a similar case riveted the country and President Trump weighed in, the courts ruled that life support could be withdrawn from another baby, Charlie Gard, and that his parents could not take him to the United States for experimental treatment. Early this year, the similar case of still another baby, Isaiah Haastrup, drew intense attention. “It’s important to note that the courts do not always go along with the doctors, and they do sometimes side with the parents,” said Dr. Wilkinson, an expert in newborn intensive care. “Some people believe that the parents’ views are paramount in every case, or that life should be prolonged at all costs, but British law does not accept either of those views,” he said. “The law of the country is that the child’s best interests are paramount.” Anti-abortion conservatives in Britain and elsewhere have seized on cases like Charlie’s and Alfie’s. Senator Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, wrote a series of Twitter posts on Wednesday assailing the court rulings and describing the decision to take Alfie off a ventilator as a grim result of Britain’s socialized medical system — though British officials say that the same legal standards apply to patients with private insurance. Pope Francis met last week with Mr. Evans, and a children’s hospital run by the Roman Catholic Church in Rome invited Alfie’s family to take him there. On Monday in a Twitter post, the pope expressed his hope that the parents “may be heard and that their desire to seek new forms of treatment may be granted.” Roman Catholic doctrine allows doctors to withdraw medical care, even food and water, under some circumstances but not others. The Italian government granted Alfie citizenship, hoping to tip the scales in favor of his traveling to Rome, but the British courts were unmoved. The Polish government, which portrays itself as fighting for traditional Christian values that are threatened in the West, has attracted attention to the case as well. State television in Poland, an overwhelmingly Catholic country, frequently reports on it, and President Andrzej Duda has weighed in on Twitter. “Alfie Evans must be saved!” he wrote in English. “Perhaps all that’s needed is some good will on the part of decision makers.” This week, a hastily built shrine to Alfie sprung up outside the British Consulate in Krakow, Poland. People brought teddy bears and flowers, candles and a single message: Don’t let judges decide his fate. Alfie was born on May 9, 2016. When he was 7 months old, after suffering seizures, he was admitted to the hospital and has been there ever since. His doctors have been unable to diagnose a specific ailment, but they say that his condition has worsened and will continue to, and that he has been in a semi-vegetative state for more than a year. He sometimes opens his eyes in response to stimuli, or opens and closes his hands. His parents cite those movements as evidence that he is not as profoundly brain damaged as the doctors contend; the doctors say those are involuntary responses that do not demonstrate consciousness. “I’m still fighting,” Mr. Evans said, “and so is Alfie.”",The New York Times
2018,"Fight Over Values Risks a ‘European Civil War,’ Macron Says","BRUSSELS — Emmanuel Macron, who beat back the far-right National Front to win the French presidency, said on Tuesday that there was “an increasing fascination with illiberalism” in Europe and that divisions over values within the European Union were like “a European civil war.” Speaking after the re-election this month in Hungary of Viktor Orban, the professed champion of “illiberal democracy,” and moves against the judiciary in Poland, Mr. Macron said that Europe was in a battle between the liberal democracy that shaped its postwar vision and a new populist authoritarianism that brushes aside dissents and cares little about the rule of law. Europeans must turn away from “selfish nationalism,” he told the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France. That was especially so in a world of larger and more powerful nations like Russia, China and a more disengaged United States under President Trump. Less than a year into his presidency, Mr. Macron is still trying to make his mark both at home, where he is facing union unrest and strikes, and in Europe. He used the speech to further stake out a position as a leading champion of the European Union at a time when states are clamoring for more sovereignty and populist forces have risen to weaken even his core partner, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany. His ambitious plans for reforms to the European Union and the eurozone have been confronted with German hesitation and new anxieties over the stability of Italy, which is still to form a government after elections that favored populist parties. But Mr. Macron was clearly offering more Europe anyway. “We need a sovereignty stronger than our own,” he said. The French president also sought to remind those like himself, just 40 years old, who had no memories of World War II and few of the Cold War, that the European Union was intended to play a vital role in encouraging peace and stability. “I am part of a generation that is suffering the luxury of forgetting the experiences of our ancestors,” he said. “I don’t want to belong to a generation of sleepwalkers that has forgotten its own past,” referring to a famous German trilogy of novels by Hermann Broch set before World War I. “I want to belong to a generation that has decided forcefully to defend its democracy.” In a clear reference to Hungary and to Poland, Mr. Macron said: “In the face of authoritarianism, the response is not authoritarian democracy but the authority of democracy.” Both countries have moved to consolidate party authority by tightening control over state media and the courts, and both countries have vowed to protect one another from substantive efforts to punish these efforts by the European Union. “Macron is the candidate of those who still believe in Europe,” said Christian Lequesne, a professor of European politics at the Paris Institute of Political Studies, or Sciences Po. “But his whole strategy is based on a new image at home, of a president able to reform this unreformable country, which will give him more leverage on the European level.” For now, the jury is out, but Mr. Macron is trying to influence a conversation on Europe’s future that seems especially necessary as Britain prepares to leave the bloc and the United States appears to be disengaging. He is calling on his fellow leaders to engage in a public debate on these issues a year before elections for a new European Parliament. It is vital, he said, “to have a democratic, critical debate on what Europe is about.” He has suggested deeper European integration, especially for those countries that use the euro, including an enhanced European budget. But there is considerable resistance from other member states toward creating either a more tightly integrated Europe or a multitiered one that treats certain countries differently. And nationalism in Europe is on the rise, and not just in Central Europe, under pressure from migration, terrorism and globalization. As Mr. Macron spoke, the European Commission, the European Union’s executive arm, was working with Poland to soften its planned overhaul of the judiciary and so avoid being punished with a reduction in the funds the country receives from the future European budget, which is being debated now. Poland’s government has been sharply criticized for trying to exercise too much political control over the judiciary and limit its independence. As Europe contemplates what to do after Brexit, the commission had good news on Tuesday for Albania and Macedonia, urging the beginning of formal accession talks to join the European Union. Currently only Serbia and Montenegro are in such talks, with membership not likely until at least 2025 or beyond. But this announcement was a significant sign of progress for Albania, and would represent the first start of accession talks in nearly five years. The commission notes, however, that “continued concrete and tangible results” to assure an independent judiciary “will be decisive for Albania’s further progress.” Edi Rama, Albania’s prime minister, called it “a new chapter in our history of long efforts, struggles, defeats and results for the last three decades to reach our European dream.” In a telephone interview from the capital, Tirana, Mr. Rama said that the process of joining now is “meticulous and difficult,” given Europe’s internal problems. But for the Western Balkans, “countries that have had not a very generous history, the European path is the only instrument to modernize and build credible states and institutions.” Macedonia’s talks on accession to both the European Union and to NATO have been held up for years by Greece, which is still trying to force the country, a former Yugoslav republic now formally known as the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, to take a different name. Talks on the matter have been proceeding slowly but are said to be making new progress.",The New York Times
2018,"Fighting Over Chores? Spend Some Money, Save the Marriage","The New Health Care Maybe family life would be more harmonious if we just outsourced the housework we disliked, research suggests. Many of us are busy at work, but even at home, there is a lot of work to do. Meal preparation, cleaning, yard work, home maintenance and child care consume considerable time for the typical American. Much of it isn’t fun, contributing to friction in relationships and taking time away from more pleasant activities that increase happiness. Instead of bickering over who will do the vacuuming, would family life be better if we just outsourced the job? One survey found that 25 percent of people who were divorced named “disagreements about housework” as the top reason for getting a divorce. In a working paper that cited that survey, scholars at the Harvard Business School and the University of British Columbia examined whether buying timesaving services could improve relationships. The study, which involved over 3,000 people in committed relationships across a variety of tests, revealed that those who spent more money on timesaving services were more satisfied with their relationships, in part because they spent more quality time with their partners. This is, admittedly, a first-world issue. Some don’t have the luxury of paying others to cook for them (eating at a restaurant counts here), tend to their yards or clean their homes. But sharing apps like TaskRabbit are making it easier for more people to find less expensive help for routine chores. Perhaps this could do wonders for some relationships. According to the working paper, timesaving purchases help protect couples from the negative impact of typical and uncontrollable relationship stressors, like unexpected pressure at work. Results like these may be unsurprising. Time-related stress — having too little time to relax — is associated with reduced feelings of well-being and increased depression. Stress doesn’t just affect our mood; it can also harm our health. Using some of our income to buy more time for leisure can improve well-being, according to a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Outsourcing at least a few tasks each month — about $100 to $200 worth — can increase life satisfaction. That finding came from surveys of over 6,000 people in the United States, Canada, Denmark and the Netherlands. Among American workers, half had spent money to buy time, largely by relieving themselves of cooking, shopping and home maintenance tasks. The results held even after controlling for income, so it doesn’t seem as if buying time is merely an indicator of being wealthier, which may also increase satisfaction. In fact, the researchers found a stronger relationship between satisfaction and buying time among lower-income groups. But just to be sure that buying time tends to cause greater life satisfaction, the researchers conducted a randomized experiment. Participants in the trial were given $40 on each of two consecutive weekends. On one of those weekends, they were randomly assigned to spend the money on something that would save them time (like going out to eat instead of cooking). On the other weekend, they could make only a material purchase that would not save time (like buying a new shirt). “When people spent the $40 to save time, they reported being in a more positive mood and feeling less stressed,” said Ashley Whillans, lead author of both the National Academy of Sciences study and the working paper about couples, and an assistant professor at Harvard Business School. “But it is important to note that even if spending a little to buy time increases well-being, spending a lot may not.” In other words, you can also overdo it. Ms. Whillans and colleagues found that spending $100 to $200 per month on timesaving services maximized satisfaction, but spending more started to reduce it. This could be because outsourcing may cause you to feel as if you can’t do anything yourself. Or perhaps it’s because of the challenges of managing others. Or maybe when you buy so many services, you’re bound to feel some aren’t done well and regret having not saved the money. In a finding from other work by Ms. Whillans, outsourcing unpleasant tasks may also cause some people to feel guilty, because they’re transferring the unpleasantness to someone else. Research on this topic may also be useful to companies. During the 2013-2014 academic year, Stanford University School of Medicine offered timesaving vouchers to doctors as rewards for certain types of work. Doctors who filled in for colleagues, engaged in mentorship and served on committees earned vouchers that could be redeemed for home services (like housecleaning or laundry) or work tasks (like manuscript editing or website design). A recently published study of the program found that it increased perceptions of wellness and satisfaction, and increased productivity. Stanford could have rewarded employees with cash bonuses instead of timesaving vouchers. But as Ms. Whillans’s study suggests, people may actually be happier by saving more time. In addition, employees who feel more supported by their employers perform better and quit less. This means that small contributions to this trade-off — saving time over money — may have benefits for employers as well as individuals. It may even save some marriages.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Fighting to Save America’s Bats,"Op-Ed Contributor Mr. Taylor is the author of several books on caves. Four scientists in Tyvek suits and rubber boots carried an aluminum fishing boat toward an opening in a granite rock face in northern Georgia. Mist cascaded from surrounding mountains, curling over swollen streams, obscuring signs for turnoffs like Warwoman Road. This was “Deliverance” country; the 1972 film was shot nearby. Along with a half-dozen researchers, I stood in the rain on the last day of an unusually warm February as the white-clad figures entered Black Diamond Tunnel, a segment of a never-completed railway begun in the 1850s that is now partly flooded. They set the boat beside a makeshift landing, climbed aboard, switched on helmet lamps and set off down a black river. Christopher Cornelison, a research assistant professor and principal investigator at the BioInnovation Laboratory at Kennesaw State University, watched his colleagues recede into Stygian blackness. Last year, they sprayed an antifungal agent in the tunnel to see if it would protect the bats that live there against a pathogen that has decimated bat populations across the country. Now they were back to see the results. “It’s taken me years to get to this point,” he said. Twelve years ago white-nose syndrome was first detected in a bat in a cave in Schoharie County, in upstate New York. Since then the syndrome’s cause, the fungal pathogen Pseudogymnoascus destructans, has spread across at least 31 states and five Canadian provinces, striking hibernating bats. More than six million are thought to have died. Some infected colonies have experienced a mortality rate of more than 95 percent. P. destructans is one of several pathogens to have invaded the United States, this one having arrived from Europe. How it got here is unclear, although one theory is that it was unwittingly carried into that New York cavern by someone who had come into contact with it in Europe. What is clear are the economic implications. Bats eat insects that damage crops, saving farmers billions of dollars every year on pest control, according to the United States Geological Survey. And the disease continues to spread. Two years ago, it was confirmed in bats in Washington State. We were in Georgia at the height of what researchers informally call “bat season,” when teams head underground in a national response coordinated by the federal Fish and Wildlife Service. For counting and collecting, these researchers sometimes enlist recreational cavers like me from the National Speleological Society. At a time when government seems under unrelenting attack, state and federal agencies, private conservation organizations and universities have been working together to stop this killer. A recent study found that the fungus caused by the pathogen can be killed by ultraviolent light. Efforts are also underway to develop a vaccine. At the Black Diamond Tunnel, scientists had been testing an antifungal agent called B23, derived from an unlikely source, the stem tissues of wild pineapples growing in the Bolivian Amazon basin. With a commercial mosquito fogger bolted to a remote-controlled boat, christened Batilda by Dr. Cornelison’s team, researchers had sprayed several applications of B23 in the tunnel during the previous year. Because the tunnel was man-made and contained few other species, it was a perfect testing ground for this agent. The tunnel’s tricolored bat population numbered over 5,000 in 2013 but was down to 152 in a count last year. “If the numbers are too low today, we may have to abandon the project,” Pete Pattavina, a bat biologist for the federal government, told me as we drove to the site. “It’s hard to justify the continued expense if we only have a few survivors.” Not everyone thinks the efforts are worthwhile. The National Speleological Society, dismayed by the closing of caves on federal land in what it sees as a misguided effort to prevent the spread of white-nose syndrome, thinks the war has been lost, that the government efforts are putting bats at greater risk and that, in any event, the disease is going to run its course. This may be what happened in Europe, where bats appear have developed resistance to it. I don’t agree. While targeted cures like the one being tested in Black Diamond would likely be impractical for most wild caves, they could potentially slow the leading edges of the disease. Kelly Lutsch, a first-year graduate student of Dr. Cornelison, has been surveying concrete culverts along Interstates 75 and 95 through Georgia’s coastal plains. She believes that infected bats using the culverts could be carrying the pathogen south into cave-rich zones near the Florida panhandle. If so, spraying the culverts with B23 might be warranted. One Georgia cave near the Florida border hosts a robust colony of 90,000 southeastern myotis bats. At the Black Diamond Tunnel, the results of the spraying were encouraging. After an hour, the team slowly paddled back to share its results: 178 bats, up by 26 from the last count. Dr. Cornelison cautioned against interpreting this as a success for B23, since other factors could affect the count. Still, he declared himself “ecstatic” that the number was higher, not lower, and plans to test B23 again in the tunnel. “I don’t think we will ever know the full ecological effect” of white-nose syndrome, Mr. Pattavina said. “We only realize the value of biodiversity when catastrophe happens.” But for the moment, for one tiny group of survivors in a Georgia tunnel, there is a glimmer of hope amid the catastrophe.",The New York Times
2018,Filipinos Get a Glimpse of Their Ruined City. The Chinese Get the Contract.,"MARAWI, Philippines — As she approached her house for the first time since militants took over the neighborhood, evidence of a disaster unfolded around Haydee Dimalawang: “ISIS” spray-painted on the door of the family’s completely stripped car, walls gouged by bullets, a kitchen ripped in half by a mortar shell. She felt lucky — relatively. At least her house, in a central neighborhood of Marawi, was still standing. Her neighbor across the street, Alpata Utto, was left with an empty plot. His house had burned down early in the fighting, and weeds had sprouted from the ashes. Islamic State loyalists seized Marawi, a predominantly Muslim city of more than 200,000 people on the Philippine island of Mindanao, more than 10 months ago, leading to months of military siege and devastating American-assisted airstrikes. The residents are finally being allowed to return, but only for a day or two per family to salvage what they can and then leave again. What happens next will depend on how and when the city is rebuilt. And in a central example of how the political wind is shifting in the Philippines, the destruction enabled in part by American military assistance will be repaired by a Chinese-led consortium, officials say. On Tuesday, President Rodrigo Duterte visited China to discuss the project, worth an estimated $1.5 billion, with President Xi Jinping, among other issues, officials said. As residents’ visits to Marawi began, three New York Times journalists were given exclusive access both to those neighborhoods and to some parts of the city still cut off to civilians and littered with ordnance and rubble. Since Mr. Duterte declared victory over the Islamic State loyalists in October, residents have been kept out. For the past five months, they have been scattered across the country. Some moved in with relatives, but many were stuck in open-air, government-sponsored camps for the displaced. After residents protested the delayed return to their city, the military scheduled the short-term visits. Last year, President Duterte admitted that the Philippine security forces had been caught off guard by the militants’ assault on Marawi, and he grudgingly asked for help from the country’s traditional military allies, the United States and Australia. What followed were five months of the most intense clashes the military had faced, with the militants killing hundreds, taking dozens of people hostage and beheading victims on video. In total, the government estimates that some 1,200 people were killed. The insurgent leader Isnilon Hapilon was killed in October, near the end of the siege. But about 200 fighters had managed to escape, and sporadic clashes continued weeks later. Long known as the “Islamic capital” of the Philippines, Marawi has a history of marginalization by the government of the predominantly Catholic country. Even before the siege began, residents would stay away from banks in favor of keeping their money in vaults and doing business among themselves. Many refused to register their property, preferring to stay off government books. As people began returning this week, some said they believed that the Philippine military, not the Islamist militants, had looted their homes. That has only added to the sense of isolation. “Our practice was staying together and closely guarding each other,” said Samira Gutoc, a community organizer from Marawi. “Now, if you’re a Muslim Filipino, you’re going to be suspected of being a part of this.” Across the city, the residents tried to gather up whatever belongings they could: scrap metal to sell in the market, old family photo albums, half-burned high school diplomas. In the center of the city, Dr. Bedoria Macabalang, 52, was inspecting what remained of the family-owned, 50-bed Salaam Hospital, which was one of the city’s most modern health facilities before the siege began. Militants had taken over the hospital and used it as an infirmary for their wounded. On the walls were pro-Islamic State graffiti. “I have had to also let go of the hospital’s 80-plus staff. No one knows what’s going to happen to us,” Dr. Macabalang said. “I can’t cry anymore because all the tears have dried up.” Plans to rebuild the city have been coming together slowly. Mr. Duterte announced last week that most of the contract will be bid out to a group of Chinese companies. But it could be months before the actual work can start. On Tuesday, Mr. Duterte seemed to hint at that relationship — and others — as he addressed a business conference on the Chinese island of Hainan, with Mr. Xi in attendance. “As sovereign equals, the Philippines and China are partners in the building of much-needed infrastructure,” Mr. Duterte said, according to a government transcript. “We are building bridges of greater understanding between our peoples.” Rommel Banlaoi, a political and security analyst, said Marawi’s future would be a critical indicator of the Philippines’ relationship with China. “It is not only a case of counterterror,” he said. “It’s a test for Duterte’s foreign policy.” Over the past year, the Duterte administration has been edging toward closer ties with Beijing. Though the two countries have a territorial dispute over islands in the South China Sea, the prospect of becoming part of China’s Belt and Road infrastructure initiative — which has provided highways, bridges and tunnels to neighboring countries like Thailand, Laos and Cambodia — appears to be moving the Philippines further out of the United States’ orbit. “The Philippine relationship with the U.S. has already changed,” Mr. Banlaoi said. “Duterte doesn’t want the U.S. to lay on the terms anymore.” With the level of destruction so high, Marawi will probably need to be completely razed and rebuilt. But residents are holding on to hope that they will be able to do the work. “We don’t want the Chinese to come in and be paid to destroy our homes,” Ms. Dimalawang said. “This is our city, and we can rebuild it ourselves.” In January, the government made moves to take control of the reconstruction away from the residents. Mr. Duterte released a presidential proclamation classifying much of Marawi’s present area as a military reservation, offering to repay residents for whatever areas are claimed. So far, no payments have been discussed. “I will do what is best for you, so do not hurry me up,” Mr. Duterte said at a news conference this week. “Can you rebuild it with how many billions? Just stay put.” There is certainly danger in any large-scale return right now. Around Marawi, volunteers for the Swiss Foundation for Mine Action distributed leaflets to returning evacuees warning them of unexploded ordnance. Posters showed different types of bombs. One soldier walked past carrying an empty shell of a rocket-propelled grenade, while spent shells of World War II-era ammunition still littered the ground. A “cadaver recovery team” from the health department continues to retrieve remains from the bombed-out areas. When the Times journalists visited, Dr. Khadafi Mapandi’s recovery team had found 12 sets of skeletal remains, and expected to find more.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Finance Isn’t Just for Fat Cats,"Op-Ed Contributor Mr. Pager is the winner of Nicholas Kristof’s 2018 “Win-A-Trip” contest to take a university student on a reporting trip. He and Mr. Kristof recently traveled to Central African Republic. Mr. Pager has also written about doctors in training and a 15-hour road trip in the country. BODA, Central African Republic — Nina Beina, a widowed mother of 11, couldn’t wait to give me a tour of the land she had just bought. She beamed as she showed me the site where her children will build their homes. Ms. Beina isn’t a real estate mogul, and like most people here she has no access to banks or formal loans. But she was able to buy the property through a program arising from one of the hot ideas in the global fight against poverty — microsavings. With the help of Catholic Relief Services, an international humanitarian organization, Ms. Beina and her neighbors recently started their own savings group. The idea is that villagers gather regularly and deposit tiny sums — often less than a dollar — into a pool, which is then lent to a member of the group. The loan is paid back over time, and it is often used to help people start small businesses. For Ms. Beina, the new land for her children will give her more space in her already overcrowded home. For vulnerable populations, especially women, “it empowers them to save,” said Laura Dills, who oversees a range of Catholic Relief Services’ programming, including the organization’s microfinance efforts. “We’re actually building that capacity to go after loans in a very safe setting that’s not going to risk any of their assets.” Some years ago there was a great deal of excitement among philanthropic groups about microlending, but that has worn off a bit. Meanwhile, it seems that microsavings may be the more important part of microfinance. Those savings are then used to make loans as well. Research shows people living in poor households want to save money, and savings groups positively impact household business outcomes and women’s empowerment. Savings groups are also particularly efficient because they don’t involve outside capital and have lower barriers to entry for members. Meeting women like Ms. Beina made it apparent that these savings groups can make a substantial difference for people, especially women, in incredibly difficult circumstances. They provide critical opportunities to some of the world’s poorest communities where access to formal financial institutions is nearly impossible. This is particularly true in Boda, a town that was overtaken by fighting in 2012, where, for many, resources such as markets and schools are still difficult to access. Ms. Beina, for example, hasn’t left the small Muslim enclave where she lives for the past five years. A convert from Catholicism, she was caught in the middle of the conflict that broke out along religious lines. Though the fighting has subsided, Ms. Beina still worries about her safety. But because Boda is no longer considered an emergency zone, the number of aid organizations here is dwindling. As aid groups move on from Boda, savings groups present a sustainable solution. Not only are the costs required for training the groups quite low, but also the members often continue the savings groups beyond the nine-month period during which aid workers provide support. Besides the economic benefits they produce, savings groups also have benefits for social cohesion, particularly in post-conflict areas. “It creates solidarity,” Ms. Dills said. “You’re not going to lend money to people you don’t know.” In Boda, Catholic Relief Services has initiated the creation of 120 savings groups with roughly 1,660 members. The savings have resulted in a variety of investments. Some, like Ms. Beina, have used the available capital to buy land and build homes, while others have enhanced their agriculture businesses by investing in gardening tools or more profitable seeds. Funds have also been used as capital to launch new businesses selling oil, spices or cassava, or to pay for medical expenses. Catholic Relief Services has replicated this success worldwide: The organization has helped start more than 130,000 groups with over 3 million members. These groups, it says, have accumulated more than $22 million in savings. Ms. Beina is already looking forward to her next loan. Once she finishes paying this one back, she plans to use her next loan to expand her crop production. Her main source of revenue — selling cassava — isn’t enough to support her entire family, so she wants to start selling more profitable goods.

2018,Finding Emerging Markets Stocks With Social Consciences,"Until recently, investors interested in emerging market funds had few ways of singling out companies with standout environmental, social and governance records. That has begun to change over the last several years, as the popularity of investing with an eye to these issues has surged. There are now 10 mutual funds and exchange-traded-funds that invest in stocks in emerging markets while making environmental, social and governance performance an explicit part of their mission, according to Morningstar. And early evidence suggests that these feel-good funds have been able to outkick their conventional kin. In 2016, Chris Varco, a managing director at Cambridge Associates, an investment consultant, conducted a study comparing the returns of MSCI’s standard emerging markets index to what’s now known as its Emerging Markets E.S.G. Leaders Index. (The latter is made up of companies with higher scores for environmental, social and governance performance, as ranked by MSCI.) For its first several years, the E.S.G. index outperformed its peer benchmark. Mr. Varco wanted to determine whether that was luck. He crunched the data and concluded that selecting companies based on nonfinancial factors had helped. Simply put, the E.S.G. index did better because the companies within it appeared, on average, to be better run. “There’s yet to be a year where the standard index did better,” he said. Within this niche, there are actively managed options, like the Calvert Emerging Markets Equity and JPMorgan Emerging Markets Equity funds, and indexed ones, like the Nushares E.S.G. Emerging Markets Equity E.T.F., SPDR MSCI Emerging Markets Fossil Fuel Reserves Free E.T.F. and the iShares MSCI E.M. E.S.G. Optimized E.T.F. The iShares offering is built around the MSCI Emerging Markets E.S.G. Focus Index, which resembles the index that Mr. Varco studied but contains fewer stocks. People who opt for funds of this sort should understand that their performance will diverge from that of well-known emerging-markets benchmarks, said Todd L. Rosenbluth, director of E.T.F. and mutual fund research at CFRA, an investment research firm. “Because the holdings and the weightings differ, the performance is likely to differ,” he said. “E.S.G. strategies tend to have hefty weightings in technology stocks. So when tech is in favor, as it was in 2017, that will help them. If we hit a time when energy or old-line industrials shine, they won’t perform as well.” Some investors may be happy to occasionally sacrifice a tincture of return for the sake of ditching polluters. That’s the sort of thinking that undergirds the SPDR MSCI Emerging Markets Fossil Fuel Reserves Free E.T.F. “Energy conservation and lowering their carbon footprint is something that a lot of people are trying to do,” including in their portfolios, said Matthew J. Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research for State Street Global Advisors in Boston. So the exchange-traded fund is composed of companies in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index minus those that own fossil-fuel reserves, such as oil producers and coal miners, he said. Nuveen, sponsor of the Nushares E.S.G. Emerging Markets Equity E.T.F., constructs its index differently, but it, too, aims to cut the number of air polluters in the portfolio by favoring companies with lower carbon-dioxide emissions. “E.S.G. investors expect low carbon, and standard E.S.G. screens won’t necessarily give you that,” said Martin Y. G. Kremenstein, head exchange-traded funds for Nuveen. Over the last five years, emerging markets have chugged upward, with MSCI’s conventional index gaining an annualized average of 4.99 percent. In the first quarter, the index gained 1.42 percent. MSCI’s Emerging Markets E.S.G. Leaders Index has outpaced its peer — rising an annualized average of 8.6 percent over the last five years, though only 1.01 percent in the first quarter. When Mr. Varco, of Cambridge Associates, did his study, he didn’t dig into precisely why companies in the E.S.G. index might excel or, conversely, why ones in the conventional index might lag. But he said one reason might be that state-owned enterprises, like Brazil’s Petrobras, where a prominent bribery scandal has implicated dozens of government officials, loom large in the standard index. These outfits are often not run as well as their nonstate kin, he said. Managers of actively managed funds echoed his assessment. “The MSCI index includes a lot of energy” state-owned enterprises, said Elena Tedesco, a portfolio manager of the Calvert Emerging Markets Equity Fund. “Those companies tend to have very poor governance — they allocate capital to fulfill political goals. The Russian gas companies, for example, don’t have a strong reputation for creating value for shareholders. They’d rather build a pipeline to fulfill a political need.” Gazprom, the giant Russian natural-gas producer, is majority state-owned and a part of the standard index. Leon Eidelman, the lead manager of the JPMorgan Emerging Markets Equity Fund, is even more broadly skeptical of state-owned companies and their aims. “The Chinese state doesn’t work for you,” he said. “It works for itself. Its goals and incentives aren’t aligned with those of minority shareholders.” Two Chinese state-owned enterprises — China Mobile and China Construction Bank — are among the top 10 constituents of the standard index. Put differently, the problem with state-run companies, besides potential political agendas, is governance. They don’t have procedures in place, as developed-world public companies typically do, to ensure that minority investors are treated fairly and have access to all the information they need about company operations, investments and finances. Philippe Langham, senior portfolio manager for the RBC Emerging Markets Fund, said concerns about governance in the emerging world extend beyond state-owned ventures. Plenty of emerging-market outfits without state ties don’t hew to developed-world standards, he said. Assessing environmental, social and governance performance, he added, isn’t just a matter of ethics when investing in emerging markets. “For me, the emphasis is sustainability,” he said. “Companies that plan for the future, with adequate infrastructure and R.&D., and look to build long-term relationships with all their stakeholders, I believe they’ll ultimately have higher returns.” And governance isn’t the only nonfinancial factor that aids in these sorts of assessments, said Thomas Wilson, co-manager of the Hartford Schroders Emerging Markets Equity Fund. Environmental and social performance also “relate to the integrity and quality of management,” he said. “They provide a window into whether management is good at their jobs.” The case for investing in the emerging world can be boiled down to a word: growth. Compared with developed countries, emerging ones are, on average, growing faster, and they are pulling hundreds of millions of people into the middle class for the first time. That’s giving rise to new companies and creating huge new markets for existing ones, said Binu George, portfolio strategist for the emerging markets team at GMO, an asset management firm. “There are 24 emerging-market countries,” he said. “In those countries and their stocks, there’s a massive opportunity for you to make money.” With that faster growth comes greater risk: On average, the returns of emerging markets stocks roller coaster more than those of developed market ones. “The asset class is incredibly volatile, and yet there are still many great businesses in the emerging world,” said Mr. Eidelman of the JPMorgan fund. Over time, patience — and attention to environmental, social and governance factors — can pay off, leading to superior performance, he said. “The time frame really matters. If you’re looking to own a business for a long time — not just trade a stock — then factors around how that business interacts with all of its stakeholders become much more important. If you’re just trading monthly, the fact that you think the management is dodgy might not matter.” For someone committed to so-called socially responsible investing, including a relatively small allocation — say 5 or 10 percent of a diversified portfolio — to this niche can make sense, added Mr. Rosenbluth of CFRA. “E.S.G. factors are perhaps even more relevant outside the U.S., especially governance,” he said. “This sounds obvious, but in less developed countries, the companies have less developed governance. By investing in ones that are providing better governance, you’re encouraging other companies to act more responsibly.”",The New York Times
2018,Finding Peace of Mind for Your Home Away From Home,"Geneva Simms and Nathan Lavertue were driving to their country house in Dutchess County one recent weekend when there was yet another spring snowstorm.

That is because during his lunch break in Brooklyn, Mr. Lavertue had turned on the heat remotely, using his smartphone. “We have three cameras — two exterior and one interior — four Nest thermostats, two Echo Dots, one Echo Show, one traditional Echo and 10 smart lights. And also the Nest smoke detector,” said Mr. Lavertue, a global experience design director for IBM, who installed the equipment himself. “The cameras are for security, but they provide plenty of entertainment. I have really funny footage of Geneva running after a U.P.S. truck.” Like a lot of second-home buyers, Mr. Lavertue and Ms. Simms, a personal trainer, corporate wellness coach and founder of Empower to Power, were overwhelmed at first with figuring out how to protect their country house when they weren’t there. The married couple, who rent in Brooklyn and had never owned before buying their Stanfordville house last year, researched their options and then turned to do-it-yourself smart home components. They plan to add another smoke/carbon monoxide detector, several more smart thermostats and a digital front-door lock from August to complete their home security system. But while smart home systems can offer second-home owners peace of mind while they are away, they cannot step in if a pipe bursts or a driveway is buried beneath a pile of snow. For that reason, many homeowners, even those with extensive smart home systems, supplement the technology with old-fashioned human help. “Usually, I suggest a two-pronged approach,” said Jessica Chutka-Pelletier, a broker with Douglas Elliman in Chappaqua, who sold Mr. Lavertue and Ms. Simms their home. “For ease of use, I suggest apps and a lot of DIY things, then I give my buyers a list of local people to call.” Among the professionals she recommends is her husband, who happens to be a general contractor. Mr. Lavertue and Ms. Simms hired him to do renovation work and a lawn care company to plow their driveway. It was through word of mouth that Justin Brent got his start. Mr. Brent is based in Pound Ridge, in Westchester County, and has worked in the town’s maintenance department for more than two decades. He is also chief of the local fire department. And he is the proprietor of Pound Ridge Home Management LLC, which he runs with his wife, overseeing more than a dozen second homes in the area. “I started out doing some landscaping, and word spread from there,” said Mr. Brent, who checks on his customers’ homes once a week, conducting a 21-point inspection, from the mailbox to the basement, for a fee of $55 an hour. The company also provides ancillary services, or will find third parties to do so, from power-washing furniture to changing light bulbs and fixing HVAC and plumbing systems. “These are weekenders, so if they come up on a Friday night and the heat is broken,” he said, “it is an emergency and they have to call the heating company to come.” Mr. Brent said he addresses any problems that arise during the week, “so that when they come up, they only have to turn the key in the door and turn on the lights and enjoy themselves.” Mary Trier has a similar company on the North Fork of Long Island. Her job, particularly during the fall and winter months, centers on coastal erosion and protecting homes from storm damage. “I thrive on the bad weather,” she said. “I am fixated with the weather report.” Ms. Trier provides a range of services, from securing beachside steps to critter control, and charges a monthly retainer of $120 to $125, which includes weekly property checks. For anything more, she charges an hourly fee of $25 to $30. “I started out with just a few houses and that stayed constant for a while,” she said. “But recently business has exploded.” “For a long time, the North Fork was somewhat sleepy,” said Sheri Winter Clarry, an associate broker at Corcoran in the North Fork, who often refers clients to Ms. Trier. “There was always a summer market, but more people are now coming for the weekends year round, and demand for services like Mary’s has grown.” For those who want to supplement services like Mr. Brent’s or Ms. Trier’s with smart home systems, there are a number of options, from traditional firms like ADT to relative newcomers like Nest. Nest, which is owned by Google, makes products that feature modern, sleek designs but are relatively costly. The Nest Secure system starts at about $500, with the option to buy additional products like Nest Hello, a $229 video doorbell, or Nest x Yale lock, a $279 key-free deadbolt operated with a passcode. “The system provides peace of mind,” said Maxime Veron, director of product strategy at Nest, adding that the majority of the company’s customers install the systems themselves. While Nest is largely a la carte, many companies offer comprehensive options, including services like ADT Pulse or SimpliSafe. These systems have a lower upfront cost and offer 24/7 monitoring, although they can also come with lengthy, multiyear contracts and expensive termination fees. Wirecutter, a product review and recommendation site owned by The New York Times, gave SimpliSafe its top score, citing the round-the-clock monitoring and the fact it does not require long-term contracts. PCMag.com also recommended SimpliSafe, giving it four out of five stars, as well as vivint.SmartHome, which it gave four and a half stars. PCMag.com awarded Nest Secure just three stars, citing the high cost and limited voice commands. Of course, some homeowners can’t be bothered to deal with installing smart home security systems, or face having to work with management companies. They prefer to have someone on site at all times. That was one reason Joanne Intrieri recently decided to buy a home at the Four Seasons Private Residences Fort Lauderdale. Ms. Intrieri and her husband, who are based in New York City, already own property in Arizona and Pennsylvania. “We know what it’s like to have sandstorms and snowstorms, and have to find people to fix things when you aren’t there,” she said. At the Four Seasons project, owners will have all the conveniences of a hotel, as well as on-site managers to cater to most needs. “Having been there and done that,” she said, “I don’t want to have to lift a finger.”",The New York Times
2018,Finding a Place (and a Decent Kitchen) to Call Her Own,"The Hunt During and after graduate school at Pace University, Haoran Yang lived in Chelsea with roommates. Then, three years ago, she found a new roommate situation on Craigslist and moved into a one-bedroom condominium in Midtown East near Sutton Place. For $1,600 a month, she occupied the bedroom. The condominium’s owner, a retired woman who traveled often, took a curtained-off corner of the living room. “We’ve become like a family,” said Ms. Yang, who came to New York from China to study finance. “I am a twentysomething and she is older than my mom, and she treated me like a daughter.” Late last summer, Ms. Yang landed a new job in her field, financial services, and decided it was time for her own place. A friend referred her to Sangmi Park, a licensed salesperson at Keller Williams TriBeCa. She knew she needed help with the hunt — it would save her time, she said, and give her access to more options. Ms. Yang, now 29, wanted a decent kitchen and a location with an easy commute to her Midtown office. For her monthly budget, $2,000 to $2,200, she assumed she would find a studio in a doorman building, similar to the condo building. But Ms. Park told her that if she wanted more space — and didn’t mind giving up amenities like an elevator or laundry room — she could instead get a one-bedroom in a no-frills building on the Upper East Side. “That’s perfect, because I don’t mind a walk-up,” Ms. Yang said. “I have a lot of stuff, and I feel more comfortable if I have a separate room.” One evening last fall, Ms. Park took her to see two relatively spacious top-floor one-bedrooms in the East 70s, each for $2,150. One faced Third Avenue. “I could hear the traffic come and go,” Ms. Yang said. “Even at 6 or 7 p.m., the avenue is very busy.” And the kitchen was a collection of appliances against a wall. The apartment felt outdated — but not as outdated as the second unit they saw, which faced away from the avenue. The next day was tightly scheduled. A one-bedroom for $2,000, also in the East 70s, was nicely renovated. But while the pictures made it look spacious, the bedroom was tiny and the hallway narrow. Ms. Yang and Ms. Park moved on to the East 80s, where the saw a building with two one-bedrooms available, on the top floor and the ground floor; the rents were $2,150 and $2,300, respectively. Ms. Yang fell for the sunny top-floor apartment, with its open kitchen. But the listing agent, en route, informed them by text that it had been rented earlier that morning. The ground-floor unit wasn’t ideal. “The layout was like a train, long and skinny,” Ms. Yang said. Plus, it faced the trash cans. Most of all, it was situated just beyond the building’s entrance, with its double doors. “I’ve never lived in that kind of building,” Ms. Yang said. “The door slams so hard. I didn’t want to live on the ground floor in an apartment close to the door.” In her previous doorman buildings, the door was always open and attended. But she was encouraged. The apartments she had seen were generally livable. Still, even if a place was otherwise fine, there was often one dealbreaker: a noisy street, a dingy bathroom, a tiny bedroom. Nearby, another top-floor apartment was available for $2,100. Up they climbed. This one was still occupied. It had two windows looking out onto the street, a separate eat-in kitchen and a quiet bedroom facing the back. And Ms. Yang was excited to learn that the outgoing tenant was eager to sell some furniture. “Usually, a $2,100 apartment doesn’t look this finished,” Ms. Park said. “We took action right away.” Ms. Yang left a deposit on the spot. Two more places were still on the schedule, but one was on busy East 72nd Street and the other, on Second Avenue near her old neighborhood, was dimly lit. “It was obvious what was the best out of all of them,” Ms. Park said. “The space was right, the location was right, and the furniture really helped.” Ms. Yang paid a broker’s fee of 15 percent of a year’s rent, or almost $3,800, and arrived last winter. For $550, she bought from the departing tenant the sofa — just a year old and originally from Ikea — as well as a large wardrobe against a living-room wall. “Most people want a no-fee apartment, but she was willing to see all the options to find the best one for her, because she is planning to live there for a long time,” Ms. Park said. Ms. Yang ordered some additional furniture and “a lot of cooking utilities, because I cook almost every day,” she said. Her only disappointment is the uneven floor, which slopes so much her kitchen table tilts. “When you walk, you can feel the floor is not even,” she said. “When I am eating dinner, I feel my food is falling.” Everything else, however, is to her liking. “I am very happy for this small place,” she said.",The New York Times
2018,Finland Has Second Thoughts About Giving Free Money to Jobless People,"LONDON — For more than a year, Finland has been testing the proposition that the best way to lift economic fortunes may be the simplest: Hand out money without rules or restrictions on how people use it. The experiment with so-called universal basic income has captured global attention as a potentially promising way to restore economic security at a time of worry about inequality and automation. Now, the experiment is ending. The Finnish government has opted not to continue financing it past this year, a reflection of public discomfort with the idea of dispensing government largess free of requirements that its recipients seek work. ■ Read more: Inside Finland’s basic income experiment Finland has actually reversed course on that front this year, adopting rules that threaten to cut benefits for jobless people unless they actively look for work or engage in job training. “It’s a pity that it will end like this,” said Olli Kangas, who oversees research at Kela, a Finnish government agency that administers many social welfare programs and has played a leading role in the basic-income experiment. “The government has chosen to try a totally different path. Basic income is unconditional. Now, they are pursuing conditionality.” The demise of the project in Finland does not signal an end of interest in the idea. Other trials are underway or being explored in the San Francisco Bay Area, the Canadian province of Ontario, the Netherlands and Kenya. In much of the world, the concept of basic income retains appeal as a potential way to more justly spread the bounty of global capitalism while cushioning workers against the threat of robots and artificial intelligence taking their jobs. But the Finnish government’s decision to halt the experiment at the end of 2018 highlights a challenge to basic income’s very conception. Many people in Finland — and in other lands — chafe at the idea of handing out cash without requiring that people work. “There is a problem with young people lacking secondary education, and reports of those guys not seeking work,” said Heikki Hiilamo, a professor of social policy at the University of Helsinki. “There is a fear that with basic income they would just stay at home and play computer games.” For centuries, thinkers across the ideological spectrum have embraced the notion of basic income. It has gained favor with the social philosopher Thomas More, the laissez faire economist Milton Friedman and the civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., an unusual diversity of support that has enhanced the appeal of the idea as a modern-day solution to economic anxiety in much of the world. Silicon Valley technologists have suggested that basic income could enable humanity to exploit the labor-saving promise of robots absent the fear of mass joblessness. Labor advocates have focused on basic income as a means of increasing bargaining power among workers, limiting the pressure for people to accept poverty wages at dead-end jobs. Other people have advanced basic income as a way of enabling parents to spend more time with their children. Finland’s goals have been modest and pragmatic. The government hoped that basic income would send more people into the job market to revive a weak economy. Under Finland’s traditional unemployment program, those lacking jobs are effectively discouraged from accepting temporary positions or starting businesses, because extra income risks the loss of their benefits. The basic income trial, which started at the beginning of 2017 and will continue until the end of this year, has given monthly stipends of 560 euros ($685) to a random sample of 2,000 unemployed people aged 25 to 58. Recipients have been free to do as they wished — create start-ups, pursue alternate jobs, take classes — secure in the knowledge that the stipends would continue regardless. The Finnish government was keen to see what people would do under such circumstances. The data is expected to be released next year, giving academics a chance to analyze what has come of the experiment. In the meantime, Finland has already moved on to consider a broader revamping of its social service programs. It is studying a new form of social welfare policy now in effect in Britain: so-called universal credit, which rolls existing government aid programs into one monthly lump sum payment. “The social security system is fragmented and has a lot of bureaucracy,” said Liisa Heinamaki,who is overseeing a project exploring ways to reorganize that system. “Discussion about basic income is not over, but it is a part of the larger discussion now.” In Britain, the shift to universal credit has poor people reeling, depriving many of them of government support while their cases shift from the old system. Benefits have increased for some people, but many recipients have wound up with less. In Finland, where the social safety net is famously generous, a structure like Britain’s could yield the very thing basic income is supposed to deliver: a guarantee that every member of society can be assured of sustenance and shelter. This may be the main reason that basic income has lost momentum in Finland: It is effectively redundant. Health care is furnished by the state. University education is free. Jobless people draw generous unemployment benefits and have access to some of the most effective training programs on earth. “In a sense,” said Mr. Hiilamo, the social policy professor, “Finland already has basic income.”",The New York Times
2018,Fire Kills 3 in Close-Knit Queens Village Community,"Everyone on this quiet stretch of 211th Street, in the Queens Village neighborhood, knew the Kainth family. Their children played together on the sidewalks nearest 93rd Avenue and in backyards that blended together, unfenced. Baby showers, birthdays and weddings were shared occasions. Women in need of a facial or eyebrow shaping knew they could find the pampering inside the Kainth family’s two-story home, where each visitor was met with a hug, a kiss and a warm welcome. But five minutes before midnight on Saturday, a fire ripped through the home shared that night by four generations of the Kainth family. The blaze killed three occupants and critically injured three others, including an 8-year-old girl, the authorities said. In all, firefighters removed 11 people from the charred home. “All of these houses are like family,” said Doreen Ramnauth, 70, who lives two doors down and ran outside as her friend’s house was engulfed by flames. “It was like, you can’t even describe it,” Ms. Ramnauth said on Sunday. “It was extremely bad.” All 11 people were taken to hospitals, where Ragvir Kaur-Kainth, 82, Pyara Kainth, 87, and Harleen Kaur, 32, were pronounced dead, the police said. The critically injured child remained at Nassau University Medical Center in East Meadow, on Sunday, and two men, both in their 50s, were in critical condition at Queens Hospital Center in Jamaica, the police said. The other victims, a 6-year-old boy and four men ranging in age from 18 to 45, were in stable condition, the police said. The cause of the fire at 93-20 211th Street remains under investigation. On Sunday morning, the house’s exterior, from the first floor to the attic, was blackened. Glass from the windows lay scattered across the front and side lawns, along with personal belongings and the house’s front door. The siding on a neighboring home also suffered significant damage from the flames. Ms. Ramnauth stared at the ruin from the sidewalk across the street and wiped away tears, recalling the horrifying events from the night before. She said she went outside after her grandson ran into her room and alerted her to the fire. She screamed, fearful that the neighbors she knew so well were in peril, and that the blaze might spread to her own home. She said she held the wife of Ranjit Kainth, the owner of the house, who cried in her arms before being taken to the hospital for difficulty breathing. “She kept saying, ‘Paaji’ and ‘Biji’ are gone,” Ms. Ramnauth said. Mr. Kainth’s parents, who perished in the fire, were known by the Punjabi nicknames, meaning “father” and “mother,” Ms. Ramnauth said. Neighbors said they were familiar faces who waved hello to everyone they passed on their daily morning walks. She said Mr. Kainth’s son jumped from the attic window to escape the flames, and was in significant pain when firefighters brought him out on a stretcher. Ms. Kaur was his sister, she said. Onlookers described the tree-lined residential block as a tight-knit community, where neighbors help raise each other’s children, and first-name basis is standard. The block’s older women were all “aunties” and older men were “uncle.” Babzy Sukhdeo, 77, held Ms. Ramnauth as the two cried together later Sunday. Ms. Sukhdeo, a neighbor of 30 years who lived around the corner, said the Kainth family had a house full of relatives during the weekend, like they usually did. Their other daughter, who lives in North Carolina, was planning a summer wedding at a Hindu temple in Queens, Ms. Sukhdeo said. During the festivities, she said she had offered to house two or three of the Kainth’s relatives. “We always helped each other out like that,” she said, recalling how she would leave her keys with the Kainths when she visited her son in Florida, so they could feed her cat. Another longtime resident, Phillip Dhanpaul, 56, said his neighbors watch over his house when he travels to Guyana. “We all look out for each other here,” he said. “We’re all good neighbors.” Ms. Ramnauth, who has lived on the block for 32 years, waved her hand at the surrounding homes, and shook her head. “It’s so sad to lose someone in this neighborhood,” she said. “This block will never be the same.”",The New York Times
2018,"Fire at South China Karaoke Bar Kills 18, and Suspect Is Arrested","BEIJING — A fire that tore through a karaoke bar in southern China in the early hours of Tuesday killed 18 people, the police said, and a man was arrested on suspicion of arson hours later. A brief initial police account of the blaze in Qingyuan, a city in Guangdong Province, said firefighters received an emergency call about 30 minutes past midnight. By the time they extinguished the fire about 25 minutes later, the karaoke bar was gutted. In addition to the 18 dead, the police said, five people rescued from the fire were hospitalized. “According to a preliminary investigation, the blaze was arson,” the online statement from the Qingyuan police said. “Currently, the public security authorities are stepping up their investigation.” Video footage shown by Chinese news outlets showed bystanders watching helplessly as intense flames flared out of the three-story building containing the karaoke bar and climbed up its walls. The Qingyuan police said they detained a suspect, a 32-year-old man named Liu Chunlu, at 10:50 a.m. Tuesday. A reporter for CCTV, the state-run broadcaster, said online that the fire had been started by a person who had been in a quarrel beforehand. That report, which did not cite the source of the account, said the person had used a motorbike to block the only entrance to the karaoke club, then lit the fire at the door. The China News Service, a state-run news agency, said that the police in Qingyuan — an industrial and commercial center — had blocked off roads to catch the person responsible. The police did not say how many of the dead were found inside the bar. Often karaoke bars in China feature small rooms padded with carpet, and at least some of the dead may have been trapped in such rooms. The deadly fire is likely to prompt another round of calls from the Chinese government to tighten up safety, especially in the crowded fringes of cities and industrial zones where fires often break out. After a fire roared through an apartment on the outskirts of Beijing in November, killing 19 people, the city intensified a program to expel migrant workers who live in such areas, displacing hundreds of thousands of people.",The New York Times
2018,"Fire at Trump Tower Kills One, Police Say","A 67-year-old man died after being injured in a fire at Trump Tower in Midtown Manhattan on Saturday, the police said. The man, Todd Brassner, was in his apartment on the 50th floor at the time of the fire, which was reported around 5:30 p.m., the police said. He was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Four firefighters sustained injuries that were not life-threatening, Fire Commissioner Daniel A. Nigro said at a news conference. He said the apartment, a large unit that was heavily furnished, was “virtually entirely on fire.” Video footage showed flames bursting through broken windows. Neither President Trump nor his family was in the building, a Fifth Avenue skyscraper that is the calling card of his real estate business. The commissioner said firefighters went with the Secret Service to inspect the president’s residence. While the rest of the building had a “considerable amount of smoke,” it was not immediately clear if it reached Mr. Trump’s unit, he said. More than 200 firefighters responded to the fire, the cause of which was unknown, the commissioner said. Mr. Trump, who was in Washington at the time, said on Twitter that the tower’s construction helped confine the fire. The commissioner said the upper floors that are home to residences do not have fire sprinklers. “It’s a well-built building,” he said. “The building sure stood up quite well.” While the building is subject around the clock to extra security by law enforcement, extra fire protection happens only when the president is there, Commissioner Nigro said. The authorities restricted passers-by from the area directly in front of the tower, keeping them out of the street and on the sidewalk on the opposite side of Fifth Avenue. Lalitha Masson, a 76-year-old resident, called it “a very, very terrifying experience.” “When I saw the television, I thought we were finished,” said Ms. Masson, who lives on the 36th floor with her husband, Narinder, who is 79 and has Parkinson’s disease. “I started praying that this was our end. I called my oldest son and said goodbye to him because the way it looked everything was falling out of the window, and it reminded me of 9/11.” She said that she did not get any announcement about leaving, and that when she called the front desk no one answered. Dennis Shields, a resident who said he lived on the 42nd floor, described the scene. “You could smell the smoke and you could hear things falling like through the vents,” he said. “It just smelled like sulfur.” He said there were no orders to evacuate but he received a text message from Mr. Trump’s lawyer, Michael D. Cohen. Mr. Shields, who said he grew up with Mr. Cohen, continued: “He said, ‘Are you in the building?’ I said, ‘Yes.’ He said, ‘You better get out ASAP.’ That’s how I knew to get out, otherwise I’d still be in there.” In January, a small electrical fire broke out near the top of the building. Officials at the time indicated it was in the building’s heating, ventilation and air-conditioning system. A firefighter was hurt by falling debris and two civilians were injured.",The New York Times
2018,Fire in Mexican Prison Kills at Least 6 Police Officers,"VERACRUZ, Mexico — Six police officers died on Sunday from smoke inhalation after prisoners started a fire while resisting an effort to transfer dangerous inmates out of a prison in Mexico’s Gulf Coast state of Veracruz, the authorities said. Gov. Miguel Ángel Yunes of Veracruz said a seventh person had died, but it was unclear whether that person was an inmate or a prison guard. Mr. Yunes said four “highly dangerous” inmates had been helping run criminal networks in the area around La Toma prison in the town of Amatlán de los Reyes, so officials had decided to transfer them to a maximum-security federal prison. The governor did not name the criminal gang involved, but the area was long dominated by the Zetas cartel. When local police officers, in support of the state police, entered the prison to get the four inmates for transfer, they were apparently ambushed by prisoners, who blocked their escape and lit a fire that suffocated six officers, the governor said. “The six police officers were attacked and were enclosed in an area with no exit,” Mr. Yunes said. “The inmates started a fire, and with the smoke, they caused the asphyxiation and death of the six police officers.” The seventh dead man was not wearing a uniform and could have been either an inmate or a guard, Mr. Yunes said. The man’s body was being examined. Seven inmates were injured, two seriously, and 15 police officers were hospitalized, one with serious injuries, the authorities said. Mexico’s largely antiquated, overcrowded and poorly guarded prisons have been the scenes of frequent riots and uprisings. In October, 16 inmates died during a prison riot in the northern Mexican border state of Nuevo León. In February 2016, at another lockup in Nuevo León, 49 prisoners died when two factions of the Zetas cartel clashed.",The New York Times
2018,Firing of House Chaplain Causes Uproar on Capitol Hill,"Speaker Paul D. Ryan’s abrupt decision to dismiss the House chaplain triggered an uproar on Friday over religion, pitting Republican against Republican and offering Democrats a political opportunity in a year already moving their way. Mr. Ryan moved quietly two weeks ago to remove the chaplain, the Rev. Patrick J. Conroy — so quietly that some lawmakers assumed the Catholic priest was retiring. But in an interview on Thursday with The New York Times, Father Conroy said he was blindsided when Mr. Ryan asked him to resign, and suggested politics — specifically a prayer he gave in November when Congress was debating a tax overhaul — may have been a factor in the speaker’s decision. Father Conroy prayed then for lawmakers to “guarantee that there are not winners and losers under new tax laws, but benefits balanced and shared by all Americans.” Shortly after, he said, he was admonished by Mr. Ryan of Wisconsin, who is also a Roman Catholic. “Padre, you just got to stay out of politics,” he recalled the speaker saying. As reports of the dismissal circulated in the Capitol, some Republicans, in a closed-door meeting on Friday morning, demanded an explanation from Mr. Ryan, while Democrats commandeered the House floor in a boisterous, if unsuccessful, attempt to force the House to investigate Mr. Ryan’s decision. At the House Republican meeting, Mr. Ryan told lawmakers that complaints about Father Conroy’s pastoral care — not politics or prayer — led to his decision, according to several who attended. The speaker’s spokeswoman, AshLee Strong, said simply that he had “made the decision he believes to be in the best interest of the House.” But the dismissal appears to be an unforced error in a political year when Republicans cannot afford mistakes. The controversy exposed long-simmering tensions between Roman Catholics and evangelical Christians over who should be lawmakers’ religious counselor. And a public clash between Southern evangelical Republicans and Northern Catholics could play to the advantage of Democrats, who are pressing hard to bring working-class Catholic regions in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin back into the Democratic fold. The controversy was heightened when Representative Mark Walker, Republican of North Carolina and a Baptist minister, said Thursday in an interview with The Hill newspaper that he hoped the next chaplain of the House might come from a nondenominational church tradition who could relate to members with wives and children. Catholic Democrats quickly called his remarks anti-Catholic, as Catholic priests are celibate, and Mr. Walker’s spokesman later said Mr. Walker was not excluding a particular faith group. One Republican, Representative Peter T. King of New York, took issue with the comments. “To be excluding one religion up front, that has all sorts of connotations coming from the evangelical community,” Mr. King said in an interview. He said he had received several inquiries from priests about Mr. Ryan’s decision, and he told the speaker, “This issue is not going to go away that quickly.” A House Democratic aide, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations, said Mr. Ryan gave the Democratic leader, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, an additional reason for Father Conroy’s ouster: Mr. Ryan said he was upset that the chaplain had granted an interview to The National Journal. In the interview, Father Conroy expounded on matters like sexual harassment and a possible spiritual crisis in Congress. He said he was asked during his job interview whether he had ever molested a child. And while he said he had never been asked to counsel a victim of sexual harassment or assault, he had handled cases of workplace abuse during his tenure in the House. “Think about it: Who are the people that run for office?” he was quoted as saying. “Are they all highly skilled in every endeavor? No! They’re not. Many of them, I can tell you, don’t know how to say hello in the hallway, let alone work with office people that maybe they don’t think they have to listen to.” Ms. Pelosi issued a statement arguing that Mr. Ryan did not have the authority to dismiss the chaplain. “I have expressed my forceful disagreement with this decision to the speaker,” she said. “It is truly sad that he made this decision, and it is especially bewildering that he did so only a matter of months before the end of his term.” The outrage broke down largely along party lines. Of 148 members of Congress who signed a letter to Mr. Ryan demanding answers on why he ousted Father Conroy, just one, Representative Walter B. Jones of North Carolina, was a Republican. “This will have ramifications,” Mr. Jones said Friday afternoon. “This is bigger than Father Conroy and the House of Representatives. This is about religion in America.” The controversy was multifaceted, pitting evangelicals against Catholics but also resurfacing lingering anger over this Congress’s singular accomplishment, the 10-year, $1.5 trillion overhaul of the tax code. To supporters of that legislation, especially to one of its chief architects, Mr. Ryan, the prayer issued by Father Conroy would have stung: “May all members be mindful that the institutions and structures of our great nation guarantee the opportunities that have allowed some to achieve great success, while others continue to struggle,” the priest said in the midst of the debate. “May their efforts these days guarantee that there are not winners and losers under new tax laws, but benefits balanced and shared by all Americans.” Father Conroy, who was named to the post in 2011 by another Catholic Republican speaker, John A. Boehner, said that he did not regard his November prayer as political in nature. “If you are a hospital chaplain, you are going to pray about health,” he said. “If you are a chaplain of Congress, you are going to pray about what Congress is doing.” He said Mr. Ryan’s remarks to him afterward marked the only time anyone from the speaker’s office had chastised him for veering into the political realm. “I’ve never been talked to about being political in seven years,” he said. In an election that ultimately will revolve around President Trump, the controversy may well prove ephemeral. “Whatever Democrats try to do, if they try to politicize this or capitalize on this, I just think it is way too obscure,” said Douglas Heye, a longtime Republican political strategist and a Catholic. “If you are having a larger conversation about ‘Catholic issues,’ Trump is going to dominate that.” Ten years ago on Capitol Hill, the number of Catholic Democrats in the House was more than double the number of Catholic Republicans. Now it is nearly even. Some on the left see an emerging issue for Mr. Ryan and his supporters. “Partisans will likely frame this as a Catholic versus evangelical contest,” said Christopher J. Hale, a strategist who did Catholic outreach for President Barack Obama’s re-election campaign. “They made a political football out of a good Catholic priest.” The spat is particularly pointed because religious power in Washington has shifted drastically under Mr. Trump to white evangelical leaders. Unlike Mr. Obama, who relied regularly on a religiously diverse group of interfaith advisers, including prominent Catholics, Mr. Trump has elevated a select group of conservative evangelicals who routinely defend his political agenda, and it is rare to see a Catholic bishop in the White House. Mr. Trump himself famously feuded with Pope Francis during his 2016 presidential campaign over Mr. Trump’s push to build a wall on the southern border with Mexico, which Francis called “not Christian.” Last year, some of Mr. Trump’s evangelical advisers sought to quiet Vatican criticism of the rightward direction of American Catholicism. Before Francis became pope, the Vatican seemed to favor Republican mainstay issues, such as opposition to abortion and gay marriage. Francis’ rise helped reset the role of Catholicism in American public life, and prioritized political and economic messages on immigration and climate change. The pope, like Father Conroy, is a Jesuit, an order of priests viewed by some as more liberal. Father Conroy’s resignation is all the more contentious in Catholic circles because Mr. Ryan is a Catholic conservative. “We are a long way from Pope Francis at the White House and in the Capitol,” said John Carr, the director of the Initiative on Catholic Social Thought and Public Life at Georgetown University. “The divisions are greater, they are more stark and they are more angry.” On Friday, the Catholic Association, a more conservative group, came to Mr. Ryan’s defense. Maureen Ferguson, a senior policy adviser with the organization, called criticism surrounding his decision to ask Father Conroy to step down “downright absurd.” “Anyone who knows Speaker Ryan knows he is a devoted Catholic,” she said. “Much ado is being made about nothing.” For others, it far more serious. The Rev. James Martin, a Jesuit priest and an editor at large of America magazine, said he has heard from Catholics who are “dismayed” that a chaplain would be fired for apparently defending the poor, and he worries about the anti-Catholic dog-whistling. “The implication that, as one legislator said, a ‘family man’ would be more suitable smacks of anti-Catholicism,” Father Martin said. “By that yardstick, Jesus wouldn’t qualify either.” OpinionGail Collins",The New York Times
2018,"First, Final Exams. Then, Perhaps, the Stanley Cup Finals.","BOSTON — Ryan Donato played his first Stanley Cup playoff game for the Boston Bruins last Saturday night, 29 days after his Harvard season ended with an overtime loss to Clarkson in their conference tournament semifinals. Although he left college hockey, he remains one of Harvard’s 6,700 undergraduate students trying to finish class work at the end of the spring semester and get through final exams in May. The Bruins have allowed Donato to miss occasional practices that conflict with his classes, and he stays in contact with his professors to keep up on class assignments while on the road with the N.H.L. team. “He’s wired a special way to deal with everything that’s been going on in the last couple of months,” said Donato’s brother Jack, his teammate this year at Harvard. “He’s a driven kid, and he always has been, whether it’s hockey or academics.” With family, teammates and friends in attendance, Donato played his first game with the Bruins, at home against the Columbus Blue Jackets, on March 19, having signed a two-year, entry-level contract the night before. He scored on a blistering one-timer in the second period and finished with 3 points in Boston’s 5-4 overtime loss. His father, Ted, the hockey coach at Harvard since 2004, described the night as “kind of surreal.” The next day, while his new teammates were practicing in St. Louis, Donato attended classes in Cambridge and met with his professors to work out the logistics for him to complete the semester. He later flew to meet up with the Bruins for the start of a four-game trip. Since then, Donato, 22, has been living in two worlds, with two residences: a hotel near TD Garden arranged by the Bruins and a four-person room at Winthrop House, his Harvard home for the last two years. “I just want to be ready for the games, so if it’s close to a game, I’m staying at the hotel so I’ll stay focused,” he said, “and maybe if we get back from a road trip at 3 a.m., I get a ride from one of the guys and get dropped off at the dorm.” Brian Gionta, Donato’s teammate on the Bruins and on the United States team at the Pyeongchang Olympics in February, played for four years at Boston College, winning a national title in 2001, before embarking on a long N.H.L. career. Asked about the difficulty of Donato’s chosen path, Gionta, 39, said, “It’s a challenge when you’re going through it as a student, but it’s a much different animal when you’re in this schedule we have, especially at playoff time.” In anticipation of possibly leaving Harvard for the N.H.L. after his junior season, Donato took five classes each semester, instead of the usual four, during this academic year. To complete his sociology degree, he plans to take classes this summer and next, along with online courses. The key to managing his workload this year, he said, has been making sure he maintains good relationships with all of his teachers and communicates regularly. The university’s willingness to accommodate his schedule “is a credit to Harvard,” said Michael Floodstrand, Donato’s Winthrop housemate and hockey teammate. “They appreciate all sorts of talent, and Ryan’s a perfect example of that.” Drafted No. 56 over all by Boston in 2014, Donato played a prep year at the Dexter School in Brookline, Mass., and then one year in the U.S.H.L. before matriculating to Harvard to play for his father. Despite missing four games because of the Olympics, where he shared the lead in goals, Donato still led the Crimson in points with 43. His 26 goals was fourth in Division I. The Ivy League player of the year as a sophomore, Donato was one of the three finalists for this year’s Hobey Baker Award, given to the best player in men’s college hockey. At Harvard, he said, he regularly arrived for practice two hours early, to tape sticks, shoot pucks or work on his core. “I could live at the rink, honestly,” he said. With the Bruins, there have been more games but there has been less practice time. As Gionta put it: “Basically, you play, recover, then do it again. It’s just as much a mental grind as it is a physical one. You’ve got to be prepared day in and day out.” Donato joined the Bruins at an opportune time, when the team was without a couple of its top forwards. He played in the Bruins’ final 12 regular-season games and finished with five goals (two on the power play) and four assists. With Boston close to full strength in the playoffs, his ice time has been more limited, but Coach Bruce Cassidy expects him to contribute when called upon. “He’s a guy that has shown he’s not going to shy away from the moments,” he said. The Bruins lead their first-round series against the Toronto Maple Leafs, three games to one, and can advance to the next round with a victory at home on Saturday. Since being drafted, Donato had been to four summer development camps with Boston, so he was familiar with the Bruins and them with him. Floodstrand, one of next season’s Harvard captains, said he thought Donato might stick around for his senior season, “but when the Olympics happened, that changed everyone’s mind.” When the Harvard season ended and Bruins General Manager Don Sweeney, who played defense at Harvard from 1984 to 1988, offered Donato a contract, his father guided him toward a decision. “I wanted to impress on him all the things he’d expressed to me about what he loved about Harvard — not just the hockey and academics, but the friendships and the people he associated with,” said Ted Donato, who played four years at Harvard and was the most valuable player of the N.C.A.A. tournament when the Crimson won their only national championship, in 1989. “He was well aware of how different it would be,” he added. “It was business he was going into. He was fully appreciative of what he was putting aside in the short term.” For Ryan Donato, the choice accomplished two goals at once: playing in the N.H.L. and playing for the Bruins, the first of seven teams his father played for in his 796-game N.H.L. career. So as Donato the Bruin chases the Stanley Cup, Donato the student will split time between Harvard Yard and TD Garden, between Winthrop House and a downtown hotel. And he couldn’t be happier. “That’s where his passions are,” his father said.",The New York Times
2018,Fishing for Stories via Instagram,"Times Insider delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how news, features and opinion come together at The New York Times. Every fish tale starts with a whopper. This one started with a photograph on Instagram. I was researching a story on the actor Chris Pratt and was surprised that a photograph he posted to the social networking app with his son on a fishing trip had been liked more than 1 million times. Even by celebrity standards, that is a huge number. Donald Trump Jr., another avid angler and Instagram user, whom I profiled last year, garnered tens of thousands of likes for his fishing pictures. And more and more, the people I follow were posting fish tales of their own. How big is the fishing crowd on Instagram, I wondered. It is indeed an active community; #fishing alone has nearly 20 million posts. As I scrolled through hundreds of photographs, I noticed that many anglers posing with their catch exhibited a studied flair, much like fashionistas promoting designer clothes in the early days of Instagram. (A few years ago, models had their own selfie pose called the “fish gape.”) Cultural trends seem to pop up early on the social media site. It’s where I first noticed the popularity of Los Angeles’s Zoe Church, which I recently wrote about, and where Sam Barsky, better known online as “the sweater guy,” gained Internet fame. (I wrote about him, too.) So I decided to explore. Some photographers shared secret fishing holes. Others tagged anglers with whom they seemed to have struck up friendships. The rest, well, bragged about their latest catch. The genre had all the hallmarks of a mature social media phenomenon. A lot of people were promoting brands. So much so, one Twitter commenter asked if the fishing industry now had “influencers.” Noelle Coley of Colorado said she worked with a number of companies, receiving free fishing equipment or apparel in exchange for social media mentions. (Some outlets, like Orvis, a maker of fly fishing equipment, are seeking to increase the number of women in the sport. That’s no surprise, given that recreational fishing is on the rise in the United States and women are an untapped market.) What was most striking, though, were the photographs themselves, which were colorful, immediate and engaging. I reached out to a number of the featured men and women from across the country and asked them to tell me their back stories. While much of America is divided between red and blue states, these anglers recounted experiences that transcend geography and politics. They said they had friends on both coasts, as well as in the middle of the country. Could fishing be the great uniter? That would be no small feat these days, when everything seems politicized. They even wanted to take me fishing. But that’s another story. (A brother once chided me for catching a trout smaller than the purse I owned.) Most of all, though, these fishing enthusiasts were eager to describe how social media helped them document their pastime so they could share it with others. Of course the smartphone itself has revolutionized the way they capture their adventures. Long gone are the days of posing afterward on the dock with a colossal prize, like Ernest Hemingway did when he lived in Key West in the 1930s. As Daniel Giunta, the owner of the sports fishing charter company Double D Charters in Montauk, N.Y., told me, customers want photographs with their catch fresh out of the water — especially since many people choose to release the fish. “Being a captain these days is all about being a good photographer,” he said. “I know where the light is. I know where they need to stand.” Smartphones have also revolutionized how journalists interact with their sources and build an audience for their work. I posted a screenshot of the article I wrote, “Lots of Fish on the Screen,” on my own Instagram account, with some of the more popular hashtags the fishing crowd uses. Right away a number of fishing accounts liked it or posted comments. I got an email from the wife of a fisherman I know in Santa Cruz, Calif. More emails like that followed. One of the men I interviewed posted an excerpt from the story on his Instagram account. Another one told his followers to read it. I even heard from Fishbrain, an app maker based in Stockholm, Sweden, which bills itself as the Facebook of fishing. People can log in to the app and see where fish are biting. Since 2016, the company said, more than 1,000 people have fished in the ponds in New York City’s Central Park, including Harlem Meer. Followers on Instagram already knew that; centralparkfishing has its own hashtag.",The New York Times
2018,Fitting the Contents of a Family Home Into a Rental,"The Hunt For decades, Gary Fritz lived in his family’s house in what is now known as Prospect-Lefferts Gardens, though to him it will forever be Flatbush. When Mr. Fritz’s mother died last fall, the developer who had bought and flipped the vacant house next door expressed interest in the Fritz house, and made the family an offer. Mr. Fritz and his sister agreed to sell the house for around $600,000. With his portion of the proceeds, Mr. Fritz, a percussionist and D.J., hoped to rent a new home with enough space for his music gear and decades of family furniture, heirlooms and antiques. The prospect was overwhelming to Mr. Fritz, 61, who also does music production and is known as Wicked Gary Fritz. Three years ago, his daughter died in a bus accident in Panama while she was on vacation. “Between my daughter passing and my mom passing, I was accumulating all the family stuff,” he said. “When it came time to move, I was like, ‘What am I going to do with all this?’” He knew that he wanted to remain near the area where his family had been for so long. His first approach was to canvass his friends. “I put the word out and asked them if they had any leads at all to send me,” Mr. Fritz said. He posted a note on Instagram and Facebook, where his friend list had topped out at 5,000, forcing him to open a second account. People responded in droves. Some mentioned Facebook’s Gypsy Housing groups, where people post listings. “I joined every Gypsy Housing thing I could find,” he said. One posting there looked right: a three-bedroom in East Flatbush with more than 1,000 square feet, for $2,200 a month. He contacted the agent, Chanel Clark, of the Cobble Hill office of Citi Habitats. The apartment had been on the market for weeks, possibly because of its distance from a subway stop, Ms. Clark said. “Gary needed a lot of space because he was downsizing from a house,” she said. “I was surprised that one person could use all that space.” Mr. Fritz liked it. “Even if I couldn’t set up my music the way I wanted to, I had room to put all the stuff I needed to move,” he said. But his timetable was unclear. The closing for the house sale was postponed several times, and without cash in hand from the sale, he couldn’t proceed with his move. In the meantime, he teamed up with Ms. Clark to hunt for a place. She started with apartments in the low $2,000s. “They were pretty decent spaces,” Mr. Fritz said. “Some of these buildings were brand-spanking new. If you ended up with a headache, you ended up with a brand-new headache rather than a recycled headache.” But not all were big enough for his needs. Ground-floor or back units with yards were especially appealing, as he had tended a thriving garden behind his family house. “I’d go in my garden and come back inside and cook up a meal,” he said, adding that the overflow went to neighbors. “Everyone used to eat out of my yard.” Ms. Clark urged him to increase his budget and to hunt farther afield. A duplex on Pacific Street in Crown Heights, for $2,300, had three bedrooms covering 1,200 square feet, plus a backyard. But because Mr. Fritz was an independent contractor, the landlord was hesitant. “Not everyone was willing to take a chance on him,” Ms. Clark said. “Some landlords prefer someone with a 9-to-5 job, a set salary and pay stubs.” Another duplex in Bedford-Stuyvesant was the best of all. It had three bedrooms, three bathrooms, a cavernous finished basement and a backyard. The rent was $2,990. At 2,500 square feet, it felt like a house “without all the maintenance hassle,” Ms. Clark said. “It is just massive. That apartment was for Gary.” After viewing it, he said, “I looked up to the heavens and whispered to my daughter and my mom, ‘This one gets my vote.’” The rent was on the high side, but Mr. Fritz decided the price was worth it. He was able to rent the garage, too — for a total of $3,100. The buyer of his family’s house gave him 90 days to clear it out, and he moved into his new home last winter. Mr. Fritz paid a broker’s fee of 15 percent of a year’s rent, or just over $5,500. With the proceeds from the house sale, he was able to pay six months’ rent in advance. As attached as he had been to the family homestead, it was falling apart, he said. While preparing to move, he was dismayed to find a basement leak that had damaged his beloved record collection. “The discovery nearly brought me to tears,” he said. He is salvaging what he can. For the move, Mr. Fritz again turned to his many friends, who turned out en masse to help. “It is people from all walks of life,” he said. “Those are my earth angels.” Now Mr. Fritz uses the front bedroom as an office and one of the two back bedrooms for guests. The enormous basement, which has a washer-dryer, is his music studio, still a work in progress. And he has plans for a garden. “It is a lovely space, and it’s the type of space that will make you a little bit envious,” he said. “Until you hear what I am paying for it.”",The New York Times
2018,Five Must-See Artworks at the Renovated Getty Villa,"LOS ANGELES — The Getty Bronze, a Greek statue of a beautiful male athlete with enviable hair that is easily the most celebrated artwork at the Getty Villa, has not been knocked off his pedestal. But he does get a remarkably different treatment — less fanboy, more scholarly — after the extensive, yearlong renovation and reinstallation of the Getty Villa near Malibu, the branch of the Getty Museum dedicated to antiquities that is the former estate of the billionaire oilman J. Paul Getty. Before the renovation, which was done in stages and marks its completion on April 18, this victorious athlete with a dramatic deep-sea discovery story that has inspired legal claims from the Italian government, was something of a diva looming over a small room of his own. Now he’s part of a new large gallery devoted to the Hellenistic world, dating from the death of Alexander the Great in 323 B.C. to the rise of the Roman Empire in 31 B.C. (And the new pedestal is noticeably slimmer.) “When you walk into this space, you realize what a wonderful collection of Hellenistic art we have — before, this work was spread out over 10 galleries,” said Timothy Potts, the Getty Museum’s director, who arrived in 2012 with an expertise in antiquities and with strong ideas for improving the Villa’s academic credentials. One driving force behind the renovation was to put artworks into proper historical context. Mr. Potts and his team have rearranged works in the permanent collection galleries to tell a more chronological story, from 3000 B.C. to 400 A.D., largely presenting Greek works on the first floor and Roman on the second. Gone are the entertaining themes like “gods and goddesses” that mixed figures from different periods in a pantheon of superheroes. Another motivation was to tell a broader, more international story about classical art, going beyond the usual Greek and Roman suspects — Mr. Getty’s original collecting focus — to include art from their Mediterranean and Middle Eastern neighbors. Mr. Potts, who earned his Ph.D. in the art and archaeology of the Middle East, considers objects from that region relevant to our understanding of the classical world. “There isn’t a bubble around the classical world, no hard and fast lines separating one culture from another,” said Mr. Potts, noting that Alexander the Great’s conquests included Central Asia, and that the Roman Empire extended as far as Afghanistan. He was giving a tour of a new gallery called “The Classical World in Context,” which makes its grand debut along with the permanent-collection reinstall. This gallery relies on long-term loans from other institutions to help broaden the Getty’s horizons. He pointed out prime examples of first- to third-century funerary relief portraits from Palmyra, the ancient caravan city in the Syrian desert, borrowed from the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek museum in Copenhagen. “The destruction in Syria today makes the exhibition even more topical, but we didn’t choose this material for that reason,” Mr. Potts said. Rather, he added, he was interested in how these Syrian objects blend an array of cultural influences. “Since Palmyra was on the borderland region between the fringe of the Roman Empire and the Parthian empire, the art reflects the coming together of two traditions,” he said, pointing out the Roman drapery on the limestone objects. Here are five highlights of the re-envisioned Villa, not to be missed. Some are old favorites in new contexts. One comes fresh from long-term storage. But one very prominent statue is no longer on view: the Getty Kouros, a larger-than-life sculpture of a naked young man once thought by museum leaders to be from ancient Greece. Soon after its purchase in 1985, scholars and scientists publicly doubted its authenticity. It was recently on view at the Villa, labeled “Greek, about 530 B.C. or modern forgery.” Mr. Potts is not waffling. “It’s fake, so it’s not helpful to show it along with authentic material,” he said. It will be accessible by appointment. “The Beauty of Palmyra,” 190-210 A.D. Though time has stripped the statues’ color away, scholars now know that many classical Greek and Roman sculptures were originally not white but as vivid as contemporary works by Jeff Koons or Takashi Murakami. You can see evidence of this polychromy painting technique in the showstopper known as “The Beauty of Palmyra,” a limestone funerary sculpture. This heavily bejeweled female figure with Eastern headdress still has flecks of red in her hair and on her cheeks, with gold tints on her pendant necklaces. Kenneth Lapatin, the Getty’s curator of antiquities, considers her a masterpiece “both for the high quality of the carving and for the preservation of all the polychromy.” Statue of a Victorious Youth (the Getty Bronze), 300-100 B.C. Ancient bronzes are exceedingly rare today because the metal was so valuable it was often melted down. But this sculpture, modeled in the style of Lysippos, was preserved by a cosmic accident: a shipwreck in the Adriatic Sea kept it submerged until 1964. Its modeling is powerful, its casting is expert, and the subject of the athletic youth has an illustrious lineage culminating in Michelangelo’s David. The sculpture has been the subject of protracted legal challenges from Italy, which has claimed the work because it was discovered by an Italian fishing trawler and brought back to Italian soil. The Getty has maintained that the piece was found in international waters and its own acquisition was legal. Asked about the status of the court battles, Mr. Potts did not have an update or resolution: “It just goes around the courts,” he said. Caeretan Hydria (Water Jar) With Herakles and Iolaos Attacking the Hydra, 525 B.C. The drama comes straight from Greek mythology: Herakles is poised to smash one snakelike head of the hydra, while Iolaos holds a sickle to another. But the style of the vase is not traditionally Greek: The strange lozenge pattern on the rim, the stars right below it, and even the squared-off shape of the rim are typical of pottery from Etruria, in what is now central Italy. “It’s a Greek myth rendered in a way that’s unmistakably Etruscan,” Mr. Potts said. He praised the vase as one of the prized pieces in the collection, now on view with other Etruscan works: “It’s got everything you want a great vase painting to have: great subject matter, beautifully executed and distinctive local style.” Frescoes From Villa Numerius Popidius Florus at Boscoreale, 1-79 A.D. From its gardens to its architecture, the Getty Villa in Pacific Palisades was modeled on the Villa dei Papiri, a Roman seaside estate that was preserved by the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius in 79 A.D. One new goal in the reinstall, Mr. Potts said, is to create a few moments where you can see what a great ancient estate like this might have contained. For example the walls would not have been painted a cool gray, as they are now, but covered in frescoes, with decorative flourishes and narrative details. These four frescoes fit the bill — they came from another Roman villa active during roughly the same period and were in Getty storage for years. One has a narrative element, but the identity of the figures is a mystery: Some speculate that it’s Socrates and his teacher Diotima. Others, judging by the man’s bare feet and unkempt look, say he is probably a Cynic philosopher, perhaps Diogenes. Roman Statue of Draped Figure, 160-190 A.D. If you visit this seven-foot-tall female figure, see if you can detect the break in her neck. When the Getty acquired the work in 1972, the head was missing — the sculpture consisted of a body covered in flowing drapery. But two years ago, after seeing a photograph of the intact sculpture during research for the reinstall, Jeffrey Spier, the Getty Museum’s senior curator of antiquities, immediately recognized an object on view at the Royal-Athena Galleries in New York as the missing head. “I was at the gallery looking at something else Tim was interested in, and I turned around to see the head just sitting there,” he recalled. “I almost laughed, it was so perfect.” The museum acquired it and turned it over to conservators, who have worked to rejoin it to its body and fill the crack. “We had to come up with a new word for it: recapitation,” Mr. Spier offered, laughing. He never learned why the head was severed, but suspects it was easier to transport and sell on its own.",The New York Times
2018,Five Places to Go in Bangkok,"5 PLACES Bangkok’s Ari neighborhood is increasingly a thicket of sleek high-rise buildings and indie cool-kid hangouts radiating international flavors. If Bangkok’s Ari neighborhood could write its own autobiography, it might be called “From Bureaucrats to Baristas.” For decades, the low-lying leafy district was known mainly for its federal ministries, municipal administration offices and gated quasi-suburban homes. Increasingly, however, Ari is a thicket of sleek high-rise buildings and indie cool-kid hangouts with international flavors: German beer gardens, Latin American restaurants, Korean canteens, Japanese izakayas, American-style food trucks and numerous freshly minted cafes stocked with Italian espresso makers. All that’s missing is the crowds. Even on weekends, Ari’s hot spots have free seats and ample breathing room — a rarity in bustling Bangkok. With its outdoor seating, picnic tables, rock ’n’ roll music and constant smoke from grilling meats, this beer-and-burgers haven feels more like a backyard barbecue than a restaurant. Created by the Thai-British cook Patrick Stall — who studied hospitality management in Perth, Australia — and his Thai girlfriend, Parichart Payungwong, the laid-back hangout serves everything from Japanese-style chicken wings in ginger-garlic sauce to the signature Chiang Mai Spicy burger, a patty of shredded pork with Cheddar cheese and Thai herbs. If such combinations sound like a recipe for indigestion, request the house-made black hamburger buns. The color comes from activated charcoal — a digestive aid. 51 Phahonyothin Soi 5, facebook.com/PaperButter. European-influenced brunch and décor invade Ari at this sun-drenched Italian-style cafe, which opened last year.

Done in cartoonish Day of the Dead style, the image is one of the many homages to Mexico, along with the pink-green-blue-yellow color palette and selection of tacos (from beef tongue to pork belly) on the menu. But the marquee attractions are the beers from the Danish microbrewer Mikkeller and other special guests. If the Drinco de Mayo lager or dark Texas Ranger porter aren’t strong enough, more than a dozen tequilas are also on offer. 68/1 Soi Ari Samphan 1, mikkeller.dk/location/tacochela.

2018,Five Places to Go in Louisville,"5 Places The upbeat New Louisville district is buzzing with cool eateries, shops and thriving businesses, with a distillery and a hotel opening just in time for Derby season. A new spirit infuses a once-neglected Louisville neighborhood about five miles from Churchill Downs, home to the annual Kentucky Derby, this year on May 5. The New Louisville district (NuLu for short) is a five-block stretch of East Market Street, just past the Interstate 65 Overpass. Lined with eclectic Victorian-era buildings, the upbeat district is buzzing lately with cool eateries, shops and thriving local businesses. Two new additions are bolstering NuLu’s renaissance, just in time for Derby season. With its launch on May 5, Rabbit Hole Distilling, the latest in Louisville’s urban distillery revival, joins dozens of establishments along the city’s Urban Bourbon Trail bar and restaurant circuit, and the 152-room AC Hotel by Marriott is set to open May 2.

2018,Five Ways to Get Some Culture on Your Next Cruise,"Travel Tips Cruises have a reputation for being all about drinking and luxury, but if you want your next trip to be a cultural experience as well, here’s how. Culture lovers don’t always think of cruising when planning a vacation, according to Doug Prothero, the managing director of The Ritz-Carlton Yacht Collection. “Cruises are stereotyped as getaways with lots of eating and drinking and little culture in sight,” he said. While that may be true for some cruises, Mr. Prothero said it’s not the case all-around, and shared some tips to enjoy an enlightening cultural experience by boat. Most cruise ships stop at a port in the morning and depart by late afternoon, but several cruise lines have itineraries where boats spend multiple days at a port, offering cruise-goers the opportunity to spend more time in port and to plan day-trips and other longer activities. They give travelers extra time to explore the destination and seek out its culture, whether it’s the local museums, bars and restaurants or other public spaces. Smaller boats and river cruises can often access ports that bigger cruise ships cannot, which allows them to visit more unusual and off-the-beaten path landmarks, Mr. Prothero said. These intimately sized ships also give guests the opportunity to create bespoke, culture-focused itineraries, and many don’t skimp on sleeping quarters or other onboard luxuries just because they’re smaller. “Generally, the bigger the boat, the less flexibility you have in making your trip all about culture because big ships have to manage the needs of many more passengers,” Mr. Prothero said. Academic and cultural centers often host their own cruises that offer itineraries brimming with cultural activities. Many include onboard lectures and seminars from professors and historians about the destinations you’ll visit, and walking tours at ports when you arrive. Yale University’s Yale University Travel, Smithsonian Journeys and Travel with The Met from the Metropolitan Museum of Art are three examples of institutions that offer such cruises. You can have a cultural trip on a large vessel, Mr. Prothero said, but it might take some legwork on your part to do so. “Many big boats have a variety onboard cultural events that they don’t necessarily promote the way that they do other entertainment options,” he said. These events can include lectures and small group dinners dedicated to cultural topics that pertain to your trip. Work with the onboard concierge team to learn more these choices. You can also find out about them ahead of your trip by calling your cruise company’s planning center. Unless your cruise line has shore excursions focused on culture, you might want to consider striking out on your own and prioritize the sights you most want to see. Mr. Prothero encourages travelers to visit small museums and art galleries, dine at restaurants in non-touristy neighborhoods and even catch a daytime show at a local theater. If your time is especially limited, consider hiring a local guide who can show you that destination’s top cultural sites.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Fixing the ‘Involuntary Housewife Visa’,"Op-Ed Contributor Ms. Dalmia, a native of India, had to overcome the H-4 hurdle to obtain a green card and work authorization before finally becoming a naturalized United States citizen in 2002. I came to America from India at age 23. That was in 1985, a golden age of immigration to this country. It didn’t feel like it, though, because it still took my husband, a medical physicist, and me a good seven years to trade up from our student visas for an H-1B for him and an H-4 spouse visa for me. Eventually we got the ultimate prize: green cards — which, to our amusement, weren’t even green back then. In the decades since, wait times for green cards for Indian techies have become impossibly long, with particularly unfortunate consequences for H-4 spouses who want to work. And President Trump is now poised to undo a 2015 Obama-era regulation that took a small stab at addressing their plight. An H-1B, which is primarily reserved for high-tech talent, allowed my now ex-husband to accept a job at a Detroit cancer hospital. But my H-4 barred me from working, even though I already had several years of journalism experience along with a degree in biology and chemistry. I had to wait another two years for my green card before I got the legal right to earn a living. Putting my career on hold until I was 30 was frustrating, especially since we had a baby to support. But Indian spouses on H-4s — well over 90 percent of them women — who came after me envy my experience. When I arrived, the wait times for green cards for Indian H-1Bs averaged about four years. But over the next several decades, the wait steadily grew. By 2005, it was more like 10 to 15 years. Today, according to the National Foundation for American Policy, a nonpartisan research outfit, Indian H-1Bs can expect to stand in the green card queue for several decades. This happened because in 1990, Congress imposed an annual limit on employment-based green cards that was far too low for America’s growing economy. This was on top of the overall green card cap and country-specific quotas. With the I.T. revolution taking off and Silicon Valley aggressively recruiting Indians on H-1Bs, the timing of this third blow couldn’t have been more inopportune. The upshot is that Indians who’ve applied for their H-1B in the past six years may end up retiring before seeing their green cards. And their spouses may have to abandon hope of ever working in America unless they can get their own H-1B. That was never easy. These visas have always been in short supply. Over the past six years, they’ve been running out within the first week after the government starts accepting applications. It also means finding an employer in the same town as your husband that is willing to hire and sponsor you despite the cost and the uncertainty involved. That’s why Indian women plaintively refer to the H-4 as an “involuntary housewife visa.” Late in his term, after it became clear that comprehensive immigration reform wasn’t going anywhere, President Barack Obama issued a regulation giving 100,000 H-4 spouses work authorization so long as their husbands had scaled all the bureaucratic hurdles — like obtaining labor certification — and filed a completed green card application, which still takes a year. This was a huge boon to Indian spouses, who eagerly applied, landing about 93 percent of the authorizations. But an anti-immigration outfit called Save Jobs USA sued the Obama administration, claiming that work authorization for H-1B spouses meant that the United States would end up “importing” two foreign workers for every one. Instead of defending the regulation in court, the Trump administration has decided, come June, to scrap it to advance its “Buy American, Hire American” agenda. Although there is nothing official yet, once the regulatory process is completed, the government may stop handing out new authorizations or renewing existing ones when they expire. Restrictionists assume a zero-sum math for workers: A job gain for a foreigner is a job loss for an American. By that logic every college graduate who enters the job market would be cause for mourning. But that’s backward, given that skilled individuals create, not take away, jobs, and no economy succeeds by shackling qualified people. These women are qualified because educated people tend to marry other educated people. The majority of H-4 women have college degrees, according to a 2014 survey by the blogger Rashi Bhatnagar, herself an H-4 visa holder. They also happen to be between the ages of 26 and 35 — peak productive years. It would be far better for the economy to accommodate their ambitions and turn them into productive, taxpaying individuals. Not letting them do so is a personal tragedy for them. But it also turns the restrictionist worry that immigrants today prefer to live transnational lives rather than assimilate into a self-fulfilling prophecy. A job is not just income. It is also an assimilation program because it offers an entry into a new culture and a chance to form new friendships. Because getting a green card took only a few years when I came, I, like many other spouses in my situation, used that time to obtain a graduate degree and build skills in preparation for entering the job market. However, what would be the point of investing that kind of time and effort in an advanced degree if there is so little certainty that it would actually offer a return one day? Many H-4 wives I know end up staying at home, Skyping with friends and family back home to escape the boredom and isolation of being confined to a “gilded cage” — their description of their life in America. I remember feeling an exhilarating world of opportunities open up before me when I got my green card. It is sad — and senseless — that President Trump is so determined to prevent others like me from experiencing the full promise of America and participating fully in American life.",The New York Times
2018,Flash Flood Kills at Least 9 Israeli Teenagers on ‘Bonding’ Hike,"JERUSALEM — At least nine Israeli teenagers on a “bonding” trip were killed, and one was still missing, after a flash flood swept them away on Thursday while they were hiking in a riverbed near the Dead Sea. Rescue workers, soldiers and volunteers in helicopters, jeeps and rubber boats and on foot frantically searched for the missing teenager as night fell in Wadi Tzafit, a popular hiking destination in dry weather that can become a death trap with little warning in a rainstorm. Two youths were hospitalized for hypothermia and other injuries, and 13 were rescued unharmed, officials said. The fatalities were reported by Zaka, an Israeli rescue and recovery organization. Eight of the teenagers who died were women and one was a man, according to Israeli media reports. A lack of regulatory oversight of the academy that arranged the field trip led quickly to recriminations between the Defense and Education Ministries, which share responsibility for approving such programs. The Israeli news media published text messages in which some of the teenagers expressed fears about the outing, and organizers reassured the doubters that they were well prepared and had the authorities’ approval to go ahead with it. “I can’t believe I’m actually going on a trip in this weather,” one girl wrote in Hebrew to her friends on WhatsApp, according to the news site Mako, which said she was among those killed. “It doesn’t make sense that we go to a place that’s all floods. It’s tempting fate. We will die, I’m serious.” The trip was led by Bnei Zion, a Tel Aviv-based leadership academy for high school graduates waiting to be called for military service. But Channel 12 in Israel reported that many in the group, including some who were killed, were prospective participants in the program who were still in their final year of high school. All together, about 25 young people had been hiking in the riverbed in a canyon with “very deep slopes,” said Nadav Eylon, chief security officer for the Central Arava Regional Council, which oversees an area south of the Dead Sea. Eran Doron, head of the nearby Ramat Negev Regional Council, described the site as “a canyon where the moment a flash flood comes, there is no way out.” “There are walls of rock between four to 20 meters high on the sides of the canyon,” Mr. Doron added. Officials said survivors reported that they heard the sound of rushing water only about a minute before being hit by the flash flood. A police spokeswoman, Merav Lapidot, suggested that the youth group had disregarded police warnings, telling the Mako news site that, “to our regret, these incidents take place when orders are not followed.” She said the police had posted roadblocks in many areas warning of danger but could not be expected to close off every river in the country. Mr. Eylon, speaking to the Ynet news site later, described the search and rescue effort. “We began combing the area and slowly found members of the group,” he said. “Some were wounded, some healthy and some in more serious condition. We found them in little groups, pairs and on their own. This is a complicated, grooved riverbed.” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in a statement, called the calamity a “grave disaster,” adding, “We all pray for better news.” The hike was meant to be a three-day bonding experience for the participants, officials said. An Israeli lawmaker, Yehudah Glick, said he had visited Bnei Zion’s offices and found its staff members, and other teenage participants who had not been on the trip to Wadi Tzafit, in tears and in shock. “Everybody’s trying to collect crumbs of information that are coming in from all over, and mostly they’re trying to collect themselves and put themselves together, and really try to keep themselves in one piece, because they’re broken — they’re very, very much broken,” Mr. Glick said. “These are students that spent the last eight months together, almost 24 hours a day, and they’re close friends.” Mr. Glick said the academy existed to let Israeli teenagers postpone their military service by a year and spend that time studying Israeli history, Zionism and other topics to make their army service more meaningful. “Most are nonreligious, but they’re very much active in social issues, trying to help people who are suffering, and really involved on the most emotional level with Israeli society,” he said. The police promised a full investigation, but early indications suggested that the academy and its outings fell into a regulatory vacuum, with neither the Education Ministry nor the Defense Ministry providing much supervision. Flash floods in the Israeli desert can come with staggering force. After a heavy rainstorm in May 2001, flooding in Nahal Arugot, near Ein Gedi on the edge of the Dead Sea, destroyed a modern highway bridge that had been designed to withstand such weather and filled a canyon with stone and alluvium in quantities officials said had not been seen in 40 years. Thursday was the second day of a storm that, in the usually arid south, flooded riverbeds with sudden, lethal effect. On Wednesday, two people were killed: An 18-year-old Palestinian shepherd was found near Ma’ale Amos, an Israeli settlement on the West Bank, a few miles from where he had disappeared, and a 17-year-old Bedouin was swept away in Wadi Mamshit, near Dimona. In some places, Kan TV reported, the rainfall on Wednesday and Thursday alone totaled about a third of what is normal in a year. Across the country, the weather seemed to keep trying to outdo itself, with hail the size of grapes and golf balls falling from Jerusalem to Mitzpe Ramon in the south, streets flooding and dozens of stranded motorists needing rescue. In Rishon Lezion, south of Tel Aviv, an acoustic ceiling collapsed, flooding a shopping mall. And the airport in Israel’s southernmost city, Eilat, had to be closed after torrential rain and hail left the runway covered with erosion.",The New York Times
2018,"Flexing Their Support for Cuomo, Key Unions Leave Working Families Party","Faced with defections from liberal supporters, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and his labor allies are striking back, threatening to sabotage a progressive third party for potentially giving its ballot line to his Democratic rival, Cynthia Nixon. Two powerful unions allied with Mr. Cuomo announced on Friday that they were withdrawing from the Working Families Party, a small but influential alliance of labor unions and progressive activists. Other labor leaders aligned with the governor have threatened to create a competing new labor party of their own, as Mr. Cuomo has himself urged labor leaders to stop giving money to liberal community groups backing Ms. Nixon. By day’s end on Friday, the breakup seemed complete, with the governor’s campaign announcing that it “will not be seeking the endorsement” of the W.F.P. at its convention next month. It amounts to an old-school political power play by a veteran politician intent on leveraging every advantage of incumbency — even as public polls have him far ahead of Ms. Nixon. The fight between Mr. Cuomo and Ms. Nixon has emerged as an early flash point in the battle to define the future of the Democratic Party in the age of President Trump: a contest between an accomplished and pragmatic governor who controls the classic machinery of Democratic politics, and an upstart challenger with little track record but white-hot rhetoric of unfiltered liberalism to rally the base. Ms. Nixon counts legalizing marijuana, increasing taxes on multimillionaires, giving driver’s licenses to those here illegally, and making New York a “sanctuary state” among her early proposals. The political maneuvers around the Working Families Party echoed a strategy used in 2014, when Mr. Cuomo was first seeking re-election, but encountered a primary challenge from Zephyr Teachout. The Working Families Party strongly considered Ms. Teachout before reluctantly backing Mr. Cuomo. This time around, with Working Families leaders hinting of a Nixon endorsement, Mr. Cuomo’s emissaries struck first. Some of the party’s top members were summoned to a meeting with labor leaders on Friday at the Manhattan headquarters of the United Federation of Teachers. Michael Mulgrew, president of the teachers’ union, said he urged the advocacy groups on Friday to have the Working Families Party remain neutral until after the Democratic primary. If the group endorses Ms. Nixon and she loses the Democratic primary to Mr. Cuomo, she could remain on the ballot through November competing for votes, potentially to the benefit of the Republican nominee. “My only concern is some reckless behavior that will have an unintended consequence of us ending up with a Republican governor,” Mr. Mulgrew said. “When these elections are over, we will judge any decision we have to make off your behavior if you caused bad things to happen — even though it was not your intent you are responsible for them.” He declined to comment on whether Mr. Cuomo had asked him to defund community groups backing Ms. Nixon, saying he has “requests on all sides.” “I’m not going to divulge personal conversations,” he said. But Bill Lipton, the state director of the Working Families Party, said that he had attended a meeting earlier this week in which the governor had said, “If unions or anyone give money to any of these groups, they can lose my number.” Mr. Lipton added that the groups in question — Citizen Action, New York Communities for Change and Make the Road Action — had been critical to efforts to raise minimum wage and criminal justice reform, among others. “W.F.P. has always fought for the rights of unions and for all working families, and that will never change,” he said. “Our friends in labor are in a tight spot and we respect their decision.” Some labor leaders disputed Mr. Lipton’s account of the governor’s comment, while Mr. Mulgrew called Mr. Lipton “misguided and delusional,” likening him to a temperamental child. The governor, a second-term Democrat facing re-election in the fall, has been aggressive in fending off Ms. Nixon’s unexpectedly vigorous primary challenge, which was announced in mid-March, and has since garnered endorsements from a handful of liberal groups. The most recent nod came early Friday, when Make the Road Action — a grass-roots immigrant rights group that receives ample funding from labor — said it would back Ms. Nixon because of “her strong progressive platform and her commitment to passing and implementing the full protections and supports that our communities need and deserve.” The governor’s campaign said that no member of Mr. Cuomo’s administration was at the meeting on Friday, and characterized it as an internal dispute “between its founding labor unions and their organizing groups.” “The governor stands with organized labor and will follow their lead,” said Abbey Fashouer, a campaign spokeswoman. According to two people in the meeting, the governor’s funding threats went unspoken but still loomed large. “You have the largest labor unions in the room who also have been our biggest funders arguing Cynthia should not get the W.F.P. line, which is a pretty forceful argument coming from your biggest funders,” said one participant, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the private meeting and for fear of angering Mr. Cuomo. Among the labor leaders in attendance were leaders or representatives from Local 32BJ of the Service Employees International Union; the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union; Communications Workers of America District 1; and the United Federation of Teachers, which collectively provide hundreds of thousands of dollars to the community groups. Héctor Figueroa, president of Local 32BJ, and Dennis Trainor, vice president of C.W.A. District 1, confirmed their unions’ withdrawal from the Working Families Party, saying in a joint statement that they “fundamentally believe that endorsing Governor Cuomo is the most effective way to put the interest of working families first.” “The latest developments show that the current leadership of the W.F.P. disagrees with that approach, and we have been unable to convince them otherwise,” they said, adding, “We are not attending tomorrow’s state committee meeting and will be pulling out of the New York State Working Families Party.” The pressure in labor ranks comes as the W.F.P. is expected to meet in Albany on Saturday to consider endorsing Ms. Nixon, an educational advocate and actress who is making her first run for public office. “This shows Cuomo will do absolutely anything to win except become a progressive,” said Rebecca Katz, a top adviser to Ms. Nixon. On Thursday afternoon, Mr. Cuomo had appeared at a rally with a variety of labor leaders to present himself as their champion, and they as his ardent supporters. “It is the union family,” Mr. Cuomo said. “When one of us is in trouble, we’re all in trouble. It’s solidarity. We stand together.”",The New York Times
2018,"Florida Deputies’ Killer: Armed to the Teeth, but Motive Remains a Mystery","Armed with two rifles, a handgun and “ample ammunition,” John Hubert Highnote left his home in northern Florida on April 19 “with the ability and apparent intent to kill people,” Sheriff Bobby Schultz of Gilchrist County said on Friday. But the sheriff said that no clear motive had been established as to why Mr. Highnote — a bearded, balding 59-year-old described by the few who knew him as a loner and a recluse — walked into a Chinese restaurant in nearby Trenton, Fla., that day, fatally shot two deputies who were having lunch, and then went out to his car and killed himself. “To date, no clear motive has been established,” Sheriff Schultz said at an emotional news conference on Friday morning in which he praised the two deputies — Sgt. Noel Ramirez, 29, and Deputy Taylor Lindsey, 25 — and called Mr. Highnote a coward. The violence, the sheriff added, will “never be explained.” “I am only going to speak about this person one last time, then send him back into obscurity where he came from and, frankly, belongs,” Sheriff Schultz said. No member of Mr. Highnote’s family has stepped forward yet, Brett Rhodenizer, a spokesman, said later in the news conference, adding, “I think that speaks to who he was.” Before driving to Trenton — where he ambushed and murdered the deputies in Ace China — Mr. Highnote had visited a former employer in Newberry, Fla., about 13 miles away, the sheriff said. Sheriff Schultz did not identify the business but said that Mr. Highnote, who lived in Bell, Fla., had not worked there for two and a half years. “We do not know what his intent was in going there, but as employees approached him, as cowards like him will often do, he fled before they reached him,” the sheriff said. He declined to answer whether the employer had fired Mr. Highnote. “Did we escape disaster right there?” Mr. Rhodenizer asked later in the conference. “We simply don’t know.” Details about Mr. Highnote’s background remain scant. Over about 40 years, he had a few run-ins with the police, mostly for traffic offenses, but these offenses were separated by enough time and distance that no connection could be made to the future violence he would commit, the sheriff’s department said. Photos of men who resemble Mr. Highnote have been circulating on social media, but they are not of Mr. Highnote, Sheriff Schultz warned. “He had no social media or online presence that unmasks him,” the sheriff said. The only photo that the police have found of Mr. Highnote is his driver’s license photo, which the sheriff said was not a public record. After his prepared statement, Sheriff Schultz admonished those who demonize the police, saying that all that Americans see are “the negative things,” like “law enforcement being portrayed as alcoholics, abusers, beating people.” “Let’s highlight the good stuff,” he said. “Let’s be part of the change.”",The New York Times
2018,"Florida’s Governor, Eyeing Senate Run, Offers Hope to an Unsteady G.O.P.","CORAL SPRINGS, Fla. — By the time a town hall-style meeting on gun violence ended Tuesday night, the gathering of more than 1,400 people — bursting into repeated standing ovations and a loud chant of “Vote them out! Vote them out!” — had taken on the electric feeling of a political rally being held days before a big election. Florida’s August primary is still more than four months away. The energized masses in Broward County, the most heavily Democratic county in the nation’s largest swing state, meant one thing for certain: trouble for Republicans, who have dominated Florida midterm elections for more a decade. “We woke. This is a community that woke,” Drew Shimkus, 52, a single father and registered Democrat, said as he left the auditorium with his son, Bruce Elkins, 15, a high school freshman. Democrats have reason for optimism, and not just because gun control has become a galvanizing issue in Florida politics after the Feb. 14 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, an affluent Broward suburb that neighbors Coral Springs. Decision after decision by President Trump and his administration over the past year has forced Republicans campaigning across the divided state to either defend or break with the leader of their party. The Republican Party’s best hope to help candidates navigate this treacherous new territory could come from an unlikely source: Gov. Rick Scott, who is expected to announce on Monday that he is running for the United States Senate against Bill Nelson, the Democratic incumbent. Mr. Scott, a multimillionaire former health care executive whose style is more suited to the boardroom than the stump, is not frequently sought to campaign for fellow Republicans. But if the governor operates as he has in the past, he will likely spend big and early on television ads that could benefit other Republicans unable to purchase much airtime in Florida’s expensive broadcast markets. His campaign team, unencumbered by a serious primary challenge, will be able to focus on mobilizing voters for the November general election. In Mr. Scott, Mr. Nelson will face his toughest opponent since his election to the Senate in 2000; Democrats are expected to invest tens of millions of dollars to defend his seat. But Mr. Scott, too, will have to answer for Mr. Trump. He led a “super PAC” raising money for the president during the 2016 election, and has been a frequent guest at the White House and Mar-a-Lago, the president’s Palm Beach estate. In the past year, as he has prepared for the Senate race, Mr. Scott has broken with the president several times. He pressed the White House to let 32,500 Haitians, living in Florida under temporary protected status, remain in the country. He opposed the end of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program that has protected many immigrants brought into the country illegally as children from deportation. He pushed against allowing oil drilling off Florida’s shores. And he made repeated trips to Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, trying to establish a response to the catastrophic storm that was more proactive than the federal government’s. Most important, perhaps, Mr. Scott signed off on new restrictions on firearm purchases after the Parkland shooting in defiance of the National Rifle Association, neutralizing some of the opposition he would have otherwise faced from vocal students and their families. That has not stopped Democrats from accusing the governor of acting only when it was politically convenient, especially given the lack of state action after a gunman killed 49 people at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando in 2016. “On this issue, you know what, he pandered,” Mr. Shimkus said outside the meeting in Coral Springs. He said he plans to vote for Mr. Nelson. A few steps away, a yelling match broke out between people leaving the event and five protesters holding signs in support of gun rights. “You’re indoctrinated!” one of the protesters shouted at a woman at the end of a fiery discussion. “You want to protect metal, I want to protect life!” a female high school student screamed at the protesters moments later. As a statewide candidate, Mr. Scott will have some room to both embrace Mr. Trump on issues that are crucial to rural, conservative voters and reject him on matters important to urban liberals. That will be more difficult for Republicans running in congressional districts, especially in suburbs that have been trending lately in Democrats’ favor. Across the state, Republicans are trying to open narrow bits of daylight between themselves and the White House — and some have even shown a willingness to embrace moderate gun control measures. Representative Brian Mast of Palm City, on Florida’s Treasure Coast, has endorsed a ban on assault weapons, for example. Representative Carlos Curbelo of Miami helped introduce legislation that would raise the minimum age for purchasing any kind of firearm from 18 to 21. On other issues, Mr. Curbelo has also warned that the tariffs Mr. Trump is imposing on steel are so broad that they might raise prices for residents of the Florida Keys who are trying to replace their metal roofs after Hurricane Irma. Representative Vern Buchanan of Sarasota has teamed up with Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the former Democratic National Committee chairwoman, to work on a moratorium on offshore oil drilling around Florida. “You’re going to see more and more campaigns — even more so than normal — localize and focus on the local issues that matter,” said Max Goodman, a spokesman for Mr. Buchanan. Mr. Buchanan aired the first of an eight-week, $130,000 television ad campaign last week as an election-year precaution, Mr. Goodman said. The congressman’s son, James, unexpectedly lost a special election for a local, Republican-leaning state House district in February. “It’s an offensive move, given this current climate,” Mr. Goodman said. “I don’t know if we’re nervous as much as we feel that we’re realists. It feels a little more like 2006 than 2010.” In 2006, riding a wave of discontent over President George W. Bush and the unpopular war in Iraq, Florida Democrats picked up two congressional seats, helping their party take control of the House of Representatives. But they failed to win the governor’s mansion that year and lost two of three elected state cabinet positions. That has encouraged Republicans running for governor to keep the playbook that has worked for them even when the national political environment has favored Democrats. Republicans have found midterm success in nominating candidates who appeal to the conservative base, said Brad Herold, a campaign adviser for Representative Ron DeSantis of Palm Coast, in northeast Florida, who is running for governor. “We’ve got the presidential endorsement. We’re not going to shy away from that,” Mr. Herold said, referring to a December post on Twitter by Mr. Trump backing Mr. DeSantis, before the congressman had even formally entered the race. Mr. Trump is expected to appear with Mr. DeSantis at a Florida event soon. Mr. Trump’s declared support for Mr. DeSantis has not stopped the congressman’s Republican primary rivals from continuing to praise the president and his policies. Richard Corcoran, the speaker of the Florida House of Representatives and a still-undeclared candidate for governor, released an explosive commercial in January — on the same day Mr. DeSantis entered the race — opposing so-called sanctuary states, which Mr. Trump has railed against. Mr. Corcoran’s graphic ad showed a hooded man firing a gun at a young woman. Adam Putnam, the state agriculture commissioner and the first major Republican to announce his candidacy for governor, grew up in his family’s citrus farming and cattle ranching business. He has touted Mr. Trump’s hard line on trade, even though it may result in retributive tariffs from China on Florida citrus and other crops. “Nobody has ever gone to bat for Florida farmers and fought against illegal trade practices like President Trump,” Mr. Putnam said last week at a breakfast with Republican activists at a Cuban restaurant in Miami. While Republicans hope to win their primaries by sticking close to Mr. Trump, Democrats appear split on how much to make their own campaigns for governor about the president. Philip Levine, the wealthy former mayor of Miami Beach, has already spent millions of dollars on television ads, though none of them are aimed specifically at Mr. Trump’s character. “I don’t run against anybody,” Mr. Levine told a Jacksonville television station this week. “I run with my own message.” His chief rival, Gwen Graham, a former congresswoman from Tallahassee, has taken the opposite approach. In her first digital ad, released this week, she mentions the president by name four times. “Donald Trump is an embarrassment,” she says.",The New York Times

2018,Flying Close to Temptation,"MODERN LOVE A newly married woman fears that her impulse to drink and keep it a secret will become a wall of deceit between her and her wife. I always said I would drink again only if Sarah got cancer, which was my way of saying I would never drink again. The possibility of anything bad happening to her seemed remote and decades away. Imagine my surprise when a mere six weeks into our marriage she called me at work to say, “The doctor found something.” The din of midday Midtown swallowed her words. A routine exam a week earlier had found a lump, and the results from her mammogram had been concerning enough that the doctor immediately picked up the phone and called her. I left my office to meet her, unsure what to expect. Some people exude resilience and fortitude in the midst of adversity. I am not one of them. My first thought is of certain and immediate death, followed by a maudlin song orchestrating a montage of good moments. I don’t call my smartest doctor friend and ask him what to do. I start writing the eulogy. Sarah and I met outside a church on Fifth Avenue, her eyes already steeled with resolve. “I’ve emailed my boss and will go to Germany tomorrow as planned,” she said. “You’ll still meet me in Italy.” Our honeymoon in Venice was two days away. We had planned it to coincide with one of her business trips; she would fly over first, and I would take the red-eye two days later. Even before we had the confirmation that it was cancer, we knew it was, and I immediately started thinking about a drink. It was a benchmark I had never wanted to hit, and here it was, staring me down. Sarah and I were set up on a blind date. I was in New York for work, and at one of my meetings, a man I barely knew asked me if I was seeing anyone. He was about to get married, and I was petrified this would turn into one of those exchanges in which the happy person assures the single person: “There’s hope for you yet.” He had little interest in my explanation (“Single, yes, but fulfilled!”) and much more interest in the truth: Yes, I was as single as single could be. “I want you to meet a friend of mine,” he said. “I think you’d get along.” He swiftly arranged for us to meet that day. Later I walked into a bar off Central Park and was shocked to find a gorgeous woman, complete with perfectly styled hair and makeup, waiting at the bar. This couldn’t possibly be my date. Half of my head was buzzed, and I was hanging on to my baby fat not in a baby-cute way. Something important to know about me: I am not set up with beautiful women. My forays into setups had been little more than a friend bringing together the only two gay women she knew. Once, I was even set up with a gay man. She ordered a club soda with a splash of cranberry. I ordered wine. Twice. The first question she asked was why I had moved from New York, and for some reason the answer that came out was: “Love, but not great love, because less than a year later I was dumped naked.” She sat there politely, and I realized with growing horror that we were both picturing me getting dumped naked. “I live in a sublet in Long Island City,” she finally said. “And sometimes I go grocery shopping at the Mobile Mart.” She was as kind as she was pretty. I may have been dumped naked, but at least I could get myself to a proper grocery store. We left after an hour and I went uptown, embarking on the exact kind of New York night that made me miss the city so badly. I assumed we didn’t have much of a future: We were 10 years apart, shared no hobbies and I drank. What fun could possibly come from sobriety? A few weeks into our courtship — started mainly because we kept responding to each other’s emails — we were walking through Chelsea Market. Our hands grazed, and as I glimpsed up at the back of her head, I had this feeling deep in my gut that I would love her. Not in that moment, not yet, but I knew in the way seasons change that I would love her before this one ended. I asked her early on why she had stopped drinking, and she described feeling as if everyone around her had known to get on a train moving forward, but she was watching from the road as these people slowly passed her by. I took stock of my life: a new relationship, wonderful friends, a rewarding job. Drinking had not kept me off the train. My heart exhaled; maybe I was safe. A few months later I was out late, propelled by a thirst to belong, and I walked unsteadily into the bathroom. The mirror caught my reflection, and suddenly I was squinting into my eyes, trying to figure out how I could be madly in love with someone but know in my core that if the person I was drinking with at this bar made a move, I would go along with it. The next morning I called Sarah. “I don’t have a healthy relationship with alcohol,” I said, cursing myself for saying it out loud because I knew she could never unhear it. But I knew: If I drank, I would cheat, and she would leave. She had the tools and presence to move on, and I didn’t. She would be the one who got away. So I stopped drinking, and my life jolted forward at an unbelievable clip: a cross-country move, a career change, cohabitation, another career change, an engagement, homeownership, marriage. Also: death, professional challenges, family politics gone awry, financial anxiety, actual anxiety and, now, cancer. Two days later I sat in the United lounge, looking at fellow travelers, the clock, my phone and my club soda. A man with a fedora sipped something brown on the rocks; a woman left smudged lipstick on what looked like a wine spritzer. A little boy watched his parents drink, his eyes moving from her red wine to his beer, his head moving slightly between the two. I saw a young couple — honeymooners, too? — toast with champagne flutes. I looked down at my club soda. The ice was mostly melted. If I drank now, could I pause my life again? Could Sarah and I go back to that first summer, when everything was still a possibility? I imagined the coldness of the chardonnay leaving an imprint on every cell as it traveled down my throat. My back would loosen, my thoughts would get fuzzy in the best way. I could call an old friend, chat about mindless gossip as I waited to board. The bartender wouldn’t think twice about giving me a pour for the road. The flight attendant wouldn’t cock her head when I asked if I could have both red and white with dinner. Sarah would never have to know. No one would. Except, I would know. The thing I prized most about our relationship was that Sarah knew everything about me — and loved me anyway. If I were to drink, that secret would be the first brick in a wall between us. Suddenly I felt as if I were back in that bathroom, squinting at my eyes. This wasn’t about just my own life. We had a life now, and the only way I was going to be the wife she needed was if I stayed in the moment. We don’t get to rewind the clock, and we don’t get to rewind our self-awareness. Honesty is linear. I thought about that night in the bathroom and how scared I was that Sarah might be really sick. For me to escape into drinking now would be to leave her alone. I watched the wall grow, brick by brick. My stomach clenched at the thought of Sarah sitting in a doctor’s chair, wondering where I had gone. I thought of months down the road, when we would get test results back saying she would need surgery and chemotherapy and radiation — neither of us knowing at the time that she would come through it and be fine. All I could see was Sarah reaching for my hand, and there I would be, locked up with my secrets, navigating a dark cave while wishing I had chosen the brighter path. A ding and a scratchy female voice announced that my flight was starting to board. I didn’t want to escape, regardless of what may be hiding in the future. The flight passed unremarkably: I watched a movie, slept, ignored the wine cart at dinnertime. And in the morning, Sarah was waiting at my gate in Milan, cappuccino and croissant in hand.

2018,Focusing on a Manager’s Best Stock Ideas May Not Be a Good Idea,"Stock funds with concentrated portfolios — 30 or 40 holdings, tops — are supposed to contain only the managers’ best investment ideas. It turns out, though, that those ideas generally haven’t been good enough to help the funds beat more diversified rivals. In the first quarter, and in the one, three and five years that ended on March 31, the average such stock fund, known as a focus fund, failed to beat at least half of the funds with the same objective — large-company growth, Asian smaller companies, whatever — according to Morningstar. At our request, Morningstar examined all actively managed stock funds that had no sales load, a minimum investment of $10,000 or less and at least $100 million in assets. A focus fund was defined as being in the 10 percent of funds with the fewest portfolio holdings, meaning it owned fewer stocks than any of the other 90 percent. Despite the so-so performance of focus funds as a group, some did exceptionally well, and that reveals the good and bad news about them: Their portfolio concentration can accentuate the gap between the best and worst. “Concentration can propel you to greater heights and drive you to greater depths,” said Christopher Davis, a senior analyst specializing in equity strategy for Morningstar. “A concentrated fund is harder to own.” Amid the ordinariness, or worse, there were many apparent standouts. A greater number of concentrated funds performed in the top 10 percent within their respective investment objectives in each period than would be expected by chance, the Morningstar data reveals. In the year through March, for instance, in a universe of 1,938 funds, 19 or 20 in the group with the 10 percent fewest holdings should be in the top 10 percent of returns, strictly by chance, but 26 were. Todd Rosenbluth, director of exchange-traded fund and mutual fund research at CFRA, views the wide performance range among focus funds as a silver lining. “Concentrated funds put only their best ideas into the portfolio and tend to stick with them,” he said. “They can be more volatile, as they are driven by a smaller number of stocks and tend to be more concentrated in certain sectors.” That may give any of them a chance to beat the market. Diversified portfolios, in contrast, may not deviate much from benchmark stock indexes, he said, and so “are more likely to lag a considerably cheaper Vanguard index mutual fund.” The potential to substantially outperform allows providers of focus funds to charge more money. The average focus fund has annual expenses of 1.06 percent, compared with 0.98 percent for the average actively managed stock fund, according to Morningstar. Focus funds also typically have smaller asset bases, providing fewer economies of scale. “Concentrated funds start off deeper in the expense hole and have a deeper expense gap to traverse,” Mr. Davis said. “If you bet on the right one, your upside potential is all that much greater. Investors choose to make that bet. If they choose well, the expense ratio doesn’t really matter. If they don’t, the additional expenses will add insult to injury.” There have been clear, consistent winners among focus funds, even if their inherent volatility can cause periodic weakness. Many names appear on several lists of top concentrated portfolios this year and over one, three and five years, with seven funds on all four. One of those, Guinness Atkinson Global Innovators, maintains a portfolio of about 30 stocks. They are often the same ones because the managers like to hold positions for many years. As the fund’s name suggests, its managers “try to identify companies that use innovation to drive their growth,” said Matthew Page, one of those managers. “We believe that, ultimately, companies like that should outperform because they’re smarter and better than their average peers. That means higher growth prospects and profits.” Among the themes that appeal to him are big data and machine learning. The first refers to the storage, processing and analysis of immense sets of related data. The second involves developing programs that allow computers to learn from and make predictions about data almost instantaneously, a skill that will be needed for technologies such as self-driving cars. It’s hard to invest in these areas directly, Mr. Page said, so the portfolio holds stocks in related ones, including Nvidia, which makes graphics processing units, Fanuc, a Japanese robotics business, and Infineon, a German maker of semiconductors for the automotive industry that is expanding into chips for electric and self-driving vehicles. The Baron Fifth Avenue Growth fund, another that appears on all four lists of top-performing focus funds, favors large companies that sell for less than their intrinsic worth because investors misunderstand their businesses, Alex Umansky, the fund’s manager, says. He adds that there are so few mispricings among these well-researched companies that the fund usually holds just 30 to 35 stocks. He keeps most of them for long periods — “our time horizon is forever,” he said — and accepts price swings that other managers try to avoid by maintaining bigger portfolios. “We think overdiversification has been massively value-destructive over the last decade because people are worried about managing volatility,” Mr. Umansky said. The fund’s largest constituent, accounting for 15 percent of its assets, is hardly obscure — Amazon — but Mr. Umansky contends that its price is too cheap, even at 235 times its earnings for the last four quarters. That extravagant valuation is misleading, he said, because Amazon has a history of forgoing earnings today by investing in new business lines that will pay off tomorrow. Other portfolio holdings include Alibaba, a Chinese e-commerce giant; and Mastercard and Visa, which dominate the credit card business. Mr. Umansky called Mastercard “the digital railroad” taking financial transactions from paper to the electronic world, a process that he expects to be larger and more lucrative than investors anticipate. Mr. Rosenbluth recommends the Guinness Atkinson and Baron funds. Others that he likes and that appear on at least one of the lists of top-performing focus funds include Columbia Select Large-Cap Value, Axa Loomis Sayles Growth and Parnassus Endeavor. Mr. Davis is a fan of the Baron and Parnassus funds, though he is agnostic about focus funds generally. “We haven’t been able to discern a real advantage investing in concentrated portfolios, but there’s not a big disadvantage, either,” he said. “You should expect to have a range of outcomes the more concentrated the portfolio is,” he added. “Even some of the best performers over the last five years underperform their peers sometimes.”",The New York Times
2018,"Following the Trail of Online Ads, Wherever It Leads","Tech We’re Using How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Sapna Maheshwari, a reporter who covers advertising for The Times, discussed the tech she’s using. What tech tools do you use to monitor what advertisers are doing with our data on websites, apps and gadgets? Digital advertising can be tough to track because so much of it is automated and personalized. But I use Ghostery, a browser extension that shows you the data collection tools that companies are using to track your activity on any given site, along with the option to block them. Often, these companies are building robust pictures of your habits, sometimes across devices, which can ultimately be used to sell ads. I’ve also used services like Moat Pro and Pathmatics, which monitor online ads and can give you some insight into what pitches brands are running and where. (That was particularly helpful with some of the advertiser boycotts we saw last year on sites like Breitbart.) I also keep tabs on some Facebook and Reddit groups that talk about marketing and scams. More than anything, though, I do lots of phone interviews — despite what they say about millennials and phones — and meet with brand marketers and people at ad agencies and ad technology companies to hear what they’re thinking about and working on. What do you like about these tools, and what could be better? The online ad tracking services are helpful for the desktop and mobile web, but I haven’t yet found an effective way to sort through the many, many ads that flow through Facebook and Instagram or across various mobile apps. In the wake of the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica controversy, many privacy experts are pointing out that if something is free, you are the product. Do you agree with that? This question makes me think of a headline from The Onion, “Exciting New App Allows Users to Be Pawns in 26-Year-Old C.E.O.’s Little Game.” I generally agree with the privacy experts, but don’t know if there are good ad-free alternatives for a lot of services that people can pay for. Maybe in the future? How has tech changed advertising, and how much is the advertising industry looking to tech these days? Tech has transformed advertising — there are so many more ways to target and reach people now than when the industry was dominated by TV, print, radio and event sponsorships. There’s also so much more data being collected about our habits by an array of companies, from big tech platforms to agencies to the advertisers themselves. Huge portions of advertising dollars in the last few years have gone to the big tech giants that we read about all the time — specifically Google and Facebook and, to a lesser extent, companies like Snap. Lately, advertisers have said they’re spending more money on Amazon. So there are still more major changes afoot. As for how advertisers are looking at tech — it can be a double-edged sword. The ability to follow consumers wherever they go online comes with the risk that brands could end up with their ads appearing on conspiracy and extremist sites or offensive YouTube videos. Platforms like Twitter have made it easy for brands to talk to consumers, but it’s also opened them up to new criticism, demands and potential boycotts. Advertisers are also grappling with how to measure their ads in this new world. That’s a challenge throughout the industry. Think of all the ways that people watch TV shows now. I recently watched — or, more accurately, binged — NBC’s “The Good Place.” I watched the first season on Netflix, where there were no ads, then saw the first eight episodes of the second season through NBC’s Apple TV app, where there were lots of commercials. I watched the final few on Hulu, which might have had different ads. That type of behavior — especially since I was using my parents’ cable login for the NBC app — is a new kind of challenge for the people buying, selling and measuring ads. What do you think of Google’s and Facebook’s power in the online ad industry? It’s an enormous topic within the advertising industry, which generally refers to Google and Facebook as the “duopoly.” It’s pretty remarkable that two of the world’s most valuable companies make virtually all of their money from selling online ads and dominate more than half of the American digital ad market. Their size and influence make it essential for people to really understand how the companies’ business models work and the types of information they’re sharing with them every day — and what makes them such powerful advertising machines. Obviously, advertisers are drawn to Facebook and Google properties because people are spending lots of time there. But they’re also fast and easy to use and rely heavily on automation. Lately, we seem to be getting a crash course in how the tools that advertisers love can be misused, whether it’s in the political realm or through fraudulent or discriminatory ads. I’m interested to see how humans factor into solving some of these issues — for example, YouTube is implementing more human screening of videos to assuage advertisers’ fears about appearing on inappropriate content. Outside work, what tech product do you love using? It’s a tie between two. I recently installed a Chrome extension called HabitLab to help keep me from wasting time when I’m online. And I love the Bose wireless speaker that my boyfriend gave me for Diwali. I use it to listen to podcasts and talk on the phone while cooking or cleaning. I love that the speaker gets me away from my phone, which can charge in the meantime, and that I can use it throughout my apartment. It would be nice if it just did the cooking for me, though. What’s your advice for those who want to prevent their data from being tracked by advertisers? It’s hard to prevent, but you can take some steps to limit it. Explore the privacy settings on your smartphone, including which apps have access to your location and microphone and whether you allow ad tracking. Delete apps that you don’t use anymore. Some people like ad blockers, but they can be operating their own businesses that allow ads through from advertisers that pay them. You could also check the settings for internet-connected devices like your television, and turn off certain “smart” features that could be sharing your viewing habits with third parties. When you check out at a store, you can avoid giving your phone number, email address or ZIP code. Finally, you can see and delete your ad preferences on Facebook and those for Google, too.",The New York Times
2018,"For Albuquerque’s Headbanger Mayor, Power Comes in Power Chords","ALBUQUERQUE — Channing Concho was in the crowd with hundreds of fellow headbangers for Anthrax’s sold-out concert this year at the El Rey Theater when something unusual unfolded before her eyes: the mayor of New Mexico’s largest city grabbed the mic. “I was like, whoa, he doesn’t look like your typical politician,” said Ms. Concho, 31, the drummer for Suspended, an all-female melodic death thrash band based in Albuquerque. “It felt like one of those history-in-the-making moments. There’s our mayor in a black T-shirt with his fist in the air, and he’s just another Albuquerque metalhead.” Tim Keller, the mayor of this city of 560,000 still struggling to emerge from a long economic slump, left some in the audience with jaws agape when he shouted above the shredding of Scott Ian, the Anthrax guitarist, “I believe in the power of metal!” Mr. Keller, 40, a Democrat who took office in December, is making his enthusiastic embrace of heavy metal a signature feature of his administration, introducing metal bands onstage at gritty downtown venues, publicly extolling the music of his favorite band, Sepultura of Brazil, even fondly reminiscing about how he once got booted from an Ozzy Osbourne concert after jumping off a wall and into the audience at Tingley Coliseum. “Albuquerque has always been pretty strong on the heavy metal front,” Mr. Keller said in an interview over a hurried lunch of green chile stew at his office, with a view of the Sandia Mountains in the distance. “What can I say, this is something I’ve been into for a long time.” The table in Mr. Keller’s office was strewn with photos of metal legends and tomes, including “Sound of the Beast: The Complete Headbanging History of Heavy Metal” by Ian Christe, and “The Encyclopedia of Heavy Metal,” with a foreword by Ronnie James Dio, the vocalist known for popularizing the “devil horns” hand gesture. “That’s really cool that my book’s on his table,” said Daniel Bukszpan, 48, the author of the encyclopedia, a 2003 illustrated guide to all things metal. (In the interest of precision, it should be noted that Mr. Bukszpan’s exuberant response included the use of a four-letter modifier that, while it appears several times in his book, has been omitted here.) Mr. Bukszpan, who lives in Brooklyn, added, “But please remind the mayor of Albuquerque that the proper way to read the book is in the bathroom, not the office.” Either way, few people can speak with Mr. Keller’s authority when it comes to explaining what makes Albuquerque a place so welcoming for metalheads that one was elected as mayor. Yes, the city has nurtured bands dabbling in other genres, from indie rock to alternative country and norteño, Mr. Keller acknowledged. “But what about Randy Castillo?” Mr. Keller asked, referring to the drummer for Ozzy Osbourne and Mötley Crüe who was born here and attended West Mesa High School before following his star to Los Angeles. In addition to the array of metal bands spawned and performing in the city, the mayor pointed out that another prominent figure in the metal world, Rex Brown, the former bassist for Pantera who now plays with Kill Devil Hill, makes his home in Albuquerque. A passion for metal minutiae might not seem like a priority for someone like Mr. Keller, who studied art history at Notre Dame and went on to obtain an M.B.A. from Harvard. With progressive political views, he served as a state senator and as New Mexico’s state auditor before running for mayor in a city that had been, until his election, under Republican control since 2009. Born and raised in Albuquerque, Mr. Keller attended Catholic schools. He struggled with dyslexia as a child and still does, opting to devour audiobooks instead of reading. As the father of two young children, he insisted that he doesn’t attend as many concerts as other metal aficionados. Still, Mr. Keller said that he valued heavy metal’s capacity for bringing people from different backgrounds together, especially in the Southwest, where Hispanics and Native Americans have long featured prominently in the metal scene, forging subgenres like Rez Metal, popular on and around the vast Navajo reservation. “Despite a reputation for metal skewing Anglo, it doesn’t in New Mexico and never has,” Mr. Keller said. He cited the appeal in New Mexico of songs like “Indians,” the enduring 1987 Anthrax single about the marginalization of Native peoples in the United States, and the admiration that many people here have for figures like Chuck Billy, the Native American frontman for the thrash metal band Testament. While Mr. Keller’s fusing of heavy metal and politics has earned him a lot of attention, authorities on the genre argue that the mayor is part of a global current of elected officials who have made their love of metal part of their political narrative. “It’s not that surprising, since the first generation of die-hard metal fans is entering their 40s and 50s, rising to positions of power and obtaining political influence,” said Jeremy Wallach, a cultural studies scholar at Bowling Green State University in Ohio who specializes in the global spread of heavy metal. Danica Roem, the pioneering transgender vocalist for the band Cab Ride Home, won a seat in November in Virginia’s House of Delegates. Farther afield, Indonesia’s president, Joko Widodo, may arguably be the world’s most powerful metalhead, listing Napalm Death and Lamb of God among his favorite bands. Freddy Lim, the headbanging frontman of the band Chthonic, is a member of Taiwan’s parliament. And in Norway, Fenriz, a member of the black metal outfit Darkthrone, campaigned for a council seat in an Oslo suburb by posting photos of himself and his cat with the caption, “Don’t Vote For Me.” (He won anyway.) Mr. Keller, for his part, insists that he is focusing on urgent issues in Albuquerque, including a stalled rapid transit system and luring investment to the city. His supporters note that he has begun chalking up victories, like the announcement this week by a Texas health care support company that it will hire hundreds of employees here. Mr. Keller also signed into law on Thursday a bill decriminalizing possession of small amounts of marijuana, a move aimed at refocusing police resources in the crime-weary city. Many constituents — including some in the metal scene — aren’t holding their breath that a new mayor, even one steeped in a take-no-prisoners music culture that isn’t normally associated with establishment institutions, will be able to achieve change overnight. “I didn’t vote for Keller, but then again I don’t vote at all,” said Jake Pacheco, 35, vocalist for the Albuquerque thrash metal band Anesthesia. Still, Mr. Pacheco said that Mr. Keller compared favorably with Albuquerque’s former three-term mayor, Martin Chávez, still notorious in the metal community for having sought more than a decade ago to crack down on downtown concerts — viewed then as contributing to underage drinking and violent crime. With each concert appearance, Mr. Keller seeks to bolster what he views as heavy metal’s “empowerment” potential. When the Florida metal band Trivium arrived here for a concert, there was Mr. Keller on the stage at the Sunshine Theater, reminiscing about how he had listened to the group’s music on the campaign trail, before urging fans to let loose a welcoming scream for the performers. Paolo Gregoletto, the bassist for the band, seemed delighted to come across an elected official expressing such zeal, and said as much later on Instagram. The mayor, he declared, had provided “one of the sickest show introductions ever.”",The New York Times
2018,"For Americas Summit, a Peruvian Seaside Locale, and Plenty of Trouble","LIMA, Peru — As the region’s leaders converged for a summit in this seaside capital, it had the feel of an escape from the scandals raging at home. But their meeting will be no respite. In Brazil, the October presidential election was upended last week after its front-runner, former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, surrendered to authorities to serve a 12-year jail sentence for corruption and money laundering. President Juan Manuel Santos of Colombia arrested one of the chief negotiators of the country’s landmark peace deal with rebels, an ex-guerrilla named Seuxis Hernández. Mr. Hernández is accused of helping traffic 11 tons of cocaine. Worse, the summit’s original host resigned the Peru presidency over corruption allegations. Pedro Pablo Kuczynski quit last month when opponents released leaked tapes in which members of Congress bragged about supporting the president in return for lucrative government deals. Corruption is nothing new in Latin America, but the headlines have reached a fever pitch in recent months and likely will be at the center of debate at the Summit of the Americas, a gathering of regional leaders held once every several years. The corruption issue also has raised the question: In a region where graft is so entrenched, who will be left to govern if the swamp is fully drained? “Across the region, polls consistently show that corruption is an increasingly salient concern,” said Michael Shifter, president of the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington-based research group. “Yet many are also wondering if addressing underlying issues could risk paralyzing the economy or undermining governability, at least in the short term.” Originally billed as the site of President Trump’s first Latin American visit, the summit’s focus shifted when the president dropped out amid rising tensions with Syria — and an F.B.I. raid on the offices of Mr. Trump’s personal attorney that has now become a White House crisis. President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela was barred from attending, and President Raúl Castro of Cuba decided not to go amid complaints of authoritarianism in coming presidential elections in both countries. Mr. Trump’s absence has forced regional leaders instead to consider rising anger at the corrupt practices in their own countries. The bribes from a single company alone have been enough to give the region pause. Mr. Kuczynski is just one of the last four Peruvian presidents who is either under investigation or charged with corruption in a widening case involving Odebrecht, a Brazilian construction company. Ecuador’s vice president was sentenced to a jail term for receiving bribes related to the company. An ousted attorney general in Venezuela has released tapes saying that Mr. Maduro received $35 million in campaign contributions from Odebrecht in exchange for better treatment. “Corruption undermines the public belief that democratic institutions work for them,” a major issue during the election year, said Mark L. Schneider, a former State Department official who now works at the Americas program of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. On Thursday, the foreign ministers of the participating countries began negotiating the text of a document meant to be a blueprint for countries to fight graft within and between their borders. The text was expected to include proposals for citizen watchdogs, protections for whistle-blowers and the press, more transparency in government contracts and the sharing of information by prosecutors. “The summit has one substantive theme to deal with: democratic governance to confront corruption,” Néstor Popolizio, Peru’s foreign minister, told reporters this week. Mexico, where voters pick a new president in July, has become a major focus of the corruption debate. President Enrique Peña Nieto and his Institutional Revolutionary Party, the PRI, have been mired by scandals, starting with a revelation that his wife had bought a multimillion dollar home from a government contractor under favorable terms. More recently his government was found to have spied on journalists and human rights defenders and done little to investigate the surveillance abuses when exposed. The front-runner in polls to succeed him is Andrés Manuel López Obrador, a nationalist whose anti-corruption rhetoric and pledge to govern austerely has struck a chord with voters. In Colombia, scandals within one of its newest political groups have been creating election waves. On Monday, Mr. Santos announced the arrest of Mr. Hernández, the blind former rebel who was one of the top leaders in the Common Alternative Revolutionary Party, which was formed by guerrilla fighters after they signed a peace deal in 2016. The authorities said Mr. Hernández, whose group has renounced decades of violence and drug running, was in the process of trafficking 11 tons of cocaine to the United States — even as he prepared to take one of the party’s first congressional seats. The trafficking accusations immediately turned into a political football in the May election, where the front-runners harbor deep criticisms of the peace deal. Some point out that bright spots exist in the region as well. In Guatemala, high-level investigations of corruption have been outsourced to an independent body of international prosecutors backed by the United Nations. Working with the attorney general, they gathered evidence against Otto Pérez, who resigned as president in 2015 and is awaiting trial on corruption charges. Two countries in the south, Uruguay and Chile, both scored well on Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index in 2017, holding the 23rd and 26th places out of 180 countries. (The region’s largest countries sit in the middle, around the 100th slot.) Mr. Schneider, the former State Department official, said Chile in particular had much to teach other countries when it came to fighting corruption. For example, after family members of Michelle Bachelet, until recently Chile’s president, were implicated in a tax-evasion scheme, Ms. Bachelet appointed a council headed by an economist, Eduardo Engel, to propose reforms. A number of new laws and institutions were created from his recommendations, which were embraced widely and continue into the presidency of Sebastián Piñera, a right-wing rival of Ms. Bachelet. “Chile is as ideologically polarized as any country in the hemisphere, but they’ve adopted these measures, and kept them,” said Mr. Schneider.",The New York Times
2018,"For Cancer Centers, Proton Therapy’s Promise Is Undercut by Lagging Demand","WASHINGTON — On March 29, Georgetown University Hospital opened a proton-therapy cancer unit that is expected to treat about 300 patients a year at premium prices using what its proponents promote as the most advanced radiology for attacking certain tumors. At the facility’s heart is a 15-ton particle accelerator that bombards malignancies with beams of magnet-controlled protons designed to stop at tumors rather than shoot through them like standard X-ray waves, mostly sparing healthy tissue. With the addition, Georgetown joined a medical arms race in which hospitals and private investors, sometimes as partners, are pumping vast sums of money into technology whose effectiveness, in many cases, has not yet been shown to justify its cost. Although most of the proton centers in the United States are profitable, the industry is littered with financial failure: Nearly a third of the existing centers lose money, have defaulted on debt or have had to overhaul their finances. For Georgetown officials, it was still a bet worth making. “Every major cancer center that has a full service radiation oncology department should consider having protons,” said Dr. Anatoly Dritschilo, the chief of the hospital’s radiation medicine department. Many have. There are 27 proton therapy centers now operating in the United States. Nearly as many are being built or planned. Georgetown’s, which vies for patients with a struggling unit in Baltimore, will soon compete with another in Washington and one in Northern Virginia. But about 30 years after the Food and Drug Administration first approved proton therapy for limited uses, doctors often hesitate to prescribe it and insurers often will not cover it. That means there simply may not be enough business to go around. “The biggest problem these guys have is extra capacity,” said Dr. Peter Johnstone, the chief executive at Indiana University’s proton center before it closed in 2014, in need of an upgrade but lacking the potential patients to pay for it. “They don’t have enough patients to fill the rooms.” At Indiana, he added, “we began to see that simply having a proton center didn’t mean people would come.” Proton therapy was initially used to treat tumors in delicate areas where surgery was not an option — near the eye, for example — and in children, and it remains the best choice in such cases. But its pinpoint precision has not been shown to be more effective against breast, prostate and other common cancers. One recent study of lung-cancer patients found no significant difference in outcomes between people receiving proton therapy and those getting a focused kind of traditional radiation, which is much less expensive. Other studies are still underway. “Commercial insurers are just not reimbursing” for proton therapy except for pediatric cancers or tumors near sensitive organs, substantially limiting the potential treatment pool, said Brandon Henry, a medical device analyst for RBC Capital Markets. Medicare covers proton therapy more readily than private insurers, but relying solely on Medicare patients does not allow backers of some treatment centers to recoup their investments, much less turn a profit, analysts said. For a glimpse of what can go wrong, consider the Maryland Proton Treatment Center in Baltimore, which is affiliated with the University of Maryland Medical Center. Opened two years ago with a “Survivor”-themed party and lofty financial goals, the unit is already undergoing a restructuring that is inflicting large losses on its outside investors, including wealthy families from Texas. Before the Baltimore center opened, those behind it saw their market stretching from Philadelphia to Northern Virginia and encompassing 20,000 potential patients a year. Officials predicted the unit would treat “north” of its current rate of about 85 patients a day, said Jason Pappas, the acting chief executive. How far north? “Upper Canada,” said Mr. Pappas, declining to provide hard numbers. He said the center would break even by the end of the year. The patient shortage might not be a good sign for projects in the pipeline, but it is encouraging for those who take a dim view of proton therapy’s rise. “Something that gets you the same clinical outcomes at a higher price is called inefficient,” said Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, a health policy professor at the University of Pennsylvania, which operates one proton center and is developing another. “If investors have tried to make money off the inefficiency, I don’t think we should be upset that they’re losing money on it.” The proton therapy boom effectively began in 2001, when Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston opened a proton unit, raising the profile of what was a little-used technology. By 2009, developers were flocking to the field, lured by the belief that insurers would cover treatment bills that run to $48,000 and more. The treatment held particular promise for prostate cancer patients, given the potential side effects, including incontinence and impotence, associated with traditional radiation. But a 2013 Yale study found little difference in those conditions among patients getting proton therapy versus those getting traditional radiation. Within a year, several insurers stopped covering the therapy for prostate cancer or were reconsidering it. Indiana University’s center was the first to close. Before long, others were in dire financial straits. California Protons in San Diego, which was once associated with the Scripps Health hospital network, filed for bankruptcy protection last year. An abandoned proton project in Dallas is in bankruptcy as well. In Virginia, the Hampton University Proton Therapy Institute has lost money for at least five straight years, financial statements show. In Knoxville, Tenn., the Provision CARES Proton Therapy Center lost $1.7 million last year on revenue of $23 million, $5 million short its target. Centers in Somerset, N.J., and Oklahoma City run by privately held ProCure have defaulted on their debts, according to the investment firm Loop Capital. A center associated with Seattle Cancer Care Alliance, a hospital consortium, in Washington State lost $19 million in the 2015 fiscal year before restructuring its debt, documents show. A center near Chicago lost tens of millions of dollars before its own restructuring as part of a 2013 sale to hospitals now affiliated with Northwestern Medicine, according to regulatory documents. Scott Warwick, executive director of the National Association for Proton Therapy, a trade group, blames “over-exuberant expectations” for the problems. “I think maybe that’s what went on with some of the centers,” he said. “They thought the technology would grow faster than it has.” The industry is using advertising and marketing to urge patients and lawmakers to press insurers to pay for proton therapy. Oklahoma recently passed a law requiring that insurers evaluate the treatment on an equal basis with other therapies. Virginia has considered similar legislation. At the National Proton Conference in Orlando last year, a full day was devoted to winning over insurers. The Alliance for Proton Therapy Access, another industry group, has software for generating letters to the editor demanding coverage. Until the insurance outlook changes, those developing new proton centers have scaled back their ambitions. Georgetown’s unit, for example, cost $40 million and has a single treatment room. The one in Baltimore cost $200 million and has five. Following the Georgetown model, with one or two treatment rooms, should allow centers in major metropolitan areas to make money, said Prakash Ramani, a senior vice president at Loop Capital, which is involved with projects in Alabama, Florida and elsewhere. Not all the new units are small. In some cases, hospitals are joining forces to make the finances work. In New York, Memorial Sloan Kettering, Mount Sinai Health System and Montefiore Health System have teamed up on a $300 million unit with an 80-ton particle accelerator and four treatment rooms that is set to open in East Harlem next year. Officials, counting on the New York area’s vast population and referrals from three major health systems, expect the center to treat 1,400 people a year. They will soon learn whether their project fares better than the Indiana proton center did. “What places need now are patients,” Dr. Johnstone, that center’s former chief, said, “a huge supply of patients.” OpinionEzekiel J.

2018,"For Catalans, a Day of Books, Roses and, of Course, Politics","Since medieval times Catalans have celebrated the feast of their patron, Sant Jordi, or Saint George, on April 23, which happens to coincide with the deaths of both William Shakespeare and Miguel de Cervantes. Almost a century ago, business-savvy publishers turned it into a book-selling event. Men traditionally offer women roses, and women buy them books in return — though these days women also receive books to ensure gender equality. All through Barcelona and other Catalan cities, bookstands are erected side-by-side with flower stalls. But this year, after months of secessionist turmoil, not even a festive day of books and roses was immune to the political divides of Catalan society. The question was, perhaps inevitably, to be, or not to be, independent. Ada Colau, Barcelona’s far-left mayor, wore a yellow rose as a lapel pin, a nod to the yellow ribbon that has become the symbol of Catalans demanding the release of jailed Catalan politicians awaiting trial for rebellion, after briefly declaring independence from Spain last October. “Of course Sant Jordi is always a great feast, but it’s also true that this Sant Jordi isn’t like all others, and that we now have people who are in prison instead of being out on the streets, enjoying this with us,” Ms. Colau said. She also lamented the fact that Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy’s government was still administering direct rule over Catalonia. Not everyone was pleased to listen to her. “Catalan society is divided, so Sant Jordi should never be the day to talk politics and divide people even more,” said Álex Sàlmon, the editor of the Catalan edition of El Mundo, a Spanish newspaper. Along the Diagonal avenue, which crosses Barcelona, some people gathered around a book stall to celebrate the fictitious Republic of Tabarnia, a jab at the separatist parties who failed to win a majority of the votes in many parts of Catalonia, including within Barcelona. The book stall was selling copies of nine different books opposed to independence. “Separatism has infiltrated and tried to destroy every aspect of life in Catalonia, even sadly Sant Jordi,” said Albert Boadella, a playwright who is the unofficial “president” of Tabarnia, as his supporters lined up to have their photo taken with him. A short distance away, the mood at another stall run by one of the main pro-independence associations was more somber. People gathered there were writing letters into scrapbooks that will be sent to the jailed politicians. “We and those of Tabarnia can each have our own space, with no need to talk to each other,” said Xavier Vidal, while he supervised the letter-writing session. “Sant Jordi is a very special celebration of Catalan culture, but every day is important to reach our goal of independence.” The feast is also an opportunity for readers to meet their writers. Established authors organize book-signings, while debut writers aim for the release of their work to coincide with Sant Jordi to jump-start sales. Some acclaimed novelists have recently published books about the history and politics of Catalonia, like Eduardo Mendoza, who was born in Barcelona but now mostly lives in London. “I wanted to put my own ideas in order, as well as clarify things for others,” Mr. Mendoza said. “I’ve been reading and hearing things about the Catalonia of 2018 in terms of oppression and Franco, when all of that is so clearly in the past.” At another stall, Toni Albà, an actor and theater director, took a different view about the legacy of Franco’s dictatorship, while he signed copies of his own book, based on extracts from Hamlet and titled, “To Be or Not to Be Catalan.” Mr. Albà was recently indicted on a charge of publishing insults on Twitter, including words directed at a Spanish judge who sent Catalan politicians to prison. “I was a child under Franco, so I sadly know all about censorship in Spain,” he said. About 1.5 million books are sold during Sant Jordi in Barcelona, yielding around 20 million euros ($24 million) in revenues, which represents a significant portion of the annual income of publishers, particularly smaller ones who specialize in books written in the Catalan language. Sant Jordi is also essential for the flower economy, even if the roses start to sell at a discount as the day nears its end. “You can end up walking away with a bunch of cheap flowers, while the books are thankfully more stable,” joked Claudio López Lamadrid, the editorial director of the Spanish subsidiary of Penguin Random House. “If people then read them, great, but at least they buy them.” Of course, this year some of the roses were yellow rather than red. “I wanted a yellow rose to make clear that it’s not normal to have people in prison because of their ideas,” said Txema Escorsa, a teacher. María Navarrete Cano said she wrote her book “From Catalonia with Love” because she was frustrated that her relatives in the southern region of Andalusia couldn’t come to terms with her support for independence, since part of the family emigrated to Catalonia from Andalusia in the 1950s. “I really care for my family in Andalusia and I’m not against anybody who is Spanish — so I really want them to understand that this is only about being against a Spanish government that’s been hurting Catalans,” she said. Santi Vila, a politician who stepped down from the Catalan government just before the botched unilateral declaration of independence last October, had a book, too. His work denounces the mistakes of secessionism, and has already sold 10,000 copies since being published last month, in both Catalan and Castilian Spanish. “Of course many people feel exhausted by our political situation, but it doesn’t mean they can ignore it altogether — whether they like it or not and even on Sant Jordi,” he said.",The New York Times
2018,"For Charlize Theron, Motherhood Is Messy Business","A Word With For Charlize Theron, acting means going beyond the script. And she doesn’t shy away from subverting traditional notions of beauty to get into character: wearing mottled makeup and rotting teeth to play the serial killer Aileen Wuornos in “Monster” (and winning an Oscar); adding sinewy muscle and shaving her head as the one-armed warrior Furiosa in “Mad Max: Fury Road”; fighting so hard in hand-to-hand combat while filming “Atomic Blonde” that she bruised ribs and cracked teeth. So she wasn’t about to climb into a fat suit for “Tully,” her second collaboration, after “Young Adult,” with the director Jason Reitman and the screenwriter Diablo Cody. For the film, which opens on Friday, May 4, Ms. Theron packed on nearly 50 pounds — eating In-N-Out Burger for breakfast and cold mac and cheese late at night — to play Marlo, an end-of-her-tether mother of three (including an infant) who reluctantly accepts her wealthy brother’s gift of a night nurse, the Mary Poppins-esque Tully (Mackenzie Davis). But it was Ms. Theron’s own experiences, with her adopted children — a son, Jackson, 6, and a daughter, August, 2 — that most helped her hone her performance. “I just remember my body and my brain not really being on the same page,” she said. “That period, especially the first couple of months, is so all-consuming that you have these small moments where you realize how far you have pushed yourself aside just to make sure this little thing stays alive.” During a telephone interview from Los Angeles, Ms. Theron, 42, discussed her onscreen transformation, the demands of motherhood and her fight for women’s rights in the movie industry. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation. Did Ms. Cody write this role with you in mind? I don’t think Diablo writes like that. I think the writing for her is very therapeutic, and she had just had her third child, and she sat down at a desk to write about what she was feeling because it was so overwhelming, and the script kind of poured out of her. It’s strange — it feels like she’s been somewhat clairvoyant in always picking a subject matter that both Jason and I are really interested in exploring. How young were your own children when you first read it? My second kid was around six or seven months old, so I was just coming out of that tunnel place where you’re kind of feeling overwhelmed, and I had just seen a sliver of light. Was the physical transformation necessary? I don’t know how to play a woman who’s giving birth to her third child and then having to live in the aftermath of that body without doing it. Jason knows me and how I work and my process, and we both knew it had to happen. For me, it’s a way to get closer to the character and to try to feel as much as I possibly can. And that helped you tap into Marlo’s emotional state. Well, I thought I was just going to start with the physical transformation, and then I would get to her inner workings. And what ended up happening was very much like this character, and I think a lot of women. It really affects your mood and your brain when you’re eating that much processed food and sugar, and for the first time in my life I went into a really, really deep depression. You co-parent with your mother, Gerda. Yeah, she lives right up the road from us and is very, very involved in my kids’ lives. And it’s a relationship that’s very different from the relationship that I have with my kids. It’s one that I don’t think we talk enough about or value enough. We get so restricted in our thoughts of a mother and a father and what a family should look like, and we neglect other relationships like that of a parent, a grandparent and a child, a grandchild. And aside what it gives me, I just think my kids are going to be cool little dudes. Shifting gears, any thoughts about #MeToo and your own experiences with sexual harassment? I have definitely felt powerless in situations because of the power that some men in my career have placed in the space that I had to work in. Or even prior to working — just trying to get a job or going out for an audition and having that feeling of: “Oh, O.K., I get it. You’re letting me know that you’re the boss in the room, and my dignity is maybe not so important in this moment.” I feel in my core that there’s something about this movement that’s going to stick, and we’re just not going to go backward. I wish it was there 20 years ago when I started. I wish there was a way to speak about this stuff and not be judged or be shamed, or even just believed. You demanded — and received — equal pay to Chris Hemsworth in “The Huntsman: Winter’s War.” I’ve had to put my foot down and say, “Look, if we’re going to make another movie, then we have to do it fair.” The problem is that I know that I am not representative in my industry, and what I can do is not necessarily what every other woman out there can do. They might have families that they have to feed, and the fear of being replaced makes it not a choice. It’s those women that I want to help. And that’s where we have to change things.",The New York Times
2018,"For Cheyenne Westphal, an Education Fostered by Collecting","As chairman of Phillips, Cheyenne Westphal is among the highest-ranking women in the auction world — and she certainly has the best-sounding title, even though she reports to the chief executive, Edward Dolman. Ms. Westphal, 50, joined Phillips just over a year ago after a long, successful tenure at Sotheby’s, having run that house’s contemporary art sales in Europe for more than 15 years. She presided over some acclaimed events, including “Beautiful Inside My Head Forever,” a sale that raised $200.7 million in 2008 with a slate consisting entirely of direct-from-the-studio works by Damien Hirst. A native of Baden-Baden, the German spa town, Ms. Westphal studied at St. Andrew’s in Scotland and then at the University of California, Berkeley, under the renowned art history professor Anne Wagner. Now based in London, Ms. Westphal has been infusing Phillips with new energy. Last month, the house had its record sale when 44 lots of 20th-century and contemporary work brought in $135 million on the London block. Big tickets included Picasso’s “La Dormeuse” (1932) at $57.8 million and a Matisse sculpture, “Nu Allongé I (Aurore)” (1908), at $20.5 million. The Los Angeles-based artist Mark Bradford saw a record for his work when “Helter Skelter I” (2007) brought $11.9 million. Ms. Westphal, a collector who owns works by Gerhard Richter, Hirst, Banksy and Tara Donovan, among others, spoke about glass ceilings, powerful women and what she’d do differently in her career. (This interview has been edited and condensed.) You have an august title — what are the-day-to-day responsibilities of a chairman? It’s not managerial. It’s really outward-facing. So I focus on working with clients on a global basis. That also means getting and selling pictures or works of design, or watches. I think that’s called rainmaking. And it’s global now? I do have a schedule that moves according to the art calendar. March was focused on the London sales. We’re opening a new office in Hong Kong. May and November, of course, are in New York for the sales. June in Basel for the fair and December in Miami. Do you feel like a glass-ceiling breaker? It’s interesting, because I’ve been working in this industry for a long time. I started in 1990 — I had my own glass ceilings that I broke in a way, I suppose. I started running the contemporary department at Sotheby’s in 1999, when I was still really quite young. And it felt, at the time as a woman, that I could do that. It felt very open. But I do think that it’s very nice that there’s a woman as chairman of Phillips. Is hiring other women a focus? You’re absolutely right. I work very closely with Ed Dolman on whom are we going to hire, where are gaps that we need to fill. We have quite a lot of wonderful colleagues that we’ve hired — some from Sotheby’s, some from Christie’s — with truly amazing women among them. In Belgium, we were joined recently by Marianne Hoet, who was at Christie’s. She has lived and breathed art from the moment she could talk, basically, and it’s amazing working with someone like that. You’re on the advisory board of the Association of Women in the Arts. What does the group do? You have to be working for at least five years in order to become a member. It’s a forum where you can give career advice and really engage in very interesting conversations. The first discussion that I led was, “If you could look back today, what were the three things that you would change?” That brought out a very good conversation, and the next one was on mentoring. I’m very happy to be part of it. So what would you do differently? The very first thing that I said was, “You have to remember, when I started in the art world it was 1990.” Things have changed. I might have been working in what was called a contemporary field, but I was really only working with artists that were already very established. Every work of art had to be at least 10 years old before we sold it, and I don’t think I got out enough. It took me a few more years, courtesy of Charles Saatchi and the like, to pick up on the truly contemporary scene. So my advice to myself would be: I should have been more grass-roots right at the beginning. You’re up against a famous duopoly in Christie’s and Sotheby’s. How does that change your thinking? I love that question. I genuinely think that we have a chance to make a big dent in the duopoly. We can give collectors a third option that they like. I think the time is right. We really want to be the premier auction house in all areas that have to do with the 20th and 21st century. And, when you look at certain market segments, we are world leaders. We’ve got the top worldwide market share in watches. We are also leaders in photography. The biggest financial piece is, of course, the 20th-century market, and that’s where we are putting a lot of efforts. And since 2014 our sales are up 80 percent across the company. What makes you want to collect art? How can you be in this market, and live in this world, and not want to buy things? I’ve had a chance to work closely with some artists, like Damien Hirst. He and I did an amazing charity sale with Bono for (RED), and of course, the “Beautiful Inside My Head Forever” auction, that brought 220 works of art directly from the studio to market. And so, of course I’ve also collected Damien over the years. That’s no small buy-in. How many Hirsts do you own? If we’re counting prints, I have more than five. Less than 10. Who else? I really, really do love Gerhard Richter. Obviously, you know, he is very expensive, but wherever I saw an opportunity, whether it’s an edition or whether it’s an overpainted postcard, I take it. I’ve got one of his wonderful 1989 souvenirs. I don’t own, and probably won’t own, a large painting. But it’s not about scale. Do you think living with art as a collector gives you a useful perspective in terms of your job? Yes. And I’m lucky that in my office I can hang works of art that are coming up for sale — I spend time with the art. I’m lucky to have something amazing with me for six or eight weeks. You get a very different sense of the work.",The New York Times
2018,"Opinion | For City Hall, #MeToo Becomes #YouToo","Editorial The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section. For months, Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York has praised the #MeToo movement as a moment of national reckoning — and he has rarely missed a chance to let New Yorkers know where he stands. Last fall, he called on Gov. Andrew Cuomo to return campaign donations given to him by Harvey Weinstein, the Hollywood producer now infamous for decades’ worth of sexual assault allegations. In January, he told reporters that President Trump should be investigated for accusations of sexual harassment, along with the New York State Senator Jeffrey Klein, a Democrat accused of sexual misconduct earlier this year. That same month, he said private companies doing business with the city should disclose claims of sexual harassment against their employees. “Look, we’re in a very powerful moment in history and a lot of truth is coming out, and thank God for it,” he said in a news conference at the time. As it turns out, Mr. de Blasio has a #MeToo problem much closer to home. Data released by his administration last week shows that New York City doesn’t consistently track sexual harassment complaints across its 361,000-person work force. It has little or no information about how often those complaints lead to any discipline, or how long it takes the city to address the complaints. And until this month, it didn’t require city agencies to report sexual harassment complaints to City Hall in a uniform way. Over the past four years, city employees filed 1,312 complaints, 221 of which were substantiated. The data suggests widespread variation in the way complaints are handled and tracked across agencies. The New York City Housing Authority uses federal reporting rules to handle its sexual harassment complaints, for example, while many other agencies use city guidelines. Some agencies reported complaints by calendar year, while others did so by the city’s fiscal year, which ends in June, making it difficult to spot trends. And some agencies seem to warrant closer scrutiny. At the Department of Education, 570 complaints (a number city officials originally gave as 471) were filed over the past four years, but only seven were substantiated. At the Police Department, 94 sexual harassment complaints were made over roughly the same period, while 10 were substantiated. It is not clear exactly what has happened to many of the complaints that have not been substantiated. The mayor said he released the data as part of an overhaul of the city’s approach to sexual harassment. That’s good, because such an overhaul is sorely needed and well overdue. But any suggestion that the mayor is leading on this issue is overblown. The sexual harassment figures were released last Friday at 4 p.m., a time when mayors looking to bury bad news have always found their best shot. The data was incomplete and confusing, leaving reporters scrambling to give the public clear information about how the city was handling complaints. And the city released the data only after months of hounding from reporters and after the City Council approved legislation this month requiring agencies to report sexual harassment complaints in a meaningful way. Though Mr. de Blasio is expected to sign the legislation, he hasn’t yet gotten around to doing so. When the mayor finally took questions on the sexual harassment data, five days after it had been released, what he had to say caused many in the room to groan. “I’ll say it gently, there has been a history, it is pretty well known inside the education world, of some people bringing complaints of one type or another for reasons that may not have to do with the specific issue — and this is not just about sexual harassment, this is about a whole host of potential infractions,” he said after Yoav Gonen, a reporter for The New York Post, had asked why so few complaints at the Department of Education had been substantiated. When all is said and done, Mr. de Blasio may be correct that the Education Department is a special case. The agency has by far the largest number of employees. We were happy when Mr. de Blasio said this week that the city planned to hire 11 new employees to help the agency better address complaints and resolve them faster. But think about it for a moment. The mayor, confronted with evidence showing that his administration had for years done nothing to address the city’s uneven handling of sexual harassment complaints, responded to the mere suggestion of criticism by saying some complaints may be overblown. Later that day, Mr. de Blasio took to Twitter in the hopes of explaining just what he meant. “Let me be clear, every single person who has the courage to come forward with a sexual harassment complaint deserves to be believed,” he wrote. The mayor could benefit from the sage advice of a woman by the name of Brené Brown, a research professor at the University of Houston well known for her work on vulnerability, courage, worthiness and shame. If he does, Mr. de Blasio might save himself some trouble by trying out a new set of words, Ms. Brown’s signature prescription for companies and others who have failed the people they serve: “We’re sorry. We’ll fix it.”",The New York Times

2018,"For Faulting a Chinese Tonic, He Got 3 Months in Jail. Then Cheers.","BEIJING — For nearly 100 days, a Chinese doctor, Tan Qindong, was jailed for an essay he wrote. He slept beside a toilet, crammed in with other suspects, with little but steamed buns to eat. But his offending article was no dissident political tract. Dr. Tan was arrested for writing online late last year that a popular Chinese tonic liquor appeared to be quack medicine, and a potential “poison” for many retirees who drink it every day, lured by swarms of ads on daytime television and its claims to be favored by emperors centuries ago. He was released from a detention center this week after news of his arrest ignited a furor across China. Lawyers, doctors, even state-run news outlets have asked how the Hongmao Pharmaceutical Company, which has a record of exaggerated advertising claims, was able to persuade the police to arrest Dr. Tan for calling into question the benefits of its elixir. After he was freed on Tuesday, Dr. Tan told reporters that he had been in despair after he was arrested in January. But he said he was now unrepentant. “It was right to write this essay,” Dr. Tan said in a video interview produced by Beijing News, a newspaper and a website. “You must speak the truth a couple of times in your lifetime, and especially if a doctor doesn’t speak the truth and lets these ads about miracle cures run rife, they’ll hurt even more people.” For the Hongmao company, its attempt to silence Dr. Tan has backfired monumentally. Almost overnight, he has become a public hero for challenging the company, which is the mainstay of the economy in Liangcheng County in Inner Mongolia, a region in northern China where it is based. Some seemed to allude to broader lessons about China’s tight restrictions on public debate and criticism. “Freedom of speech and the right to exercise oversight are fundamental rights granted to citizens by the Constitution,” said an article on Thursday in Guangming Daily, a party-run newspaper. When it comes to food and medicine concerns, it added, “freedom of speech must receive particular protection.” Chinese news outlets and law experts have said that the Hongmao company and its official backers should explain who authorized his arrest and gave the police the power to spirit Dr. Tan 1,700 miles from his home in Guangzhou, a city in China’s far south, to a squalid cell in Liangcheng County. “This is a fairly typical instance of the public security authorities intervening in a civil dispute; it’s an overreach of power,” Wang Yong, a professor of commercial law at the China University of Political Science and Law in Beijing, said in an interview. The number of cases of Chinese companies mobilizing the police against critics or commercial rivals has shrunk in recent years, he said. “But in this Hongmao Medical Tonic case, the role of the public security authorities in local protectionism has again come to the fore,” Professor Wang said. “The fundamental problem is that for a long time in Chinese law, the boundary between civil and criminal cases has been blurred.” Dr. Tan never expected such a ruckus after he published his essay criticizing Hongmao in December. He initially shared his views on a blog, which he said only a few fellow doctors read. He then spread it on WeChat, a popular Chinese social media service, where it was viewed more than 2,000 times, according to the police. But the title of Dr. Tan’s article was eye-catching: “China’s miracle liquor, ‘Hongmao Medical Tonic,’ a poison from heaven.” Dr. Tan argued that the supposed curative effects of the 67 ingredients said to be used in the alcohol-based elixir were unclear at best, and could be dangerous for people with high blood pressure or diabetes. Hongmao had brushed aside these medical concerns, and its plethora of ads on Chinese television have exaggerated its powers, Dr. Tan wrote. Citing traditional Chinese medical theories, it claimed to relieve ailments like painful joints, frail kidneys, and weakness and anemia in women by combining 67 ingredients from plants and animals. His essay had little initial impact. But in January, when Dr. Tan entered an elevator to his apartment, two men jumped in and showed police badges. They revealed that they were officers, sent from Inner Mongolia to detain and question him. Later, they took Dr. Tan to Liangcheng County by train and a long car ride. There he lingered in jail for three months, arrested under Article 221 of the Chinese criminal code, a little-used provision that makes it an offense to fabricate and spread claims that seriously damage a business’s reputation. “Honestly, that time was not for humans,” Dr. Tan said after his release. “Every day I slept beside the toilet, every day I ate two and a half pieces of steamed bread. There was no freedom.” Dr. Tan said thoughts of suicide crossed his mind before he steadied himself and began to accept that he could be convicted and imprisoned for a year or two. But then this week, a news report mentioned his detention and his case became a national controversy. After the initial reports, the police in Liangcheng County at first insisted that they had plenty of evidence to support their charge. But they wilted under the pressure and criticism of the state-run news media, as well as the Chinese Medical Doctor Association. The Supreme People’s Procuratorate, the top national prosecution office, ordered the police to release him for lack of evidence. Dr. Tan was freed on a kind of bail. But the investigation has not officially ended, and his lawyer, Hu Dingfeng, said he could still be rearrested. But if the police entirely abandon their case, Dr. Tan may seek compensation from the government, Mr. Hu said in a phone interview. “I’m quite optimistic about how this case will go,” Mr. Hu said. “The case should be withdrawn, but it’s too early to say.” Meanwhile, the Hongmao Pharmaceutical Company’s attempt to silence one critic has ignited a firestorm of criticism and inquiries into its extravagant advertising. Health Times, a Chinese newspaper, estimated that Hongmao had violated rules against misleading advertising more than 2,600 times. “After we heard the news this week, we took the tonic off our shelves,” Han Li, a drugstore manager in Beijing, said in an interview. “There was not notification from above; we just worried that there’d be a problem.” An earlier version of this article misstated when Dr. Tan Qindong was arrested. As reported elsewhere in the article, it was in January, not December.",The New York Times
2018,"For Gaza Protester, Living or Dying Is the ‘Same Thing’","GAZA CITY — No one would ever pick out Saber al-Gerim from the crowds of Palestinians demonstrating against Israel along the heavily guarded fence that has helped turn the Gaza Strip into an open-air prison. Not for his youthful appearance. At 22, he wears ripped jeans and white sneakers, has a modish haircut and carries a few extra pounds from too many months without work. Not for his anger. Screaming “Allahu akbar!” and hurling stones with a sling, or straining to pull a cable hooked onto Israel’s barbed-wire barrier in hopes of tearing it apart, he is just one in a fevered multitude, a protagonist in nobody’s drama but his own. Not even for his willingness to risk death, or his dream of going home to a patch of land he has never seen and cannot really visualize.

Soldiers, the only Israelis Mr. Gerim has ever seen this close, can be spotted through the smoke of burning tires, moving about in their foxholes atop tall sand berms, occasionally launching tear-gas barrages, sometimes using live fire. Over a loudspeaker, one warns Palestinians to retreat or risk death. Mr. Gerim, well within range, and resting between slinging stones, shouts back: “We want to return!” Say what you will about root causes and immediate ones — about incitement and militancy, about siege and control, about who did what first to whom — one thing is clear. More than a decade of deprivation and desperation, with little hope of relief, has led thousands of young Gazans to throw themselves into a protest that few, if any, think can actually achieve its stated goal: a return to the homes in what is now Israel that their forebears left behind in 1948. In five weeks of protests, 46 people have been killed, and hundreds more have been badly wounded, according to the Gaza health ministry. With its 64 percent unemployment rate among the young, Gaza, under a blockade maintained by Israel and Egypt for years, presents countless men like Mr. Gerim with the grimmest of options. They can seek an education in preparation for lives and careers that now seem out of reach, and hope for a chance to eventually emigrate. They can join groups like Hamas or Islamic Jihad, devoting themselves to armed conflict with Israel in return for a livelihood and a sense of purpose and belonging. Or they can stay home, staving off boredom by smoking shisha, a tobacco-molasses mix, or stronger stuff, and wait for things to change. Mr. Gerim considers himself neither a terrorist nor a freedom fighter. He is not much for prayer or for politics; he says he does not belong to Hamas or Fatah or any other faction. He is a young man with nothing to do, for whom the protests have offered a chance to barbecue with friends late into the night, sleep late most mornings, make himself useful while singing songs of love or martyrdom or an end to suffering, and lash out at a hated enemy all afternoon. “It doesn’t matter to me if they shoot me or not,” he said in a quiet moment inside his family’s tent. “Death or life — it’s the same thing.” The protests, with an outdoor festival’s schedule of fun and games, performances and creative programming — and carnage every Friday — is meant to build to a climax on May 15, the day Palestinians mark the Nakba, or catastrophe, of their flight and expulsion when Israel was established 70 years ago. The protest, which grew out of a young activist’s Facebook page and was a grass-roots initiative before being embraced, organized and publicized by Hamas, the militant Islamist group that rules Gaza, has hardly scared the Israelis into altering their basic policy. Israel continues to treat the tiny coastal enclave like a deadly virus to be quarantined and, other than that, more or less tunes it out. But it has been a success in one important respect: It has cast a light onto the unsolved problem that is Gaza, and reminded a world that had seemed to move on to more urgent crises that its two million people, deprived of clean water, freedom of movement and a steady supply of electricity, are sliding steadily into despair. Mr. Gerim is typical in another way: He does not think of Gaza as his home, but he has no idea what home is. His grandmother, Haniya al-Kurdi, 80, was a little girl when her family left what is now Ashdod, Israel, in 1948. She has never been back, but has heard that there is a coffee shop next to where her home was. The closest anyone else in the family has gotten was in 2013, when Mr. Gerim’s sister, Sabreen, now 26, contracted cancer and was allowed to spend a year in Tel Aviv getting treatment. On the way there, her mother, Iktimal al-Gerim, asked their driver to point out Ashdod to them from the highway. For Mr. Gerim, the family’s old property is an idea more than a place he can actually picture. Israelis themselves he has had more experience with. When he was about 10, before the Israelis evacuated their Gaza settlements in 2005, Mr. Gerim climbed a tree outside his grandfather’s house to get a better look at the soldiers a few hundred yards away. Then he fell to the ground and broke his right hand. He has been as enterprising, and as ill-starred, ever since. He used to raise pigeons and chickens on his family’s roof, for fun and for food — until an Israeli airstrike hit a neighbor’s house and it collapsed on the coop, killing all of his birds. He sometimes dreams of working in an automobile-manufacturing plant, of traveling overseas to learn how to build cars, then coming back to Gaza to make them. But the closest he has ever gotten is loading tuk-tuks — motorcycles with cargo beds — or handling a pushcart to distribute sacks of donated flour, sugar and other staples to his fellow refugees. In the autumn, Mr. Gerim sometimes harvests olives. When there is construction work, he looks for chances to lay bricks or pour concrete. He has never had a regular job. He is stoic for a 22-year-old, though this may be an acquired response to adversity: His father is mentally ill, Mr. Gerim says, given to flying into destructive rages over the slightest disappointments. His family — two younger brothers, their sister and their parents — all share a single room with a tile floor and blankets but no beds. The kitchen floor is sand. The family’s debts are choking them, he says. Mr. Gerim’s industriousness shows at the protests, as does his stoicism. On Thursday, he arrived early at his family’s tent, a roomy contraption that was provided to them by the protest’s organizers, and set about sweeping the tarpaulin floor for the first of several times, before building a fire and cooking eggplants and tomatoes that city workers were distributing to the needy. At lunch, a charity handed out meals of chicken and rice, and then Mr. Gerim swept the floor of crumbs and bones, singing a love song as he did. He has no girlfriend, and no hopes of marrying. “There is no money, no work,” he explained. “Marriage is not free.” After lunch, he walked up to the fence for a quick look across at the Israeli soldiers, then foraged for firewood. He dragged a six-foot log more than a quarter-mile back to the tent, and broke it apart with his hands and feet. Later, he assembled kites from sticks, clear plastic and paper — and talked about attaching soda cans to them stuffed with gasoline-soaked rags, to sail over the fence and maybe set something or someone on fire. At 10 p.m., he and his friends began barbecuing a feast for 12. It didn’t end until 2:30 a.m. It takes a long time to cook 22 pounds of chicken wings on a grill about 18 inches across. Sitting around the fire, a friend named Abu Moaz, 25, said he wanted to use a kite to drop leaflets in Hebrew and Arabic warning Israeli soldiers to “evacuate your houses and return to the countries from which you came.” Everyone liked the sound of that. Mr. Gerim went home to sleep, but was back at the tent at 8 a.m. on Friday, sweeping again, building the wood fire, drinking tea with his neighbors. He went to Friday Prayer, then ate a falafel sandwich. At 2:30, he was crouching behind the barbed-wire barrier, whirling his slingshot like a helicopter rotor, aiming in vain at Israeli soldiers again and again. Around 5 p.m., he saw a group of men a few hundred yards to the south, and ran to see what they were doing. They had breached the barbed wire, and were trying to get to the main fence marking Israeli territory. Mr. Gerim hung back, and did not try to join them. Near him, a man fell, hit in the stomach by what seemed like a grenade fragment, Mr. Gerim said. He was not shocked by this, he said afterward. “I could be shot or killed anytime,” he said. “It doesn’t matter.” Night had fallen now; the protesters were headed home. And soon Mr. Gerim was singing again — this time a Lebanese tune of weariness with conflict. “Enough is enough,” he crooned softly in Arabic. “Enough for miseries, promises and words. School students, church bells, a soldier, a knight and the calls of prayer — all pray for prevailing peace.”",The New York Times
2018,"For Judy Collins, Marriage Is a Song of Many Verses","Love Is ... “We were just thinking of all the restaurants that we’ve outlived,” Judy Collins said on a recent afternoon at the Carlyle Hotel in New York. She was there with her husband, Louis Nelson. “It all started with Orsini’s,” Mr. Nelson said, referring to the famed pasta house in Midtown Manhattan where the couple had their first date. “There was nothing like Orsini’s.” And on top of it, Scaletta, their favorite restaurant on the Upper West Side, had just closed. “I was devastated!” Ms. Collins said from the couch in her suite. She had a show later that night in the hotel. “You live through the ups and downs of your personal life, and you have these favorite things in your life and then poof — they disappear.” The closings of favorite neighborhood haunts may serve as a mildly alarming metaphor for Ms. Collins, 78, the folk singer and social activist, and Mr. Nelson, 81, a designer. But no matter what, they always find a way to laugh through such things. This month the couple celebrates the 22nd anniversary of their wedding; in total they have been together for 40 years. “Very good for an old hippie,” Ms. Collins said with a smile. The two met at a fund-raiser for the Equal Rights Amendment. She was 38 and he was 42, and both were previously married and well along in their careers. “We were both old enough to know what was important,” Mr. Nelson said. Marriage never seemed necessary to the couple over their first 18 years together. They toyed with the idea off and on, but neither bit. “We always said, ‘If you want to, I’d be happy to,’” Mr. Nelson said. “Judy said to me, ‘I’d follow you anywhere.’ That’s pretty amazing.” That was enough of a commitment until Mr. Nelson had a serious complication from a burst appendix. Because they were not married, Ms. Collins was locked out of medical decisions. “I’m a hippie, I don’t get it,” Ms. Collins recalled. “And then I thought, wait a minute, what am I supposed to do? I went into his hospital room with a big frown on my face and said, ‘I think we should get married.’ In my fog, I’m thinking if you’re married, all of those things are simple.” They were married on April 16, 1996, at St. John the Divine in New York in front of 280 guests, 18 years to the day after they met. Guests included Peter Yarrow, Gloria Steinem, Bill Moyers, Susan Cheever and Donna E. Shalala. Pondering their four decades together, Ms. Collins said: “You share the good things, share the tragedies, share the traumas.” “We shared the worst thing that could possibly ever happen,” Mr. Nelson said. That was the death of Ms. Collins’s son, Clark C. Taylor (his father was Ms. Collins’s first husband), who committed suicide in 1992. “And we got through that,” Ms. Collins said. “I understand that a lot of people who come up against a tragedy like that don’t necessarily make it through, they don’t necessarily survive it.” They have survived bouts of jealousy too. Fifty years ago, Ms. Collins and Stephen Stills of Buffalo Springfield and Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young became romantically involved while making an album together. Their time together inspired Mr. Stills’s hit song “Suite: Judy Blue Eyes.” The two remained friends and even toured together in 2017; they’re hitting the road again on May 1. Ms. Collins has no problem being on tour with a former lover. But in the words of her husband, “it’s a rub.” “It’s annoying,” Mr. Nelson said. “But the thing is, I can say that.” He came to a second conclusion too: “I guess I won.” Leading separate professional lives has also, they believe, helped their longevity. Ms. Collins and Mr. Nelson do not collaborate — they even keep their bank accounts separate — but they do lean on each other for input. He comes to her shows and provides feedback, and she reads his writing projects. (He is probably best known for designing the Korean War Veterans Memorial mural in Washington.) “It means we help each other but we’re very clear about what we’re responsible for,” Mr. Nelson said. They are also not shy about asking for help. Once, Ms. Collins suggested they split up. Mr. Nelson said, “Absolutely not, let’s go see somebody.” “If you have an issue, get someone to help you deal with it,” Ms. Collins said. “Don’t be afraid to talk about it with the person. We both have good relationships with friends that we can run things by. I think that’s also important, that you have an integrated life but you’re not completely, emotionally dependent on one person to be solving everything you have.” So after 18 years together, was being married any different? “After we were married, I never had this feeling before, but all of the sudden I didn’t feel alone anymore,” Mr. Nelson said. “Things go on in your psyche that have to do with the nature of living on the planet and having certain things that are reliable and certain things that aren’t,” Ms. Collins said. “I didn’t have the same kind of feeling during my first marriage when I was young, at all. It was very sustaining and very palpable. But it does make a difference, and it’s a different feeling.” Mr. Nelson turned slightly to face Ms. Collins, his face relaxed and wide. “I don’t think you ever told me that,” Mr. Nelson said. “But I agree with you, it is different.” An earlier version of this article misstated the title of a Crosby, Stills & Nash song. It is “Suite: Judy Blue Eyes,” not “Sweet Judy Blue Eyes.”",The New York Times
2018,"For Lance Armstrong, Backing Down Might Have Hurt More Than Paying $5 Million","Sports of The Times WASHINGTON — Lance Armstrong just avoided a trial that could have ended with his financial ruin. He reached a settlement of $5 million, the amount his lawyers offered the federal government almost five years ago to make amends for Armstrong’s use of performance-enhancing drugs while he was sponsored by the United States Postal Service. All things considered, the settlement was a piddling sum. Armstrong’s cycling team received $32.3 million in its final contract with the Postal Service, and the government could have demanded three times that amount from him. He should be satisfied, content even. But that’s not how Armstrong is wired, at least not the Armstrong I covered for more than a decade. That man conceded nothing, ever. He told me once that he would welcome a jury trial in his fight against the government. He was positive that the jurors would side with him, believing that his misdeeds were canceled out by the good he had done as a cancer survivor. How many of them had been sick themselves or had loved ones with the disease? How many came from a generation that used to call it, in hushed tones, the “c-word,” as if it were a mystical, omnipotent force? Did any of them ever wear one of the ubiquitous yellow rubber bracelets from Livestrong, the Armstrong foundation that spread cancer awareness all over the world? The settlement on Thursday took away the chance to answer those questions, erasing another shot at victory. Instead Armstrong conceded, not only to the government but to Floyd Landis, his former teammate who initiated the federal fraud complaint as a whistle-blower in 2010. From there, Armstrong’s legacy unraveled. His seven Tour de France titles were revoked. He forfeited millions in bonus money, repaid a British libel settlement and was essentially pushed out of his own foundation. After Armstrong publicly confessed to doping in 2013, the government joined Landis’s case. Under the terms of Thursday’s settlement, Landis will get 22 percent, or $1.1 million. That part of the deal is pure defeat for Armstrong, and possibly more painful than any other element of the case. He has to pay the man who was responsible for his downfall, a fellow cyclist who committed similar sins: doping and lying extravagantly about it. Landis failed a drug test and was stripped of the Tour de France title in 2006, the year after Armstrong’s reign ended. Landis traveled around the United States professing his innocence, wrote a book on the subject and persuaded people to donate to his effort to regain his title and cycling eligibility. More than 1,700 contributed nearly $500,000 to the “Floyd Fairness Fund.” But Landis lost his legal fight and ended up ostracized from cycling. The whistle-blowing began. He confessed and agreed in court to repay his Fairness Fund donors. It’s entirely possible that he will keep very little of his $1.1 million from Thursday’s settlement, after taxes, a cut for his lawyers and any remaining compensation for the deceived supporters. Armstrong would surely find little solace in that. Still, aside from paying Landis for his betrayal, Armstrong can write off the settlement as an act of prudence. The case was scheduled to go to trial on May 7. It would have been great theater — the first time Armstrong’s ugly history had been explored in front of a jury. A cast of memorable characters, many with doping pasts who have been caught in grand lies, would have had the room rapt. Cycling’s longstanding code of silence would have sustained yet another smarting blow. I would have paid good money to see Betsy Andreu go toe to toe with Armstrong’s lawyers. The wife of Frankie Andreu, another former Armstrong teammate, Betsy became one of the first people to speak out against Armstrong’s doping — years before Landis did. Armstrong repeatedly tried bullying her, to no avail. Facing Andreu’s sharp tongue and backbone of steel, Armstrong’s legal team would have earned every dime of its fees. Armstrong smartly pre-empted that show. “It’s a sad day for justice,” Andreu said Thursday after she heard the news of the settlement. “Honestly, it feels like he just got away with it. This will just empower him to be as ruthless and as vengeful as ever. I’m disappointed because I was looking forward to telling the truth.” I’m not sure Andreu, who has been proven right many times against steep odds, was correct on this point — that a trial would have brought more justice than the deal cut by federal prosecutors. After the theatrics, the jury might still have sided with Armstrong. No matter how much he had been discredited as an athlete, I suspect there was enough adoration left for him to walk away with his bank accounts unscathed. Maybe the government sensed that. Maybe it didn’t. In the end, a mediator told both sides that $5 million was the magic number. The government, which had demanded at least $10 million to settle, took that advice and gained the satisfaction of holding a celebrity at least nominally accountable. In some circles, that sort of compromise is a win. If Armstrong can see things that way, he has changed a lot. And that’s a triumph of its own.",The New York Times
2018,"For Luigi Di Maio, It’s Now or Never to Lead Italy. Unless It’s Later.","ROME — As he leads the Five Star Movement in negotiations to form a new Italian government, Luigi Di Maio, 31 and brimming with confidence, seems to have a long political career ahead of him. But according to the rules of his party, this is Mr. Di Maio’s last shot. A fundamental rule of the Five Star Movement limits party members to two terms of elected office — at any level — over the course of their lifetime. Mr. Di Maio, who already served a term in Parliament, to which he was re-elected in March, is now in his second term. The Five Star Movement, politically slippery and ideologically vague, has a record of bending its unbreakable party rules when victory is at stake, but for now, the term limit on Mr. Di Maio has added an element of now-or-never desperation to his bid to be Italy’s next prime minister. It has also formed another complication in the stalemate after last month’s inconclusive election that may take weeks of negotiations to undo. Talks resume on Monday after a week in which the parties began testing the waters. Without the emergence of a consensus candidate or an alliance between Italy’s populist parties, the country could face new elections. Mr. Di Maio’s anti-establishment Five Star Movement won about a third of the vote, by far the most for any single party. But the right-wing and populist League, led by the equally ambitious Matteo Salvini, 45, emerged as the leader of a coalition of parties that won even more votes, but still not enough to form a government on its own. As a result, both men have strong claims to lead the next government. Neither seems particularly eager to let the opportunity of a lifetime slip away. “According to the rules of our democracy, it is necessary that there be some accords between different political forces to form a coalition,” Italy’s president, Sergio Mattarella, who has the job of cobbling together a sustainable government from the fractured parties, said on Thursday at the presidential palace. “This condition has not yet emerged.” For now — a key phrase when discussing fluid Italian politics — it seems doubtful such conditions will soon present themselves. For now, Mr. Di Maio says he is seeking support in Parliament from the center-left Democratic Party, which suffered a crushing defeat and was incessantly demonized by Five Star’s vast and often virulent social media network. (In an interview published in Saturday’s La Repubblica newspaper, Mr. Di Maio said it was time to “bury the hatchet.”) For now, the Democratic Party has resisted Five Star’s entreaties and retreated to the opposition. For now, Mr. Di Maio has said he refuses to join any government involving Silvio Berlusconi, the octogenarian whom Five Star leaders called a mafioso and a psychotic dwarf. For now, Mr. Salvini won’t abandon Mr. Berlusconi, whose comeback plans suffered a humiliating setback when Mr. Salvini outperformed him. For now, Mr. Di Maio and Mr. Salvini, who have expressed a similarly jaundiced outlook toward Europe, migrants and changes to the pensions system, are maintaining their opposing positions, despite Roman graffiti depicting the two in a lusty embrace. And for now, Mr. Di Maio says he is honoring the term-limit rule, of which he has said he is “proud.” Speaking on March 13 at Rome’s Foreign Press Club, Mr. Di Maio fielded a question about whether the term limit would still be valid if the president had to call new elections. The results of the vote would technically create a new legislature and a third term for Mr. Di Maio. In response, Mr. Di Maio called the two-term limit “fundamental for us.” “As I have always said,” he added, “the rule of the two mandates is sacrosanct.” Rocco Casalino, a spokesman for the party, said it was a “possibility” that in the case of a new election, Mr. Di Maio and all the other newly elected Five Star members of Parliament, including those currently in their second terms, would automatically receive nominations to their current seats. But he insisted such a maneuver had “never been discussed.” The party has loosened apparently hard-and-fast rules in the past. It scratched its early ban on members appearing on television, hired a media consultant and flooded the airwaves with telegenic candidates. It softened its originally draconian rules against members facing legal travails. It also pledged never to enter a coalition, a promise challenged by the current negotiations over forming a government. But the two-mandates commandment, central to the party’s anti-establishment character, has held. Soon before her election as mayor of Rome in the summer of 2016, Virginia Raggi, a member of the Five Star Movement, balked at the question of whether she would ever want to be prime minister. While her rocky tenure has made such a proposition unlikely, she explained in an interview at the time that since she had served in the City Council, she would be barred by the party’s rules from ever serving again. “At the moment it’s not thinkable,” she said, adding that she would be free to help out a successor in a free or paid capacity: “I don’t know. Maybe a consultancy, one can hypothesize.” Pressed as to whether great statesmen such as Franklin D. Roosevelt would have ever had the chance to hold higher office with such a rule, she said, “No, I don’t think so.” “Let’s put it this way,” she added. “In Italy, professional politicians have ruined politics.” But some former Five Star members say the rule has ruined promising politicians. Fabio Fucci, 38, who served an abbreviated term as councilman of the Five Star Movement, was elected as mayor of Pomezia in 2013. Mr. Di Maio and others hailed him as a model of good governance, but when he announced his desire to run for re-election, he found himself on the outs with the party’s power-brokers. Mr. Fucci argued in an interview that while the rule perhaps made sense 10 years ago when the party was a fringe protest movement, it was now “illogical.” Now that Five Star had become the leading political force in the country, the term limits prevented the formation of a management class with the necessary expertise at the local, regional and national levels, he said. To make his case, Mr. Fucci and others traveled up to Milan in the Spring of 2017 to Casaleggio Associates, the internet consulting firm run by Davide Casaleggio, the son of the party’s co-founder and the keeper of the web platform upon which Five Star elections are held. Mr. Fucci said Mr. Casaleggio, who is unelected and unchecked by term limits, has a “huge role” in political decisions. “He was inflexible,” Mr. Fucci said, recalling Mr. Casaleggio as saying, “The rule doesn’t change and you can forget it.” But that was for Mr. Fucci. Now it is the career of Mr. Di Maio, the mainstream face of the party, that is at stake. If the legislature were to be cut short for new elections, “not only Di Maio but dozens of newly elected members of Parliament” would be barred from running again. “This will weaken greatly the Five Star Movement,” he said. Beyond automatically reinstating nominations, the Italian press has reported that the party has considered redefining two mandates as 10 years in office. Mr. Fucci said he considered some such maneuver “very probable.” “Unfortunately, and I say this with disappointment and bitterness,” he said, “they change the rules because it’s convenient. In this case to save Di Maio and the other parliamentarians.”",The New York Times
2018,"For Many, Life in Trump’s Orbit Ends in a Crash Landing","News Analysis WASHINGTON — Another day, another casualty. Or two. By the time the sun set Thursday, Dr. Ronny L. Jackson was a failed cabinet nominee whose life had been picked apart for public consumption, and Michael D. Cohen was back in court facing possible criminal prosecution. A ride on President Trump’s bullet train can be thrilling, but it is often a brutal journey that leaves some bloodied by the side of the tracks. In only 15 months in office, Mr. Trump has burned through a record number of advisers and associates who have found themselves in legal, professional or personal trouble, or even all three. Half of the top aides who came to the White House with Mr. Trump in 2017 are gone, many under painful circumstances, either because they fell out with the boss or came under the harsh scrutiny that comes with him. Some of the president’s longest-serving aides have left with bruises. His son and son-in-law have hired lawyers and been interrogated. Even his lawyers now have lawyers as they face inquiries of their own. Proximity to Mr. Trump has been a crushing experience for many who arrived with stellar careers and independent reputations yet ended up losing so much. Rex W. Tillerson ran the world’s largest energy company. David Shulkin was a respected doctor and a “high priest” of the medical world. Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster was an admired warrior. So was John F. Kelly. Jeff Sessions held a safe seat in Congress. So did Tom Price. Now all of them are known for unhappy associations with Mr. Trump. All of them, of course, had varying degrees of responsibility for the troubles that would ultimately befall them. But like Dr. Jackson and Mr. Cohen, they have all emerged from the other end of Mr. Trump’s world deeply damaged. And their collective fate serves as a cautionary tale for those who might otherwise be tempted to join the president’s team but worry that they, too, might pay a price that would be too costly. Mr. Trump expressed outrage on Thursday about the toll exacted on some people close to him. Dr. Jackson, the White House physician and rear admiral who withdrew as nominee for secretary of Veterans Affairs after accusations of drinking on official trips and badgering his staff, is “an incredible man” whom Democrats were “trying to destroy,” Mr. Trump said on “Fox & Friends.” The president attributed it to the toxic atmosphere of the capital, saying he warned Dr. Jackson. “I did say welcome to Washington,” he said. “Welcome to the swamp. Welcome to the world of politics.” Mr. Trump likewise said that Mr. Cohen, his longtime lawyer who paid $130,000 to Stephanie Clifford, the pornographic film actress known as Stormy Daniels, before the 2016 election and now faces a federal investigation, is “a great guy” who “did absolutely nothing wrong” in that matter. But as he has with other advisers who have gotten in trouble, the president also distanced himself, suggesting that Mr. Cohen was in trouble for business dealings separate from any legal representation he had done for Mr. Trump. “I’m not involved, and I’ve been told I’m not involved,” he said. Over many decades, people who have entered Mr. Trump’s circle have discovered that they are bit actors in a movie he sees himself starring in. “People are not people to him, they are instruments of his ego. And when they serve his ego, they survive, and when they don’t, they pass into the night,” said Tony Schwartz, the ghostwriter on “The Art of the Deal,” Mr. Trump’s first book. “Ultimately, the fate of anyone who casts their lot with Trump is — you are passing through. And I just can’t think of anybody for whom it is not true.” Jack O’Donnell, the former president of Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City, and a vocal critic of his former boss, said many people have cycled through his world remarkably quickly without leaving much of an impression on Mr. Trump. Since President Trump’s inauguration, White House staffers and cabinet officials have left in firings and resignations, one after the other. “This is an individual who completely lacks compassion and empathy, and therefore the recycling of people, people crashing and burning, it means nothing to him,” Mr. O’Donnell said. “He might put on a public frown for a day because he’s upset that, in his mind, the admiral got railroaded out. But Trump couldn’t care less about the admiral.” The president tapped Dr. Jackson because he had come to like him and was impressed by him even though he had little management experience to run the government’s second-largest department. Shortly after his selection, several senior White House officials warned Dr. Jackson that it was a bad idea and that it was likely to end poorly. But Mr. Trump is a transactional person, and many have made transactional decisions to work for him understanding the risks. For some, it is a sense of public service and duty to country. For others, it is a calculation that the return on investment will be worth it. Indeed, Mr. Cohen has attracted enormous attention over the years as he built business ties because of his affiliation with Mr. Trump. Some who have come and gone managed to benefit from the experience in their own way despite the ordeal. Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary who was mocked on “Saturday Night Live” and maligned by the president and the news media, nonetheless has received lucrative speaking contracts and has a book coming out in July. Mr. Tillerson and Gary D. Cohn, the former national economics adviser, lost power struggles, but both still have hundreds of millions of dollars to console themselves, and friends say no one should feel sorry for them. Still, former advisers like Michael T. Flynn, Paul Manafort and Rick Gates have all been charged with or pleaded guilty to crimes and are looking at prison time. Others worry they may face the same fate. Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency whose spending and security practices were spotlighted Thursday at a contentious House hearing, may yet lose his job. Other presidents have seen associates get caught up in investigations or scandals that were highlighted or magnified because of their closeness. Plenty of advisers, aides and friends of Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton met untimely ends to their political careers or even went to prison, and critics of both presidents often said they did not seem to care about the consequences to those around them. The closer someone gets to a president, the harsher the spotlight can be. Many who seek the power and stature of the White House somehow convince themselves that their own foibles or misdeeds will not be exposed, only to learn otherwise, or become intoxicated by their new positions of influence and exercise poor judgment. And Washington can be especially unforgiving. “Here, ruining people is considered sport,” Vincent W. Foster Jr., a longtime Clinton friend and aide, wrote before killing himself in 1993. Several people who have been close to Mr. Trump over the years say that he is exceptionally good at rationalizing his own behavior to himself, and compartmentalizing the types of personal catastrophes that would leave other people emotionally ravaged. “I think that loyalty has always been a one-way street with Trump, and he doesn’t really care about the wreckages he engenders as long as he comes out where he wants to be,” said Tim O’Brien, a biographer who was sued by Mr. Trump over a book reporting that Mr. Trump had inflated his net worth. “Ronny Jackson’s reputation would never have been in play had the president not put him up for this job,” Mr. O’Brien said, adding that in Mr. Trump’s mind, the issue is, “Ronny was great, but Washington is a snake pit.” Michael D’Antonio, another Trump biographer, said, “Anyone who engages with the president and, before that, with him as a business person, had to practice self-defense even if they were his allies.” “All that matters to him,” he added, “is what you say and do in the moment in front of him.”",The New York Times
2018,"For McMaster, Pomp Under Bittersweet Circumstances","WASHINGTON — President Trump’s national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, handed off his duties to John R. Bolton on Friday, a bittersweet departure from the White House in which he played down personal animosities with Mr. Trump but left little doubt that he and the president had differences on issues like Syria and Russia. General McMaster met with Mr. Bolton, who then walked the halls of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, introducing himself to staff members still reeling from Mr. Trump’s second major shake-up of the National Security Council in 13 months. Mr. Bolton, a hawkish former envoy to the United Nations, takes up the job on Monday. Mr. Trump treated General McMaster better than other ousted officials in his administration. The president met the general and his family in the Oval Office to say goodbye. Dozens of staff members, including Vice President Mike Pence, lined the parking lot next to the West Wing to clap as he walked to his car. At a farewell reception Thursday evening in the Indian Treaty Room, General McMaster urged roughly 150 career staff members to keep working on policies that were codified in the National Security Strategy that he had rolled out in December. In two speeches during his final weeks, General McMaster, a 55-year-old veteran of Iraq and Afghanistan who first made his name with a book about how the Pentagon and Lyndon B. Johnson mishandled the Vietnam War, reinforced how differently he and the president thought about the world. He delivered a scathing denunciation of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, whom Mr. Trump has stubbornly refused to criticize. The general also emphasized the need for sustained American military engagement in Syria, where Mr. Trump has ordered a rapid drawdown. General McMaster’s criticism of Russia drew the most attention, especially his assertion that “we have failed to impose sufficient costs” on Russia for its subversion of American democracy. But it was his reference to autocratic leaders that arguably drew the most blood, given Mr. Trump’s assiduous cultivation of Mr. Putin and President Xi Jinping of China. “Even in the United States and other free nations, some journalists, academics, public officials and saddest of all, young people, have developed and promulgated idealized, warped views of tyrannical regimes,” General McMaster said this week at the Atlantic Council. Three weeks earlier, at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, he delivered an impassioned case against President Bashar al-Assad, as well as Russia and Iran, which he said were complicit in the Syrian government’s murderous campaign against its own people. While General McMaster said the United States had liberated nearly all the territory held by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, he said the American military would continue to carry out operations in Syria “until ISIS is completely defeated, population centers are stabilized and refugees can safely return home.” That prospect seemed in doubt last week after Mr. Trump declared, “We’ll be coming out of Syria, like, very soon.” At a meeting of the National Security Council on Tuesday, which General McMaster did not attend, Mr. Trump pressed his military advisers to wrap up the campaign immediately. The advisers, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., demurred, according to a person in the room. Instead, they sold the president on an alternative plan, in which troops would stay in Syria for months — though not years — to stabilize territories liberated from the Islamic State and to train local forces. General McMaster, people who know him said, favored a deeper commitment to Syria than even Mr. Mattis or General Dunford. His colleagues said he skipped the N.S.C. meeting to attend a military awards ceremony. But his presence would likely not have helped. By that time, Mr. Trump was long past listening to his national security adviser. The two men had a stilted relationship, even before the president decided to replace him with Mr. Bolton. They got off on the wrong foot during the debate over Afghanistan, these officials said, because General McMaster was so fervent about sending additional troops. Mr. Trump acquiesced, but unhappily — a frustration that may have colored his views on Syria, they said. The president also bridled at General McMaster’s military-style briefings, viewing him as pedantic and condescending. If the president’s treatment stung General McMaster, however, he did not show it. Unlike Rex W. Tillerson, who lamented the inability of people to treat one another with respect after Mr. Trump fired him as secretary of state on Twitter, General McMaster has not taken swipes at the president, either publicly or in remarks to staff members. He credited Mr. Trump with speaking out against oppression on visits to Poland, Saudi Arabia and South Korea. And he said Mr. Trump had properly expelled 60 Russian diplomats in the United States in retaliation for Russia’s role in a nerve-agent attack on a former Russian spy and his daughter living in Britain. “I am immensely proud of the vital role that the National Security Council played in restoring America’s strategic confidence,” he said in a statement released by the White House. General McMaster’s tenure had its low points, including his awkward defense of Mr. Trump after an Oval Office meeting in which the president disclosed highly classified information from Israel, about an Islamic State plot in Syria, to the Russian foreign minister and ambassador. Some of the general’s friends also winced when he defended Mr. Trump’s worldview in two opinion articles he wrote with Gary D. Cohn, Mr. Trump’s former chief economic adviser. They viewed it as inappropriately political for an active-duty military officer. General McMaster will retire from the military this summer; friends expect him to pursue a job in academia. But inside the N.S.C., General McMaster’s missteps mattered less than his management style. Officials said he brought stability to a department that had flailed in the aftermath of his predecessor, Michael T. Flynn, a former three-star general who was fired after 24 days in the job for lying to Mr. Pence about his contacts with the Russian ambassador at the time, Sergey I. Kislyak. “McMaster leaves, broadly speaking, with his dignity intact, which is more than can be said for most of Trump’s appointees,” said John A. Nagl, a retired Army lieutenant colonel who knows him well. Richard H. Kohn, a military historian at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who advised General McMaster on his doctoral thesis, said his departure was probably inevitable given the president he was serving. “McMaster was not going to pull his punches or dumb down his material in the belief that Trump could only sit still for that,” Mr. Kohn said. “In his view, that would be an improper way to serve the president of the United States.”",The New York Times
2018,"For Milford Graves, Jazz Innovation Is Only Part of the Alchemy","Calling Milford Graves an autodidact would be basically correct, but it gets at the wrong idea. Known as a game-changing drummer of the 1960s avant-garde, he’s also become a kind of underground thought leader in martial arts, natural healing and cellular biology. That wasn’t just by learning from what was available; he likes to build new systems, reshaping the channels by which information comes to him. Mr. Graves prefers to live in territory that’s uncharted, which often means unseen, but a small wave of recognition has started to flow his way. Since the fall, he’s been featured in a range of major art magazines and has exhibited his first sculpture (exploring connections between body and rhythm) at Hunter College. Last month, he played two triumphant sets at the Big Ears Festival in Knoxville, Tenn. And on Friday, the documentary “Milford Graves Full Mantis” has its New York premiere at the Film Society of Lincoln Center. The film’s main lesson is that it’s possible for an artist to spend an entire life working his way back from the source material: If he makes his principles expansive enough, he might even succeed in creating a loose society of learners around him, with or without an institution’s help. In one scene, Mr. Graves, now 76, stands in his backyard garden in Jamaica, Queens, speaking to the film’s director, Jake Meginsky. A vegetable provides more nutrients if you eat it directly, he says. Then he bends over and gobbles up a spinach leaf, chewing it down to the stem. This moment shows where his creativity flourishes — at the square root of super-seriousness and total innocence. Walking into his basement laboratory last Saturday, I found a wall lined with bottles of herbal extracts he’s made. He’s frequently sought out as a healer and acupuncturist by neighbors and artists across the city. Even to a knowledgeable jazz fan, the depth of Mr. Graves’s inquiries would probably be a surprise. He’s spent decades directly researching the human heart in that basement, using software he’s built to measure its textured pulse and convert it into a melody. By feeding those sounds back to a person, he’s found he can increase blood flow and possibly even stimulate cell growth. This work recently led Mr. Graves to a partnership with a team of Italian biologists. Last year, they patented a device that aims to use these melodies to regenerate stem cells. Mr. Graves does this research in the semi-suburban Queens home where he and his wife, Lois, have lived since 1970. (He grew up nearby, then inherited the house from his grandmother.) Years ago, he festooned its exterior with a creeping, Gaudíesque mosaic of stones and colored glass. In the comfortably cluttered basement, books on biology, Kundalini yoga and 20th-century music perch next to West African drums and Indian tablas. “I guess I’ve always been my own person,” Mr. Graves said, sitting in baggy sweatpants and a flannel jacket by a bank of six computer monitors. “I didn’t have no teacher, and that was great, because I was allowed to figure it out without anybody telling me to do it this way or that way. That came later, when I said, Oh, that’s the conventional way.” He grew up playing timbales in Latin jazz and mambo bands, where the rhythmic complexity is greater and more gravity-defying than in standard jazz drumming. Mr. Graves decided to move to the kit after hearing Elvin Jones with John Coltrane at a club — not to imitate what he’d heard, but to transcend it, add more range. “I said, ‘He’s cool, but I hear something else, man,’” Mr. Graves said. “I heard what he wasn’t doing.” On the drum kit, he met the new challenge of incorporating foot pedals. Playing Latin percussion, he recalled, “we’d be doing dance movements while we were playing. So I said: ‘That’s all I’ll do. I’m going to start dancing down below.’ I started dancing on the high-hat.” He fell in with the improvising avant-garde around 1963, recording first with the New York Art Quartet, a group that’s now iconic. He had begun to develop a polyrhythmic style of free playing, shapely and articulate and unabating. Delivering most strokes at about 60 to 80 percent force, Mr. Graves sometimes holds multiple sticks in one hand, each tapping a different drum with a different rhythm. He maintains a low and certain flow, even as patterns tilt and tempos shift. Soon he had radically remodeled his drum kit, ditching the snare drum and taking the bottom skins off his toms, getting a soupier resonance. He said the snare’s stiff-toned sound fit its European military origins better than it did his music. “The potential of how you can manipulate a vibrating drum membrane is much greater,” Mr. Graves said. He suggested that jazz drummers who use the snare might simply be “following orders without questioning those orders” — his idea of a grave sin. In 1973, he began teaching at Bennington College in Vermont, where he stayed on as a professor until 2012, holding forth on topics well beyond any single subject, despite having no more than a high school diploma. But he spent most of each week back in Queens, teaching percussion and yara, a hybrid martial art of his own creation, to interested artists and neighborhood residents. In “Full Mantis,” Mr. Graves is the only speaker, which makes for both a captivating sound poem (philosophical speech interleaved with performances) and a risk: It positions him as a solitary figure, too far ahead to relate to, whereas, in fact, he’s always been a convener and a sharer. For many years, he has hosted informal Sunday get-togethers in his basement, assembling different groups of guests, teaching and opening up broad discussions. “At the house, you meet people from all over,” said Mr. Meginsky, who served as Mr. Graves’s personal assistant for over a decade before making “Full Mantis” out of a combination of his own recordings and Mr. Graves’s old videos. “You’re meeting classical musicians there, you’re meeting consecrated priests in Santeria and Ifá and voodoo, you’re meeting doctors, you’re meeting guys who run the health food store in South Jamaica, drummers, gardeners.” The pianist Jason Moran, who sought out Mr. Graves for a duet at Big Ears, said in an interview that he’s long been impressed by the way Mr. Graves “turns the way that knowledge functions around, into the personal, away from the textbook.” He added: “He follows through on all those intuitions where I think most of us sometimes don’t, really spending his time.” Onstage at the Bijou Theater in Knoxville, the two musicians let their instincts multiply, Mr. Moran moving from chunky chords to rippling repetitions of a single high note. Even when the pianist swept down to the lowest reaches of his instrument, Mr. Graves seemed to stay underneath him, a ballast in constant flux, offering only the guarantee that he would listen, and change.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | For Mrs. Bush,"Op-Ed Contributor Mr. McBride is an author, musician and Distinguished Writer in Residence at the Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute at NYU. I met former first lady Barbara Bush about two decades ago. She had read my first book, “The Color of Water.” The book describes how my late mother, Ruth McBride Jordan, a white Jewish woman who was twice widowed to black men, raised 12 black children and sent them all to college. It led to an invitation to do a reading for the Barbara Bush Literacy Foundation and later a visit at her Houston home. When my mother and I got there, after passing through a Secret Service checkpoint, we knocked on the front door, fully expecting a butler of some type to answer. Instead, Mrs. Bush flung the door open herself. She was wearing a simple dress, pearls and comfortable shoes. She was beaming. She said: “Ruth! I’m so glad you made it!” They talked all afternoon, then spent the next day together. They had a lot in common. Between them, they’d raised 18 children. Mommy’s children were black. Mrs. Bush’s were not. Neither cared about that. They were, ultimately, mothers. I’ve thought a lot about that since Mrs. Bush died. About that common ground. And about where we all live now. I do not know enough about American politics to venture informed opinions about power, other than I wake up every day since the last presidential election feeling as if I’m living a nightmare. But Mrs. Bush was beyond politics. She represented a far greater power. She represented the power and grace of a mother’s love. Mother love is an unwieldy, cumbersome thing, hard to differentiate and quantify, yet powerful as the curve of an egg. It goes deeper than any political party. It is rooted in the idea of family and the underlying belief that here in America we can do better, ought to do better, should know more, strive for more, and most of all, love more. Mrs. Bush defined that feeling. She was, in a way, the great American woman we would all like to be. She was outspoken and honest. She said things that needed to be said, and occasionally things that ought not be. She carried the load, nursed the babies, drove the cars, prepared the food. She taught the children to walk, and when the children became adults, stood them up when they could no longer stand. Like any mother, she would take a bullet for those she loved — her husband, her children, her grandchildren. And like too many mothers, she suffered the immeasurable grief of losing a child when her 3-year-old daughter, Robin, died of leukemia. She and her husband, George Bush, were at Robin’s bedside when the child passed peacefully. “I never felt the presence of God more strongly than at that moment,” she wrote in her memoir. Like all mothers, she worked. After her husband graduated from Yale and left the Navy following World War II, the couple moved to Odessa, Tex., where George began his career as a warehouse sweeper and oil parts assemblyman. They lived in a tiny flat attached to a hothouse next door, with a shared bathroom. Her neighbors were not the “forgotten blue-collar working class” that the press likes to talk about these days, but rather oil workers and friends whom Mrs. Bush would recall with fondness the rest of her life: the Casselmans, Smitty the Oklahoma salesman who gulped bourbon from the bottle, the customers at Pinky Roden’s liquor store, and the oil company employee who gave her husband — a happy soul who dragged all sorts of characters back to their crowded house — a ride home in the back of his pickup truck on Christmas Eve after the company offered an open bar for its oil workers. “He dumped George in the yard and drove away,” she wrote. “It was a long time before I let George forget it.” During her husband’s eight years as vice president, she traveled 1,629 days, visited 50 states and 65 foreign countries and covered 1.3 million miles, which is 54 times around the world. She mothered her kids in every kind of living quarter imaginable — cheap inns, well-heeled mansions, hotel rooms, apartments and the back of a station wagon that she drove from Maine to Texas every year. She hosted 1,192 events at her house and 1,232 events in Washington. Yet she still answered her own front door. Her smile was genuine, her delight infectious. Mrs. Bush liked to laugh, and she could converse as easily with a Mexican mother of seven as she could with a head of state. It made no difference. She was a true Christian. My mother admired her. She was not without fault. Her public statements sometimes caused controversy. She recalled wearing sneakers to meet the prime minister of Greece. When she was a young bride-to-be and was called upon to cook for Mr. Bush’s younger brothers, her future mother-in-law bragged to Mrs. Bush’s mother that Barbara was a wonderful cook. Her mother, shocked, responded, “Oh?” Peanut butter and jelly was the actual menu. It didn’t matter. The menu was love, something Mrs. Bush learned from her own mother, whom she would lose in an auto accident after she married, unable to attend the funeral because she was living in California and very pregnant with her second child and, ironically, her own duties as a wife and mother prevented it. There was nothing to do. Family comes first. And what a family she raised. In the tight-knuckled, bare-fisted world of Washington politics, the Bushes proved over the years that they could hit as hard as anyone. Some did not like it. Still, you will not find a more loyal family. Republican, Democratic, black, white, Latino, North, South, Dixie, New England — you won’t have to look far down the Bush family line to find some of this, or that, or the other. They’re a real American family, flawed as all families are, shaped by a matriarch who understood, even as a young woman, that in all the ways of life, the importance of a mother’s love is paramount. It is the last line of reason and discourse in a planet gone seemingly mad. It is our last breath and greatest hope. Motherhood defines a society. Barbara Pierce Bush defined every single bit of it. In the last years of her life, she dragged her octogenarian body onto planes and buses and into cars from one end of the country to the other, raising money for her literacy foundation. She despised ignorance. She despised it because she knew it was wrong. And if you loved her and what she represented, you’ll go out and get a book. And you will read it. You will turn off that TV and pay attention. And cut the tweeting. And cut the Facebook chatter and all the other nonsense. And you will get busy doing what Barbara Bush spent a majority of her life doing. You will fight ignorance. You will learn to love. And in doing so, you will do what she did. You will change the world.",The New York Times
2018,"For Mueller, a Feared Weakness Becomes a Strength","WASHINGTON — Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating Russia’s interference in the 2016 election, transformed this week what has appeared to be a weakness — his relative lack of independence — into a strength. Since he was appointed in May by Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, the scope of Mr. Mueller’s power has been intensely debated. President Trump’s allies have portrayed the special counsel as running amok as his focus expanded to the business dealings of Mr. Trump’s associates. The president’s critics have worried that Mr. Mueller is too vulnerable to potential Trump administration interference. The tension is familiar when the president comes under scrutiny by law enforcement, as the vast powers of the executive branch are at stake. Similar tensions cropped up during the Watergate, Iran-contra, Whitewater and Valerie Plame leak investigations. Now they have spurred the first significant legal fight arising from Mr. Mueller’s work, as Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump’s onetime campaign chairman, battles charges related to payments he received from a pro-Russia government in Ukraine. “Manafort’s fight over Mueller’s authority goes to a central question in our republic, going all the way back to Plato’s question, ‘Who guards the guardians?’” said Neal Katyal, a former Justice Department official who drafted its special counsel regulations in 1999. “The central debate is how much independence do you want, versus how much accountability for the prosecution. There needs to be a balance between these two competing goals.” Last month, Mr. Manafort asked Judge Amy Berman Jackson of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia to dismiss his indictment. Portraying Mr. Mueller as out of control, Mr. Manafort’s defense lawyers contended that criminal allegations arising from their client’s Ukraine dealings either exceeded the limits of the special counsel’s assigned jurisdiction or that Mr. Rosenstein had improperly given Mr. Mueller a “blank check” to prosecute anything. Mr. Manafort has also filed a lawsuit making similar arguments. Mr. Mueller’s original assignment from Mr. Rosenstein was to look into Russian meddling in the 2016 election and any links to Trump campaign officials, with the ambiguous addition of “any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation.” In a response this week, Mr. Mueller’s team insisted that Mr. Manafort’s Ukraine dealings, in light of his campaign role, were relevant to investigating links between Russia and the Trump campaign. The team also argued that Mr. Manafort had no right to challenge Mr. Mueller’s jurisdiction. (It did not, however, invoke the widespread belief that Mr. Mueller is using the Ukraine charges to pressure Mr. Manafort to divulge what he knows about 2016 events as part of a plea bargain.) But members of Mr. Mueller’s team also backed up those arguments with a striking move: They emphatically pointed to their subordination to Mr. Rosenstein — the acting attorney general for the Russia investigation because Attorney General Jeff Sessions is recused from it. While Mr. Rosenstein has testified that he knows about and approves of what Mr. Mueller is doing, the filing went into significant new detail, including disclosing that Mr. Rosenstein wrote a memo on Aug. 2 blessing the idea that Mr. Mueller’s jurisdiction extends to Mr. Manafort’s Ukraine-linked dealings. “The acting attorney general appointed the special counsel, defined his jurisdiction, understands the scope of his investigation and has specifically confirmed that the allegations that form the basis” of Mr. Manafort’s prosecution are within Mr. Mueller’s purview, the filing said. “In these circumstances, no serious question of political accountability can be raised.” Mr. Mueller’s assertive use of a Trump appointee’s control over his investigation as a shield against Mr. Manafort’s attack was a remarkable moment in the history of recurring tensions over the independence of investigations touching on high-level executive branch officials. After the Watergate scandal, in which President Richard M. Nixon forced the Justice Department to fire the prosecutor investigating him, Congress enacted a law permitting the appointment of an “independent” counsel who would report to a panel of judges rather than to a presidential appointee. Although the Supreme Court upheld Congress’s constitutional power to make that arrangement in a 1988 case, both political parties came to see it as a bad idea. In 1999, when the independent counsel statute expired, lawmakers did not renew it. As a replacement, the Justice Department created a regulation to permit the appointment, from outside the government, of a special counsel who would exercise day-to-day independence but remain subject to control by the attorney general, who could veto decisions like whether to file charges or expand jurisdiction. At the same time, it limited the attorney general’s power to fire a special counsel to cases of misconduct. But that regulation has rarely been used. The most high-profile case arising during George W. Bush’s administration — the appointment in 2003 of Patrick J. Fitzgerald to investigate who leaked the identity of Valerie Plame Wilson, a C.I.A. official — bypassed its envisioned arrangement. Mr. Fitzgerald, then a United States attorney in Chicago, was appointed as a special counsel by James B. Comey, then the deputy attorney general, after Attorney General John Ashcroft recused himself from the investigation. Mr. Comey also delegated his supervisory powers as the acting attorney general to Mr. Fitzgerald, permitting the prosecutor to take major investigative steps “independent of the supervision or control of any officer of the department.” By contrast, after Mr. Trump fired Mr. Comey in May from his subsequent job as F.B.I. director and Mr. Rosenstein appointed Mr. Mueller as special counsel, Mr. Rosenstein invoked the regulation — meaning he retained supervisory control. At the time, some Democrats greeted that arrangement with suspicion. They worried that Mr. Rosenstein — a Trump appointee who had helped with Mr. Trump’s firing of Mr. Comey by writing a memo criticizing Mr. Comey’s handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation — would keep Mr. Mueller on a short leash. During a June hearing, for example, Senator Kamala Harris, Democrat of California, pressed Mr. Rosenstein to instead create a more independent special counsel who could oversee himself, like Mr. Fitzgerald. “Are you willing to do as has been done before?” she demanded. Mr. Rosenstein demurred. While noting that Mr. Bush could have fired Mr. Fitzgerald for any reason — so working under the regulation gave Mr. Mueller greater protection — he also said there were other complicated legal issues that led him to his decision. (One of the complexities may have been that Mr. Mueller was not a current Justice Department employee at the time of his appointment, unlike Mr. Fitzgerald in 2003, so Mr. Mueller most likely could not have been delegated attorney general supervisory powers, Mr. Katyal said.) The anxieties of that period make it all the more striking that, 10 months later, Mr. Mueller’s team is stressing his subordination to Mr. Rosenstein to repel Mr. Manafort’s attack. Still, several specialists cautioned that Mr. Mueller’s subordination could revert to a weakness if Mr. Trump were to fire Mr. Sessions or Mr. Rosenstein, putting someone else in charge of the special counsel. Against that backdrop, Julie O’Sullivan, a Georgetown University law professor and a former federal prosecutor, worried about the lengths the filing went to in detailing Mr. Rosenstein’s approval for Mr. Mueller’s actions. “Mueller’s lack of independence was viewed as a real problem, but now it’s a response to any attack on the indictment,” she said. “I do wonder, though, if he hasn’t put Rosenstein in additional jeopardy.”",The New York Times
2018,"For Neil Patrick Harris, It Takes an Adult to Make a Kids’ Show","A Word With As the hooknosed, hygiene-challenged, villainous Count Olaf in “A Series of Unfortunate Events,” Neil Patrick Harris could easily be the stuff of nightmares — yours and your children’s. After all, “Unfortunate Events,” in which he wickedly (and continuously) places the Baudelaire orphans — Violet (Malina Weissman), Klaus (Louis Hynes) and Sunny (Presley Smith) — in harm’s way while chasing after their inheritance, isn’t typical family fare. But the malice and nefariousness are surprisingly enjoyable. “We’re far from friendly, but I like that a 10-year-old and a 40-year-old can watch the same scene and enjoy it for different reasons,” he said of the show’s $10 vocabulary and themes. “We feel like we’re making something that, in all of its nastiness, in all of its cynicism, is good.” Hewing closely to Daniel Handler’s marvelously macabre Lemony Snicket novels, the series, whose second season is now streaming on Netflix, will end after Season 3, with the last of the 13 books. Which will give Mr. Harris, 44 — a multiple Emmy nominee as the womanizing Barney in CBS’s “How I Met Your Mother” and a Tony winner as the transgender East German rocker in “Hedwig and the Angry Inch” — more time to spend with his own family: his husband, David Burtka, and their 7-year-olds, Gideon (his thing is chess) and Harper (hers is belting out songbook standards), who live in New York while he shoots in Vancouver. And yes, the twins are allowed to watch their father at work. “Of course, it’s probably not the perfect content because it’s pretty dark — a lot of slapping children and smoking cigarettes and trying to murder 14-year-olds,” he said with a vaguely maniacal chuckle after pouring himself a glass of Scotch at a New York photo studio. “I don’t know that that’s a conversation to have at the dinner table, but for us it’s a little bit different.” Here are edited excerpts from the conversation. So what is that, two fingers of Scotch? No, not two fingers. [Measures against his index finger. And yes, it’s slightly over.] How dare you, ma’am. Why don’t you take a sip and tell me where we are we in the Baudelaire tribulations? The kids are still trying to evade Count Olaf, and the only difference is they’ve both grown about three inches, so we quickly reference how remarkably tall they’ve gotten. And there’s more action. The Baudelaires for the first few books are shuffled from location to location from protector to protector, and at this point realize that they’re on their own and have to take some personal action in order to get away from Olaf and stick together as a family. And that is a good fuel for the engine. And Olaf? He’s losing it as the series goes on. He’s Wile E. Coyote, frustrated that the Road Runner keeps getting out of his reach. So he’s tired and swinging roundhouse knockout punches, even though that’s not the best way to box. And that’s fun to play. You’re unrecognizable as Olaf. And Olaf himself plays different characters. How much time do you spend in the makeup chair? About two and a half hours. I start in the special-effects makeup trailer and do all the prosthetics. I have a big forehead piece that covers my eyebrows and a nose that goes on, and then they paint it to match my skin tone, airbrush the whole thing with wrinkles and spots and hand-paint bags under the eyes and capillaries. After that I get a three-piece unibrow, two muttonchops, a goatee and a two-piece wig. And then I get dressed, and I’m ready to go. Whew. As much time as I spend in the process of looking like Olaf, it pales in comparison to the workload that Louis and Malina have. They’re on set doing their scene, blocking and learning lines, and then they’re rushed to school to think only about honors biology. Then there’s a knock at the door, and they stop where they are and go recite dialogue and act stressed and emotional. Rinse and repeat all day long until they’re pumpkined, which is the term for when they’re wrapped. You recently rented out a theater in your hometown, Albuquerque, N.M., so that locals could see “Love, Simon” free of charge. It was a movie that I think is profound, about a gay high school student who is afraid to come out and falls in love, and I was really moved by just how pure it was. But that purity doesn’t have to be pretentious. It’s not “Brokeback Mountain”; it’s more “Sixteen Candles,” handled in such a confident, casual, easy way. So I got 111 people to see it, and hopefully they were moved by it and will tell their friends and pay it forward. Talking about smart kids, you also host NBC’s “Genius Junior.” What’s the appeal? It’s these remarkable kids that do the most amazing feats, who can spell “omnidirectional” backward as fast as you can say it and remember a shuffled deck of cards and know the Greyhound bus map. These are achievable goals that kids can accomplish. If it can be aspirational and inspirational and still watchable, then I’m happy to be the ringmaster of that circus. Does it make you want to go home and quiz Harper and Gideon? I’m having to shift into that parent. Not, certainly, spelling backward. But to get them to recognize that homework, that reading, that writing, isn’t something that they do for an hour until they can play — and so they’re excited to know that it doesn’t stop until you’re 80 and you have cataracts. So I’m on them to make sure they’re using sentence structure well, that they’re spelling things right, that their E’s look uniform. It’s time.",The New York Times
2018,"For Politicians Scraping Bottom, a Scarce Resource: Impeachment Lawyers","NEW ORLEANS — As he navigates a seamy swirl of scandals, Gov. Eric Greitens of Missouri finds himself the newest member of a small, unenviable club: governors so embattled they risked being expelled from office. But political crackups have given rise to another similarly select group: the handful of lawyers who shepherd governors and lawmakers through the trauma of a possible impeachment. Despite the high stakes and bright lights, the nation’s statehouse impeachment bar is made of up just a few battle-tested lawyers who have improvised legal strategies largely on history and hunches. So it was hardly surprising when Mr. Greitens’s office brought in Ross H. Garber, a professed “Watergate nerd” who, after representing besieged governors in Alabama, Connecticut and South Carolina, has arguably become the nation’s leading practitioner of a subspecialty whose relevance can be a barometer of political rancor. “The personalities are different, the politics are different, the facts are always different,” Mr. Garber, 51, said in an interview at his purple-hued shotgun home near the French Quarter in New Orleans. But when a governor is on the ropes, he said, “some fundamentals wind up being the same.” An impeachment, lawyers who have worked on such proceedings around the country agree, is a political process imbued with law, where electoral rivalries and ambitions uncomfortably share the stage with talk of traditions and procedures. “The interesting thing about an impeachment — and people always need to keep this in mind — is it’s inherently a political exercise, and not a legal exercise,” said David Ellis, who prosecuted Gov. Rod Blagojevich of Illinois during his Senate trial in 2009 when Mr. Blagojevich was convicted and removed from office. “It’s governed by the legislature, not the courts. Courts have all sorts of procedural protections built in — due process rights, impartial juries — but you cannot perfectly analogize that to the legislative realm.” With impeachments still relatively rare, even as some Democrats talk of removing President Trump from office, lawyers working recent cases in state capitals like Montgomery, Ala., have found little precedent to guide them. Instead they often find that the processes long codified in constitutions can, in modern practice, be murky to the point of inviting chaos. That lack of clarity invites clashes about privileges and subpoena power, legislative authority and access to evidence. Arcane-seeming subjects may be able to reshape a state’s approach to executive power. And a particular brand of politics — fueled by self-flagellation, piety, pride and legal jeopardy — seems to thread through every threatened impeachment. “There’s a common structure, but as far as how you’re supposed to do it on the ground, substantively or procedurally or in terms of burden of proof, there’s a lot of debate on that, and not a lot of consensus,” said Jackson R. Sharman III, who was special counsel to the Alabama legislative committee that investigated Gov. Robert Bentley before his resignation last year. The absence of norms lends extraordinary influence to the lawyers who are often tasked with speedily setting up something resembling, but not always behaving like, a traditional investigation and trial. Mr. Ellis was counsel to the state’s House speaker when legislative leaders urged him to take the case, a role he said he accepted only after “a pregnant pause.” He had about two weeks to prepare for trial. Mr. Garber, a white-collar criminal defense lawyer who once edited his high school newspaper, more or less fell into impeachments as a legal niche. After Mr. Garber’s bid for Connecticut state treasurer faltered — he was “the silver medalist,” he noted wryly — Gov. John G. Rowland’s office sought the lawyer’s help for a federal corruption investigation. Mr. Rowland had lawyers on his staff, but, like those in all governor’s offices, they were far more familiar with legislative haggling than with inquiries that could lead to prison terms. Mr. Rowland resigned before lawmakers could decide whether to impeach him. But Mr. Garber, who describes his work as safeguarding the institutional traditions and privileges of the governor’s offices he represents, had stumbled into a legal arena in which few others were experts. He was later asked to advise Gov. Mark Sanford of South Carolina, whom lawmakers eventually declined to impeach over accusations connected to his whereabouts while he visited his mistress in Argentina. And then last year, Mr. Garber, whose usual work includes handling regulatory investigations and international trade issues, was on Mr. Bentley’s team after the Alabama governor was enmeshed in a sex scandal. He said his name comes up so often because there are so few in the field. “Because so much of what happens isn’t reported or recorded or even known, one of the things I bring to the process is the sense of having done them and spent a lot of time studying them,” Mr. Garber said. At the federal level, the United States Senate has conducted just 19 impeachment trials in its history; nearly all have been of federal judges, including the most recent, in 2010. State legislatures have impeached a host of lower-ranking officials, from a university regent in Nebraska to a Kentucky agriculture commissioner, but only 16 governors have ever been impeached, and almost all were before the Great Depression. Although some governors, like Mr. Sanford, withstand the pressure, modern governors tend to succumb to political or legal realities and leave office before an impeachment can happen. Neither Mr. Bentley, who now practices dermatology in an Alabama college town, nor Mr. Sanford, a member of Congress, responded to messages. Mr. Blagojevich and Mr. Rowland, who were convicted of corruption charges after leaving office, are in federal custody. For Mr. Garber, whose bills are often paid with tax dollars because he is not representing a governor’s personal interests, part of his job is ensuring that politics alone do not settle impeachments and undermine the authority of governors for generations to come. His goal, he said, is to argue “that our constitutional system is set up so that elections don’t get overthrown because of political whims, that elections have consequences and we don’t throw those out absent very, very serious acts that affect the public official’s office, that are proven with a high degree of certainty after a fair process.” Missouri lawmakers are still grappling over how they will reckon with Mr. Greitens, who has been criminally charged with two felonies: invasion of privacy, for photographing a nude or partially nude person without the person’s knowledge or consent, and for tampering with computer data for allegedly obtaining a charity’s donor list and using it for political fund-raising. The governor has denied criminal wrongdoing and rebuffed demands for his resignation, calling the efforts against him “a witch hunt.” A legislative committee will decide in the coming weeks whether to pursue the impeachment process that is broadly outlined in the Missouri Constitution. Mr. Garber, who teaches about political investigations and impeachments at Tulane University’s law school and largely splits his time between Washington, Hartford and New Orleans, declined to detail any of his plans for the Missouri case. His record, though, suggests that he will argue, in public and in private, that lawmakers should not hastily negate the voters’ choice for governor and should save impeachment for a most exceptional case. Like just about every impeachment lawyer these days, he is likely to look to history, where the proceedings against President Richard M. Nixon remain especially important for lawyers working in state capitols. More than 40 years later, it remains a lesson in the strategies and risks that come with representing the most powerful figures in government. “Institutions, even something so sophisticated as the White House,” Mr. Garber observed, “aren’t set up to deal with these kinds of crises.”",The New York Times
2018,"For Reviews of Times Employees’ Books, the Only Guarantee Is Integrity","Times Insider delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how news, features and opinion come together at The New York Times. Charlotte Alter’s review for The New York Times of “Chasing Hillary,” the Times political reporter Amy Chozick’s memoir of a decade covering Hillary Clinton, is a largely positive one. Ms. Alter calls the book “funny and insightful.” But it doesn’t always happen that way. Even for a Times reporter’s book, a positive review is never guaranteed. In fact, as with any book, there’s no guarantee it will be reviewed at all. “We’re judging on the book’s merits or newsworthiness,” said Pamela Paul, the editor of The New York Times Book Review. “Not only in our own assessment as editors and critics here, but also in what we think will be of interest and relevance to Times readers.” Ms. Chozick’s memoir, which by Tuesday topped Amazon’s best-seller list in the “Elections” category, made the cut. But plenty of other books by Times employees (or former employees, or employees’ spouses or children) haven’t, to their chagrin. That’s in keeping with the Review’s mission to apply the same rigorous journalistic standards to book criticism as are practiced at every other desk at the paper, in terms of both what is covered and how. Once a book has been selected, the next task is finding a reviewer — and the editors of the Review take very seriously the mandate not to assign a review to anyone who has any personal affiliation with a book’s author. “You can disagree with a reviewer’s assessment, but you shouldn’t distrust it,” Ms. Paul said. “So, for that reason, conflict of interest and fact-checking are two of the most important things that we worry about here.” If a book was written by a Times employee, that means The Times’s daily critics — Dwight Garner, Parul Sehgal and Jennifer Szalai, all of whom are full-time employees at the paper — cannot review it; nor can anyone from a directly competing news organization. Beyond that, Ms. Paul said, the editors apply the same standards they would to any other book. A reviewer cannot review a book by anyone with whom he or she shares an agent, publisher or editor; anyone the reviewer has blurbed, or been blurbed by; anyone, even, with whom the reviewer has shared a contentious moment on a panel or at a conference. Friends are out, as are enemies. The ubiquity of social media has complicated these assessments. “If you’re following someone on Twitter or if you’re ‘Facebook friends,’ I think that we have all been disabused of the notion that that actually constitutes a friendship,” Ms. Paul said. Those relationships aren’t necessarily seen as a conflict of interest that would preclude a review. Of course, the literary world is a small one — as are the fields represented by many of the books the Review covers. “In certain areas, everyone knows everyone,” Ms. Paul said, citing politics, science and even British literature. (“It’s an island nation,” she added.) It can be difficult to find a reviewer who has never been in the same room as a book’s author; and on a case-by-case basis, some passing familiarity can be acceptable. A handshake at a party is fine; a sexual relationship — even years ago, as at least one prospective reviewer has tried to emphasize — is not. In the case of “Chasing Hillary,” Ms. Chozick, the author, had never met Ms. Alter, the reviewer, who is a radio host and a national correspondent at Time magazine. In choosing her, Ms. Paul sought a reviewer who could “understand the political landscape but who would also be able to assess the book as a memoir,” she said. Without exception, the reviewer must be able to answer “yes” to the question: “If need be, would you feel free to criticize the book?” And criticize they do. Though it wasn’t the case this time, Times employees have received plenty of negative reviews in the past. The Books desk doesn’t edit opinions, nor does it kill and reassign a review if it comes back negative. “There have been instances where writers, both in the newsroom and on the opinion side, have had very negative assessments in the Book Review,” Ms. Paul said. “You just hope that you don’t run into that person in the elevator.”",The New York Times
2018,"Opinion | For Russia, Trump Was a Vehicle, Not a Target","Op-Ed Contributor Mr. Watts testified on March 30, 2017, at a Senate Select Committee on Intelligence hearing and presented a statement, “Disinformation: A Primer in Russian Active Measures and Influence Campaigns.” Last week, in a sentencing memorandum for the lawyer Alex Van Der Zwaan, the special counsel’s office noted that Rick Gates and “Person A” — an unnamed figure who has ties to a “Russian intelligence service and had such ties in 2016” — “were directly communicating in September and October 2016.” What coverage there was of this staggering claim — evidence of a direct link between a member of Donald Trump’s campaign and Russian intelligence — and the Van Der Zwaan filing was quickly overtaken by controversy over the president’s relationship with an adult film star. It’s been a year since I testified to the Senate Select Intelligence Committee on Russian interference in the presidential election of 2016. The revelations from Robert Mueller’s indictments since then have provided so much clarity on how Russia interfered in our democracy — yet Americans seem more confused about the question of possible collusion with Russia. That is, in a way, by design — Russia’s design. Its infiltration and influence on America is difficult to understand, even with vastly more detail about Russia’s influence efforts. A lot of the focus on the Mueller investigation has fallen on Donald Trump: Did he obstruct the investigation? Was he a “Manchurian Candidate” or just a Russian ally, by ideology or business interests? In my view, as a former F.B.I. special agent who has watched the Kremlin’s infiltration of America since 2014, the answer may be neither. A standard Russian approach would have been to influence Mr. Trump through surrogates like Mr. Gates and Paul Manafort rather than through direct command through an individual — in this case, the candidate and then president. Russian intelligence develops options and pathways over many years; as objectives arise — like the election of Mr. Trump — they focus and engage all available touch points. The revelation last week about Mr. Gates’s connection is another piece of evidence to support that view. Russia’s efforts to influence, known by the Kremlin moniker Active Measures, did not seek a single pathway into the Trump team. Instead, they targeted a wide spectrum of influential Americans to subtly nudge their preferred policy into the mainstream and sideline foreign opponents. Russian intelligence services establish campaign objectives and compromise foreign targets through espionage, but their principal focus is to recruit agents of influence. Typically, the Kremlin deploys layers of surrogates and proxies offering business inducements, information or threatened reprisals that can individually be explained away by coincidence while masking the strings and guiding hands of the Kremlin’s puppet masters and their objectives. When called upon by the Kremlin, oligarchs, contractors, criminals and spies (current or former) all provide levers for advancing President Vladimir Putin’s assault on democracies. In Trump and his campaign, Mr. Putin spotted a golden opportunity — an easily ingratiated celebrity motivated by fame and fortune, a foreign policy novice surrounded by unscreened opportunists open to manipulation and unaware of Russia’s long run game of subversion. Mr. Putin has succeeded where his Soviet forefathers failed by leveraging money and cyberspace to subtly infiltrate and influence Americans while maintaining plausible deniability of their efforts. And the Kremlin’s ground game “cut outs” — intermediaries who facilitate communication between agents — conducted a more complex game. Each Mueller indictment and investigative lead illuminates more Kremlin influence avenues into President Trump’s inner circle. Mr. Van Der Zwaan, whose father-in-law is the Russian oligarch German Khan, lied to investigators about his conversations with Mr. Gates, the Trump deputy campaign manager, and a Person A, whom the F.B.I. assessed as a Russian intelligence agent and many believe to be Konstantin Kilimnik, an associate of both Mr. Gates and Mr. Manafort, a Trump campaign manager. Evidence of Russia’s intent to interfere in the election is overwhelming, and documentation of Trump campaign members’ collusion not only exists but is growing. The special counsel’s investigation into collusion ultimately comes down to two questions. First, did President Trump or any member of his campaign willingly coordinate their actions with Russia? And did President Trump or any member of his campaign knowingly coordinate their action with Russia? Trump campaign members certainly colluded with Russian influence efforts, some willingly, some possibly knowingly. The president denies the Kremlin’s hand, either still unaware or in denial of being manipulated by Mr. Putin’s minions. For Mr. Putin, it’s likely everything he hoped for — America riddled with political infighting and mired in investigations, a weakened NATO alliance vulnerable to aggression and a United States president seeking his adoration, obstinate and ignorant of the great caper the Kremlin just orchestrated. The problem for the president is that ignorance is not immunity. The problem for America is that ignorance of Russian interference is vulnerability.",The New York Times
2018,"For Scott Pruitt, a Spotlight Shines on His Ethics, Not His E.P.A. Rollbacks","WASHINGTON — It should have been Scott Pruitt’s finest moment. Mr. Pruitt, the chief of the Environmental Protection Agency, has sought to make his name as the Trump administration’s most effective eraser of regulations on American industry. On Tuesday, he formally announced his most sweeping regulatory rollback to date: a plan to weaken President Barack Obama’s stringent rules on planet-warming tailpipe emissions. Mr. Pruitt’s proposal is designed to unravel a signature piece of Mr. Obama’s environmental legacy, hand a victory to the American automakers and please his boss, President Trump. But instead of basking in glory, Mr. Pruitt is caught up in a swirl of allegations of impropriety — most recently centered on the fact that last year he rented a room in Washington from the wife of a prominent lobbyist. Mr. Pruitt unveiled his rollback in a hastily announced presentation at E.P.A. headquarters after canceling a plan to speak at a suburban Virginia auto dealership, a more public setting that might have exposed him to questions about the lease arrangement, or about his first-class air travel at taxpayer expense over the past year, for which he has also faced criticism. Mr. Pruitt declined to field questions at the event. Late Monday, Mr. Trump phoned Mr. Pruitt to reassure him that his job was safe. “Keep your head up, keep fighting, we got your back,” Mr. Trump told Mr. Pruitt, according to an administration official. Then on Tuesday morning, John F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff, called Mr. Pruitt to reaffirm the president’s sentiment, the official said. Despite the president’s encouraging language in the call, the depth of Mr. Trump’s support can be difficult to gauge. He dislikes direct confrontation and has been known to pivot from chummy chatter with an associate, in private, to an abrupt firing. That was the case last week with David J. Shulkin, the secretary of veterans affairs, who was fired by Mr. Kelly just hours after having what Mr. Shulkin described as a low-key phone conversation with the president about the progress he was making at the department, during which Mr. Trump said nothing of his impending ouster. On Tuesday morning, Senate Democrats sent a letter to the E.P.A.’s inspector general asking him to open an investigation into Mr. Pruitt’s housing arrangements in 2017. Mr. Pruitt came under fire last week after reports about his rental last year of a Washington residence partly owned by the wife of a top energy lobbyist whose firm, according to disclosure forms, conducted business before the E.P.A. that same year. Under terms of the lease, he paid $50 a night to stay in a condominium in the pricey Capitol Hill neighborhood. An E.P.A. spokesman on Tuesday said the lease arrangement was consistent with federal ethics regulations. Mr. Pruitt earlier this year was reprimanded by the White House after documents emerged showing that he had spent more than $107,000 in public money on first-class air travel. A Republican member of Congress took the unusual step of calling for Mr. Pruitt’s removal on Tuesday. Representative Carlos Curbelo of Florida wrote on Twitter, “Major policy differences aside, @EPAScottPruitt’s corruption scandals are an embarrassment to the Administration, and his conduct is grossly disrespectful to American taxpayers. It’s time for him to resign or for @POTUS to dismiss him.” Mr. Curbelo is a co-chairman of the House Climate Solutions Caucus, a bipartisan group that has called for efforts to address global warming. Mr. Trump on Tuesday afternoon made a brief comment when asked about Mr. Pruitt in the Cabinet Room, after The Atlantic magazine reported that Mr. Pruitt gave raises to two aides even though the White House had declined to approve the raises. “I hope he’s going to be great,” Mr. Trump said of the E.P.A. administrator. The E.P.A. spokesman said that Mr. Pruitt had not been aware that the personnel actions had not been submitted to the Presidential Personnel Office and had directed them to be submitted for review. The spokesman, Jahan Wilcox, also said that the agency had “clear authority” to make staff appointments. Chris Christie, the former New Jersey governor who himself has come under fire for ethics issues, including his handling of a bridge lane-closing scandal, said on Sunday that Mr. Pruitt’s actions were likely to cost him his job. “The president’s been ill served by this,” Mr. Christie said on ABC’s “This Week.” When asked if Mr. Pruitt should resign, he replied, “I don’t know how you survive this one.” Mr. Trump has sought to build a legacy of rolling back regulations on American industry, and Mr. Pruitt has proved to be one of his most effective lieutenants. In his first year on the job, Mr. Pruitt initiated the rollbacks of more than two dozen major environmental rules. The proposed rollback on vehicle mileage and emissions standards that he announced Tuesday is arguably the largest of those. Last year, soon after Mr. Trump’s inauguration, the nation’s biggest automakers asked the president to loosen an Obama-era rule that would have forced automakers to build cars that achieve an average fuel economy of 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025, nearly doubling their mileage while also reducing a major source of greenhouse gas pollution. At Mr. Trump’s request, Mr. Pruitt declared the auto regulation too onerous on industry and filed a legal document to reconsider it with the expectation of filing a new, weaker rule later this year. Initially, Mr. Pruitt’s announcement was to take place Tuesday at a Chevrolet dealership in Chantilly, Va., owned by Geoffrey Pohanka, who has spoken out against climate science and against tougher automotive standards. But while Mr. Pohanka was eager to offer his dealership as a stage for the announcement, other Chevrolet dealers were uneasy about seeing the Chevy brand used as a backdrop to Mr. Pruitt’s announcement, according to two dealers who spoke on condition of anonymity, citing their relationship with the automaker. Late Monday, the dealership said the event had been canceled. Instead, the Tuesday morning event was held at the E.P.A. headquarters, attended by a handful of auto industry lobbyists. The E.P.A. invited only a small handful of reporters to attend. “This is another step in the president’s deregulatory agenda,” Mr. Pruitt said, standing next to a row of signs that said “jobs” and “certainty.” “We are going to make sure that consumers across this country are not put in a position where they’re having to buy more expensive cars, cars that don’t really truly want to be purchased.” Afterward, when asked about the ethics questions facing his tenure, Mr. Pruitt turned and left the room, flanked by members of his security detail. Some Republicans believe the E.P.A. chief’s efforts to roll back regulations will keep him in Mr. Trump’s good graces. “So far, his reforms are estimated to save taxpayers over $1 billion in deregulatory savings,” Senator James M. Inhofe, Mr. Pruitt’s fellow Oklahoma Republican, a senior member of the Senate environment committee and a longtime supporter of Mr. Pruitt’s, wrote in a statement. “He’s been an effective member of the president’s team and I look forward to continuing to work with him to restore the E.P.A. to its proper size and scope,” Mr. Inhofe wrote. Conservative supporters said they believed it would take more than the apartment and travel scrutiny to bring down Mr. Pruitt. Myron Ebell, who led the Trump administration’s E.P.A. transition team, said he thought that as long as Mr. Pruitt pursued Mr. Trump’s agenda his job would be safe. Mr. Trump is “giving us a number of surprises, and one surprise could be that he stands by Pruitt,” Mr. Ebell said.

2018,"For Second Time in a Week, Trump Weighs In on World Cup Bidding","For the second time in a week, President Trump on Monday urged other countries to support the North American bid to host the 2026 World Cup and again implied there might be consequences for those who did not. The comments, made during a news conference in the Rose Garden, raised new questions about whether Mr. Trump’s input constitutes political interference in the bidding process, which could jeopardize the joint bid by the United States, Mexico and Canada. In remarks about international trade while meeting with the Nigerian president, Muhammadu Buhari, at the White House, Mr. Trump said, “I hope, all African countries and countries throughout the world, that we also will be supporting you and that they will likewise support us in our bid along with Canada and Mexico for the 2026 World Cup.” He added: “We will be watching very closely, and any help that they could give us in that bid, we would appreciate.” Last Thursday, Mr. Trump praised the bid on Twitter, adding remarks that some observers construed as a veiled threat: “The U.S. has put together a STRONG bid w/ Canada and Mexico for the 2026 World Cup. It would be a shame if countries that we always support were to lobby against the U.S. bid. Why should we be supporting these countries when they don’t support us (including at the United Nations)?” FIFA, global soccer’s governing body, declined to comment on the Twitter post. A FIFA spokesman, however, did point to its pre-existing rules of conduct, which warn governments of bidding nations not to participate in activities that “may adversely affect the integrity of the bidding process and create an undue influence on the bidding process.” The host of the 2026 World Cup will be named June 13, a day before the opening match of the 2018 World Cup in Russia. Even before Mr. Trump’s remarks, the North American bid was not considered a lock against its only rival, the North African nation of Morocco, even though the United States has an abundance of large stadiums and, in 1994, sold more tickets than any World Cup before or since. Geopolitics always come into play when selecting hosts for the largest international sporting events, the World Cup and the Olympics. And Mr. Trump is unpopular internationally, in part because of his travel ban on residents from several predominantly Muslim nations and because of his reported vulgar remarks about accepting immigrants from developing countries, including those in Africa. From his remarks about the World Cup, it is not clear that Mr. Trump understands the process of how a host country is chosen. Governments don’t vote, but rather top officials in the world’s 207 national soccer federations. FIFA explicitly warns governments not to interfere in soccer-related matters, and it has suspended countries from international soccer for violations of those rules. Morocco has the public support of the Confederation of African Football, which includes 50-plus national federations, and backing from European federations like France, Russia and Belgium. A corruption scandal related to the awarding in the 2018 and 2022 World Cups led to changes in how World Cup hosts are chosen. Instead of a small committee making the decision, each of FIFA’s member federations will vote — with its choice made public — at the meeting in Moscow in June.",The New York Times
2018,"For Survivors of Aleppo Siege, the News From Syria Is Especially Painful","GAZIANTEP, Turkey — As the government siege of a rebel-held Syrian suburb has unfolded, one group of Syrian exiles has felt especially tormented. They are opposition leaders and activists from Aleppo who survived the devastating government chokehold of their own city. Fourteen months after they were forced to evacuate the last neighborhoods of Aleppo, they are reliving their trauma from southern Turkey, where they have been spending hours online encouraging activists and rebels in the Eastern Ghouta region outside Damascus, the Syrian capital, and helping to disseminate videos and news from the latest siege. “The period that we witnessed and lived in Aleppo was a real hell,” said Hisham al-Skeif, one of the civilian leaders of the Aleppo protests now living in the southeastern Turkish city of Gaziantep. “Now what is happening in Eastern Ghouta is bringing it all back. “The hardest thing is to see despair in people’s faces,” he added, clenching his fists and screwing up his face at the memories and at one point breaking into tears. “They think they are going to die and no one cares.” A writer and Arabic teacher from an old Aleppo trading family, Mr. Skeif became one of the most outspoken civilian leaders opposed to President Bashar al-Assad and his father, Hafez al-Assad, who was president before him. Mr. Skeif’s baby son was asphyxiated by the dust of a bombardment. The father made a last, ferocious denunciation of the Syrian government on video just before the evacuation of Aleppo in December 2016. That placed him on top of the government’s wanted list. “This regime does not fear weapons. It fears words,” he said. “We had to keep going in our revolution because if we went back, our children would have to live under a third generation of Assads.” In exile, many of the Aleppo protesters have dispersed or taken a break, exhausted and depressed at the defeat of their dream of freedom from dictatorship. Yet they feel compelled to share their experience, even if they think the outside world only tunes in after the ghastliest horrors, like the April 7 attack that witnesses and medical workers say used chemical weapons to kill scores of Syrians in Douma, a town in Eastern Ghouta. The United States, Britain and France joined in airstrikes last Saturday to punish the Assad government for the attack; Syria, and its backers Russia and Iran, has denied being behind the attack. Monther Etaki, a former design student who was one of the last media activists to document the Aleppo siege to the end, said of the act of bearing witness: “It’s worthless, but it’s a duty to do it.” A former fine arts student, Mr. Etaki, 28, struggles to support his extended family with freelance media and design work. “I lost my job,” he joked, referring to his activism in Aleppo. “For people who were relying on me for information, I am no longer useful.” But he continues to blog and post on social media about the war in Syria and to help those still resisting inside. “I am just talking to friends in Ghouta and giving advice how to survive because I have some experience,” he said. “I am telling them to save their equipment and not be worried, be calm, that everything will be solved in the end.” Fearful for his family — his son was born on July 10, 2016, just before the siege of Aleppo began — he said he lost control at times toward the end. “Once I cried,” he recalled. “Once I burned my car. I forgot to take my things.” Many of the opposition members set fire to their cars and belongings to prevent them falling into the hands of the pro-government militias that were encroaching into the rebel neighborhoods. In the end, the last to leave were allowed to drive their cars out since there was a lack of buses and in the snow and freezing night, the soldiers stopped checking all those evacuating. Mr. Etaki even left the gas on in his home, hoping to destroy it so the pro-government militias could not use it. “I was thinking it would burn, but then we did not evacuate that day and I had to go back,” he laughed. There was still just enough gas in the bottle to keep warm that night, he said. When he did leave, he said Russian soldiers stole his computers, and his cameras and other equipment were taken as well. Dr. Hamza al-Khatib, who became known for his work running the last functioning medical center in Aleppo, Al Quds hospital, warned a friend in Ghouta how the siege would play out. “The beginning was a complete besiegement, not allowing anything in or out,” he said. “Then there were a lot of rumors, people coming who wanted to negotiate. That takes about three months. Then heavy shelling, barrel bombs and gas attacks.” Dr. Khatib urged his colleague to stay safe somewhere and wait for the organized evacuation. “I am telling him just not to lose faith in life,” he said. “You and your wife will live and don’t listen to the rumors. We heard that a lot in Aleppo, that everyone is a traitor.” Many who went over to the government side were arrested, and others who chose to stay in their homes were killed by the pro-government militias who took control after the evacuation, Mr. Skeif said. For those who did evacuate, the transition to a normal life has been hard in a different way. Molham Ekaidi, 29, an architecture student who became a rebel commander, spent the first four months in Turkey sitting inside his parents’ home, staring at the walls. “For years, you only live for the moment. You do not think of the future and you do not think about the previous days,” he said, describing his years as a fighter. “I had to think how to make my living, how to raise my children. It was very hard to start thinking. It took four months before I spoke about architecture.” When Turkey opened its universities to Syrian undergraduates to complete their degrees, he joined the final year in the architecture degree course. “I didn’t remember anything,” he said. His fellow students are 10 years younger than he is, and, he said, they know little about the Syrian revolution. “It is hard to connect with them,” he went on. “They don’t know anything of my life.” He avoids watching video footage from Syria, but has not ruled out returning to fight if circumstances were to change. Like other survivors, he describes restarting with smaller dreams. “I do not have the big dream to have a free country,” he said, “just an aim to make a better life.” Mr. Skeif said he was lost. “There is no plan for my life,” he said. But then he rallies and talks of a new political project for Syrian youth. “I have a dream for girls like my daughters to have political awareness,” he said, “so they never have an Assad in the future.” Dr. Khatib, 31, seems the most positive and confident of the survivors. He works for a relief organization, supplying medical relief to hospitals inside Syria and is planning with his wife to further his education. “Now we think is a dead time,” he said. “So we thought we can use this time.” But he is also devastatingly realistic about returning to Syria. “Maybe my daughter will grow up and by the age of 20 will never have been to her country,” he said.

2018,"For Tesla, ‘Production Hell’ Looks Like the Reality of the Car Business","Tesla began producing electric cars at its plant in Fremont, Calif., six years ago, starting with small quantities and ramping up to about 100,000 vehicles last year. Now, as it tries to double or triple that number, the company and its chief executive, Elon Musk, are getting a lesson in how hard it is to mass-produce automobiles. On Tuesday, Tesla reported that it had managed to increase production of a crucial new model in the first quarter of 2018, although it remained well short of the company’s already lowered target. At the same time, it encountered a new hitch — a drop in sales of its two established products, the Model S sedan and Model X sport-utility vehicle. The company is counting on the success of the new offering, the Model 3, to increase revenue and help pare its losses as Tesla invests heavily in the vehicles it hopes to offer in the future. But a series of setbacks have left Tesla far behind schedule in turning out the Model 3 — for which nearly 400,000 prospective buyers have already put down $1,000 deposits — and it is taking some extraordinary measures to turn things around. Mr. Musk said on Twitter this week that he had been sleeping at the plant, and the company said some workers who normally assemble the Model S and Model X were shifted to Model 3 production. The troubles reflect a reality overlooked by many people outside the auto industry: Producing a quarter of a million cars a year in one plant is a daunting task. “You have to have a finished car rolling off the line every couple of minutes,” said Mark Wakefield, global co-head of automotive and industrial at AlixPartners, a consulting firm. “And each one has maybe 5,000 parts that come from different suppliers and have to arrive just in time, and each car is available in a couple of thousand build combinations with different colors and features. And all this has to happen at a competitive cost. There’s a lot that can trip you up.” Even as he introduced the Model 3 at an event last summer, Mr. Musk warned that the company would find itself in “production hell” — and as those words proved prescient, he has had to repeatedly dial back his forecasts for how many Tesla could churn out. Mr. Musk once envisioned producing as many as 500,000 cars this year, and last summer he was hoping to be able to make 20,000 Model 3s a month by December. More recently, Tesla had aimed to produce at least 2,500 Model 3s per week by the end of the first quarter. But that is more than it managed in the entire fourth quarter, and it has produced fewer than 10,000 in the first quarter, the company said Tuesday. There have been signs of momentum, however. In the past seven days, Tesla said, it had produced 2,020 Model 3s, a rate it said it expected to sustain in the coming week. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Tesla said it expected its output to “climb rapidly” through the second quarter and reach 5,000 per week in about three months. It added that it was “rapidly addressing production and supply-chain bottlenecks, including several short factory shutdowns to upgrade equipment.” Tesla has closely guarded the details of its manufacturing system, but Mr. Musk has described it as highly automated. Ron Harbour, a partner and auto-manufacturing specialist at Oliver Wyman, a consulting firm, said that adding more automated equipment tends to create a more complex production environment. “You have more new equipment to launch, there’s more programming, more maintenance,” he said. “More automation doesn’t necessarily make it more efficient.” The highest-volume plants he’s seen, Mr. Harbour added, often have more assembly workers and fewer robots. “It’s a little counterintuitive, but that’s how it is,” he said. With a starting price of $35,000, the Model 3 is more affordable than Tesla’s other models and a crucial part of its ambitions to become a mass-market automaker — as well as to stabilize its finances and turn a profit. But Mr. Wakefield noted that working out bottlenecks and hitches in auto production often isn’t as straightforward as it could appear. For example, modifying one part to make it fit better or stronger can require other parts to be modified, or can alter the car’s driving characteristics. “If you make a change to solve one problem, you can create five other problems,” he said. “People think you just find a problem and solve it, but it’s not like that. There are literally millions of problems that come up and require thousands of engineers, working in teams, either at the car company or the suppliers, to deal with.” While Tesla scrambled to work out the kinks in making the Model 3 in the first quarter, deliveries of the Model S and Model X declined by 23 percent from the previous quarter — to 21,800 — even as the company reported “the most productive quarter in Tesla history.” Tesla said it had been hurt by a shortage of battery packs for its cars, made at the plant it calls the Gigafactory, near Reno, Nev. Michelle Krebs, a senior analyst at Autotrader.com, said the decline in deliveries of the Model S and Model X might suggest that the allure of Tesla vehicles has somewhat faded. Electric cars make up fewer than 1 percent of all vehicles sold in the United States. “You just wonder if there’s enough growth in electric vehicles,” she said. “At first everybody who wanted a Tesla and could afford a Tesla hopped on. But it’s not the newest thing anymore.” In its statement on Tuesday, the company said that “demand remains strong” for the Model S and Model X. But a sustained slump in sales of those vehicles could complicate Tesla’s efforts to trim the losses it has been reporting every three months — including a net loss of $771 million in the fourth quarter. Even aside from its production struggles with the Model 3, the company has been hit by a barrage of negative news in recent weeks. Concern has grown over the safety of Autopilot, its driver-assistance system, after a fatal crash on March 23 that occurred while the system was engaged. It was at least the third fatal crash that has taken place while a driver was using Autopilot. On Friday, Tesla said the driver had not heeded several visual and audible warnings to put his hands on the steering wheel before his Model X hit a concrete barrier. Neither the driver nor the car appeared to activate the brakes before impact. Also last week, Moody’s Investors Service downgraded Tesla’s credit rating and said the company risked running short of cash by the end of the year. The company said Tuesday that it saw no need to take special measures this year to raise cash. Its shares closed up 6 percent on Tuesday after the regulatory filing, but they have still shed 23 percent of their value in barely three weeks.",The New York Times

THE LIFE TO COME By Michelle de Kretser 344 pp. Catapult. $26. The Australian novelist Michelle de Kretser has made a habit of disputing the notion that travel necessarily broadens the mind. Her fourth novel, “Questions of Travel,” which won Australia’s most prestigious literary award, the Miles Franklin, contrasted the journeys of an asylum-seeker from the subcontinent with those of a backpacking travel-guide writer from Sydney. The characters in “The Life to Come,” de Kretser’s fifth novel, are similarly peripatetic. While they all eventually enjoy a comfortable life in suburban Sydney, some are dogged by memories of past lives in violent places. The memory of a stretch of wall split by the sun transports an elderly woman back to her childhood in Sri Lanka: “Pictures like that were always there, running invisibly under her Australian life, appearing now and again like snatches of an old videotape that a later recording has overlaid without entirely erasing.” The émigré is one kind of traveler, portrayed here with sympathy and lyricism. But de Kretser, who was born in Sri Lanka and came to Australia at 14, saves her startling satirical firepower for another — the expats of the global West, or those who can travel on a whim. In a novel that restlessly spans decades and continents, a woman named Pippa is as close as de Kretser gets to a protagonist. It is Pippa’s friends, colleagues and acquaintances whose stories we learn via impressionistic flashbacks. In the late 1990s, when we meet her, she is an idealistic undergraduate in Sydney who announces “I love India” after watching a documentary on TV. Over time, she becomes a more interesting character, a full-fledged writer who seeks experiences in the world with which to animate her fiction. Yet Pippa remains naïve. She preaches empathy for refugees on Facebook, but is careless of the inner lives of others. In 2010, Pippa goes to Paris on a writing fellowship. (The ensuing novel, “French Lessons,” is a flop.) Her approach to other cultures is uncomplicated. Europe, she thinks, is “momentous and world-historical”; Australia, “eventless.” Plus, there’s all that foreign food, which can be recreated at Instagram-worthy dinner parties back home. Many scenes revolve around Pippa in the kitchen, whipping up something ostentatiously multicultural: a lamb tagine with saffron, carrots and fennel for a sick neighbor; a salad of pork and ginger during a Thai phase; local prawns for her literary agent served with lemon juice, brown bread and butter. Meals like these are as familiar in Brooklyn or Portland as they are in inner-city Sydney. Call it the cult of Ottolenghi — that trendy Israeli-British chef is name-checked on more than one occasion. In one scene, the function of food as a status symbol for globe-trotting cosmopolites becomes clear. During her time in Paris, Pippa befriends Céleste, an older woman who lives alone. Céleste’s father died in the aftermath of the massacre of Algerians in the French capital in 1961; her mother remarried an Australian man she met on the Métro. The family emigrated to Western Australia, but in adulthood Céleste found her way back to Paris as a translator. (This is the kind of fractured life, filled with loss and hard-won visa stamps, that de Kretser protects from ridicule.) Relatives visiting from Perth come over to Céleste’s small apartment for lunch, and she prepares gratin dauphinois, chicken in a wine sauce and asparagus from the market. The Australians, flush with money from the mining boom of the new millennium, push the meal around on their plates and talk of how they eat at home: quinoa and broad bean salad, barley with pomegranate seeds. “Why do Australians go on so much about food?” Céleste asks her mother afterward on Skype. Her mother’s reply is brutal. “Because they live in a country of no importance.” For a novel concerned with dislocation, there’s a lot of grounding humor in “The Life to Come.” Most of it comes at the expense of Pippa and her ilk, but de Kretser’s observations are so spot on, you’ll forgive her even as you cringe. An earlier version of this review referred incorrectly to Michelle de Kretser’s novel “Questions of Travel.” It was her fourth novel, not her third.",The New York Times
2018,"For Thousands of ‘Dreamers,’ It Has Been a Wild Ride. And It’s Not Over Yet.","The young undocumented immigrants have seen their hopes alternately elevated and dashed, sometimes in a single week. Listening to lawmakers speak in support of a DACA solution outside the United States Capitol in January.CreditCreditErin Schaff for The New York Times For many of the young undocumented immigrants whose futures have seemed to be hitched to a roller-coaster in recent months, Wednesday was a day of unusual hopefulness: The night before, a federal judge had signaled his readiness to open applications once again for a program that protects some young undocumented immigrants, known as Dreamers, from deportation and allows them to work. “First thing this morning, I opened up my email to find inquiries from potential applicants. We’re telling them to get all their paperwork together, let’s get ready,” said Fernanda Durand, communications manager at Casa, an immigrant advocacy organization. “This is the first ray of hope that these Dreamers have had in a very long time.” Not so fast, she had to tell her clients. Judge John D. Bates of the Federal District Court in Washington wasn’t going to make his order effective for 90 days. Much could change in the meantime. It might not happen at all. Since the early days of the 2016 presidential campaign, young people who benefited from the Obama-era program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, have seen their hopes alternately elevated and dashed, sometimes in the space of a single week. President Trump canceled the program, some judges revived it, politicians negotiated deals to save it — but none of them closed. How nerve-racking has it been? Just ask Arlette Morales of York, Pa. “I turned 15 in September, right at the time the program started to shut down,” she said. “When I heard that news, I teared up and didn’t want to believe it. I lost hope.” That all changed on Wednesday after she heard the news about the judge’s latest decision. “I feel empowered. I am motivated again. I have to continue thinking positive,” she said. For now. What has this crazy ride been like for the 700,000 undocumented immigrants, brought to the United States as children, whose fate depends on DACA? Here’s a glimpse. 2010: Much of DACA had its seeds in a piece of legislation known as the Dream Act that would have given a path to citizenship to more than one million young immigrants brought illegally into the country as children. More than 100 of them packed the Senate gallery. They held hands as the vote was taken, many of them praying. In the end, the bill passed the House but fell an excruciating five votes short in the Senate. The Dreamers were ushered out into the Capitol hallway, hugging and weeping. They began to defiantly chant: “What do we want? The Dream Act! When do we want it? Now!” Something had changed. Until now, undocumented immigrants had stayed out of the spotlight, leaving others to speak on their behalf to avoid exposing their illegal status. No more. “We were thinking no matter what, this vote doesn’t define us,” said Lorella Praeli, director of immigration policy and campaigns at the ACLU, who was then a Dreamer in Connecticut. Our lives will never be the same, because we’ve come out of the shadows.” Ms. Praeli, then 23, and several other Dreamer leaders would play an instrumental role in persuading President Obama that young undocumented immigrants could be shielded from deportation even without congressional action. “We wanted to be everyday Americans,” recalled Gaby Pacheco, then 27, a leader of a fast-growing group of young immigrants called United We Dream. She arrived in the United States from Ecuador when she was 8 years old. Ms. Pacheco, Ms. Praeli and their fellow activists campaigned for more than two years with marches and sit-ins, arguing that they were Americans in every sense but their birthplace. June 2012: Under pressure from the young immigrants and their allies, President Obama took executive action to create DACA, providing the young people with protection from deportation and work permits renewable every two years. When Mr. Obama made the announcement in the Rose Garden, Dreamers around the country — many who had been glued to their televisions — were elated. They embraced and cried, this time in celebration. “I received a call from a White House official telling me that I should turn on the TV,” recalled Juan Escalante, an activist who was working at his computer in Tallahassee, Fla. “When the president was speaking, my jaw dropped to the floor. I ran out of the office to call my mother crying, because I knew it was going to help me, my brothers and thousands of other Dreamers.” Mr. Escalante and two younger brothers signed up for the program as soon as they could. “Our applications were among the first, I am sure,” Mr. Escalante said. Thanks to DACA, his brother, Daniel, was able to work legally for the first time, pay for more college classes and afford a car. Mr. Escalante, 26, expects to graduate on April 30 from Florida International University and plans to become a high school teacher. The same year DACA went into effect, attempts to end the program began to surface. They went nowhere. Aug. 20, 2016: It was election season, and on the campaign trail, President Trump in Phoenix struck a hard line on immigration and reaffirmed his commitment to terminate the DACA program. There would be “no amnesty,” Trump declared. “For those here illegally today who are seeking legal status, they will have one route and one route only. To return home and apply for re-entry like everybody else.” DACA participants were heartsick, but consoled each other: Trump would never be elected, they said. Jan. 20, 2017: Mr. Trump took office. “Everyone was like, is he actually going to do it? We were biting our nails and worried he would end DACA in the first few days,” said Frank Sharry, executive director of America’s Voice, an immigrant advocacy group. But then Trump did an about-face. At a White House news conference on Feb. 26, 2017, President Trump said, “We’re going to deal with DACA with heart.” Dealing with the issue, he said, was “a very difficult thing for me. I love these kids. I love kids.” June 29, 2017: The attorney general of Texas, Ken Paxton, wrote a letter threatening to sue the federal government over DACA unless the administration phased it out. The notice was signed by nine of his counterparts in other states. Trump’s attorney general, Jeff Sessions, and his chief of staff, John F. Kelly, met with the president and warned him that the DACA program was unconstitutional. You had better take action to end it, they advised him, according to administration staff members. Sept. 5, 2017: Sessions announced the administration’s decision to end DACA. Later that evening, Trump called on Congress to pass a replacement. [Read our story about Trump calling on Congress to act.] For participants in the program, the abrupt decision was stunning. DACA had enabled them to get jobs, attend college, obtain driver’s licenses and even get 401(k)s. Everything was at risk. Heyra Avila, 22, who arrived in the United States from Mexico at the age of 4, donned a T-shirt emblazoned with “Here to Stay” and joined a DACA rally in Cincinnati outside the office of Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio. She was feeling defiant. “No matter what the administration says and does, I am going to keep fighting for justice for thousands of immigrants here in the United States,” said Ms. Avila, who is a paralegal in Florence, Ky. “We’re not going anywhere.” Sept. 13, 2017: About a week after the announcement, Trump hosted a working dinner with top Democrats — the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, and the House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi of California — to discuss immigration. Mr. Schumer and Ms. Pelosi declared that they had a deal with President Trump to quickly extend protections for Dreamers, an announcement that led to widespread elation in the Dreamer community. But then the president contradicted those statements. In Congress, a number of bipartisan proposals that would protect Dreamers were either rejected by the White House or failed to gain enough support among lawmakers. But the big action has been in the courts. Jan. 9, 2018: A federal judge in San Francisco ruled that the Trump administration had ended the DACA program improperly and ordered the government not only to keep it in place, but to allow DACA participants to apply for renewals. On the first day, legal-aid organizations were deluged. In Los Angeles, people started lining up at 2:30 in the morning at the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles. “I wanted to take this opportunity while the window lasts,” said Mario Hernandez, 29, who was whisked across the Mexico-United States border when he was a 1-year-old, and then raised in Los Angeles. Hours later, his sense of urgency seemed prescient. The Department of Justice filed a notice of appeal. April 24, 2018: This week, in the biggest blow yet to the Trump administration’s move to kill the DACA program, Judge Bates in Washington found that the decision was “virtually unexplained.” He gave the government 90 days to come up with sufficient legal justification, or be forced to begin accepting new DACA applications. Yehimi Cambron, an art teacher in Atlanta and a DACA recipient, spread news of the latest court decision among students at her school, many of whom she believes are undocumented. Some of them were celebrating; others were skeptical. All of them were exhausted by the breathtaking twists and turns of the past year or so. “Any time there is one of these decisions, there’s a feeling of hope,” said Ms. Cambron, 25. But maybe, she knows by now, not for long. “Even if there are small victories,” she said, “people are now in survival mode.” She added: “We can’t continue living this way.”",The New York Times
2018,"For Workers Without Retirement Savings, State-Run I.R.A.s Can Pay Off","Your Money Adviser A new breed of state-based savings accounts can help workers prepare for retirement, in part by allowing them to push back the time when they file for Social Security payments, a new analysis suggests. Half of all states have considered plans to offer automatic individual retirement accounts, and at least five (California, Connecticut, Illinois, Maryland and Oregon) have begun offering them or have taken steps toward doing so. The plans vary in their details but, in general, are for workers at private-sector employers that don’t offer retirement plans. Those workers are automatically enrolled in the state I.R.A. program and have contributions withdrawn from their paychecks, although they can choose to opt out or change their contribution. Many people think they must start receiving Social Security as soon as they retire, but the two steps don’t have to be done simultaneously. People can start claiming their federal benefits at age 62, but waiting at least a year or two to collect means their monthly payments will be larger because of the way the federal program is structured. Those enrolled in the new state-sponsored accounts could, instead, use that money to temporarily cover their expenses after they retire, allowing them to delay claiming their Social Security benefits for a year or more, the report from the Pew Charitable Trusts said. Since many people lack adequate retirement savings or traditional fixed pensions, the idea of delaying Social Security payments to receive bigger checks is “getting traction,” said Alison Shelton, senior research officer in Pew’s retirement project. Some workers may be unable to delay claiming benefits past age 62, if they are in poor health or unemployed. But others simply may be reluctant to postpone the benefits because they lack savings. State-based individual retirement accounts that automatically enroll workers who don’t have retirement benefits through their employers can help meet that need, Pew’s report said. Workers can delay claiming their federal benefits, and instead withdraw an amount equal to what their monthly benefit would be from their so-called auto-I.R.A. For example, if a worker retiring at 62 would get $700 a month in benefits, but had $8,400 in a state-based auto-I.R.A., the worker could wait a year to claim the benefit and instead withdraw $700 a month from the retirement account. The monthly benefit a year later, when the worker was 63, would climb to about $750. The approach can especially benefit younger, minority and lower-income workers, who are less likely to have job-based retirement plans, Pew said. Under a simulation run by the Social Security Administration at Pew’s request, Pew found that if workers contributed 3 percent of their income to a state-run auto-I.R.A. for 31 years, starting in 2019, nearly 40 percent of them could delay Social Security by a year or more. (The model accounted for workers entering and leaving the program, and for older workers who would contribute for fewer years.) States have been pursuing the plans even though Congress has scaled back rules meant to encourage their creation. Oregon, for instance, completed a test of its OregonSaves program last year, and began expanding it statewide in January. As of mid-April, more than 600 employers had registered for the program, and more than 31,000 employees — more than three-quarters of those eligible — were enrolled, with about 10,000 making contributions, Oregon officials said. New York recently said it was considering an auto-I.R.A. program, with plans to offer it in two years. Here are some questions and answers about state-based auto-I.R.A.s and Social Security: If I am automatically enrolled in a state-based I.R.A., can I drop out if I choose? Yes. In general, the plans automatically enroll eligible employees and set payroll contributions at a fixed percentage — say, 5 percent. But workers can opt out of the programs or reduce the amount withdrawn from their paychecks, at any time. How do I determine my “normal” retirement age for Social Security benefits? Your normal retirement age — the age at which you receive full federal benefits — depends on the year in which you were born. If you were born in 1960 or later, your full retirement age is 67. How early can I claim Social Security retirement benefits? The earliest age to claim retirement benefits under Social Security is 62, but you generally will receive a significantly reduced monthly payment. Someone who would receive $1,000 a month at a normal retirement age of 67, for instance, would receive $700 at age 62 — a reduction of 30 percent, according to Pew’s report.",The New York Times
2018,"For a Doubles Champion, the Title That Counts Is Dad","KEY BISCAYNE, Fla. — Max Mirnyi, one of the top doubles players in tennis, encountered a scheduling crisis during a recent tournament in Long Island. He had to practice for a match, but he also had promised to accompany his 13-year-old daughter, Melanie, on an excursion that would require time and planning. Mixing competition and parenting can be a complicated enterprise, especially in a sport like tennis that requires extensive international travel. Serena Williams, who now travels with her 7-month-old daughter, is learning this, just as players like Victoria Azarenka, Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic have done before her. But Mirnyi knows a trick or two. To resolve his recent predicament, Mirnyi entrusted Melanie with the job of organizing a trip into Manhattan to see “Anastasia,” the Broadway musical. “She said, ‘Dad, don’t worry about me,’” Mirnyi said. “‘You go practice. I have schoolwork. I am going to read through the play we are going to see, and I’m going to tell you how we will get there.’ And she did.” It helps that Melanie Mirnyi is a teenager, only a few years younger than some players competing on tour. She is, by her own observations at tournaments, the oldest child of any player currently on tour. That makes her father, 40, a foremost expert on combining parenting and tennis. For 13 years and 4 months, Mirnyi, a father of four, has carefully negotiated this balance of career and family. At first, when Melanie was a toddler, she and Mirnyi’s wife, Ksenia, traveled the globe to watch Mirnyi play. But once Melanie entered school, the Mirnyi children mostly remained at home, either in Florida or in his native Belarus. “Halloween,” Mirnyi said with a sigh. “I always miss Halloween. It seems like such an exciting holiday for the kids, and they prepare for weeks in advance. But I’m always in Paris at that time of year. Sometimes I feel guilty, and it’s the toughest thing.” Many athletes are not fortunate enough to play long enough for their children to fully understand their jobs. That kind of longevity, until recently, has been unusual in tennis. But Mirnyi has extended his career by excelling at doubles; he has won six Grand Slam men’s doubles titles, and is currently No. 37 in the ATP doubles rankings. Mirnyi and his wife have two girls, Melanie and 11-year-old Petra, and two boys, Demid, 8, and Trophym, 3. All four typically spend the school year in Sarasota, Fla., and the summer in Belarus, which is Mirnyi’s base for tournaments on the European circuit. But whenever the tour schedule allows, he tries to find ways to take the whole gang to work. Planning the family’s travel is a job in itself. When the Mirnyis hit the road, they need to find airline seats for six, a rental van and hotel managers who will do their best to arrange a series of adjoining rooms. Years ago, it was incumbent on Ksenia to look after the kids on the tournament grounds, though Nikolai Mirnyi, Max’s father and coach, helped out. Now the three older children are mature enough to look after themselves. At the Miami Open last month, Melanie and Demid roamed the player lounge while their father received treatment after a match. Demid sought out Federer, Mirnyi’s former doubles partner, because he likes to snap a photograph with Federer after each of his Grand Slam titles. “Now he has 20,” Demid said, referring to Federer’s Australian Open victory in January, “so I have to get another photo.” For other players, family life and tennis do not always jibe so smoothly. Azarenka has been involved in a custody dispute over her 1-year-old son, Leo, and when she and the boy’s father were temporarily barred from leaving California with the child, Azarenka declined to travel to several tournaments. Yet even in cases without conflict, Mirnyi said, “it’s tougher for the mothers.” “It’s important to have a good support team with you,” he added. “We know that there are some difficulties with men and women and husbands and wives getting in the situation that Vika is in right now. But if you can have a big part of the family along, with mothers, brothers, sisters and grandparents, it can make it so much easier.” When one of your children is a savvy 13-year-old, it is easier still. For the New York Open, it was Melanie’s idea to go on the special father-daughter trip because she was so eager to see “Anastasia.” She made plans a year in advance, once she learned that the tournament would be moving to New York from its traditional home in Memphis, and that it fell during a school vacation. The visit became even more memorable when Mirnyi reached his 100th tour final, and won, with Melanie in the stands. During the post-match trophy ceremony, Mirnyi’s partner, Philipp Oswald, thanked the fans, the tournament organizers and the pair’s coach: Melanie. “That was just an extra wave of boom,” she said. Mirnyi and Oswald won again this month, at the United States Men’s Clay Court Championships in Houston. This time Petra made the trip, and served as honorary coach. Mirnyi thanked her on court, too. But as much as he cherishes those moments, Mirnyi said his favorite time was his brief off-season in November and December. “For a month and a half, I am the happiest father alive,” he said. “When they want to play ball I play ball. When they want to play dolls, I play dolls. And I do that with a smile on my face, because I know there are millions of fathers around the world that have to wake up at 6 and go to work.” But then comes January, when Mirnyi trundles off to Australia, California and Europe. He will turn 41 in July, and he said at the Miami Open that he would play as long as he was performing well. The debate over retirement has percolated in his mind for years, long enough that Melanie can now weigh in as any reasonable adult might. “It will be kind of sad when he just stops,” she said. “But I don’t want him to hurt himself or get really tired. I’ll support whatever he decides.” For now, Mirnyi has decided to set an example as a hard-working parent facing obstacles, experiencing losses as well as wins and balancing a life that few athletes’ children are old enough to fully appreciate in real time. “No matter what they do in life, whether it is athletes, musicians or scientists, there are things to overcome,” he said. “Hopefully, they see me doing that every day. Even though I am still a tennis player, I am still a father.”",The New York Times
2018,"For a Mess Made by a Few, Many May Be Punished","Ask Real Estate Q: Some people in my co-op in Jackson Heights, Queens, leave a mess in the compactor room. The board imposed a $500 fine for anyone caught doing this, but without cameras, catching the culprits is nearly impossible. I received a notice that if the situation isn’t rectified, all the tenants on the floor will be fined $50 each. Can the board really fine an entire group because one person is a slob? What recourse do I have? A: When I was in fifth grade, my teacher used to take away recess from the entire class because one child habitually had a messy desk. The collective punishment certainly made everyone unhappy, but it did little to get the disorganized student’s papers in order. I’m not sure what your board expects to achieve with this strategy, other than enrage those who have done nothing wrong, and reduce the penalty for the few people who deserve discipline. Does your board even have the right to do such a thing? Probably not. Generally, a co-op board can impose only fines authorized by the proprietary lease, which governs the co-op. It is very unlikely that your lease authorizes a group fine, according to Peter R. Massa, a real estate lawyer and partner in the Manhattan law firm Gallet Dreyer & Berkey. Review the lease to confirm this. You could pay the fine and sue the co-op board in small claims court. Or you could not pay it, and if the co-op sues you for eviction for nonpayment of rent, you could argue your case in court, Mr. Massa said. But before you end up in court over $50, write a letter to the co-op board and the managing agent insisting that the building address this issue fairly and appropriately. Ask other disgruntled neighbors to sign the letter, too. Rather than fine innocent people, the managing agent should send a letter to shareholders reminding everyone of proper trash procedure, pointing out that leaving a mess in the compactor room is unsanitary and could attract vermin. The board should install cameras in the compactor room. The abandoned trash may hold clues, like discarded mail with a name on it. “Get the super a nice pair of gloves,” said Daniel J. Wollman, the chief executive of Gumley Haft, a property management company. “I know it’s a little disgusting, but if they want this to stop and they want to catch who’s doing it, someone’s got to sort through the trash.”",The New York Times

But during her 20s, often as not, she was out of town on tour or appearing in London’s West End in shows like “Hair” and the musical adaptation of the movie “Ghost.” She and Mr. Reiser, 37, a writer, composer and theater professor, married in 2011. Four years ago, the couple decided it was time to put down roots in New York City and buy an apartment. They scrutinized hundreds, frequently at Sunday open houses just before Ms. Levy had to shove off to perform in the “Les Miserables” matinee. She wanted to buy any and every place she saw. Her husband’s attitude could be summed up thus: Let it go. “If it was a hellhole or it was amazing, I’d say, ‘This is great. We can make this work. We can do this and this and this,’” Ms. Levy recalled. “I’ve always been a big interior design nerd, and I’d always be envisioning how we could move the walls.” And David would say, ‘This is the worst apartment I have ever seen.’” She continued: “I think I was just so eager to own a piece of New York City that I was willing to leap, which is my way. And he was like, ‘Let’s take a breath, and keep it steady here, and wait for our place.’ And, of course, he was right.” When they first saw it, “our place,” an estate sale, had but a single bedroom and bath. Subsequently, walls were relocated or eliminated to carve out a nursery, a second full bath and an office that doubles as guest quarters. Pocket doors were installed to create private nooks and to maximize floor space; the ceilings were raised three feet, and a long wall in the kitchen acquired a veneer of thin brick. (It fools everybody.) “We designed this apartment within an inch of its life,” Ms. Levy said. But really in the best possible way: It is well thought out without appearing studied or precious. And because Ms. Levy is a bit of a neat freak, there is a place for everything and everything in its place. The neutral-toned furniture — some new, some picked up at flea markets or found through a moms’ group on Facebook — is a pleasing backdrop for art and knickknacks like the vintage ice bucket and the brass urn that holds a plant. “It’s all about the mix,” Ms. Levy said. “If you have too many of any one thing it starts to feel either too dated or too modern and cold.” A fellow cast member in the London production of “Ghost,” Adebayo Bolaji, was also an artist, Ms. Levy learned. She and Mr. Reiser bought one of his paintings; it hangs on the wall outside their bedroom. “It’s the first adult piece of art we bought together,” she said. “As a child, I would go to galleries every weekend with my parents, who collected a lot of abstracts and a lot of sculptures. I had to sit quietly, and I wouldn’t be able to touch anything, and I hated it. And, of course, as I’ve grown up, art is the thing I love most.” As much as anything, the apartment is a celebration of family: the family Ms. Levy has created with Mr. Reiser and their young son, and her family in Canada. The master bedroom and master bath are illuminated by chandeliers that belonged to Ms. Levy’s maternal grandmother, Freda. It was Freda, too, who furnished the lamp on a side table in the living room. The mirror in the kitchen came Ms. Levy’s way courtesy of her paternal grandparents. The gallery wall in the living room displays the wood sign that hung outside her doctor father’s office for more than 40 years, as well as a plot plan of the street Ms. Levy grew up on, an artifact she found in her parents’ basement. But she has yet another legacy from the previous generation. “Besides being art collectors, my parents love interior design. And when I was little, most Sundays I would come downstairs and find them rearranging the furniture,” Ms. Levy said. “I fully inherited that hobby,” she added. “I’m sort of famous for moving massive pieces of furniture around the apartment by myself, much to David’s surprise and worry.”",The New York Times
2018,"For the ACT and the SAT, Pencils No Longer Required, but Sometimes Necessary","For the first time this Tuesday, the 70-member junior class of Chisholm High School in Enid, Okla., will sit for the SAT college entrance exam, but almost all the students will be clicking through Chromebooks instead of blackening bubbles with a No. 2 pencil. One hundred fifteen miles east of Enid, the Tulsa, Okla., schools were also invited this year to administer an online version of the SAT, the exam that Tulsa’s 1,700 juniors must take. The district chose paper and pencil. Like Chisholm, Tulsa already gives all its end-of-year tests online. But this is the first year that SAT scores must be reported to the state for Oklahoma’s school accountability report cards, and principals just did not want to risk an internet problem or power outage, explained Erin Lester, director of assessment. There are other challenges for this urban district, too, like how to give an online test to those likely to be in jail, juvenile detention or a mental health facility, a number that could range from dozens to more than 100 on testing day. “Some of the jails don’t even allow computers with internet accessibility,” Ms. Lester said. “We wanted to be equitable.” Long in the works, the digital transition by the two college testing companies is taking a few more cautious steps forward this year. But with 29 states, the District of Columbia and many of the largest cities giving the standardized exams to all juniors, the complexity of the task has never been greater. [READ MORE: Here’s What You Need to Know About Online Testing for the ACT and SAT] Out in front is ACT Inc., which began digital testing in 2015 and will move all its international testing online this fall — a year later than planned. ACT offers the digital option to all 16 states and 1,100 districts that contract with it, said Edward Colby, a spokesman. But just 8 percent of roughly one million school-day tests given last year were digital. “The challenges I often hear are about the entire state having enough laptops for every single junior and senior to take an assessment on the same day,” said Angie McAllister, ACT senior vice president for research. “ACT is responding to what our customers are asking us for, and today, they are still saying we want to do most of it on paper.” ACT’s archrival, the College Board, are offering digital versions of the school-day SAT in Oklahoma and Ohio this month. Altogether, about 100 schools will take either the SAT or Preliminary SAT exams online, said Zach Goldberg, a spokesman. But it, too, has had stumbles and resistance. “We will continue to work with educators to navigate the unique challenges of responsibly delivering digital assessments while safeguarding access and equity,” Jeremy Singer, the chief operating officer, said in a statement. Digital testing offers the potential for lower cost, instant results and more accurate scoring. Eliminating test booklets and answer sheets provides greater security from test theft, a serious concern after major cheating scandals in the United States and abroad. An increasing share of professional, licensing and postgraduate exams are digital-only, including the GRE, MCAT and GMAT. Digital literacy in schools was a core goal of the federal No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, which mandated annual testing of schoolchildren grades three through eight and in high school to hold schools accountable. The Common Core academic standards, released in 2010 and accepted by most states, called for state accountability tests to be administered online. But developing an online version of a high-stakes standardized test requires exhaustive studies of such factors as laptop scrolling speeds, screen loading of various equipment and fine-grained statistical comparisons of scores, Ms. McAllister said. Test administration poses its own challenges. In South Carolina last year, the first statewide mandatory online ACT exam was marred by technical difficulties, forcing some schools to administer makeup tests and delaying some score reports. Mr. Colby blamed a nationwide outage beyond ACT’s control, but Ryan Brown, an Education Department spokesman, said the state encouraged districts to seek waivers for paper tests this year, and many did. “Frankly, we don’t trust ACT’s capacity to test an entire state online,” he said. ACT adapted by requiring a new test setup this year. The approach, known as proctor caching, is in place in suburban Edmond, Okla., where 1,692 juniors are taking the ACT online for the first time at three high schools and an alternative academy. Each school has a dedicated server that downloads and administers the test to individual students’ work stations, thus avoiding web-related problems. “We have not had one phone call from a parent concerned or questioning,” said Angela Mills Grunewald, associate superintendent. “I think online testing is so much the norm that it’s not a concern.” But Oklahoma City opted for the paper SAT this year, because the city does not yet have enough equipment and its older buildings are prone to power and network failures. The 2013 debut of Oklahoma’s online statewide testing is remembered as a debacle. “Many students already experience anxiety while taking exams such as the SAT, and disruptions in testing may further increase this anxiety for students,” said Beth Harrison, chief communications officer for the Oklahoma City schools. It’s not just students who are anxious, said Thomas Tucker, superintendent of the Princeton City School District in Cincinnati, which plans to give the SAT online on Tuesday. “When you change from one mode of test administration to another, scores typically drop — we know that for a fact,” said Mr. Tucker, who serves on a College Board advisory panel. Adept as this generation is online, teenagers are most at ease using phones, not keyboards, he said. Though scores tend to rebound later, Mr. Tucker said many of his colleagues do not want even a temporary score drop on their watch. “They don’t want to bite the bullet,” he said. Closer study has shown that scores drop only among students who do not use computers for everyday schoolwork, said Tracy Weeks, executive director of the State Educational Technology Directors Association. The College Board and ACT emphasize the practice value of their online exams in earlier grades, as well as their free online test prep: The College Board promotes the score-boosting power of its partner Khan Academy, commonly used in school and after-school curriculums, while ACT this spring began its own ACT Academy online test prep. Nevertheless, many students still feel more confident with pencil and paper. Bryce Kessler, a senior at Princeton High School, who hopes to study musical theater, said he took the online SAT at school last year but did better on the pencil-and paper Saturday ACT for which he had been practicing for years. “It was kind of disorienting to me,” he said of the digital format. “I know a lot of people who did not finish or said they only got halfway.” At least one test coach, ArborBridge, is urging its clients to avoid online tests if they have the option, saying too little is known about the testing setup and interface. “No one wants to be a guinea pig,” said Megan Stubbendeck, ArborBridge’s senior director of instruction. That prospect apparently does not faze the juniors in Enid. “I personally am nervous,” said Kassidy Diel, junior class secretary, who is aiming for Oklahoma State University and a career in veterinary medicine. But she admitted that is just her mind-set about tests. “Everybody has taken at least one big test online,” she said. “I think they know what to expect.”",The New York Times

Want to share your story, photo, poem or video? Email nytaustralia@nytimes.com. Sydney By Elise Coroneos When I was in New York, I lived with a Dominican-born, Bronx-raised New Yorker. He had guided me through the ‘ins and outs’ of local and American life. So when we traveled to Sydney to hang in my native land, I looked forward to reciprocating the tour guide aspect of our relationship. It is interesting to think about what someone will find unique about your native land. Yes, there were the beaches. He was amazed at the sheer number of them. But I expected that. Yes, he was impressed by our visit to my local doctor. When I pulled out a Medicare card (an Australian universal health care card) in order to ‘pay,’ it was like he’d just witnessed a new and wonderful world. But again, I expected that. Yes, he was seriously surprised with just how multiethnic Sydney is. But I expected that too. The growth of Asian-Australian as an ethnic group is an evolution in motion that has not translated to the outside world quite yet. But then there were the things that I didn’t expect, the largest of which was … the Australian bird life. It seriously blew him away. I had taken it for granted. As a person who grew up in suburban Sydney, I did not for a moment predict the impact it would have on him. On our first day in Sydney, after freshening up after the long flight, we took a stroll down the street on which we were staying — about 15 minutes by car from the city center. While on this walk, we saw a cockatoo land in a small tree. Immediately, my partner said, “Look, someone’s pet got out.” Of course, while trying not to laugh at his presumption, I immediately said, “No, they are native here. You will see them around.” But it was such an alien idea to him, he could not accept it as fact. “No, no, that must be someone’s pet,” he said. Suddenly, a flock of 12 or so cockatoos landed next to their mate in the same small tree. Vindication on my part. Sincere surprise on his. Some may call it divine intervention, but I call it simply the reality of living in suburban Sydney. Over the next couple of weeks, the cockatoos, the lorikeets, the kookaburras and other bird life blew him away. I had not expected this. For my Bronx-raised partner, who only knew animals in controlled environments such as zoos or as pets, it was sincerely amazing for him to witness the extent of free and thriving bird life in suburban Sydney. “It’s like an aviary opened its doors and just let its contents out on this country,” he said.

2018,"Opinion | For the Vegas Golden Knights, It’s Not Only Magic on Ice","Sporting Ms. Bronson is a hospitality worker and a contributing opinion writer. LAS VEGAS — To those who thought ice hockey couldn’t work in the Nevada desert, you should see Las Vegas Boulevard. The oversize L.C.D. screens are flashing Golden Knights chants. Inside the Bellagio casino, a life-size chocolate sculpture of goalie Marc-Andre Fleury defends the counter of a patisserie. In front of the New York-New York replica skyline, the Statue of Liberty currently wears a 600-pound, 28-foot-long Golden Knights sweater. Las Vegas has embraced hockey, and with our stereotypical, extravagant flair. Our pregame shows feature surreal, Cirque du Soleil-style choreography. Elvises and Blue Man Group performers can be spotted rooting in our stands. Between periods, a futuristic-looking drum line, illuminated by LED gloves and goggles, thunders away on flashing, neon-yellow snares. We are Vegas, after all — we know our brand better than anyone. But beyond the loud crowds of the T-Mobile Arena, Golden Knights fever has permeated Las Vegas in less ostentatious ways. A year ago, an average weeknight at my local bar was just a smoky room full of strangers playing video poker machines and quietly watching sporting events from around the country. Now on Golden Knights game nights, that same bar is rowdy and boisterous and packed with neighbors in gray and gold jerseys. Yes, they still gamble and smoke, but when center William Karlsson lights it up with a sensational goal or the Knights need support, they swap high-fives, erupt in guttural cheers of “Go, Knights, go!” or both. Last week, when the Golden Knights swept the Los Angeles Kings in their first round Stanley Cup playoff series, half of my neighborhood was at that bar — people I had lived on the same street with for years but whose names I didn’t learn until we were side-by-side with the same Golden Knights helmet silk-screened onto our chests like a new, indestructible armor. Although Las Vegas has never had major professional sports teams, it has always been a sports town. In 1990, it was Runnin’ Rebel fever, when the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, men’s basketball team defeated Duke in the N.C.A.A. National Championship game. But to some people, it takes professional teams to legitimize a city. Historically, expansion teams perform poorly. But as this year’s Pacific Division Champions, the Golden Knights accomplished in their inaugural season what no other expansion team in any sport has done. To the outsider, the Golden Knights might seem like a first-time gambler on a heater. But to locals, the most poignant result of the team’s arrival is not their unlikely success but how their journey has been intimately tied to our city’s healing and catharsis. Just days before the Golden Knights’ first home-game opener, a gunman fortressed inside the Mandalay Bay hotel with nearly 50 weapons and 4,000 rounds of ammunition opened fire on the Route 91 Harvest Festival crowd, killing 58 concertgoers and wounding hundreds of others. Instead of introducing their team with standard Vegas-like theatrics, the Golden Knights comforted Las Vegans with a tribute to emergency medical workers. The players entered the rink paired with nurses, police officers, E.M.T.s and surgeons. The names of the 58 victims were projected onto the ice, and 58 seconds of silence was observed. In those moments, before the puck was dropped and any ice hockey was played, the Golden Knights forged their role as more than just another economy-fueling tourist attraction. They claimed a stake in our local community. From there, the Knights went on to win their first seven games. By February, they broke the N.H.L.’s record of wins by an expansion team. The city of Las Vegas extends far beyond the two-mile corporate glitz where T-Mobile Arena is, yet our identity is so often contained to the Strip. Getting the nation to acknowledge us as anything other than America’s favorite place to party has been an endless challenge. The Route 91 massacre seemed to awaken the country to the community of Las Vegas, a collection of diverse people with shared victories and disappointments. But the Golden Knights recognized this truth almost immediately. As the season progressed and the city moved forward, the team certainly catered to our big personality, but it also continued to acknowledge our often overlooked heart. Professional sports franchises helping their cities cope with tragedy is nothing new. After Sept. 11, the New York Yankees made it to the World Series. Had the Golden Knights never been displaced to the desert, Las Vegas’s grief and recovery still would have occurred, but on a much quieter, lonely scale. We would have pressed on, because surprisingly, Las Vegans are not strangers to loneliness or displacement: Three out of every four residents were not born here. Similarly, despite the team’s slogan, “Vegas Born,” the players for the Golden Knights were plucked from all around the country. The Golden Knights have offered residents a way to be rooted to one of the most transient cities in the world. For the small contingent that truly is “Vegas Born,” they have affirmed that being so is something to be proud of. But our new, shiny armor is certainly not indestructible. Explosions of fandom are always tied to success. Hard times will certainly come to the Golden Knights, whether it’s in the next round of the Stanley Cup playoffs or next season. But in our quintessentially Las Vegas style, we never ease into anything. We started our show with the entire bejeweled and bedazzled bandwagon. Who knows how long the ride will go? You might as well jump on it.",The New York Times
2018,"Ford Changed Leaders, Looking for a Lift. It’s Still Looking.","DEARBORN, Mich. — When Jim Hackett took over as chief executive of Ford Motor, he was charged with revitalizing a company suffering from slumping profits, rising costs and an uncertain outlook. In the 11 months since then, Mr. Hackett has shuffled Ford’s executive ranks and outlined plans to introduce new sport-utility vehicles and electric cars. Other steps in his strategy, however, have been slow in coming. New models — including updated Escape and Explorer S.U.V.s — are on the way, but most won’t begin arriving until the second half of 2019. The company’s stock price is still lagging. And while Mr. Hackett has vowed to cut engineering costs and improve Ford’s “fitness,” he has yet to specify how he’ll do that, what his overall turnaround plan entails, and what financial targets Ford hopes to hit. The lack of detail has frustrated Wall Street analysts, and the tension spilled into the open during a conference call in January. In the call, Mr. Hackett noted that Ford was working on six efficiency initiatives but offered no specifics. “When are we going to know these six?” Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley asked. “Because I asked you a pretty straightforward question. You’re alluding to the six in your slides. You’re clearly not willing to talk about them.” Then, with a tone of exasperation rarely heard in such calls, Mr. Jonas added, “That’s a problem, Jim.” The slow rollout of a recovery plan has added a new layer to the challenges facing the No. 2 American automaker. It has trouble on several fronts: Operations in Europe, India, and South America are struggling; costs for key materials like aluminum and steel are rising; sales in China have stalled; and its model line is short on the new types of S.U.V.s and trucks that buyers are snapping up in the United States. In a recent note to his clients, Mr. Jonas said investors were becoming skittish about Ford and saw General Motors and Fiat Chrysler as better bets, largely because of the uncertainty of how Mr. Hackett intends to fix the company. “Ford is seen as carrying unnecessarily high levels of risk and little transparency,” he wrote. Ford is due to report its first-quarter earnings on Wednesday and is expected to offer some new information about cost-cutting. But investors probably won’t see a full-blown turnaround plan until September, three people familiar with the matter said. Senior executives are debating the elements of a comprehensive plan to streamline Ford’s internal operations and rebuild profitability in the company’s North American business, and job cuts cannot be ruled out, these people said. They said a key goal would be lifting North America’s profit margin to near 10 percent by 2019 or 2020. Last year, Ford North America’s margin was 8 percent, well short of the 10.7 percent that General Motors achieved. Shrinking or selling unprofitable foreign operations could also be part of the new strategy, the three people said, and the company is also discussing whether to continue selling small and midsize cars in the domestic market. Ford currently loses money on the Fiesta, Focus and the Fusion sedan, they said. Ford’s top executives expect to present the plan to the company’s directors at the board’s July meeting, these people said. The July gathering is typically when directors spend several days at Ford to give its business strategy a thorough review, and test-drive new models the company is preparing to introduce. A Ford spokesman, Bradley Carroll, declined to comment on the board’s deliberations. But he added that “the entire company is intensely focused on improving the operational fitness of the business to deliver profitable growth with improved returns.” Mr. Hackett, 63, has signaled that he is wary of rushing into a new strategy. “If you think too quickly, and you’re wrong,” he told reporters in March, “you get this joy of making it to market but then you’re always correcting.” Just two years ago, Ford was cruising at high speed. Mr. Hackett’s predecessor, Mark Fields, guided the company to record earnings in 2015 — nearly $11 billion in pretax profit. Brimming with confidence, Mr. Fields approved several ambitious projects. He set off a hiring spree to stock up on software developers, engineers and other executives — talent that he believed Ford would need to compete as electric and self-driving cars reshape the auto industry. Ford laid out a billion-dollar plan to remake its Dearborn, Mich., locations into a high-tech, Silicon Valley-like campus. The company invested in ride-sharing and other start-ups in a bid to turn itself into a “mobility” company. Mr. Fields and Ford’s chairman, William C. Ford Jr., called on a director — Mr. Hackett — to join the management ranks and run the mobility activities. It also introduced a $400,000 super sports car, the Ford GT. But when Mr. Fields couldn’t move fast enough to head off slippage in Ford’s profits, the board dismissed him last May and handed the reins to Mr. Hackett, a former chief executive of Steelcase who is credited with turning around the office-furniture maker. And analysts question whether the vestiges of the Fields strategy will ever pay off. Its very name was synonymous with the 20th-century economy. Now it’s trying to catch up with Silicon Valley on self-driving cars. The headquarters makeover might make Ford a more enticing place to work years down the road, but won’t generate the revenue growth the company needs now. The mobility businesses aren’t making money yet. And while the GT sports car turns heads, Ford is selling only 250 a year. “You have to ask the question: Is it really getting you showroom traffic?” said Brian Johnson of Barclays Capital. Ford’s aluminum-bodied F-150 pickup truck, introduced in late 2014, has been a strong seller and a big generator of profits. But other parts of its core business have been sputtering. As American consumers gravitated away from cars and toward trucks, S.U.V.s and roomy but fuel-efficient S.U.V. cousins known as crossovers, Ford began losing money on cars and allowed its S.U.V. and crossover lineup to age. The current Explorer S.U.V. was introduced in 2010, and the Escape in 2012. Competing models from Toyota, Honda, G.M. and others have since been redesigned and feature newer technology. “What they should have done is invest in the new crossovers in 2015 and 2016,” said David Whiston, an analyst at Morningstar. Crossovers, he noted, now make up a third of the American car market. Ford also decided to drop its small pickup, the Ranger. But it is now scrambling to introduce a redesigned version of the Ranger after realizing it was losing sales of small pickups to competitors. Mr. Hackett and his executive team have presented overviews of his vision for Ford on Wall Street and elsewhere on several occasions. At an event in March, they promised to introduce a slew of new S.U.V.s, including high-performance and off-road models. But his presentations haven’t generated much enthusiasm with investors. Ford’s stock is trading at about $11, slightly below where it stood a year ago. Mr. Whiston said he was willing to wait for Mr. Hackett to present a comprehensive plan. But he added, “It is strange that it’s been almost a year and we don’t have any concrete details.”",The New York Times
2018,Ford Will Drop Focus and Fusion Sedans in North America,"DEARBORN, Mich. — Ford Motor replaced its chief executive officer a year ago, handing the job to Jim Hackett. But it may be another year before the company starts to show clear signs of a revival under the new boss. On Wednesday, the automaker said it was accelerating efforts to slash costs and planned to stop making the Focus, the Fusion and other sedans for the North American market in a bid to turn around its fortunes both at home and abroad. Ford said it expected to reduce sales, marketing, engineering and other costs by $11.5 billion between 2019 and 2022. That’s on top of about $14 billion in efficiencies the company had already promised to achieve in the next several years. The company is also considering exiting or selling money-losing operations in Europe and South America, its chief financial officer, Robert L. Shanks, told reporters. Ford expects the measures to enable it to achieve a global profit margin of 8 percent by 2020, two years earlier than it previously forecast, he said. “We are undergoing a profound transformation,” Mr. Shanks said, “and are committed to taking decisive action.” He cautioned, however, that the cost-saving moves would not have much of an impact on the bottom line until the second half of 2019, when new sport-utility vehicles are expected to arrive and help drive profits. Ford has been criticized by Wall Street analysts for offering few details on Mr. Hackett’s strategy for the company. In a conference call on Wednesday, the chief executive said Ford will outline a full turnaround plan for investors and analysts on Sept. 26. News of the turnaround plans arrived as Ford reported further signs of difficulty in the first quarter of 2018. Net income totaled $1.7 billion, up by $100 million from the same period a year earlier, and earnings increased to 43 cents a share, up by 3 cents. But the company’s profit margin slipped to 5.2 percent from 6.4 percent a year earlier. Profits before taxes fell to $2.2 billion from $2.5 billion. And in every region of the world, Ford reported either a decline in profits or a loss. In North America, Ford’s largest and most important region, pretax profit was $1.9 billion, down $200 million from a year earlier. Its margin in North America fell to 7.8 percent from 8.9 percent. Mr. Shanks said North American operations had been hurt by rising costs for key commodities such as steel and aluminum. Ford is counting on its planned cost reductions to reinvigorate its North American operations. The company expects its profit margin in North America to rise to 10 percent by 2020, Mr. Shanks said. In a further savings, Ford now plans to reduce its capital spending between 2019 and 2022 to $29 billion; it previously expected to spend $34 billion in that time. Dropping out of the sedan business in the United States is a momentous shift for Ford. Just a decade ago, the Focus compact and the midsize Fusion spearheaded a push to provide stylish and fuel-efficient cars as gasoline prices were rising. But Americans are abandoning sedans and choosing trucks and S.U.V.s. Mr. Shanks said the business lines losing money were mainly smaller vehicles. Within a few years, Ford will offer only two cars in the United States: the Mustang sports car and a new Focus variant with the shape of an S.U.V., Mr. Hackett said. Fiat Chrysler dropped its small and midsize cars in North America two years ago, and has prospered by ramping up sales of trucks and Jeeps. Ford is planning to introduce several new trucks and S.U.V.s over the next three years. They will be available as both gasoline- and battery-powered versions. “Ford realized it can’t be everything to everyone, and in today’s market that could be O.K.,” said Jessica Caldwell, a senior analyst at Edmunds.com, an auto-information website. While S.U.V.s and trucks generate richer profits than cars, Ford will probably lose some market share by exiting the car business, she said. Just two years ago, Ford was one of the most profitable companies in the global auto industry, thanks in part to robust sales of its aluminum-bodied F-Series pickup trucks. But since then, Ford has been slow to roll out the new sorts of S.U.V.s that have caught favor with American consumers, and it let costs creep higher. Last May, Ford’s board called on Mr. Hackett, a former chief executive of the office furniture maker Steelcase who had been running Ford’s new businesses related to autonomous vehicles, to whip the company into shape. He has laid out plans to introduced several new S.U.V.s as well as a range of electric vehicles, and until now had given few details on what financial targets he planned to hit, and how. Ford took steps on Wednesday to bolster its operations in China, a key overseas market, where sales have been flagging. Rather than maintain two dealership networks selling separate lines of Ford vehicles, its China dealers will now sell all Ford products available in the country.",The New York Times
2018,Forensics Helps Widen Architecture’s Mission,"LONDON — Last year, Israeli police officers raided a Bedouin village in the Negev desert called Umm al-Hiran. The Israeli authorities said that during the raid a villager had purposely run over an Israeli officer, killing him. They called it a terrorist attack. The villager died at the scene. Silent police helicopter footage seemed to show his car accelerating into the officer. Forensic Architecture uncovered a different story. You may recall Forensic Architecture from headlines a few years back. It investigated the killing of two Palestinian teenagers in the West Bank. Local and international media crews were on hand when the teenagers were killed. Security cameras recorded the shootings. At first, Israel’s minister of defense said the teenagers had been throwing Molotov cocktails at Israeli soldiers, despite security footage showing otherwise. The minister said the footage had been doctored. Forensic Architecture combed through the videos and social media posts. Using architectural rendering software, it pieced together a computer model of the site and tracked the trajectory of the bullets. That pinpointed the soldier who fired them and the weapon he used. Comparing acoustic signatures, Forensic Architecture then matched the fatal shots to the distinct sounds of live ammunition, contradicting the military’s claim that only rubber bullets had been fired. All this contributed to Israeli officials reversing themselves, and charging the soldier with manslaughter. A survey of Forensic Architecture’s work is now on view at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London, through May 6. A collaborative of designers, filmmakers, coders, archaeologists, psychologists and others, based at Goldsmiths, University of London, Forensic Architecture acts more or less like a detective agency. It partners with groups like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. Its funders include the European Research Council. And its investigations are whodunits. Eyal Weizman, an Israeli-British architect, is the group’s founder and resident Columbo. Instead of creating a house or skyscraper, the group scours for evidence of lies, crimes and human rights violations — combining the spatial and engineering skills of architects, the data-gathering prowess of librarians, the doggedness of investigative journalists and the storytelling finesse of screenwriters. Its reports have annoyed Germany’s Christian Democratic Union party, frustrated Bashar al-Assad, Syria’s president, provoked an attack from Vladimir V. Putin’s Russia Today news service, and infuriated officials in Israel. Mr. Weizman has an especially long history of run-ins there. Born in Haifa, educated at the Architectural Association in London, he was just starting out as an architect in Tel Aviv when he began to study the legacy of town planning in the occupied territories. What he saw suggested to him architecture’s complicity in human rights violations. In 2002, with a colleague, Rafi Segal, he was hired to organize a show of new Israeli architecture. Mr. Weizman and Mr. Segal presented settlements in the occupied territories. Appalled, the Israel Association of United Architects canceled the exhibition and withdrew the catalog. The incident brought Mr. Weizman attention. And it made him think. His timing could hardly seem better, with technology rapidly democratizing the instruments of forensic research and the purview of young architects widening. He begins his recent book, “Forensic Architecture,” recalling the libel trial in London of the Holocaust denier and historian David Irving, nearly two decades ago. Mr. Irving’s shameful case relied on a tidbit of architectural evidence: he made much of fuzzy satellite imagery showing a demolished crematory at Auschwitz. Survivors had said they recalled poison cyanide gas canisters dropped through a hole in the crematory’s roof, but Mr. Irving said there was no hole in the satellite photos. “No hole, no Holocaust,” became the deniers’ catchphrase. Mr. Irving lost his trial. But Mr. Weizman cites the case as a cautionary tale. The tools of forensic analysis can easily be perverted. Wielded especially by governments and other powers in defense of violence and crime, they need to be challenged by equally sophisticated means. Architecture and forensics may be disparate disciplines but brought together they could produce a new, “different mode of practice,” Mr. Weizman realized. They could help reverse “the forensic gaze” back onto state agencies “that usually monopolize it.” Adopting a phrase coined by the photographer Allan Sekula, Mr. Weizman terms the practice “counter forensics.” I stopped by the group’s office in southeast London the other day. A dozen or so researchers were staring into computer screens, Nick Masterton among them. He was tinkering with a timeline and 3D computer model of the Grenfell Tower fire that killed 71 people in London last year. Mr. Masterton and the rest of the Grenfell team have spent the last several months knitting together thousands of open-source photographs, videos and reams of metadata related to the fire. Mr. Masterton told me he’s using some of the techniques he learned in architecture school when so-called parametric design was the rage. Forensic Architecture relies on computer programs and digital animation software that model exotic building shapes to reconstitute bombed-out ruins, identify debris patterns from drone strikes and document tragedies like the fire. And of course Mr. Masterton scours the Web for images. It has become a cliché that smartphones and social media today flood the world with pictures that change public debates around power, policing, violence and race. For Mr. Weizman, the “image flotsam,” as he calls it, can be as confounding as it can be useful and it needs to be assembled. It requires “construction and composition — thus, architecture,” in his words. The resulting “architectural image complex” functions like a lens, letting people “see the scene of a crime as a set of relations between images in time and space.” Christina Varvia is now Forensic Architecture’s research coordinator. “What we do is in the tradition of ‘paper architecture,’” she told me, when I asked how her work relates to what she did as an architect. “Except we expect results. As architects, we’re also trained to bring different people together to produce a design. But instead, we synthesize evidence.” Since 2011, when Mr. Weizman founded the agency, its work has expanded beyond Israel and the Palestinian territories to Mexico, Guatemala, Afghanistan and Europe. Its investigation into whether a German undercover agent lied about witnessing the murder of a man of Turkish descent at an internet cafe is one of the most intriguing and mysterious cases at the Institute of Contemporary Arts. One of the most heartbreaking involves Saydnaya, the infamous prison outside Damascus. Since the start of Syria’s civil war, thousands have disappeared inside that country’s detention centers. At Saydnaya, prisoners are kept in darkness, tortured and beaten if they speak. No outsiders are allowed access. There are no recent photographs of the inside. Working with Amnesty International, Forensic Architecture interviewed five former Saydnaya detainees in Istanbul. The researchers asked the prisoners to describe the building. Trauma unhinges memory, but architecture can provide an anchor. No detail was considered too trivial. Based on remembered smells of grease and blood, and sounds like an idling truck engine delivering new prisoners or the approaching thud of guards beating inmates, cell by cell, Forensic Architecture constructed a computer model of Saydnaya. “When a state commits a crime,” Mr. Weizman explained, “it cordons off an area, which is the privilege of the state. That site becomes a work of architecture, defined by the cordon. A prison by definition is architecture. You can try to break through the state cordon via leaks, media images, satellite photographs. And when they’re not available, memory is a way around the cordon. In any case, the cordoned area is our ‘building site.’” At Umm al-Hiran, the Bedouin village that was raided, the building site became the dusty hill where the car struck the police officer. The supposed terrorist in that case was a farmer named Yaqub Musa Abu al-Qi’an. The Israeli policeman he ran over was named Erez Levi. Collaborating with ActiveStills, an Israeli-based photographic collective, Forensic Architecture used photogrammetry and collected, time stamped and synchronized every available image and video of the raid, producing a corresponding soundtrack. The soundtrack, when played alongside the thermal-imaging videos, revealed the pops of three gunshots where heat flashes emerged from a policeman’s weapon that had been overlooked in the silent helicopter footage. The weapon was fired at Mr. Abu al-Qi’an’s car just before it accelerated down a hill and into Mr. Levi. Not long after that discovery, the Israeli newspaper Haaretz published a leaked autopsy report revealing that Mr. Abu al-Qi’an had suffered two bullet wounds, one in his right knee, the leg controlling the gas pedal. The wound raised an alternative explanation for why Mr. Abu al-Qi’an, who had been moving slowly, with his lights on, suddenly accelerated, as if losing control of his vehicle. The police continued to insist he was a terrorist, but more than a month after the raid Israel’s security service and Ministry of Justice changed the story and attributed the incident to a police blunder. That still left unexplained the second bullet, which villagers testified to seeing an Israeli officer fire at point-blank range into Mr. Abu al-Qi’an after his car had stopped. So Forensic Architecture continued its investigation. With volunteers, it reenacted the event at Umm al-Hiran, using the same model car, confirming that the scenario in which a wounded Mr. Abu al-Qi’an lost control and sped down the hill matched the video evidence. It also turned out that the doors of a Land Cruiser lock automatically when the vehicle reaches 20 kilometers an hour, as Mr. Abu al-Qi’an’s car did before swerving to a standstill at the bottom of the hill. In helicopter footage, the driver’s side door can be seen to open when the police surround the stopped vehicle, implying Mr. Abu al-Qi’an willingly opened it. A single gunshot then pierces the soundtrack. That second bullet lodged beneath Mr. Abu al-Qi’an’s heart. The leaked autopsy report said he bled to death from this wound, while medical aid was withheld. An investigation by the justice ministry into the event recently concluded, without any apparent indictments. The case awaits a final verdict by the state attorney.

2018,Former Colombian Rebel Commander Is Arrested on Drug Charges,"MEDELLÍN, Colombia — A former guerrilla peace negotiator has been arrested on drug trafficking charges in Colombia, after government officials said he and associates had returned to the drug trade his group had vowed to give up. The arrest of Seusis Hernández Solarte was a surprise turn of events for the FARC, the former rebel organization that has refashioned itself as a political party called the Common Alternative Revolutionary Force. In signing a peace deal in 2016, its leaders — all wanted as drug traffickers in the United States — were promised immunity for past crimes and, in return, they renounced future ones. But on Monday, the Colombian government said that Mr. Hernández, whose nom de guerre was Jesús Santrich, had quickly returned to the drug business. Officials said that starting last June, just months after the peace deal was signed, Mr. Hernández had sought to export roughly 10 tons of cocaine to the United States, whose value they estimated was as much as $320 million. President Juan Manuel Santos of Colombia announced the arrest on television. He issued a stern warning to the FARC, saying that while past offenses were forgiven under the peace accord, future ones would be handled by prosecutors. “The accords are clear: Whoever commits a crime after the signing of the deal will be sent to the courts for the new crimes committed,” Mr. Santos said. FARC leaders rallied around Mr. Hernández on Monday, contending that the government was breaking the peace deal by ordering the arrest. “What they’ve done to Jesús Santrich they can do to any of us,” said Judith Simanca Herrera, a former FARC leader known by her war name, Victoria Sandino. The arrest, which officials said involved information from the Drug Enforcement Administration, also showed the American involvement in continuing to capture FARC leaders when they are wanted on trafficking accusations. United States officials have warned repeatedly that former guerrillas have not left the drug business and continue to have involvement in the American market. Néstor Humberto Martínez, the Colombian attorney general, said Mr. Hernández had access to planes registered in the United States to transport drugs, as well as cocaine laboratories. He said Mr. Hernández had been involved in drug smuggling scheme until this month. Mr. Hernández cut a striking figure among the former rebel leaders, appearing before reporters wearing dark sunglasses and a checkered scarf similar to those worn by Palestinian rebels. A top commander, he was a key member in negotiating the peace deal signed with Mr. Santos in 2016. In the months since, he had taken a political position in the new rebel party. He had even been selected to take one of the seats in Congress that the party was granted automatically as part of the deal. Both the peace accord the party remain unpopular in Colombia, and Mr. Hernández’s arrest is likely to stoke longstanding suspicions among Colombians that FARC members have not given up the drug trade. By Monday evening, it had already become the key topic among candidates in the first round of Colombia’s presidential election. “Colombian authorities must act firm and investigate what other heads of this organization continue to have criminal ties,” said Ivan Duque, a front-runner in the race, which is set for May. His right-wing party, Democratic Center, campaigned against the peace deal, saying it was too lenient on the rebels for drug crimes. The arrest also capped what has been a disastrous year for the FARC’s political party. In February, the group said it was suspending campaigning after many of its members had been attacked by angry mobs on the campaign trail. In March, its former commander, Rodrigo Londoño, dropped out of the presidential campaign, citing health problems. Several days later, Colombians delivered a deep blow to the group during congressional elections, in which it won less than 1 percent of the vote.",The New York Times
2018,Former F.B.I. Agent Admits He Shared Classified Documents,"A former counterterrorism agent at the F.B.I. who gave classified documents to the news media in an effort to reveal how the bureau treated minority communities pleaded guilty on Tuesday to the unauthorized disclosure and retention of national defense information. It is the most recent prosecution in a growing series of leak cases being pursued by the Justice Department, which has significantly increased its focus on such investigations since President Trump took office. However, the actions of the agent, Terry J. Albury, largely predate Mr. Trump’s presidency. As a field agent in the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Minneapolis office, Mr. Albury provided a reporter with two documents between February 2016 and Jan. 31, 2017, according to the charges against him. The first document, dated Aug. 17, 2011, described how the bureau evaluated confidential sources; the second, which was undated, concerned “threats posed by certain individuals from a particular Middle Eastern country.” Mr. Albury also possessed, without authorization, “a document relating to the use of an online platform for recruitment by a specific terrorist group.” “Mr. Albury was entrusted by the F.B.I. with a security clearance, which included a responsibility to protect classified national defense information,” Bill Priestap, assistant director of the bureau’s Counterintelligence Division, said in a statement on Tuesday. “Instead, he knowingly disclosed that material to someone not authorized to receive it.” Mr. Albury, 39, faces up to 10 years in prison on each of the two charges, but under his plea agreement, he could receive less than five years. Judge Wilhelmina M. Wright of the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota will decide his sentence. In his plea, Mr. Albury acknowledged that the facts outlined by the government were accurate and that he had acted with the knowledge that he was breaking the law. His lawyers, JaneAnne Murray and Joshua Dratel, said in a statement that he viewed his disclosures as “an act of conscience” in the face of racism at the F.B.I. “It has long been a critique of the F.B.I. that it consists of and reflects a predominantly white male culture, which, as a result, has often treated minority communities with suspicion and disrespect,” the statement said. It added that Mr. Albury — who was the only African-American field agent in the Minneapolis office — had decided to act after he was assigned to the bureau’s counterterrorism team and “was required firsthand to implement F.B.I. investigation directives that profiled and intimidated minority communities in Minnesota and other locations.” Public court documents do not name the news organization to which Mr. Albury gave the documents, and a Justice Department spokesman declined to identify it. However, an Associated Press report noted that the date and subject matter of one of the documents correspond with those of a document cited in a Jan. 31, 2017, article by The Intercept. The Intercept article reported that F.B.I. agents “have the authority to aggressively investigate anyone they believe could be a valuable source for the bureau.” Among its sources was a classified document dated Aug. 17, 2011, which said that in evaluating potential informants, the bureau would “attempt to psychologically evaluate the target to determine the target’s motivations, mental stability and loyalties” and “seek information on the target’s habits, hobbies, interests, vices, aspirations, emotional ties and feelings concerning his country and his career and his employer.” Betsy Reed, editor in chief of The Intercept, said in a statement on Tuesday that the organization would not discuss its anonymous sources, but that the Justice Department’s “use of the Espionage Act to prosecute whistle-blowers seeking to shed light on matters of vital public concern is an outrage.” In a statement released by the Justice Department, John C. Demers, the assistant attorney general for national security, said Mr. Albury had “admitted that his actions put America at risk.” But in their statement, Mr. Albury’s lawyers emphasized that the documents he disclosed did not include “any names of any F.B.I. personnel or assets or any operational information.”",The New York Times
2018,Former F.B.I. Deputy Director Is Faulted in Scathing Inspector General Report,"WASHINGTON — The Justice Department inspector general delivered to Congress on Friday a scathing report that accused Andrew G. McCabe, the former F.B.I. deputy director, of violating the federal law enforcement agency’s media policy and then repeatedly misleading investigators about his actions. The inspector general found that Mr. McCabe, 50, had lacked candor on four occasions when questioned by investigators and faulted his decision to authorize the disclosure of information to a reporter with The Wall Street Journal in October 2016 as self-serving. In a point-by-point rebuttal of the report, Mr. McCabe said that he had full authorization to share this information with the news media as deputy director and that he did not intentionally mislead investigators. He also argued that his decision to release information about an investigation into the financial dealings of the Clinton Foundation was justified and in the public’s interest. Mr. McCabe, a 21-year F.B.I. veteran, was fired in March after Attorney General Jeff Sessions rejected an appeal that would have let him retire with a full government pension. At the time, Mr. Sessions said that Mr. McCabe had repeatedly shown a lack of candor under oath. Mr. McCabe disputed that, saying his firing was meant to undermine the special counsel investigation being led by Robert S. Mueller III, and to discredit him as a witness. The report’s release, which had been anticipated for months, comes at a time when the F.B.I. and the Justice Department are under intense scrutiny by Republicans on Capitol Hill and by President Trump for their continuing investigation of possible links between the Trump campaign and Russia. Mr. Trump, who considers the Russia investigation a “witch hunt,” has fumed in recent days after an F.B.I. raid of his personal lawyer’s office and hotel room in New York. The inspector general’s report also provides the president and his allies with a convenient counterpoint to a new memoir by James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director Mr. Trump fired last May. The book, “A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership,” is scheduled to be released on Tuesday, but details began to trickle out Thursday night, including pointed criticisms of Mr. Trump. On Friday afternoon, Mr. Trump, who has sought to tarnish the reputation of his investigators, pounced on the report on Mr. McCabe, calling it a “total disaster.” “He LIED! LIED! LIED! McCabe was totally controlled by Comey - McCabe is Comey!! No collusion, all made up by this den of thieves and lowlifes!” he wrote on Twitter. Michael R. Bromwich, a lawyer for Mr. McCabe, replied to the president’s tweet, writing in one of his own that his client was considering filing a defamation suit. “Stay tuned,” he wrote. The inspector general report was unsparing in its assessment of Mr. McCabe. The review accused Mr. McCabe of lacking candor when he spoke to Mr. Comey shortly after the October 2016 article was published, when he spoke with F.B.I. investigators and then in two conversations with investigators for the inspector general. Lack of candor, or knowingly providing false information, is a fireable offense at the F.B.I. The inspector general said that when investigators asked whether Mr. McCabe had instructed a pair of aides to provide information in October 2016 to Devlin Barrett, then a Wall Street Journal reporter, Mr. McCabe said he did not authorize the disclosure and did not know who did. Mr. McCabe subsequently said he approved the F.B.I.’s contact with the reporter, according to the review. The newspaper article delved into a dispute between F.B.I. and Justice Department officials over how to proceed in the investigation into the Clinton Foundation. It revealed a meeting during which Justice Department officials declined to authorize subpoenas or grand jury activity. The article said that some F.B.I. agents thought that Mr. McCabe had slowed the investigation. But The Journal, citing anonymous sources including “one person close to Mr. McCabe,” detailed a tense conversation with a senior Justice Department official in which Mr. McCabe insisted that the F.B.I. had the authority to press ahead with the investigation. The inspector general concluded that that engagement initiated by Mr. McCabe had not been justified under the media policy of the F.B.I. and Justice Department and constituted misconduct. Specifically, the report said, providing an anonymous quote about the content of a conversation between Mr. McCabe and another department official “served only to advance McCabe’s personal interests and not the public interest, as required by F.B.I. policy.” Mr. McCabe disputed that conclusion, saying that he took the steps he did to protect the F.B.I.’s reputation. In his interactions with investigators, he said that he had not intended to mislead and in one case reached back out to the inspector general’s office to correct earlier comments. The inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, is expected to release a larger report in the coming weeks about the F.B.I.’s actions during the 2016 election. The report on Friday generated split reaction on Capitol Hill. Top Republicans said that it clearly justified Mr. McCabe’s firing, and highlighted the importance of truthfulness in federal law enforcement. Democrats, while not disputing that point, warned that the report should not be connected to the Russia investigation. Earlier on Friday, Christopher A. Wray, the director of the F.B.I., formally elevated David L. Bowdich, the bureau’s third in command, to succeed Mr. McCabe as deputy director. Mr. Bowdich, the former top agent in the Los Angeles Field Office, has been the acting deputy director since January.",The New York Times
2018,Former Judge Chosen to Review Materials Seized From Michael Cohen,"Barbara S. Jones, a former federal judge, was selected on Thursday to oversee the process of screening materials seized in a recent F.B.I. raid from President Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen. It has been two weeks since federal agents descended on Mr. Cohen’s office, apartment and hotel room and hauled away at least eight boxes of documents and more than a dozen cellphones, iPads and computer hard drives. But because the government and lawyers for Mr. Cohen and Mr. Trump have been sparring about whether the seized materials are privileged, the prosecutors working on the case have not yet been able to look at them. The selection of Ms. Jones, by a federal judge in Manhattan, to determine whether any of the materials are protected by attorney-client privilege appeared to resolve, at least for now, the dispute over who should be permitted to review the materials and how the process should proceed. Bringing on Ms. Jones to serve as what is known as a special master could speed up the review, but it also introduced another layer of scrutiny — and thus a note of caution — to the process. The judge who selected her, Kimba M. Wood of Federal District Court, said that she had asked Ms. Jones how much time she could devote to the special master’s role. “She has committed 90 percent of her time to it and perhaps more if needed,” Judge Wood said. She added, “If at any point it turns out that the special master review process is going too slowly, I’ll revisit the question of the scope of the special master’s role.” At the hearing, prosecutors said that they had already started handing over portions of the seized materials to Mr. Cohen’s lawyers, a process that could take weeks to finish. Under a system laid out by Judge Wood, Mr. Cohen’s lawyers will now begin to screen them for attorney-client privilege and will pass on those records that pertain to Mr. Trump to his own lawyers, who will do the same. At the same time, Ms. Jones will begin a simultaneous review, setting aside records that she herself concludes may be privileged. Each of the parties, Judge Wood said, will have the right to challenge decisions made by the others. While highly technical, the findings about which records are privileged could shape the contours of the government’s investigation into Mr. Cohen. That inquiry is seeking to determine whether he broke the law by attempting to tamp down negative news coverage of the president in the run-up to the 2016 election. Judge Wood made it clear that Ms. Jones was well positioned to serve as an arbiter. For 17 years, she served on the bench in the same courthouse where the Cohen case is now being heard. Before that, she worked as a prosecutor in the United States attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York. Ms. Jones was also once a senior aide to Robert M. Morgenthau, the former Manhattan district attorney. As a private lawyer, Ms. Jones has worked as a monitor or a “neutral party” in disputes. In 2014, she was picked to hear the appeal by Ray Rice, a former Baltimore Ravens player, of the National Football League’s decision to suspend him over a domestic-abuse case. In the past week or so, Mr. Cohen has been shedding legal exposure in separate but related court cases. On Wednesday, he filed papers in California saying he planned to invoke his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination in a lawsuit filed last month against President Trump by Stephanie Clifford, a former pornographic film star better known as Stormy Daniels, who claims she had an affair with the president. Mr. Cohen has admitted to paying Ms. Clifford $130,000 in exchange for signing a nondisclosure agreement in October 2016, a month before the election. Ms. Clifford’s suit seeks to invalidate the agreement, alleging it was void because Mr. Trump never put his name to it. Mr. Cohen also dropped two defamation lawsuits last week against the political research firm Fusion GPS and the website BuzzFeed related to their publication of the so-called Steele dossier, an intelligence report alleging ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. In the suits, Mr. Cohen had accused both companies of disseminating the dossier even though both knew that it contained what he described as lies. All three moves may help Mr. Cohen avoid releasing documents or providing answers to probing questions that could have been used against him in the criminal investigation. That inquiry is said to be focusing not only on hush-money payments that Mr. Cohen made to Ms. Clifford, but also on his role in keeping quiet another woman who claims she had an affair with Mr. Trump, Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model. On Thursday, Ms. Clifford’s lawyer, Michael Avenatti, filed a motion on her behalf to formally intervene in Mr. Cohen’s case in New York. In the motion, Mr. Avenatti said that Ms. Clifford’s former lawyer, Keith Davidson, had communicated with Mr. Cohen about hush-money payments he had made to her, and that records of those dealings were now in the hands of prosecutors. Mr. Davidson confirmed last week that he was contacted by federal authorities after the raids on Mr. Cohen, and that he had shared some of his records with the government. Judge Wood declined to rule from the bench on Ms. Clifford’s motion to intervene. And when asked in court what he and Ms. Clifford wanted, Mr. Avenatti admitted that it wasn’t much. “A seat at the table,” he said.",The New York Times
2018,Former Lawyer for Stormy Daniels Is Drawn Into Federal Investigation,"The Beverly Hills lawyer who represented two women who were paid in 2016 to keep quiet about their alleged affairs with Donald J. Trump has been drawn into the federal investigation focused on Michael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump’s longtime lawyer and fixer. That lawyer, Keith M. Davidson — who finalized another legal agreement with Mr. Cohen in recent months — was contacted by federal authorities in the wake of this month’s raid on Mr. Cohen’s Manhattan office and has shared records with investigators, a spokesman said. “Mr. Davidson has been contacted by the federal authorities regarding the Michael Cohen probe in the Southern District of New York,” the spokesman, Dave Wedge, said on Friday. “Mr. Davidson was asked to provide certain limited electronic information. He has done so and will continue to cooperate to the fullest extent possible under the law.” Mr. Davidson has reached multiple agreements with Mr. Cohen — one of them negotiated in late 2017, when the men brokered the silence of a Playboy model who had had an affair with a major Republican donor and Trump ally. Mr. Cohen also referred business to Mr. Davidson after their earlier dealings leading up to the 2016 presidential election. In 2016, Mr. Davidson represented both the pornographic-film actress Stormy Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, and the former Playboy model Karen McDougal in two separate legal agreements that required each woman to keep silent about an alleged sexual relationship with Mr. Trump. Ms. Clifford, who received $130,000 from Mr. Cohen weeks before the election, has sued him, seeking to be released from that agreement, which her lawyer has argued is invalid because Mr. Trump did not sign the contract. Ms. McDougal similarly sued American Media Inc., the media company that had paid her $150,000 for the rights to her story, arguing that she was deceived into accepting the terms. She said that Mr. Davidson, acting as her own lawyer, inappropriately pressured her and secretly colluded with Mr. Cohen, who was not technically part of the negotiation. This week, A.M.I., the parent company of The National Enquirer, freed her from that agreement. Yet another former Playboy model was represented by Mr. Davidson in recent months, as he negotiated another agreement with Mr. Cohen. Under that contract, Elliott Broidy, the deputy finance chairman of the Republican National Committee, agreed late last year to pay $1.6 million to the woman, who had become pregnant during an affair with Mr. Broidy. Mr. Broidy resigned last week after reports of the agreement emerged. Like Ms. Clifford and Ms. McDougal, the woman who settled with Mr. Broidy has sought a new lawyer and is no longer represented by Mr. Davidson. Mr. Davidson’s past client list has included the professional athletes Jalen Rose and Manny Pacquiao, as well as the sex-tape cases of the “Austin Powers” actor Verne Troyer, the wrestler Hulk Hogan and the onetime Playboy model and MTV host Tila Tequila. Mr. Davidson has called Mr. Cohen a friend, and this month he defended his professional integrity to CNN, telling the network that Mr. Cohen had encouraged him to speak out. Mr. Wedge, the spokesman, called the men’s relationship “purely professional” and said they had met in person only a handful of times. “He is one of hundreds, if not thousands, of lawyers Attorney Davidson has dealt with over his 18 years as a lawyer.” The investigators who have sought information from him are working separately from the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, though the special counsel’s office referred certain information to them. Among the evidence that the authorities in New York have seized are recordings of conversations that Mr. Cohen secretly made. Mr. Davidson, who works out of two offices in Southern California, would need to have agreed to Mr. Cohen recording any phone calls they may have had, as California law requires that both people involved in a conversation consent. “Attorney Davidson never consented to any recordings of his conversations with Mr. Cohen,” Mr. Wedge said. “If they in fact do exist, Attorney Davidson will pursue all his legal rights under the law.”",The New York Times
2018,Former N.F.L. Cheerleaders Offer to Settle for $1 and a Meeting With Goodell,"The lawyer representing two former N.F.L. cheerleaders who recently filed discrimination claims against the league has made a settlement proposal: If her clients can have a four-hour, “good faith” meeting with Commissioner Roger Goodell and league lawyers, they will settle all claims for $1 each. The settlement proposal, sent to an N.F.L. attorney on Tuesday, asks that the league meet with at least four cheerleaders to “prepare a set of binding rules and regulations which apply to all N.F.L. teams.” Also, it would not allow teams that currently have cheerleading squads to disband them, as a way of retaliating against women who raised the workplace issues, for at least five years. The proposal was crafted and sent by Sara Blackwell, a Florida lawyer who represents the former Saints cheerleader Bailey Davis and the former Dolphins cheerleader Kristan Ware, both of whom recently filed complaints of gender discrimination. The letter is little more than one typed page, mostly asking for an audience with Mr. Goodell. But it could force the league into making the next move in what has become a sticky public-relations battle. Ms. Blackwell asked for a response from the N.F.L. by May 4. “We’re not asking them to admit fault, or to admit guilt, or even admit that there is anything wrong,” Ms. Blackwell said in a phone interview. “But if they do want and expect that cheerleaders should have a fair working environment, as they have stated, then it doesn’t make any common sense why the answer would be no.” The letter was sent to Steven Hurd, a New York lawyer at the firm Proskauer who often represents the N.F.L. The letter is the latest development to push the treatment of cheerleaders — and, by extension, the public’s perception of them — into the forefront. Dozens of current and former cheerleaders have stepped forward to discuss the indignities of what is often considered a glamorous job at the pinnacle of the dance profession. Some have detailed grievances that include pervasive and sometimes physical sexual harassment from fans that teams are aware of, extremely low pay and long hours, and strict rules covering everything from weight and appearance to social-media use that do not apply to players or other team representatives. The N.F.L. has responded with a written statement, filled more with a soothing tone than concrete ideas to fix any problems. “The NFL and all NFL member clubs support fair employment practices,” the league’s statement said. “Everyone who works in the NFL, including cheerleaders, has the right to work in a positive and respectful environment that is free from any and all forms of harassment and discrimination and fully complies with state and federal laws. Our office will work with our clubs in sharing best practices and employment-related processes that will support club cheerleading squads within an appropriate and supportive workplace.” Ms. Blackwell’s letter to the league cited that statement and said: “If the NFL is serious about this statement, then this should be an acceptable settlement demand. It is one that is virtually free for the NFL and for the NFL teams and it will ensure the positive and respectful environment the NFL states is the right of the NFL cheerleaders.” One of the cheerleaders present would be Ms. Davis, who was fired from the Saintsations, the cheerleading and dance squad of the New Orleans Saints, after posting a photograph of herself on Instagram. She filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, accusing the Saints of having different standards for women and men. Another cheerleader who would meet with the N.F.L. would be Ms. Ware, who worked three seasons with the Miami Dolphins. Earlier this month, she filed a complaint with the Florida Commission on Human Relations alleging that she was discriminated against because of her gender and religion. Ms. Blackwell said the other two cheerleaders who would attend the meeting have not been determined, but they would have no association with Ms. Blackwell and would come from other teams. The four cheerleaders would discuss both the “unlawful” and the “lawful, but egregious” employment practices pervasive in professional cheerleading, according to the letter. “We want change,” Ms. Blackwell said. “We want the opportunity for change.” If the N.F.L. rejects the proposal, the complaints made by Davis and Ware would continue through due process. If the N.F.L. accepts it, there is still no guarantee that the meeting would be fruitful, or that it would greatly improve conditions for cheerleaders. “I understand that they could meet with us, patronize us and do nothing in the end,” Ms. Blackwell said. “I understand that risk.

2018,"Former Trump Tower in Azerbaijan, Dogged by Controversy, Is Engulfed by Fire","MOSCOW — A fire broke out on Saturday in a high-rise that until recently had been called Trump Tower in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, engulfing much of the building in flames by early evening. Footage on social media showed flames shooting out of the windows and smoke billowing from the 33-floor building, which is still under construction and had been labeled “Donald Trump’s Worst Deal” by The New Yorker magazine. The blaze, which broke out on the top floor of the building, burned down through about 20 stories before firefighters extinguished the flames by midafternoon, the news agency Interfax reported. The fire rekindled in the evening, burning through much of the building, a video posted by the Russian news portal Lenta.ru showed. The cause of the fire was not immediately clear. Azerbaijan’s Ministry of Emergency Situations did not release further information. The building was the second property linked to President Trump to catch fire this month, after a blaze broke out on the 50th floor of Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue in New York, killing an art collector. That building was built in the 1980s, before sprinklers were required in new residential towers in New York City. The Trump Organization withdrew its licensing agreement for the Baku skyscraper shortly after the 2016 election, as it promised to wind down international projects that could pose conflicts of interest to the president. Mr. Trump had partnered in the development with the son of a former minister of transportation in the oil-rich former Soviet state. The Trump-branded hotel never opened, but it was dogged by controversy. Mr. Trump cut the deal despite allegations by United States diplomats that the minister had dealings with front companies for the Iranian Revolutionary Guards and was corrupt. After the New Yorker article was published in 2017, Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, was among lawmakers who wrote to Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin; Attorney General Jeff Sessions; and James B. Comey, then director of the F.B.I., seeking an investigation into the issues raised in the article. The planned hotel had been under construction since 2008 and was nearing completion when Mr. Trump announced the licensing agreement six months before joining the presidential race in 2015. His partner was Anar Mammadov, the billionaire son of the country’s former minister of transportation, Ziya Mammadov. In a diplomatic cable leaked in 2009, American diplomats described the father as “notoriously corrupt, even for Azerbaijan.” The cable also accused the former minister of awarding highway construction projects to a onetime senior Iranian military official in the Revolutionary Guards. “We assume Mammadov is a silent partner in these contracts,” the diplomatic cable said. A lawyer for the Trump Organization told The Associated Press for an article published in June 2016 that the organization had been unaware of the corruption accusations and the Iranian links of the Mammadov family, but that it postponed the project that year for economic reasons. The Trump Organization pulled out of the deal that December and dropped a host of other overseas projects after the election.",The New York Times
2018,Former UBS Trader Is Cleared in ‘Spoofing’ Case,"A federal jury on Wednesday acquitted a former trader for the Swiss bank UBS of charges related to market manipulation, dealing a blow to a Justice Department effort to crack down on a Wall Street practice known as “spoofing.” Prosecutors accused the former trader, Andre Flotron, of trying to move market prices for precious metals by making offers on electronic trading systems to buy or sell gold, silver and other financial products and then quickly deleting those offers before anyone could accept them. But after only a few hours of deliberation, a jury in United States District Court in the District of Connecticut rejected their theory, according to Mr. Flotron’s lawyer Marc L. Mukasey. Mr. Flotron’s acquittal could spell trouble for similar cases brought by the United States government. In January, federal prosecutors filed criminal charges against seven other people for spoofing, among the first criminal charges brought for suspected financial crimes during the Trump administration. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission simultaneously brought civil cases against a number of the former traders, including Mr. Flotron. The traders’ behavior, a Justice Department official said at the time, reflected “a systemic problem.” The Connecticut jury decided otherwise. “It’s a huge setback for the government,” Mr. Mukasey said. “We basically smacked them in the face.” Mr. Mukasey said he planned to ask the trading commission to dismiss its civil case against Mr. Flotron. “While we are disappointed in the outcome, we respect the jury’s verdict,” a Justice Department spokeswoman said Wednesday. A UBS spokesman declined to comment. A spokeswoman for the commission did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",The New York Times
2018,Found Footage Offers a New Glimpse at 1906 San Francisco Earthquake,"Nine minutes of newly found footage, restored from an aging film reel that was revealed publicly this weekend, shows the aftermath of the earthquake that devastated San Francisco in 1906. On Saturday night, a small crowd filled a 120-seat theater in Fremont, Calif., to watch a movie unlike any other on the big screen, one that offers a fresh look at a tragic chapter in American history. The nine-minute silent film, much of it previously thought to be lost, shows the ruins left by the earthquake that ravaged San Francisco 112 years ago, according to David Kiehn, a film historian who helped to identify and restore the footage, which he said was originally shot by the pioneering Miles Brothers film studio in San Francisco. The rediscovered work is a fitting follow-up to the famous Miles Brothers production “A trip down Market Street before the fire,” which shows the bustling city just days before the earthquake, its inhabitants unaware of the disaster to come on April 18, 1906. “It’s quite a bookend to the earlier film where you see the activity down Market Street, only in a different light because everything is devastated,” Mr. Kiehn said. Less than a decade ago, his research revealed that the earlier Miles Brothers movie was recorded not in 1905, as was long believed, but just four days before the earthquake. The new footage, which he painstakingly digitized, was recorded just a few weeks later, he said. For the first five or so minutes, the newly found film takes viewers on a trip similar to the one in the earlier Miles Brothers production, Mr. Kiehn said. Unlike that movie, the camera in the new one occasionally pans from side to side to reveal the rubble lining Market Street, San Francisco’s main artery. Soon, the landmark Ferry Building comes into view, its scaffolding offering a clue to the date. A photograph marked April 22 shows no such support structure, while one dated May 3 shows more scaffolding than appears in the film, suggesting the recording was made sometime in between, Mr. Kiehn said. The movie then cuts to a different view of the Ferry Building site, panning back to Market Street, where wagons are lined up for passage across the bay. “You can even see a military guard with a bayoneted rifle standing post to control the crowds and there’s dozens and dozens of these wagons just waiting there,” Mr. Kiehn said. “You can see all the devastation in the background.” The latter portion of the film shows buildings being demolished with explosives. In a final scene, a crowd gathered to watch one such blast with the occasional bystander turning to look at the camera, which was still a novelty in 1906. That final stretch of the footage is tinted red, a kind of silent film special effect, Mr. Kiehn said. “In the early days, they would tint the film to kind of give a little color to the image,” he said. “Traditionally, red would be fire and night scenes would be tinted blue and they would have other colors to indicate some kind of mood.” The film’s recent journey from obscurity began about two years ago. Around that time, David F. Silver, a Bay Area dealer of antique and vintage cameras, met a man selling the reel, which was in particularly good condition and featured scenes that Mr. Silver didn’t recognize. After an inspection — and a brief panic when the seller held the highly flammable nitrate film perilously close to a light — Mr. Silver decided to buy it. “It’s the kind of treasure that I look for,” he said. But, distracted by other work, Mr. Silver ignored the film for about a year. After unspooling much of the film down a hallway at home for a more thorough look, he was still unable to identify it, so early last year he shared a post about it with a Facebook group dedicated to California history. One of the members of the group, Nick Wright, reached out to help and eventually connected Mr. Silver with his brother, Jason Wright, a dealer of antique photographs based in England, who agreed to buy the reel from Mr. Silver. “I was kind of secretly hoping it was going to be this long-lost Miles Brothers film, so I took a chance on it,” Mr. Wright said. If it was what he had hoped, he wanted to preserve the film, Mr. Wright said. So he contacted Mr. Kiehn, who was featured on a 2010 “60 Minutes” segment about the pre-earthquake film. After matching the footage to descriptions in a Miles Brothers advertisement from June 1906, Mr. Kiehn set about digitizing it, a process that took about 20 hours in all. To do so, he used a home-built machine to advance the film and photograph each frame with a digital camera. In all, the reel contained 8,665 frames, 16 for every second of footage, he said. The recovered film was shown publicly for the first time this weekend in three sold-out shows at the Edison Theater, a century-old venue restored by the Niles Essanay Silent Film Museum, where Mr. Kiehn is a film historian. The movie will be played again in early June at the 1,400-seat Castro Theater during the San Francisco Silent Film Festival. Mr. Wright said he plans to post at least some of the video online and will keep an archival copy for himself and share another with the Library of Congress. He wasn’t sure what he’ll do with reel itself, he said. “It’s been digitized, it’s been put down on safety film,” he said. “So I feel good that it’s been done. It’s been saved now.”",The New York Times

2018,Four Books Explore Various Aspects of Cities Past and Present,"The Shortlist EXTREME CITIES The Peril and Promise of Urban Life in the Age of Climate Change By Ashley Dawson 384 pp. Verso. $29.95. “Extreme Cities” examines the intersection of climate change and urbanization, and some of the challenges and contradictions involved. Dawson seems to be inspired by quasi-anarchist movements like Occupy Sandy. Yet to carry out the kinds of transformations he envisions, like the expropriation of fossil fuel assets, would require a very powerful government, even though he himself argues that moneyed interests have captured the state. Of particular value is Dawson’s discussion of the way climate change adaptation has been sabotaged, even hijacked, by real estate interests. Cities like Miami and New York continue to build luxury buildings on waterfront land that rising sea levels are expected to overrun. Even in developing world cities like Jakarta, projects billed as climate change mitigation, like constructing artificial barrier islands, are really gussied up luxury real estate boondoggles. Dawson can’t identify a clear path to the kinds of extreme reforms he advocates, but at least he puts subjects on the table that many want to avoid facing up to. For instance, rising sea levels are almost guaranteed to require painful retreats from coastal settlement. But it’s much sexier to talk about building green skyscrapers than it is to envision abandoning Miami Beach. The problem for writers like Dawson is that the future they foresee is so gloomy it promotes a fatalism that justifies inaction. CHICAGO ON THE MAKE Power and Inequality in a Modern City By Andrew J. Diamond 421 pp. University of California. $29.95. This book is as much polemic as analysis. Nevertheless it effectively details the long history of racial conflict and abuse that has led to Chicago becoming one of America’s most segregated cities. Diamond includes the standard story of restrictive covenants, blockbusting, freeway and public housing construction and other exclusionary techniques. He also covers Chicago’s tradition of violence, much of it coming from white ethnic street gangs and mobs that were engaged in an ultimately failed attempt to keep blacks out of their neighborhoods. Chicago was so hostile to blacks that Martin Luther King Jr. made little impact there. There’s such a wealth of material here that incidents meriting book-length treatment, like the Chicago police’s use of suffocation and electric torture to extract false confessions from black men, can garner only a page or two. Unfortunately, Diamond is too one-sided in his treatment of race, making excuses for black gangs and for the exploitative numbers rackets that plague black neighborhoods. Diamond also can’t convincingly explain why blacks have given overwhelming electoral support to the Democratic machine that has treated them so poorly. Just recently the neoliberal Rahm Emanuel won the black vote in his re-election over the progressive Chuy Garcia. Broader looks at Chicago’s civic and political cultures are needed to explain this, something Diamond’s focus can’t do. THE NEW LOCALISM How Cities Can Thrive in the Age of Populism By Bruce Katz and Jeremy Nowak 290 pp. Brookings. $25.99. They cite the example of Pittsburgh, which promoted the transition from steel to knowledge-economy specialties like robotics. Indianapolis is praised for its Central Indiana Corporate Partnership, an entity set up by business, university and foundation leaders to tackle economic development initiatives in a way that would transcend political boundaries and electoral cycles. And from Europe, Copenhagen’s City and Port Development Corporation is offered as a shining example of how to use municipal real estate assets to finance infrastructure, notably Copenhagen’s subway system. The challenge is that these solutions are of necessity particular to each city, requiring a careful assessment of local assets, politics, etc. And some level of leadership capability must already be in place to pull them off. Still, with the federal government missing in action, there’s little alternative to cities having to do the difficult and time-consuming work. Whether they can succeed in time to fend off populist insurgency remains an open question. THE MAN WITH THE SAWED-OFF LEG And Other Tales of a New York City Block By Daniel J. Wakin 205 pp. Arcade. $22.99. This book by an editor at The New York Times uses a mostly intact block of mansions on the Upper West Side of New York as a window into some of the city’s colorful history. The mansions, just around the corner from Wakin’s boyhood (and current) home, mostly managed to dodge being demolished for apartment buildings. And generally they remain very beautiful. It’s a testament to the vast riches of New York history that this handful of homes intersects with so many people of note. Duke Ellington once owned two of the buildings. Marion Davies, the mistress of William Randolph Hearst and the model for the character of the singer Susan Alexander in “Citizen Kane,” lived in one. So did Lothar W. Faber of the Eberhard Faber pencil company family, as well as the pioneering Japanese scientist Jokichi Takamine. Today’s occupants include the Catholic order Opus Dei, a frequent focus of conspiracy theories, and a Buddhist center. Much of the book’s action is only tangentially related to the homes, however, especially the armored car heist that forms the book’s spine. This caper actually took place in Brooklyn, with an Upper West Side mansion featuring as the site of a gruesome postrobbery amputation during a time when one of its seedier owners lived there. The history of New York is so vast that it lends itself to volumes of extreme length. This slim book is a welcome breezy complement to those encyclopedic accounts.",The New York Times
2018,"Four Geniuses, Gone to AIDS, as They Might Be Today","The epidemic didn’t just deprive us of millions of lives — it deprived us of decades of potential masterpieces of fashion, art, design, theater and dance. Here, we imagine Keith Haring, Tina Chow, Alvin Ailey and Perry Ellis as they might have been. Most of the people we revere in the arts would be unknown if they’d died before 40. I was just thinking of Allen Barnett, who lived to publish one book of stories, 1990’s “The Body and Its Dangers,” before dying of AIDS a year later at 36. I recall talking to him in the late ’80s, and he was so angry that he had to die. And no wonder! His book had been excerpted in The New Yorker, and everyone expected great things. Now he’s nearly forgotten, along with all the other geniuses who found their start — and their end — in Manhattan in the early ’80s. I remember 1981 in Larry Kramer’s living room, when the dermatologist Alvin Friedman-Kien told us for the first time about AIDS and added: “I would stop having sex if I were you guys.” We were incensed: Like most gays (and many straights), to us political liberation meant the freedom to be promiscuous. We still had wounds from the ’60s, when New York would close a gay bar as soon as it opened; 1969’s Stonewall uprising was, after all, sparked by the cops shuttering a Greenwich Village dance bar. In that pre-internet era, bars were the main places where gays met each other. The idea that we were being asked to give up sex altogether because of some mysterious new disease, which would undoubtedly be cured right away, outraged us. But the disease wasn’t brought under control until 1996. During that period, thousands of painters, writers, dancers, actors, directors and other artists suffered and died — the ones who were the most daring, both aesthetically and sexually. Of course there were many sick non-gay people: Haitians, American blacks, a high percentage of women. But generally it was the timid who survived, those who stayed at home during those incredibly creative years. As soon as a test existed, in 1985, I was tested. Like many people, I had been living with H.I.V. for years without knowing it — no one did. (Though, unbeknownst to me back then, I belonged to a tiny percentage of “slow progressors,” people whose T-cell count keeps dropping, but so slowly they seldom move into the danger zone.) Those of us who were positive quickly developed an entirely new way of thinking about time. We wanted to act as if everything was normal so we could fully enjoy what was left of daily life; at the same time, most experiences seemed unbearably trivial. How could you set out a picnic while time’s winged chariot was bearing down on you? I just stayed in bed for months, though many artists rushed to finish their life’s work, like the great French writer and photographer Hervé Guibert, who said to me, “I want to write all the books I might have written in a long life, even if I have to do them badly.” He left behind 35 titles when he died in 1991. Or take Paul Monette, who wasted his days writing silly “novelizations” of movies until his partner died, then turned his attention to his brilliant memoirs, “Borrowed Time: An AIDS Memoir” and “Becoming a Man: Half a Life Story,” before dying at 49 in 1995. Love and death had handed him the most important themes there are. I recently learned that the Latin word “holocaustum” means a “burnt offering to the gods.” For 15 years in New York, starting in 1981, the gods were indeed very greedy. And as Fran Lebowitz once pointed out, AIDS not only decimated practitioners of the arts, it also destroyed a whole generation of its most dedicated consumers. We are grateful to the families and foundations of Alvin Ailey, Tina Chow, Perry Ellis and Keith Haring for their gracious support of this story. I was just a baby when he died, but everyone says my father was a ray of light. The fact that he asked my mother to share a child with him — which wasn’t done very much at the time — was a sign of who he was. She was a writer, already in her early 40s, in the television business, very far from the fashion world. But she had a tomboyish, Annie Hall fashion sense; she used to wear some of his suits. He thought she was one of the most beautiful women he had ever seen. In college I studied television, but it wasn’t me. Afterward, I interned for Michael Kors, and it clicked. As an accessories designer, I’m inspired by how classic my father was, how he elevated the casual with these meticulous details and made things that even today don’t seem dated. I watch the videos of his runway shows, and the models are skipping down the runway. It was all very bright; what I think about most was how full of joy he was. — Tyler Ellis, accessories designer and Ellis’s daughter I first saw Perry one summer on the ferry to the Fire Island Pines. He was so striking, leaning against the boat’s rail. He was from the South, but his face was, to me, the perfect New England face, with that hair flowing. The thing that always distinguished him was his pure Americanness; he looked so clean and open. Yet he was very mysterious and quiet, a completely romantic character. Physically, he was someone who embodied the clothes he designed. It wasn’t a costume or a fantasy. When he got sick, he was discreet about it. But he was discreet about everything. He didn’t want people to know he had AIDS, and frankly, we didn’t want to know either. We didn’t want to acknowledge that people were dying. We had come out of a decade that invented freedom, and we never imagined there would be a bill at the end of the meal. — Diane von Furstenberg, fashion designer Even before she married [restaurateur] Michael Chow, everyone was taken with her. She was so light! That’s the word that distinguished her: Whether she was with Yves Saint Laurent or Jean-Michel Basquiat, she was the same person. At Mr. Chow, she would treat people as guests in her home. Every night was such theater, and she worked, nonstop, 24 hours a day. Her sense of style was always there. When we were girls and Twiggy came out, she wanted me to cut her hair, but I wouldn’t do it, so she did it herself, really badly. In New York, she just went to a barbershop. Even though she loved vintage couture — Fortuny and everything — there was a very pared-down person in there. She would lock into a certain look: my father’s cardigan, a Hanes T-shirt and these Kenzo pants she had copied a million times. She’d take bunches of silk corsages and pin them on her shoulder. Everyone might have wanted to copy her style, but her bravery and warmth were all her own. Tina was singular. — Adelle Lutz, actress and Chow’s sister As a teenager, Keith bought art supplies with his own money and took them to entertain kids in an inner-city neighborhood not far from our house in Pennsylvania. I was 12 years younger than him, but I can remember how energetic and committed he was to being an activist as well as an artist: In 1982, a few months before he had his first solo show at Tony Shafrazi’s gallery, he went to a nuclear disarmament rally in Central Park and distributed 20,000 posters. He didn’t have much money at that point, but somehow he got the posters made, and he had friends lug the boxes uptown and roll posters all day. He was always obsessed with giving things away. People may not have known they met him, they just knew that that skinny guy who did drawings in the subway handed them a button. Over the years, I have met many people who swore they were close with him, and at first I suspected they were exaggerating their relationship with Keith, but then I realized that even people who had very casual contact with him felt immediately connected. — Kristen Haring, historian and Haring’s sister I met Keith at the School of Visual Arts in 1978, when I heard Devo music in the hall and walked until I found him painted into the corner of his room, having covered the walls, ceiling and floor to the beat. Around 1981, we moved together to a little apartment building near Times Square, which was quite dangerous at the time; we’d walk over to the subway where he would do the work that made him famous. He was so much fun — I think people forget that. He used to paint one stroke at a time to the rhythm of whatever he was listening to. But he also used to talk about how he knew he was going to die young. I didn’t believe this at the time, but he seemed to understand it. I’m glad Keith got to see success in his lifetime, because he did quite well while he was alive. Everyone knew his work, and they still do. — Kenny Scharf, artist The head of his school, Denise Jefferson, would ask up-and-coming young choreographers like me to come and work with his students. And when I was at UCLA, in the early ’80s, he invited me to see him at the Del Capri hotel, which was straight out of the ’50s: kidney-shaped pools, bungalows where his dancers stayed. But while everyone was out by the pool, he was alone in a big suite, and I came to understand his loneliness: He did not have a partner. He wanted to share a new piece about Jim Morrison which he said had “a little Bill T. Jones in there,” but I could not for the life of me tell which part reminded him of my style. Yet, in that moment, I realized how caring he was: He saw me as part of his lineage, and I think he was breathing a sigh of relief, that there was someone coming along who was not trying to be Mr. Ailey. — Bill T. Jones, choreographer The first time I laid eyes on him was when the company performed in Philadelphia: Can you imagine him dancing in “Wade in the Water” [Ailey’s legendary 1960 piece]? And then, you saw them afterwards, loading their costumes into wicker baskets to move to the next city. It was so difficult at the beginning. They did everything themselves. Everyone talks about diversity now; he cared about inclusion while keeping the company predominantly African-American. To him, this was entwined with the Civil Rights movement. But as long as you could really dance — as long as you were truly special — he didn’t care what color you were. The happiest I ever saw him, I mean, just truly happy, was when 10 of us went to the World Festival of Negro Arts in Dakar in 1966. Duke Ellington was there, and so were Katherine Dunham and Langston Hughes. It was intense — when you do something like that in Senegal, it isn’t going to be like a gala in New York — but it was magical. At the very end, when we were boarding the plane on its outside steps, he turned back and chuckled. There has never been a smile like that. — Judith Jamison, artistic director emerita of Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater I wanted the photographer Anthony Goicolea to shoot this story, so I met with him to discuss an idea by Hanya Yanagihara, T’s editor in chief, to depict Keith Haring, Alvin Ailey, Perry Ellis and Tina Chow as if they were still alive: Above all, this project was meant to celebrate these creative legends and address the cultural void their deaths — and those of so many others with AIDS-related illnesses — left. Anthony, who is 46, told me that when he was a younger artist in New York he felt that he was “missing this whole group of people who, if they hadn’t died, would have been mentors.” He still feels this today. Then I started talking to Regina Harris, who had done hair and makeup for three of Matthew Barney’s “Cremaster” films. She found three of the models (a casting agent scouted the fourth), people she encountered in daily life who had the right face shape and looked the appropriate age. Our stylist, Haidee Findlay-Levin, brought some scarves that were similar to ones worn by Ailey and went to visit Patricia Von Musulin, whose jewelry Tina Chow had often worn. Honestly, I’d been conflicted about the assignment. I kept wondering what these figures’ families and friends might think: Would they feel violated, offended, sad or that it was in bad taste? But our two days on set were so quiet and serious and respectful, with everyone sharing the responsibility of honoring these artists’ legacies. Anthony cared so much about doing work that felt meaningful, and about making art that would speak to the culture, rather than merely trying to shock. I think he did just that. — Nadia Vellam, T’s photography and video director Read more:Those We Lost to the AIDS Epidemic",The New York Times
2018,"Four Killed in Gaza, as Weekly Protests Shrink","JERUSALEM — They came in smaller numbers. But the outcome was still deadly, and the victims this time included a 15-year-old boy. Palestinians protested for a fourth Friday along the security fence dividing Gaza from Israel, some of them burning tires, hurling rocks or flying kites with flaming tails in the hope of setting ablaze the fields of Israeli rural communities on the other side. The Israeli military distributed a photograph of one kite with a scrawled swastika. The military estimated the number of participants at about 3,000 in five locations along the Gaza border, down from at least 30,000 on March 30, when the protest campaign started. But by evening the Gaza Health Ministry reported four killed by Israeli sniper fire. One was identified as Muhammad Ayoub, 15. Amateur video taken on the Gaza side of the fence purported to show him shot while running with other youths, apparently empty-handed. Graphic photographs showed the teenager lying on the rocky ground, bleeding from the head, and later on a hospital gurney. His father, Ibrahim Ayoub, told a local Gaza-based news site: “I thank Allah for taking him as a martyr. This is better than the humiliating life and tragedy we live.” A fence that divides Israel and Gaza has become the latest flashpoint in the decades-old conflict, with Israeli soldiers unleashing lethal force against mostly unarmed Arab protesters. The Friday toll brought the total number of fatalities from the start of the campaign to at least 37. Hundreds more protesters have been wounded by Israeli fire. Israel has drawn international censure for using live fire against the mostly unarmed protesters who did not appear to present any immediately life-threatening danger to the soldiers. On Friday, Nickolay E. Mladenov, the United Nations special coordinator for the long-stalled Israeli-Palestinian peace process, denounced the shooting of the 15-year-old as “outrageous,” writing on Twitter: “How does the killing of a child in #Gaza today help #peace? It doesn’t! It fuels anger and breeds more killing.” He called for an investigation into the killing. Even as the numbers of protesters waned, the international campaign supporting the Palestinians received a boost this week when Natalie Portman, the Oscar-winning actress, backed out of a major award ceremony meant to honor her in Jerusalem. Representatives initially cited her distress over “recent events” in Israel. On Friday, Ms. Portman issued a statement explaining her absence, saying, “I did not want to appear as endorsing Benjamin Netanyahu.” Israel’s military says it is acting to prevent any mass crossing of the fence and to prevent attacks against Israeli soldiers and nearby communities. The military said it was looking into the reports of the fatalities. On Friday, the Israeli military said in a statement that people participating in what it described as riots were “attempting to approach the security infrastructures,” burning tires and trying to fly kites over the border with burning items attached to them. Several crossed into Israel, the statement said, and “were extinguished when required.” The military added that it would “not allow any harm to security infrastructure that protects Israeli civilians, and will act against the violent rioters and terrorists who threaten either.” The troops responded with tear gas and live fire. As in previous weeks, no injuries were reported on the Israeli side. The protests began as a grass-roots campaign but were quickly adopted by Hamas, the Islamist militant group that controls Gaza. They are meant to draw international attention to the 11-year blockade imposed by Israel and Egypt on the isolated, impoverished coastal territory. The protests also are meant to punctuate Palestinian demands for the return to lands in what is now Israel. The organizers of the protests, named the Great Return March, originally said the idea had been for a peaceful, family-style six-week sit-in at tent encampments erected about 700 yards from the fence, with weekly marches building up to a peak on May 15. That is when Palestinians mark the Nakba, or the catastrophe, of the foundation of Israel and the war surrounding its creation in 1948, during which hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were expelled from their homes in what is now Israel. Many of the refugees ended up in Gaza. Israel says the campaign has been taken over by Hamas, which Israel, like much of the Western world, classifies as a terrorist organization. In leaflets dropped from the air on Friday the military warned protesters, in Arabic, to stay away from the fence, and told them to ignore instructions from Hamas, which Israel says is exploiting the protesters for its own political interests. While a few confronted the troops, most of the protesters stood by, watching. One protester, Abdallah Daoud, 16, explained why he was participating. With his face black with soot from the burning tires and slingshot in hand, he said: “There is no money, there is nothing. I want to be a martyr because of the siege,” a reference to the blockade. “I cannot get out of Gaza. There is no income.” In a new tactic, protesters including whole families in the Shejaiya area of eastern Gaza moved tents forward to about 300 yards from the fence, considered the edge of the danger zone. Some Shejaiya protesters built a cage, like a mock prison cell, containing effigies of two Israeli soldiers whose bodies are being held by Hamas in Gaza, and two Israeli citizens also believed held by Hamas there. The entrance to the Shejaiya protest site included a large poster with pictures and names of those killed during the first three Fridays. During a visit to the protest area, Ismail Haniya, the political leader of the Hamas organization, said: “Be ready and prepared for the human flood on all the borders of Palestine inside and outside the occupied lands on the anniversary of the Nakba.” Islamic Jihad, an extremist group that often rivals Hamas in Gaza, went further, releasing a video on Thursday showing Israeli officers, including a senior general, in its sights as they toured the Israeli side of the fence. Avigdor Lieberman, Israel’s hard-line defense minister, visited the Gaza border area on Friday. “What we have seen in these four weeks is that every week there are less and less people on the one hand,” he said, “and on the other hand, there is much more terror activity.” He warned, “Whoever makes threats will lose in the end.”",The New York Times
2018,Four Masked Burglars Steal Jade and Gold Artifacts From Museum in England,"LONDON — The British police are seeking clues to a burglary at a museum in Bath, in southwest England, this week in which four masked thieves made off with precious artifacts including a jade figure of a monkey holding a peach from the Yuan or early Ming dynasty. The Avon and Somerset Police said witnesses reported seeing the thieves breaking a first-floor window about 1:20 a.m. on Tuesday at the Museum of East Asian Art, which bills itself as the only museum in the United Kingdom “solely dedicated to the arts and cultures of East and South East Asia.” The burglars then smashed display cabinets and removed numerous items, according to a police statement. Among the items stolen in addition to the jade monkey: • A carving of jade mandarin ducks with lotus flowers. • An inlaid wooden box. • A soapstone figure of the Han dynasty scholar Dongfang Shuo. • A set of 14 gold belt plaques. • A Jizhou stoneware vase. The police have not put a price on the haul, saying that the items vary in monetary value but that their “cultural significance is priceless.” The police said the thieves fled in a dark sport utility vehicle. Officers have seized a white Ford van that was stolen and left at the scene. The police have appealed to the public for information to solve the crime, and are scouring CCTV footage for clues. Detective Sgt. Matthew Reed said in a statement, “Due to the items stolen and the speed of the burglary, we suspect this to be a targeted attack with the artifacts possibly stolen to order.” Nicole Chiang, the museum’s curator, said in a statement: “We are deeply shocked and saddened by the burglary as we are preparing for our 25th anniversary celebrations. Not only do the stolen objects have significant historical and cultural value, they also hold irreplaceable emotional value for our founder.” The museum was founded by Brian McElney, a former lawyer who lived in Hong Kong for many years, and whose own collection of East Asian art formed the initial basis of its holdings. The museum — which boasts a collection representing more than 7,000 years — will remain closed for the next few weeks while employees take an inventory. The next exhibition is planned for May 5: “A Quest for Wellness: Contemporary Chinese Art by Zhang Yanzi.” The break-in follows an attempted burglary at the same museum six years ago, when three men tried to steal items during opening hours, according to local news outlets. Nothing was stolen then, and the would-be burglars fled before the police arrived.",The New York Times
2018,"Fran Bera, Competitive, Record-Breaking Aviator, Is Dead at 93","Fran Bera’s fascination with flight began when she took an airplane-themed carnival ride as a young girl in Michigan in the 1930s. As a teenager she hitchhiked more than 30 miles to an airfield, where she worked odd jobs and saved for flight lessons. She earned her pilot’s license at 16, and by 24, the youngest allowable age, she became a designated examiner, allowed to certify new pilots. Ms. Bera went on to win more than a dozen air races. She set an unbroken National Aeronautic Association record for highest altitude attained in a twin-engine Piper Aztec, pushing that plane to an altitude better suited for a jet. And, she said, she once flew a small plane from California to Siberia on a whim. Ms. Bera also oversaw more than 3,000 check rides, or licensing examinations, for new pilots, and in the 1980s stopped counting her flight hours after she had accumulated 25,000. Leslie Day, a friend who hangared her plane near Ms. Bera’s at Gillespie Field in El Cajon, Calif., outside San Diego, estimated in an interview that Ms. Bera had spent the equivalent of more than three years in the pilot’s seat. Ms. Bera last flew her white Piper Comanche 260 (decorated with pink and magenta stripes and the phrase “Kick Ass” stenciled on the fuselage) in January 2016, when she was 91. She stopped flying when chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, arthritis and other health problems made clambering into the cockpit — getting to it by first climbing onto her plane’s right wing — too arduous. Ms. Bera died on Feb. 10 at her home in San Diego after having a stroke, Ms. Day said. She was 93. Her death was not widely reported at the time. She and Ms. Day were members together of the San Diego chapter of the Ninety Nines, an international group of female pilots whose first president was Amelia Earhart. (Ms. Day remains a member.) Ms. Bera was a consummate aviator, licensed to fly propeller and jet planes, helicopters and hot air balloons. She worked as a flight instructor, sold airplanes for Beechcraft and Piper and was a test pilot; in the 1960s, she flew an experimental helicopter with no tail rotor. Female pilots were unusual when Ms. Bera started flying, in the 1940s, but breaking aviation boundaries came naturally for her. “She said, ‘It wasn’t that I was a women’s libber, it’s that this is what I love to do and it’s my calling,’ ” Ms. Day said. At first glance, Ms. Bera did not necessarily fit the conventional image of a dashing pilot: She stood under 5 feet tall and often flew wearing a dress. But she was fearless and, when racing, highly competitive. “There’s different lines on the airspeed indicator,” Ms. Day said. “You want to be in the green line; yellow line, you’re pushing it, and red line is where you don’t want to be. And she would always joke that she would always red-line her engine.” Ms. Bera’s penchant for speeding contributed to seven wins, most of them during the 1950s, in the All Woman Transcontinental Air Race, better known as the Powder Puff Derby; and seven wins, most of them in the 21st century, in the Palms to Pines All Women’s Air Race, in which participants flew from Santa Monica, Calif., to central Oregon. In another race, from London to Victoria, British Columbia, in the early 1970s, Ms. Bera and her co-pilot rushed to refuel in Glasgow and get back in the air. “It was so fast, my girlfriend accidentally popped her Mae West,” Ms. Bera told The San Diego Union-Tribune in 2007, using World War II slang for an inflatable life jacket. “She flew across the Atlantic with it inflated. It was terrible.” Ms. Bera set her altitude record in 1966, climbing to 40,154 feet — so high that she needed to use bottled oxygen in the perilously thin atmosphere. In 1993, she flew her Piper 235 Cherokee from California to Siberia “just for the fun of it,” she told The Lakewood News of Lake Odessa, Mich., a local newspaper based near her hometown. Soon afterward she decided to upgrade to her swifter Comanche, explaining, “I’m getting older, I need to get places faster.” She was born Frances Sebastian to Elizabeth and Fred Sebastian, Hungarian immigrant farmers, on Dec. 7, 1924, in Mulliken, Mich. The youngest of eight children, she developed a passion for flying as a girl; she would sneak off to study aviation and take flight lessons without mentioning any of it to her parents. They learned about her flying, she said, when she needed their written permission to fly solo at 16. After graduating from high school in Lake Odessa, Mich., she sought to join the Women’s Airforce Service Pilots, a unit, known as the Wasps, that flew military aircraft on noncombat missions during World War II. But she was rejected because of her height. She became an adept parachutist, however, and after the war, when the military began selling off surplus aircraft, she flew planes to buyers around the country. She also got a job as a flight school instructor near Grand Rapids, Mich., and, in 1947, married Gordon Bera, the school’s owner. They moved to Santa Monica in 1951. Though the marriage ended in divorce later that decade, Ms. Bera kept his surname even after remarrying twice. Eudene McLin, her husband of nearly 50 years, died in 2016. She is survived by a stepdaughter, Jackie Bera; and a sister, Edna Baldwin. Ms. Bera received numerous honors for her aerial feats, including a spot on the Smithsonian National Air & Space Museum’s Wall of Honor, a Wright Brothers Master Pilot Award from the Federal Aviation Administration and an Elder Statesman Award from the National Aeronautic Association. But she said that the most gratifying part of her long career was still the sensation of being airborne. “It still fascinates me after 65 years of flying,” she said in 2007. “And I’m still learning.” An earlier version of this obituary referred incorrectly to the Piper Aztec plane that Ms. Bera flew when she broke an altitude record. The Piper Aztec she used had two piston engines; not turboprops.",The New York Times
2018,"France, Boracay, North Korea: Your Thursday Briefing","Asia and Australia Edition (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. A Philippine island closes down for cleanup, “le bromance” is tested and Apu of “The Simpsons” may lose his voice. Here’s what you need to know: • The leaders of North and South Korea will meet tomorrow in an almost inconceivable moment of face-to-face diplomacy after 70 years of bitter rivalry. There will be a lot on the table when Kim Jong-un, the North’s supreme leader, meets President Moon Jae-in at Panmunjom, the so-called truce village, including issues that have bedeviled the Korean Peninsula for much of the 20th century. Our veteran correspondent explains. Amid hurried preparations, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan has been working overtime to make sure his country is not forgotten by its allies. (Tokyo even demanded that the South rethink a mango mousse it plans to serve that features a map with islands claimed by Japan.) Former President Jimmy Carter, one of the few Americans to have gone to North Korea, also weighed in. _____ • France and the U.S. will “make this planet great again.” That’s what the French president, Emmanuel Macron, told Congress, even as he argued that the U.S. should remain a part of both the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris climate accord. Mr. Macron’s criticism of his host’s policies contrasted sharply with “le bromance” with President Trump, which continued at the Trumps’ first state dinner. (The body language of the two leaders — holding hands, kissing cheeks — was much discussed, but so was Melania Trump’s white hat and Chanel dress.) Separately, Mr. Trump’s travel ban may survive. After arguments at the Supreme Court, it was hard to identify enough justices ready to strike it down. _____ • “I think Harry will be disappointed.” Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull expressed disappointment that Adm. Harry Harris, above, would be posted as the U.S. ambassador to South Korea instead of Australia. Mr. Turnbull said he had known about the cancellation for “some time.” (He said he would not respond to suggestions by former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd that the switch made Australia look like a “second-class ally.”) Admiral Harris is the commander of U.S. forces in the Pacific. He oversees about 375,000 military and civilian personnel. _____ • In the Philippines, a cleanup or an invasion? Tourists will be barred from the central Philippine island of Boracay for six months, starting today, as President Rodrigo Duterte vows to clean up what he calls an environmental “cesspool.” Mr. Duterte ordered Boracay to be closed this month, saying that the water “smells” and that it poses a danger to people’s health. But residents fear that the island will be militarized and that its tourism industry, which brought in more than $1 billion last year, may never recover. _____ • Bangladesh struggles to move on from the Rana Plaza disaster. This week was the fifth anniversary of the deadliest garment industry accident in modern history: More than 1,100 people were killed in a horrific building collapse and more than 2,500 were injured. At the time, hundreds of factories were shuttered, and today the land where Rana Plaza once stood is overgrown with weeds. But as the garment industry returns to business as usual, critics say that the jailing of labor leaders and the expiration of safeguards show that little has been learned. • Chinese tech companies are hiring female “motivators” to help overworked male coders relieve stress through conversation, activities — and massages. • Takeda, a Japanese drugmaker, reached a tentative agreement to buy Ireland-based Shire for $64 billion, in one of the biggest pharma deals to date. • Kobe Steel’s shares fell sharply as the Japanese authorities investigate the company’s data falsification scandal. • Foreign auto executives at China’s annual auto show this week said Beijing’s plan to open its car market will change little, and is unlikely to avert a trade war with Washington. • U.S. stocks were mixed.

Donald and Ivana Trump were among the first guests — but they arrived early in the night. It would be hours before it turned into a hedonistic dance party of epic proportions. “All of us knew that night that we weren’t at the opening of a discothèque but the opening of something historical,” said Robin Leach, who went on to host “Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous.” His comments were included in the book “The Last Party: Studio 54, Disco, and the Culture of the Night,” by Anthony Haden-Guest. The owners of Studio 54, Steve Rubell and Ian Schrager, came to be known as the “first pashas of disco.” Above, Mr. Rubell, Liza Minnelli, Bianca Jagger and Mr. Warhol at the first anniversary party.

2018,Freddie Mac Examines Loan to Possible Rent-to-Own Housing Provider,"Freddie Mac, the huge government housing-finance company, is reviewing whether it inadvertently lent support to a company that specializes in a type of rent-to-own program that critics call predatory. Freddie Mac said it was examining a loan it effectively guaranteed under a pilot program meant to bolster the market for affordable single-family rental homes. The review began after a housing advocacy group filed a lawsuit on April 12 in federal court, contending that an Indianapolis investor group was selling rundown homes through a rent-to-own arrangement that’s prohibited by the program. Chris Spina, a spokesman for Freddie, said the company “is reviewing the transactions referenced in the complaint” by the Fair Housing Center of Central Indiana against an investor group operating under the name Casas Baratas Aqui — or “Cheap Homes Here” in Spanish. The lawsuit alleges that the group has violated the federal Fair Housing Act by targeting Latino buyers. As part of its lawsuit, the housing advocacy organization said Casas Baratas Aqui had acquired nearly 1,000 formerly foreclosed homes and recently began selling some of those houses in rent-to-own transactions. The lawsuit references two homes that were part of the Freddie deal. The investor group received a roughly $13 million loan that was one of dozens included in the $161 million bond issued by CoreVest Finance. Freddie provided a financial guarantee that protects investors against the risk that the bond defaults. Freddie is providing that guarantee as part of a program it announced last year. The intention is to make it easier and cheaper for investors to get the money they need to buy homes that they can then rent out on affordable terms. The loans in this particular bond involved more than 2,000 homes in multiple states. But the pilot program specifically excluded loans to investors that engage in rent-to-own or contract-for-deed arrangements. The finance firms that made the loans were supposed to vet the landlords to make sure they were not seeking to sell homes through either of those structures. Rent-to-own and contract-for-deed deals have drawn criticism from housing advocates and regulators because they often lack basic consumer protections. The homes often need major repairs, and the long-term financing deals carry high interest rates. Evictions are common. The 2008 financial crisis created a boom in such products. There was a ready supply of cheap foreclosed homes for investors to buy and a large population of consumers unable to get traditional mortgages. Officials in Ohio, Wisconsin and New York have cracked down on investment firms that peddle rundown homes in such deals. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau also opened an investigation. Neither Freddie nor CoreVest, which specializes in providing loans to investors in single-family homes, were named as defendants in the lawsuit by the Fair Housing Center of Central Indiana. A spokesman for CoreVest, previously known as Colony American Finance, declined to comment. Representatives for Casas Baratas Aqui did not return requests for comment. Fannie Mae, another government-controlled mortgage finance firm, last year instructed firms selling its foreclosed homes to make sure that investors buying those homes were not seeking to resell them through either a contract-for-deed or a rent-to-own deal. Fannie imposed the restrictions after The New York Times revealed in a series of articles that at least 17,000 homes had been sold by Fannie to firms selling homes in either of those arrangements.",The New York Times
2018,"Free of New York’s Stinky Sludge Train, an Alabama Town Is Still Steaming","No town ever wants a “poop train” nearby, and should that fate befall your town, you would not want to see a news article describing it as a saga. But after a train full of human excrement sludge from New York City traveled to Alabama, only to be bureaucratically stuck outside the 1,000-person town of Parrish for more than two months, engulfing the town with a suffocating stench — yeah, that was a saga. And now at long last, the saga is over. The odor, however, is lingering. “It smells like rotting animals, or a dead carcass. It seems like there’s a dead animal nearby,” Mayor Heather Hall of Parrish said Thursday. “And it’s not like you just get a whiff of it where it’s just a subtle smell. It is so overpowering you cannot go outside.” On Wednesday, Mayor Hall announced that she had “wonderful news”: The last of the sludge had been removed, and the town was free at last from the 42-car train with the awful nickname. The foul odor had been difficult to avoid, permeating all two square miles of the town, about 40 miles northwest of Birmingham, she said. It was especially horrid in the early evening, but you could smell it throughout the day. Little League baseball games were canceled, and you could forget about enjoying the nice weather on the front porch. Turning on the air-conditioning would just bring the smell inside. A federal ban forbids New York from disposing of its treated sewage waste in the ocean. So the city routinely ships it to the South, where landfills can offer better bargains. A nearby one, Big Sky, had accepted the city’s sludge since 2017, according to The Associated Press. But West Jefferson, a town near the landfill, was fed up with the smell as the loads were transferred from trains to trucks. The town got an injunction to stop the trains in January, at which point the train in question was parked in Parrish. Parrish was not happy. Last week, the town’s council issued an ultimatum, saying it would file a lawsuit and injunction against Big Sky if the rail cars weren’t removed by April 23, according to the Daily Mountain Eagle, a local newspaper. Big Sky did not return phone calls seeking comment on Thursday. The ordeal came to an end as trucks hauled the contents off to the Big Sky landfill in Adamsville, about 20 miles to the west. Ms. Hall said there were more than 10 million pounds of the material in almost 400 containers. Ms. Hall said the town did not have zoning laws to prevent such a train’s presence because officials never thought they would be necessary. That’s an oversight she said they hoped to fix. For the time being, the town denied Big Sky’s business license “so it’s illegal for them to do business in Parrish.” She wasn’t thrilled by the common nickname for the train in news stories, which she said brought the cutesy emoji to mind. Rest assured, she said, this was a serious quality-of-life issue for residents. “It does disrupt life,” she said. “It’s just not a good thing to have in a populated area. There needs to be a better way to handle this material and to dispose of this material.”",The New York Times
2018,"Freeman Dyson’s Life, Through His Letters","Nonfiction When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. MAKER OF PATTERNS An Autobiography Through Letters By Freeman Dyson 400 pp. Liveright. $27.95. As a reader, I was enthralled by this collection of Freeman Dyson’s letters. But as a biographer, I am most annoyed with him for having squirreled all these missives away. Long ago, this now 94-year-old physicist should have shared these nuggets of history. Specifically, back in the 1980s, when my co-author Martin J. Sherwin was interviewing sources for our 2005 biography of J. Robert Oppenheimer, Dyson kept mum about his treasure trove. This was rather miserly of him, for Dyson knew full well the value of these letters, written to his parents from 1941 through the late 1970s. He knew, because in 1968, after reading “The Double Helix,” James Watson’s account of his discovery with Francis Crick of the peculiar structure of DNA molecules — really, the secret of life — Dyson had asked Watson how he had been able to tell the human drama of the story, “with verbatim accounts of their conversations, stumbling and squabbling as they grope their way toward the truth.” The answer, of course, was that Watson had written letters each week to his mother, who fortunately had saved the correspondence. Dyson wrote his mother that same day, instructing her to preserve his own missives. Clearly, even then the quantum physicist harbored literary ambitions. As an 18-year-old, Dyson had once asked his Cambridge mathematics professor, Godfrey Hardy, then aged 65, why he was writing books instead of working with numbers. “Young men should prove theorems,” Hardy replied. “Old men should write books.” Born an Englishman in 1923, Dyson worked for the Royal Air Force’s Bomber Command during World War II, but in 1947 he moved to Cornell University to study physics under Hans Bethe. He never earned his doctoral degree, but soon found himself at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., where he flourished. The institute’s director, Oppenheimer, was so impressed by Dyson’s work on quantum electrodynamics that in 1953 he offered the 30-year-old physicist a rare lifetime appointment. Dyson became an American citizen in 1957 — and has lived in Princeton for well over half a century. He knew Albert Einstein, Richard Feynman, Julian Schwinger and, well, just about anyone worth knowing in the scientific universe of the last six decades. But he is also no doubt today one of the world’s best-known theoretical physicists precisely because, like Oppenheimer, he has always been a polymath, a literary man of science who could explain the physical world to us in plain old English. Always a scientist-rebel, Dyson has been unafraid to wade into controversy, whether it be his reservations about climate change or his forays into the debates over nuclear weapons. “Maker of Patterns” is not autobiography. That would require something more than just the long letters reproduced here, occasionally annotated with italicized commentary. But these letters will delight any reader with their often contrarian observations. Dyson is an excellent witness, an acute observer of personality and human foibles. This volume should make any reader pine for a deep memoir. Dyson has published more than a dozen books, and while his 1979 book, “Disturbing the Universe,” contains reminiscences, it is more philosophical than autobiographical. Readers who desire a full biography could turn to Phillip F. Schewe’s 2013 “Maverick Genius: The Pioneering Odyssey of Freeman Dyson.” Dyson’s letters are particularly engaging when they describe the occasional flashes of illumination that lead to a scientific insight. Riding on a cross-continental Greyhound bus, past Iowa cornfields, Dyson notes: “On the third day of the journey a remarkable thing happened; going into a sort of semi-stupor as one does after 48 hours of bus riding, I began to think very hard about physics, and particularly about the rival radiation theories of Schwinger and Feynman. Gradually my thoughts grew more coherent, and before I knew where I was, I had solved the problem that had been in the back of my mind all this year, which was to prove the equivalence of the two theories. … This piece of work is neither difficult nor particularly clever, but it is undeniably important.” Dyson was chiefly pleased that once back in Princeton, he would “now encounter Oppenheimer with something to say which will interest him.” Dyson is fascinated by Oppenheimer: “I have been observing rather carefully his behavior during seminars. If one is saying, for the benefit of the rest of the audience, things that he knows already, he cannot resist hurrying one on to something else; then when one says things that he doesn’t know or immediately agree with, he breaks in before the point is fully explained with acute and sometimes devastating criticisms, to which it is impossible to reply adequately even when he is wrong.” Dyson thought this “impatience” demonstrated by “Oppy” was beyond his control, and in any case, “To me, the interruptions provided many valuable new ideas.” The letters are also sometimes painfully candid and close to home. In early 1957, Dyson writes his parents from Aspen, Colo., where he has gone on vacation with his mathematician wife, Verena — and he has to report that Verena has “fallen in love and decided to run away” with one of Freeman’s old Cambridge friends. Dyson is clearly devastated that his wife of six years is walking out of what he had considered a “happy” marriage, leaving behind two young children, Esther and George. (Both children forged innovative careers, Esther as a digital-age journalist and angel investor, and George as a historian of science.) Freeman stoically writes his parents: “Please do not offer me your sympathy or your pity. I have been happy in this marriage, and I have no regrets now it is over. … What she has done may be crazy, but it is not irresponsible.” And then within months, Dyson’s letters begin to mention the name of Imme Jung, the Berlin-born, 20-year-old au pair Verena had hired just before she walked out. “The more I see of Imme,” Dyson writes his parents, “the more impressed I am with her firm and solid character.” Escorting her to dinner at the Oppenheimers one night that spring, Dyson feels like “Higgins taking his Eliza to the ball; after all, Imme is extremely young and has little formal education.” But fortunately, that night Oppenheimer himself was charming: “Oppy especially went out of his way to be friendly to her.” Dyson was falling in love with his soon-to-be second wife. In an italicized note, he explained that for the next two years as a single dad, while the divorce was taking shape, “I held back from any display of affection for Imme, but it was obvious to all.” So, these letters are not only about science and politics. There is a love story too! They went on to have four more daughters; Imme became a master runner — the Dysons like to joke that “he has the brains, she has the legs.” If this “autobiography through letters” is not quite memoir, maybe it will nevertheless inspire a film.",The New York Times
2018,"Freight Train Kills 4 Elephants in India, Including a Calf","NEW DELHI — A speeding freight train traveling through eastern India on Monday barreled into a herd of elephants as they were crossing railroad tracks, killing a calf and three adult animals, an official said. The official, Biswajit Mohanty, a wildlife expert in Odisha State, where the accident occurred, said the train was traveling at 75 miles an hour in a protected stretch of forest near the village of Teladihi around 3:30 a.m. when it struck a bull elephant, two females and a calf. The speed limit there is around 20 miles an hour, he said by telephone. “At such a high speed, there’s no chance the elephants would have survived,” Mr. Mohanty said, adding that he had called for an investigation. “This is a big violation.” Hundreds of elephants have been killed in India over the past 20 years, and deaths attributed to trains appear to be on the rise. As mining and development projects shrink the country’s forests, Indian wildlife experts say, elephants in search of food have been forced to wander farther from their natural habitats. More than half of the world’s roughly 50,000 Asian elephants, which are considered an endangered species, live in India. A recent study identified a dip in the country’s elephant population, though scientists disagree over whether there are actually fewer elephants or if their numbers are simply being counted more precisely. In a letter to India’s railways minister this year, a group of wildlife activists urged the government to take action in areas with large elephant populations, for instance by building underpasses beneath railway lines for the animals, and instructing passengers not to throw food out of windows. The letter was sent about two weeks before a deadly accident in February, when a passenger train rammed into a herd of elephants in northeastern India, killing five. Indian forestry officials said the driver had been worried about being late and had ignored warnings to slow down. After a train killed five elephants in Odisha in 2012, Mr. Mohanty, the wildlife expert, pushed for reducing speed limits in areas where elephants congregate. The new measures seemed to work, Mr. Mohanty said, until the accident on Monday. Even after hitting the elephants, the driver of the train did not stop, he said. “The railways are under pressure to keep time routes,” he said. “They say to slow down, it will eat into our timing and we’ll lose our revenue. We’ve been telling them that this is a very small price to pay to protect India’s wildlife.”",The New York Times
2018,French Museum Discovers More Than Half Its Collection Is Fake,"PARIS — One painting included a castle tower that had been built in the late 1950s. But the artist who supposedly painted it, Étienne Terrus, died in 1922. On another canvas, a light touch with a glove was enough to wipe away what had appeared to be Terrus’s signature, revealing another painter’s name. These are the most flagrant examples of the disconcerting discovery made by a small art museum in the South of France: More than half of the works in its collection were fakes. The Terrus museum in Elne, France, has spent the past two decades amassing a collection of what curators thought were the works of Terrus, a local painter. He was born in 1857 and died in 1922 and is best known for his landscapes of the Roussillon region in the South of France. The museum was set to reopen after a renovation when the forgeries were discovered by a local art historian, Eric Forcada, in September. A simple glimpse at images of the paintings that Mr. Forcada received by email made him wary of their authenticity, he said in a phone interview. After inspecting the artworks and confirming his findings with a panel of experts, he found that 82 of the 140 pieces in the collection were counterfeits. Most of the fakes were acquired after 2013 and were not on exhibit because town officials were awaiting the creation of a second floor in the museum to display its full collection, Mr. Forcada said. Still, 10 to 15 forgeries hung on the museum’s walls for years, and Elne’s mayor, Yves Barniol, called the fraud a catastrophe for his municipality. The town council filed a complaint in March, leading the police to begin an investigation, and the museum reopened on Friday with about 60 paintings by Terrus, all authentic. Yet local officials said it could take years to find out who was behind the fakes. Beyond the blow to the museum’s and the town’s reputations, the case has illustrated the risks that European small towns face when seeking to enhance a heritage that can galvanize cultural life and attract tourists. The Terrus museum had neither a curator nor a team dedicated to acquisitions. Yet after Mr. Barniol became mayor of Elne in 2014, and as the museum’s founder was purchasing an increasing number of canvases in recent years, the town started to spend dozens of thousands of euros to restore some of the paintings, install better lighting and regulate the building’s temperature so the works could be better preserved. Mathieu Pons-Serradeil, a lawyer representing the municipality, said the town had also spent 160,000 euros, or over $190,000, buying artworks on behalf of the museum. Other paintings were purchased through fund-raising campaigns or bequeathed by collectors. “It has become increasingly unsustainable for small towns to run museums, and it has become increasingly simple for fraudsters to trick municipalities with fakes,” Mr. Forcada said. “It is easy to buy a 5 euro canvas at a flea market and to sell it to a small museum for €3,000, while faking a Picasso or a Matisse and selling it to a great Parisian museum is impossible.” The Terrus counterfeits involved preposterous landscape imitations, canvases dating from the same era but painted by other artists and fakes with flagrant anachronisms that had been painted decades after the artist’s death. Lynda Albertson, the chief executive officer of the Association for Research Into Crimes Against Art, said in an email that the museum is now under public scrutiny because it has admitted that some of the fakes acquired “appear to have been rather obvious.” She added that an acquisition process should involve “exercising due diligence in terms of researching provenance and when necessary, conducting material analysis during the acquisition of artworks.” This is also not the first case of a French museum discovering it is in possession of counterfeits. In 2016, the French culture ministry issued a statement saying that the police were investigating €2.7 million (around $3 million at the time) worth of furniture, including two Louis XV chairs, purchased by the Palace of Versailles. The art historian Bill Pallot and the gallery director Laurent Kraemer were arrested in that case and are awaiting trial later this year. The scandal rocked the French art world and led to the culture ministry reforming its acquisitions process for museums. According to The Art Newspaper, the ministry established research centers to carry out authentication analysis on items before they enter national collections. The Versailles fiasco also prompted La Biennale Paris, a venerable art fair, to tighten its vetting process last year. The examination of artworks offered for sale at the fair is now handled by an independent committee of experts, none of whom show at the fair, and whose decisions cannot be reversed by the National Federation of Antiques Dealers, the body that organizes the event. Yet the Elne museum is part of another arts world, one of small, local museums that live on tight budgets and local donations and that cannot benefit from the services offered by the Ministry of Culture. The Terrus museum isn’t labeled a “museum of France,” an official distinction monitored by the ministry. A local artist who went to study painting in Paris when he was 17, Terrus did not seek fame in the French capital and returned to his native region in 1882. Although he refused any label, he has been seen as a precursor of Fauvism, a movement in the early years of the 20th century that privileged cheery landscapes in vivid colors and was popularized by Henri Matisse, who was Terrus’s friend. “Even for art historians, Terrus remains a mystery,” said Mr. Forcada, who described him as a political anarchist who repeatedly refused the offers of another friend, the well-known sculptor Aristide Maillol, to help him exhibit in Paris. Instead, Terrus spent his life in Elne and died there. “Terrus was a son of the countryside,” Mr. Pons-Serradeil, the lawyer for Elne, said about the southern area of Pyrénées Orientales, which spreads at the French-Spanish border from the hamlet-state of Andorra to the Mediterranean Sea. “That his memory was tarnished by fakes in a museum that bears his name is a profound shock.”",The New York Times
2018,Frenchman Is First in World to Get 2 Full Face Transplants,"PARIS — He has been called the man with three faces. Jérôme Hamon of France has earned the title because of pioneering operations that have made him the first person to get not just one, but two full face transplants. Both surgeries were performed by Dr. Laurent Lantieri of the Georges-Pompidou European Hospital in Paris. Mr. Hamon was said to be recovering in the hospital from the second operation, which he underwent in January. Mr. Hamon, a French bookseller, has neurofibromatosis, a genetic disease that can lead to facial deformities. In June 2010, Dr. Lantieri removed Mr. Hamon’s entire face, including his eyelids and lachrymal system. Using material from a 65-year-old donor, the surgeon replaced the bookseller’s face with a full-face skin graft. The operation was a success. The only features of Mr. Hamon that were preserved were his blue eyes. “I am not the one that people are staring at with terror and cruelty. I am a man among men, simply a happy man,” he wrote in “Have You Seen That Gentleman,” a book describing his experience. But five years later, his new life took a cruel turn — all because he caught the common cold. To treat the illness, Mr. Hamon took an antibiotic he had received via a medical prescription. But the pill was incompatible with the immunosuppressive treatment for the transplant. Mr. Hamon’s body quickly started rejecting his face. Doctors decided to add Mr. Hamon to the national transplant waiting list for a new face. They made clear that while the first transplant sought to give him a better quality of life, the second was to save his life. Parts of his first transplant began gradually to die. The skin began to get stiff. In November, surgeons had to remove Mr. Hamon’s new face entirely. Dr. Lantieri said Mr. Hamon looked like a “zombie in ‘The Walking Dead’” after the transplant was removed. “Without skin, the organism is subjected to repeated microbial attacks that can lead to septicemia, and therefore to death,” Dr. Lantieri said. With no face, Mr. Hamon was confined to a highly sterilized room for about two months. He was unable to move and could not drink, eat or breathe naturally because he did not have lips. He could barely hear because he did not have ears. He could not see because he did not have eyelids (doctors closed his eyes artificially to protect them). To communicate, Mr. Hamon sometimes typed words on a touch pad. But “while waiting, he never complained — he was even in quite a good mood,” Bernard Cholley, an anesthetist-resuscitator, told French television. “It’s just an incredible ordeal that no one in the world has ever experienced,” Mr. Cholley added. “He earned the well-deserved admiration of everyone for his stoicism and his capacity to confront the situation” In mid-January, skin from a new donor became available from a 22-year-old man in western France who had been declared brain-dead. After getting the family’s approval, Dr. Lantieri removed the face of the young man. “In the U.S., it is necessary to be declared as a donor. But in France, we follow the principle of supposed consent,” Dr. Lantieri said in a phone interview on Wednesday. “It enables us to take organs without authorization. However, we always ask for the family’s agreement for a face.” A prosthetic mask was made for the donor. “Even though the family does not want to see the deceased, we do it as a matter of respect,” Dr. Lantieri said. The procedure has been used in New York to replace the faces of dead patients. “It’s extremely lifelike,” Dr. Lantieri said. Before Mr. Hamon underwent the second transplant, doctors replaced all the blood in his body in a monthlong procedure, to eliminate any potentially problematic antibodies from previous treatments. Then, medical workers began painstakingly putting the new face on Mr. Hamon’s head. The operation lasted almost 24 hours and involved about 30 members of staff. “It was very difficult because the blood vessels had a much worse quality after the first transplant,” Dr. Lantieri said. “It’s not like a lifting. Everything had to be reconstructed.” But the work paid off. Mr. Hamon’s face started getting red again at the end of the operation. “I recognize him; it’s him,” Mr. Hamon’s mother, Arlette Geffroy, said at the hospital when she first saw her son after his second transplant, according to Dr. Lantieri. Mr. Hamon cannot yet eat, and he speaks with difficulty. His face does not perfectly fit his skull. He lost a lot of weight but remains highly motivated, his doctor said. “He can’t move his face or have facial expressions yet, but he has sensations on his face,” Dr. Lantieri said. “He is tired but not depressed. His treatment shows that there is no rejection. I am very confident.” In a news release, the hospital said, “The patient, still hospitalized, was able to enjoy a first outing, with his final discharge expected in the short term.” “For the first time worldwide, it showed that, when it comes to composite vascularized transplants (face and hand), re-transplantation is possible,” the statement added. There have been about 40 face transplants globally (about a quarter of them in France) since the world’s first partial face transplant was performed on a Frenchwoman, Isabelle Dinoire, in 2005. Her nose, lips, chin and parts of her cheeks were replaced after she was bitten by her dog. Ms. Dinoire died in 2016 at 49. In the United States, the first face transplant was performed in Cleveland, in 2008, on an unidentified woman. In 2011, Charla Nash, 62, underwent a full face transplant at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston after she was mauled by a friend’s pet chimpanzee in Stamford, Conn., in 2009. Mr. Hamon’s surgery meant he was not only the first to get two full face transplants and to live without a face for months, he also became the first to be able to cry with someone else’s tear ducts. On French television on Tuesday, Mr. Hamon noted that he had gone from the face of a man in his 60s to that of a man in his 20s. “I’m 43,” he said. “The donor was 22. So I’ve become 20 years younger.” The whole procedure, including the transplant and the medication, cost nearly a quarter of a million euros, about $309,000, which was paid by the French public health care system. Mr. Hamon’s surgery offers hope for patients with severe facial deformities. But Dr. Lantieri, who has performed eight such operations, said, “It will never be a generalized practice.” The operations remain very sensitive. Because of the difficulty in finding donors, the cost and the risks of complications, they are not expected to become commonplace. And multiple face transplants are likely to remain even more rare. “It’s an experience I don’t want to live again,” Dr. Lantieri said. “Neither for him, nor for me.”",The New York Times
2018,"Frick Collection, With Fourth Expansion Plan, Crosses Its Fingers Again","The irony is not lost on Ian Wardropper, the director of the Frick Collection: The very gated garden that upended the museum’s previous attempt to renovate its 1914 Gilded Age mansion is now the centerpiece of its revised design. In 2015, preservationists, designers, critics and architects successfully opposed the Frick’s plans to remove the garden on East 70th Street, designed by the British landscape architect Russell Page, to make way for a six-story addition, by Davis Brody Bond. The new plan, by the architect Annabelle Selldorf — which the Frick board approved Wednesday — has situated several new elements precisely so that each provides a tranquil view of the garden: a renovated lobby; a newly created second level above the reception hall; and a new education center, cafe and expanded museum shop. In addition, the garden will be restored by Lynden B. Miller, a garden designer and preservationist, in keeping with Page’s original vision. And rather than build over the garden, as previously planned, the Frick will now build beneath it, creating a 220-seat underground auditorium to better accommodate educational and public programs. “The garden becomes the new center of the campus,” Mr. Wardropper said in a recent interview at the museum. “It’s a beautiful garden — always was. Now we’re going to make the most of it.” The Frick ended the last design process feeling battered by — and somewhat bitter about — critics, including the Times’s own, who raised concerns about protecting the museum’s intimate scale and preserving the garden. “Gardens are works of art,” Robert A.M. Stern, the dean of the Yale School of Architecture, said in an interview at the time. “This one is in perfect condition by Russell Page, one of the pre-eminent garden designers of the 20th century, and it should be respected as such. It’s as important as a tapestry or even a painting, and I think the museum is obliged to recognize its importance.” Had the museum been able to build its addition in the garden, Mr. Wardropper said last week, the Frick would have gained “a proper loading dock” and “we wouldn’t have to close” for an estimated two years during construction. (The museum is talking to other institutions about continuing its activities in borrowed spaces during that hiatus.) But he said he doesn’t feel as if the museum is settling for less. Instead, he said, the Frick has had to be more resourceful in repurposing 60,000 square feet of existing space and surgically adding 27,000 square feet, in part by building in the rear yard of the museum’s art reference library on East 71st Street. “We’re able to achieve everything we need,” Mr. Wardropper said. “I think we’ve come up with a more elegant plan and a more rational one.” Construction, which is expected to cost $160 million, is to begin in 2020 and take about two years to complete. Mr. Wardropper said he still firmly believes in the reasons behind the effort: to increase exhibition space and to improve circulation, amenities, infrastructure and wheelchair accessibility — trying to meet the needs of modern audiences while honoring the building’s jewel-box quality. The museum’s collection of about 1,400 paintings, sculptures, works on paper and decorative arts — including works by Rembrandt, Goya, Vermeer and Renoir — “has more than doubled since the Frick opened in 1935,” Mr. Wardropper said. “We haven’t added more than 700 square feet in 80 years.” For the first time in its history, the Frick family’s private living quarters on the second floor will be open to the public, helping to create 30 percent more exhibition space — including a permanent gallery for the new Scher Collection of portrait medals — and highlighting the experience of seeing art in an elegant home. “The Frick has always been one of my favorite museums because you get up close to the art and you can respond to the domestic spaces in your own way,” Ms. Selldorf said. “You’ll be able to come to the museum and do the exact same thing you do today, except that you’ll be able to go up the stairs and see these rooms.” The new design seems less likely to prompt outrage, given that the garden will be preserved, the new second level will raise the height of the lobby by less than five feet, and the museum is adding just two more floors above the mansion’s music room. Moreover, both of these additions will be set back from the street. “You will only see it if you’re all the way back at the corner,” said Ms. Selldorf, who is working with Beyer Blinder Belle, the executive architecture firm on the project. “The closer you get, the less you see of it.” The building addition behind the library will be the same height as the library: seven stories. The renovation’s aesthetic will also be understated and honor the original building’s aesthetic, using materials like Indiana limestone. “You want it to be part of the existing volume, but have its own identity,” Ms. Selldorf said. “It’s not apologetic, but at the same time it’s not about style.” The renovation will open the reception area, which currently becomes congested, by removing the existing circular stair to the lower level and relocating the gift shop to the second floor. A new staircase will lead down to the new coat check, bathrooms and auditorium. (The current 147-seat music room is acoustically challenged and so small that the museum must constantly turn people away.) The newly configured underground spaces will eliminate the low-ceilinged galleries that could not accommodate certain works. The current show of life-size portraits by the Spanish master Francisco de Zurbarán, for example, had to be displayed on the main floor, displacing a portion of the permanent collection. The Frick will also get its first dedicated space for the 100 school groups that visit every year. (They will enter the new education center through the library’s 71st Street entrance.) Mr. Wardropper said the Frick’s $30 million operating budget is expected to increase by $1 million or $2 million after the renovation, and its $22 admission fee is likely to go up by an undetermined amount. Given its three previous attempts to expand in recent years — in 2001, 2005 and 2008 — the Frick is hoping to get it right this time. “This is the one,” Mr. Wardropper said. Over the next few months, the Frick plans to meet with some 75 community organizations and others to present the project. Museum officials have already had initial informal discussions with the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, which has to approve the project since the Frick is in a landmark mansion, designed by Carrère and Hastings for the industrialist Henry Clay Frick. Three former members of that commission opposed the previous plan, along with a coalition, Unite to Save the Frick, that included architects and designers. Facing what the museum called “protracted legal battles” in pushing its plan forward, the Frick decided to go back to the drawing board. With this iteration, Mr. Wardropper said he expects some controversy, and he is steeling himself for another round. “Are people going to have objections? Sure; it’s New York,” he said. “But I believe this is necessary for the Frick, and I’m willing to go up on the barricades one last time to make it happen.” An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of a garden designer. She is Lynden B. Miller, not Millen.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Friday Night Music: Samantha Fish,"Paul Krugman Opinion Columnist I’m an aging baby boomer, raised to believe that good music ended sometime in the 1970s. But around 2010 I discovered that this is anything but true — if anything, the end of the CD era and the shift to live performance as a source of income has brought on a renaissance of incredibly talented musicians. If anything I worry that there’s too much good music out there — how can all of those who deserve to make it? But anyway, I keep discovering new artists who take my breath away.

2018,Friendship’s Dark Side: ‘We Need a Common Enemy’,"As a rule, friendship is considered an unalloyed good, one of life’s happy-happies, like flowers and fresh fruit. “Report: It Would Probably Be Nice Having Friends,” read a recent headline in The Onion. Ha ha! Of course it’s “kind of fun” and “pretty cool” to “have a few select people in your life to do stuff with on a regular basis.” Most people can name at least half a dozen people they view as reasonably good friends. The only society where people don’t have any friends, according to Daniel Hruschka, an evolutionary anthropologist at Arizona State University, is found in the science fiction of C.J. Cherryh’s “Foreigner” series. Yet researchers who explore the deep nature of friendship admit the bond can have its thorns, bruise spots and pesticide traces. Take the new evidence that people choose friends who resemble themselves, right down to the moment-to-moment pattern of blood flow in the brain. The tendency toward homophily, toward flocking together with birds of your inner and outer feather, gives rise to a harmonious sense of belonging and shared purpose, to easy laughter and volumes of subtext mutually, wordlessly, joyfully understood. But homophily, researchers said, is also the basis of tribalism, xenophobia and racism, the urge to “otherize” those who differ from you and your beloved friends in one or more ways. The impulse can yield absurd results. One recent study from the University of Michigan had subjects stand outside on a cold winter day and read a brief story about a hiker who was described as either a “left-wing, pro-gay-rights Democrat” or a “right-wing, anti-gay-rights Republican.” When asked whether the hypothetical hiker might feel chilly as well, participants were far more likely to say yes if the protagonist’s political affiliation agreed with their own. But a political adversary — does that person even have skin, let alone a working set of thermal sensors? “Why must it be the case that we love our own and hate the other?” Nicholas Christakis of Yale University said. “I have struggled with this, and read and studied a tremendous amount, and I have mostly dispiriting news. It’s awful. Xenophobia and in-group bias go hand-in-hand.” Game theory models predict it, real-life examples confirm it. “In order to band together, we need a common enemy,” Dr. Christakis said. Fortunately, he added, no model insists that the out-group must be exterminated or otherwise eliminated from the scene. “It’s possible to treat the out-group with mild dislike or even grudging respect,” he said. “Cultivating in-group distinctiveness does not require that the other must be killed.” Nevertheless, even the ordinary business of making friends is an exclusionary act, a judgment call, and therefore threaded with the potential for pain. “A friendship is always a little bit of a conspiracy,” said Alexander Nehamas, a professor of philosophy at Princeton. “We two are here, they are over there, and we’re going to do our thing whether they want us to or not.” And if they try to join us, we can say, no, sorry, that seat is taken. We’re saving it for a friend. Who may not return the favor. Abdullah Almaatouq of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and his colleagues recently showed that people are poor judges of who their friends are. When the researchers asked 84 college students to identify which of their classmates qualified as friends, the researchers found that in half the cases, those labeled friends failed to reciprocate the designation. Other studies have shown similar discordances or worse, with one survey revealing that 66 percent of supposed friendships were cases of unrequited like. Friendships are also surprisingly fragile. Based on a detailed survey of 540 participants, researchers at Oxford University determined that people had a falling out with a member of their social circle about once every 7.2 months, or nearly two times annually, and that a year later 40 percent of those ruptures remained unhealed. The overall rates of friendship conflict did not differ between men and women, but women were more likely to clash with close friends, to express feelings of anguish over the breakup, and to be more demanding of evidence of remorse before reconciling. Sure, love may mean never having to say you’re sorry. But friendship is a stricter taskmaster, and sorry may not be enough.",The New York Times
2018,"From Aristophanes to Hitchcock, Celebrating Birds and Culture","If you took a — forgive the phrase — bird’s-eye view of culture, it wouldn’t take long to see just how much ornithological inspiration has led to some of the greatest art of the past few thousand years. Their flight and liberty, but also their imprisonment, have been metaphorical fodder for titans like Aristophanes, Picasso and Stravinsky. Maya Angelou’s bird sings of freedom. So Violaine Huisman faced no small task in organizing “Birds: A Festival Inspired by Aristophanes,” the Onassis Cultural Center’s citywide festival featuring theater, visual art, music, museum and spoken word events that began on Sunday and runs through July 8. “It’s both a very strict idea, and at the same time an incredibly broad one,” Ms. Huisman said. “When you start looking across culture and history, birds are literally everywhere.” At the heart of the festival is Aristophanes, whose ancient comedy “The Birds” will be staged at St. Ann’s Warehouse in a raucous adaptation by the director Nikos Karathanos that is coming to the United States after a sold-out run in Greece. Mr. Karathanos said that the play, which is about two Athenians who build a utopia in the clouds with the help of birds, is a constant revelation for him. He pointed to the relatability of the characters, who think the world is too small for them and aim for a better life above the world, and to the false paradise they end up making, which has a border wall to keep out unwanted migrants in search of the same freedom. “This says so many things that correspond to contemporary realities,” he said. But don’t expect the whole festival to be purely an homage to classics and a reflection of current events; it’s also, simply, fun. “One of the goals of this was to be really intellectually rigorous and playful and in that sense inclusive,” Ms. Huisman said. “You don’t need to know anything about Aristophanes and ancient Greece to engage in the festival. You can, en passant, find out about these things.” Events that have already taken place have juxtaposed, for example, the heady music of Messiaen with the family-friendly environment of the American Museum of Natural History, where the pianist Taka Kigawa played the composer’s birdsong-filled “Catalogue d’Oiseaux”. Other festival highlights are as cerebral as a talk with the novelist Rachel Kushner and the filmmaker Paul Schrader, or as sweet as a meet-and-greet for children and baby birds. The full lineup is at onassisusa.org. Here are five of the festival’s wide-ranging offerings. At first glance, Mr. Karathanos’s adaptation (written with Giannis Asteris) may look like a revival of the musical “Hair,” with visually rich nods to pop culture, ancient Greece and drag queens. Much of Mr. Karathanos’s inspiration, he said, comes from the text of the play itself, which he said is like Andrei Tarkovsky, Ingmar Bergman and Woody Allen all in one. But he is also open to whatever else the audience sees in the comedy. “When the curtain goes down,” he said, “I hope you have been opened up as a human being and your mind has been expanded.” May 2-13 at St. Ann’s Warehouse, Brooklyn; stannswarehouse.org. Paul Sweet, an ornithologist at the American Museum of Natural History — which touts having the largest bird collection in the world — will lead bird-watching tours at Brooklyn Bridge Park. “It’s playful and inclusive,” Ms. Huisman said. “It’s also genuinely looking at the phenomena of birds in our culture and highlighting how present birds are around us.” Don’t forget your binoculars. Comfortable shoes wouldn’t hurt, either. May 5 at Empire Fulton Ferry State Park, Brooklyn; onassisusa.org. Could any bird festival be complete without Alfred Hitchcock’s 1963 thriller? “What I found really interesting in this film is that it presents the opposite view of everything else: birds as ominous creatures,” Ms. Huisman said. “They can be free and inspiring, but they can also bring visions of doom and fear. There’s nothing more versatile than birds.” For something gentler, check out “The King and the Mockingbird,” an animated French film from 1980 that Ms. Huisman loved as a child — and that Hayao Miyazaki counts among his influences. May 19-20 at Metrograph; metrograph.com. Ms. Lawler’s 1972-81 audio installation — a humorous fixture of the west garden at Dia:Beacon — features the names of famous male artists shouted in the style of birdcalls. Visitors to St. Ann’s can hear it as part of the exhibition “Nature of Justice: On the Birds,” just outside the theater. “It’s a way of talking about birds in a very literal way, but also in a very metaphorical tongue-in-cheek way,” Ms. Huisman said. “She spoke the names of the artists as if they were birdsong and poked fun at how they had glorified themselves, but it also makes fun of birds themselves while admiring their boldness.” May 3-13 at St. Ann’s Warehouse, Brooklyn; onassisusa.org. This one falls under the category of purely fun and adorable. As part of the New-York Historical Society exhibition “Feathers: Fashion and the Fight for Wildlife,” children can come to the museum to learn about baby birds and feed them. “I can’t really imagine anything cuter,” Ms. Huisman said.

2018,From Doodling on Napkins to Acres of Art,"Show Us Your Wall SAGAPONACK, N.Y. — The Dutch-born sculptor and longtime New Yorker Hans Van de Bovenkamp discovered the artists community on Long Island’s East End when he sold a piece to Edward Albee. Some years later, he rented the sculptor Wilfrid Zogbaum’s studio in East Hampton’s Springs neighborhood, near Willem de Kooning. In 2001 he bought what he describes as a “funky farmhouse” and stable on 7.5 acres in Sagaponack. Walking around the property one chilly day, Mr. Van de Bovenkamp, 79, explained that he had gutted the house, and transformed two outlying buildings into studios, one for sculpture, the other for painting and contemplation. His art collection sprawls across nearly every room of the house and includes spur-of-the-moment purchases made at small galleries, Buddhist sculptures obtained on sojourns through Asia, and works acquired in swaps or at friendly prices from artists, sculptors and photographers he has met. Outside are about 50 of his sculptures, ranging from 8 to 20 feet high, which sometimes travel to shows and exhibitions. Below are edited excerpts from our conversation. Where do we start? You have art everywhere. Let’s start in the living room. You know, I feel deep connections to art and also to objects that have mythological meaning. I learned a lot about mythology from Joseph Campbell, my neighbor upstate. I also have gotten to know so many artists who became friends. Some have passed away, like de Kooning. Bill and I were neighbors in the Springs — and friends when he was sober. He lived about 100 feet away, through the woods. I’d hear a knock at the door at night and it would be Bill. He’d paint in the middle of the night under the light of one light bulb. Then he wouldn’t like it. He’d take his knife out and scrape off all the paint. How did you come by the Picassos? The Picassos were woodblocks and etchings from the Vollard Suite [a celebrated series of neoclassical works, named after the art dealer who commissioned them]. I also have a Monet etching of Baudelaire and a Chagall artist proof, all bought in various galleries in Arizona and Los Angeles in the late ’60s. The works were grossly underpriced. I did not have much money and bought them with a credit card. I love this hilly landscape. Who’s the artist? My wife, Siv Cedering, was the artist. She passed away. She was a writer, poet and painter from Lapland. She wrote 27 books. She died in the bed upstairs in my arms, about 12 years ago. I still feel her presence. What’s this? Looks like a birdhouse. It’s a Buddhist birdhouse, a gift to me. You see the pagoda concept? Here is a bell and inside is a tiny Buddha. [Laughing] I don’t know if there are any Buddhist birds. What’s the sound of one wing flapping? Exactly. Tell me about your progress as a painter. I use the same undulating shapes as I do in sculpture, but with color — although I do black paintings too. The paintings are primarily energy. Somebody suggested that looking at the colors I chose, I must be colorblind. I’m definitely out of the box. Here’s one of my paintings, where the scales of a fish turn into a landscape. The painting underneath is by Peter Reginato, whom I knew in New York. How did you meet? Peter and I hung out at the same bars and restaurants, at places like Tony Goldman’s Greene Street Cafe in SoHo in the ’80s. I had no money, no living room, just a studio with two chairs. But I knew all the famous restaurants and knew the owners. We traded our work for meals and ate better than most people. Even for tips, we’d leave a doodle on a napkin. Tell me about this Buddha sculpture. It’s made of hardwood. I’ve always collected Buddhas. I like Buddhists; they are not as aggressive as Christians. In Burma [now Myanmar] I saw a bunch of Buddhist monks in their orange outfits and followed them into the mountains. They went to their temple where art was stacked five high, 20 deep. They had the real beautiful things. I bought two Buddhas from them; the other looked just like this. I spent half the day negotiating a price with the monks and the rest of the day at Customs negotiating terms for taking it out of the country. What happened to the other Buddha you bought? I gave it to Thich Nhat Hanh, the spiritual leader from Vietnam. We meditated together in Thailand. An earlier version of a caption with this article incorrectly described a lamp in a photograph.

2018,From Janitor to Chief Justice: Could Joaquim Barbosa be Brazil’s Next President?,"SÃO PAULO, Brazil — Just as former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, the front-runner in Brazil’s presidential election, was surrendering this month to start serving a 12-year sentence for corruption, a former Supreme Court justice quietly made his debut on the political stage, quite possibly upending the contest. Joaquim Barbosa, who made history in 2003 when he became the country’s first black Supreme Court justice, registered with the center-left Brazilian Socialist Party on April 6, one day before the deadline for potential presidential candidates to join a party. While he has yet to formally begin a campaign, party leaders have spent the past few weeks building a strategy that draws on Mr. Barbosa’s remarkable biography. Having overcome poverty and discrimination to reach the pinnacle of the legal profession, Mr. Barbosa became a crusading figure in the fight against corruption, which is the top concern among Brazilian voters. “His campaign won’t be based on polarization,” Carlos Siqueira, the president of the party, said in an interview. “It will be about his clean, honest name and about a black man who comes from humble origins and made it to the Supreme Court and now could reach the presidency.” The first poll conducted by Datafolha, which was released April 15, puts Mr. Barbosa in third place, with his level of support at 10 percent, in a matchup that excludes the former president. The poll had a margin of sampling error of 2 percent and included over 4,100 interviews. Mr. Barbosa’s standing in the poll is remarkable considering that he has stayed out of public view and still has not said whether he will, in fact, run. “For someone who doesn’t frequent public spaces, doesn’t give interviews, leads a quiet life, it’s pretty good,” Mr. Barbosa said this week when reporters asked about his poll numbers as he walked into a meeting with party leaders in Brasília, the capital. But he cautioned that his candidacy was not a done deal, citing unspecified “personal difficulties.” Eurasia, a consultancy that closely tracks Brazilian politics, recently called Mr. Barbosa “the real wild card of this election.” With six months to go before Brazilians cast their ballots in the most unpredictable and splintered presidential election since the return of democracy in the mid-1980s, the race’s onetime leader, Mr. da Silva, sits behind bars with no anointed successor for his left-wing base to rally around. The incumbent, President Michel Temer, is among the old-guard leaders who have become widely despised by the electorate amid mounting reports of systemic corruption by the political chieftains who have run Brasília for decades. That may set the stage for a remarkable showdown. Excluding Mr. da Silva, the leader in the polls is Jair Bolsonaro, a congressman and ultraconservative former army captain who was recently charged with inciting racism and discrimination against blacks. Trailing him are Marina Silva, a former environment minister, and Mr. Barbosa, who are among the few black people who have managed to muscle their way into the top echelons of power in Brazil. Slightly more than half of Brazilians describe themselves as black or mixed race. While Ms. Silva has competed in the past two presidential elections, Mr. Barbosa is a fresh face on the political scene, which may prove an asset at a time when voters are clamoring for a break with the past. The eldest of eight children, Mr. Barbosa was raised in the poor city of Paracatu in Minas Gerais State, where his father worked as a bricklayer. As a teenager, he worked as a janitor in a courtroom in Brasília. He was the only black student in his law school class at the University of Brasília. Mr. Barbosa, 63, began his government career with a short stint as a diplomat, but left the foreign service after concluding that he would not advance much in a bureaucracy he found hostile to blacks. He studied abroad, learned English, French and German and worked as a federal prosecutor before becoming a judge. Mr. Barbosa was appointed to the Supreme Court by Mr. da Silva in 2003, and he led the charge against politicians implicated in a kickbacks scandal known as mensalão, a reference to monthly payments to lawmakers in exchange for votes. The investigation landed several stalwarts of Mr. da Silva’s Workers’ Party in prison. This year’s election, which will take place in October, will be the first since a subsequent corruption investigation known as Lava Jato, or Carwash, which tarred much of the political elite. Just this week, Aécio Neves, the presidential candidate who was narrowly defeated in 2014, was ordered to stand trial before the Supreme Court after he was accused of accepting a bribe and obstructing justice. Mr. Temer is accused in two corruption cases, but no trial as been set. During his tenure on the court, from which he retired in 2014, Mr. Barbosa became famous for his blunt style and the barbs he delivered from the bench. Yet it remains a mystery how he would act on a campaign trail. Also unclear is how many traditional supporters of Mr. da Silva, who is widely expected to designate an heir in coming months, would gravitate toward Mr. Barbosa. Mauro Paulino, the director of the polling firm Datafolha, said this was the most fractured race in recent memory. Anger at the political establishment has worked to the advantage of those who can present themselves as outsiders. Mr. Bolsonaro, who was regarded as a fringe legislator with a tendency to say outrageous things, has built a significant following by vowing to stamp out corruption and curb violence by giving law enforcement officials a freer hand. “This election is about fear,” Mr. Paulino said. “Voters have never been so afraid. They’re afraid of crime, that’s why we’re seeing the support for Bolsonaro.” None of the leading candidates have the support of a political party with a strong nationwide presence. Ana Lúcia, a public affairs specialist in Rio de Janeiro, said that could be Mr. Barbosa’s Achilles’ heel. “He’s a person of integrity who fights corruption,” she said. “But on the other hand, he’s new to politics, he doesn’t have party connections, and because of that he couldn’t make the necessary changes.” Mr. Barbosa may be in a strong position to attract voters who once supported Mr. da Silva. Miguel Oliveira, a 47-year-old maintenance worker whose family is from the poor northeast of Brazil, said he had always voted for “Lula” as Mr. da Silva is universally known. “But I’d definitely take a look at Joaquim Barbosa,” Mr. Oliveira said. “He at least knows what it means to be poor in a country where politicians are stealing all of the money.”",The New York Times

2018,"From Rotterdam, Many Left for a New Life","ROTTERDAM, the Netherlands — They came from Russia, Poland, Germany and Ukraine, bearing tickets bought in the field offices of the Holland America Line passenger ships. They were fleeing the pogroms, escaping tyrants, running from war or just seeking a better life. About two million people made their way to Rotterdam harbor during the peak years from 1880 to 1920 to begin a trans-Atlantic journey that would often end at Ellis Island. The stories of these migrants inspired the former Rijksmuseum director, Wim Pijbes, and the group he leads, Stichting Droom en Daad (Foundation Dream and Do), to transform a crumbling warehouse on the Rotterdam piers into a kind of Dutch sister-site to Ellis Island. The nonprofit organization he directs, founded in 2016 to support arts in Rotterdam, acquired a city permit in March to turn the old Holland America Line warehouse into an institution that will commemorate those journeys. “I won’t call it a museum,” Mr. Pijbes said recently as he showed a reporter around the 108,000-square-foot concrete and steel building on a windswept pier, which is home to a number of ragtag hipster start-ups, including an organic food court, galleries and arts groups. “A museum is a phenomenon that has a very strict idea and image in most people’s minds. I want to find a word that has a kind of hybrid function, a place, a platform, an agora.” The new multiuse facility, called the Fenix, will include restaurants, shops and galleries on the ground floor, while the entire top floor will be devoted to exhibitions related to immigration, past and present. In 2020, when their leases expire, the current shops and businesses will move out to make way for renovation, which is expected to cost upward of 5 million euros ($6.14 million), though some will return. “Culturally and historically, this will be of amazing value for the city,” Ahmed Aboutaleb, the mayor, said of the Fenix project, adding that it would serve as “a bridge” between the north and south sides of Rotterdam. Through a partnership with several local museums and the Rotterdam City Archives, the exhibition space will combine historical presentations, based on three million records related to the immigrants who passed through here, and ship data, along with contemporary art. Mr. Pijbes said he would like to show the Mexican artist and filmmaker Alejandro G. Iñárritu’s high-tech art installation “Carne y Arena (Virtually Present, Physically Invisible)” (2017), which allows one visitor at a time to experience crossing the United States-Mexico border in the desert, through virtual reality. “What we want to show is that this is a universal story,” Mr. Pijbes said. “People at some point of their lives make a decision, whether it’s forced by war, poverty, religious reasons or something else. They decide to put everything they have into one or two suitcases and to make this journey to a new world and start all over again. The same thing happens to Jews from Russia and people from African continents crossing the Mediterranean, or Syrians fleeing the war. What we want to do is to understand the emotion and to show the emotion.” Hundreds of thousands of those who left through Rotterdam were victims of pogroms, anti-Semitic riots that swept the Russian Empire, killing thousands and propelling mass Jewish migration. But among the 3.5 million people who took the Holland America Line from its inception in the 1870s to the 1960s, when air travel became significantly cheaper, were every conceivable kind of immigrant. Mr. Pijbes intends to make the passenger lists, and details about those who traveled, available to the public online within a couple of years, before the Fenix opens. The Holland-America Line built what was said at the time to be the largest warehouse in the world on this pier in 1923, using it as a passenger terminal and goods transport center, according to Droom en Daad. In those days, some 2,000 to 4,000 people would board a single ship — first steamers and later ocean liners — for the weekslong voyage to the United States or Halifax, Nova Scotia, with poorer émigrés cramming into steerage and the wealthier passengers banqueting in first class. An entire industry sprang up around the travelers who passed through this port, to house them, provide them with papers and check them for diseases like rheumatic fever and trachoma (pink eye) that would prevent their entering the United States. Rotterdam was heavily bombed by German forces before the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands in 1940 and again as the Germans retreated, hoping to cut off Allied access to supplies. The warehouse was blown up with dynamite, but rebuilt at half the size after the war. It was named the Fenix, or phoenix, rising from the ashes. Today, large ocean liners dock at these piers, and glass office towers dwarf the Art Deco building, once the tallest at the harbor, that had served as the headquarters of the Holland America Line (now the charmingly historic Hotel New York). “It takes more than a hundred years to rebuild a city that has been bombed to the ground,” Mr. Pijbes said. “You see now in places like Syria and Iraq what happened here. “If you see the city as a body, what happens to the body is a trauma. What people tend to do when they have a very serious trauma is to turn their back on it. The people from Rotterdam did not look back in history. Don’t think about the past, they said, look at the future.” But Mr. Pijbes said that his foundation felt it was time to look back, because the history of Rotterdam was rich and fascinating. Mr. Pijbes served as the general director of the Rijksmuseum, the Dutch national museum, for eight years before he stepped down in 2016 to run the Museum Voorlinden, a private contemporary art center in Wassenaar founded by a chemical company executive and art collector, Joop van Caldenborgh. The Voorlinden job lasted only a few months. Soon afterward, Mr. Pijbes said, he was approached by the Van der Vorms, one of the wealthiest families in the Netherlands, who asked him to establish a foundation devoted to Rotterdam-based cultural activities and projects. The Van der Vorms owned shares in the Holland America Line from the 1930s until it was sold to the American Carnival Corporation in 1989, but this project was not born of that connection, Mr. Pijbes said. After spending about a year meeting with some 200 Rotterdam-based artists, architects, developers and city leaders, Droom en Daad settled on the Fenix as its first major undertaking. “If you go to Amsterdam or Leiden or Delft, you go to the city center, and you see the Middle Ages and you see the 17th century and the 19th century, you see history,” Mr. Pijbes said. “In Rotterdam, you have history, but you can’t see it physically. Everything that is built in the city center was built after 1950. There’s a lack of history. There’s a gap in the memory. “Our goal is to fill that gap, or refill that gap, by focusing on culture and heritage.”",The New York Times
2018,"From Siberia, an Unlikely Cry: ‘We Need Greenpeace Out Here!’","Tas-Yuryakh Journal TAS-YURYAKH, Russia — At a truck stop at the northern terminus of the Vilyui ice highway in northeastern Siberia, drivers make small talk not about life on the road but rather the life of the road. It might last another week, suggested one driver casually, tucking into a steaming plate of meatballs. “Not likely,” countered Maxim A. Andreyevsky, 31, the driver of a crude oil tanker truck. “Didn’t you see the shimmer on the surface? It will be gone in a day or two.” Every spring, thousands of miles of so-called winter highway in Russia, mostly serving oil and mining towns in Siberia and far northern European Russia, melt back into the swamps from which they were conjured up the previous fall. And every year, it seems to the men whose livelihoods depend upon it, the road of ice melts earlier. That insight has turned Tas-Yuryakh, a tiny village of log cabins that depends on the ice highway for business at its truck stop and gas station — the last gas for 508 miles — into a hotbed of true believers in the human contribution to climate change. “Of course people are to blame,” Mr. Andreyevsky said. “They pump so much gas, they pump so much oil. Brother, we need Greenpeace out here.” With highways made of ice, including the icy surfaces of deep lakes and rivers, all it takes is one pleasantly warm spring day for the highway to vanish. Every year, officials say, at least one big rig goes through the ice of a lake or big river. “The danger is always with the daring truck drivers,” said Aleksandr A. Kondratyev, the director of the regional department of roads in Mirny, a diamond-mining town in northeastern Siberia linked to the rest of Russia to the south only by the Vilyui ice road. Most of the time, he said, they escape with their lives. When the Vilyui ice highway first opened in 1976, its builders celebrated the occasion on Revolution Day, Nov. 7, Mr. Kondratyev said. These days, the road rarely opens before mid-December, he said, and it now typically closes on April 1, about a month earlier than it used to. For truck drivers in this part of Siberia, The Plate, the truck stop that marks the Vilyui highway’s northern end, is an island of comfort in a sea of snow. Drivers stepped in, kicked snow off their boots and lined up at a counter to order their last restaurant meal for three days, the typical time it takes to drive over the ice to the next gravel road. Outside, a skinny, angry Siberian husky tied to a tree barked fiercely at anybody who came near. Ice highways are integral to Russia’s mining and oil economy in the Far North, as they are in Canada and Alaska, where ice roads are also freezing later and melting earlier. The highways are surfaced with ice either graded by a bulldozer from frozen swamp or formed by spraying river water onto the intended site of the road and allowing it to freeze. The winter roads take shortcuts across frozen lakes and rivers but mostly traverse permafrost, the layer of frozen, prehistoric swamp that when melted resembles frozen spinach after a spell in the microwave. Permafrost is mostly composed of mud and vegetation but includes the occasional frozen mammoth. It is typically hundreds of yards deep, and in places in Siberia penetrates nearly a mile into the earth, rendering it impossible to dig down to bedrock to build a road. At the top is what is known as the active layer, or the upper five to 10 feet that thaws and refreezes every year. In the fall, this layer becomes construction material for Russia’s ice road builders. The first crews arrive in a “light column” of bulldozers traveling on the still boggy ground to plow insulating snow from the future road, exposing the soil to cold air and hastening a deep freeze. A bulldozer makes a final pass to smooth it off and the road is done — until the first warm spring day. This road is in fact a 508-mile long ice rink, hard and slippery under a coating of blown snow, connecting the Yakutsk and Irkutsk regions of Siberia. When the road melts, The Plate truck stop shutters for the summer. Late in the season, Siberian trucking companies raise fees for drivers to compensate for the danger and difficulty of driving during the spring thaw. Ice trucking is in any case handsomely compensated, by Russian standards. In the dead of winter, drivers at The Plate said, shipping companies pay about $500 for a one-way run over the Vilyui highway. After mid-April, the rate goes above $700. But it’s hard work. The wife of one truck driver on the Vilyui highway wrote a book about his life with the title, “Territory of Risk.” When a truck breaks the ice on a river crossing, “you don’t hear anything,” in the cab over the thrum of the motor, said Aleksandr G. Potashov, nursing a cup of tea at The Plate before setting off. “You just feel the truck collapsing in.” On an ice road river crossing, drivers say, seatbelts must be unfastened, to make a quick escape in the event of a breakthrough. Another hazard is melt water pooling on the icy road surface, rendering it too slippery to ascend grades and reflecting light in the shimmer that Mr. Andreyevsky said he had noticed on the road. Out on an ice road, a warm spring day is a curse. Polishing off their meals, drivers recalled melts of years past. In 1996, an unexpectedly warm spring stranded dozens of truckers along hundreds of miles of the Vilyui highway. In these cases, the trucks and their cargo stay put until the next winter. Drivers fell trees and build platforms of logs for the trucks, lest the vehicles sink forever. Ruslan A. Sizonov, a director of logistics at the Alrosa mining company, who said the warming winters were shrinking the window for hauling in heavy equipment and fuel, even as the cost of the road remained the same. Russia’s federal government contracts with the mining company to build the road, at an annual cost of about $3,050 per mile at the current exchange rate. The Arctic has been warming twice as fast as the rest of Earth, scientists say. Last month, the maximum extent of Arctic Ocean ice cover was the second lowest since satellite record keeping began in the 1970s. Russian energy companies are, though, seeing an upside to the thaw. Last year, a Russian-operated liquefied natural gas tanker, the Christophe de Margerie, made its maiden voyage carrying fuel to Asia over the thawing Arctic Ocean, which is opening as a new shipping route to the east. This year, Mr. Andreyevsky set off in his Renault truck on March 29, two days before the official closure of the road on April 1. While a few warm days came earlier last month, on that day the temperature was a safe -10 degrees Fahrenheit. The plan was to make it to the graveled surface in the south before the melt. If he makes it out with his crude oil load, Mr. Andreyevsky joked, he would only be adding to the road’s woes. “Of course there is an effect,” on the climate from burning oil, he said. “The exhaust pipes are smoking.”",The New York Times
2018,"From Thai Jail, Sex Coaches Say They Want to Trade U.S.-Russia Secrets for Safety","PATTAYA, Thailand — A pair of self-described sex instructors from Belarus have been stuck in a Thai detention center for weeks. They say that they have evidence demonstrating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign in the United States, and that they have offered it to the F.B.I. in exchange for a guarantee of their safety. Their claim — that they are targets of a covert Russian operation to silence them because they know too much — might seem outlandish, but their case certainly includes some unusual circumstances. They have influential enemies in Russia. They were arrested with the help of a “foreign spy,” according to the Thai police, and locked up on what is a fairly minor offense: working without a permit. And the F.B.I. tried to talk to the pair, suggesting that American investigators had not dismissed their account out of hand. “They know we have more information,” one of the pair, Alexander Kirillov, 38, told The New York Times last month in an unauthorized phone call from the detention center, in Bangkok. Mr. Kirillov said his co-defendant, Anastasia Vashukevich, 27, had angered some powerful people. “They know she knows a lot,” he said. “And that’s why they made this case against us.” Ms. Vashukevich certainly knows how to get attention. In February, a top critic of Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, released a video that included footage she recorded during a brief affair she had with a Russian aluminum tycoon while working as an escort aboard his yacht in 2016. The evidence included photos she posted of the tycoon and his guest, Sergei E. Prikhodko, a deputy prime minister, and a recording of them talking about relations between the United States and Russia. The aluminum tycoon, Oleg V. Deripaska, has close ties with Mr. Putin and with Paul Manafort, President Trump’s former campaign chairman, who has been indicted on money laundering charges by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel looking into election interference. The escort and her seduction coach have been held largely incommunicado since March 5, when reporters for The Times and other news media outlets were kicked out of the detention center for speaking to them. They now face deportation and fear what might happen to them if they are sent home to Russia, where they live, or Belarus, the former Soviet republic where they grew up, which remains firmly within Russia’s influence. (Mr. Kirillov was traveling on a Russian passport.) Neither of them is accustomed to silence. They and their circle of friends say they make a habit of recording everything they do as they go about their campaign of teaching seduction techniques and trying their skills on strangers, sometimes in public. The two were arrested along with eight others on Feb. 25 when dozens of plainclothes police officers raided a workshop they were conducting for Russian tourists at a hotel in Pattaya, about 70 miles south of Bangkok. The seminar was aimed mainly at male Russian tourists and offered instruction in how to seduce women. It was not illegal. The police arrest report says that a “foreign spy” infiltrated the Russian-language seminar and provided the Royal Thai Police with information about the training. Cellphone messages show that the agent signaled the waiting officers when it was time to raid the Ibis Pattaya Hotel conference room. The work permit charge is relatively minor, and Mr. Kirillov had been conducting training sessions in Pattaya for years. But high-level officials appeared to take an unusual interest in this case: Six police generals and two colonels had responsibility for the raid, according to the arrest report. Since the arrests, the government has tried to keep a tight lid on information. Friends said they had not been allowed to visit Ms. Vashukevich and Mr. Kirillov for weeks. A law enforcement official said the F.B.I. tried to speak with the two but was not successful. A Thai police spokesman, Lt. Col. Krissana Pattanacharoen, would not comment on whether Russia was behind the arrests, but he said it was not unusual for the police to use foreign operatives. “Investigations are not one size fits all,” he said. “It depends entirely on the situation.” Few other police officials have been willing to talk about the case. The American Embassy in Bangkok declined to comment. The Russian Embassy asked that questions be submitted in writing, but did not answer them. After the pair’s arrest, Mr. Kirillov sent a handwritten letter to the American Embassy in Bangkok asking for asylum for all 10 detainees. (At the time, Heather Nauert, a State Department spokeswoman, dismissed the case as “a pretty bizarre story” and indicated that the embassy had no plans to talk with them.) Financial records show that companies controlled by Mr. Manafort owed millions of dollars to Mr. Deripaska, the aluminum tycoon. During the 2016 race, Mr. Manafort offered to give him private briefings about the campaign, though there is no indication that the tycoon took him up on the offer. Ms. Vashukevich, who goes by the name Nastya Rybka online and recounts her story in a book, “Who Wants to Seduce a Billionaire,” became an escort under the guidance of Mr. Kirillov, better known as Alex Lesley, who has gained popularity in Russia for his advocacy of sexual freedom. At the time of the yacht visit, Ms. Vashukevich had shaved six years off her age to pose as 19. She was sent by a Moscow modeling agency to a yacht off Norway along with six other escorts, according to her account. She said she followed Mr. Kirillov’s instruction to record all her interactions with her target, the yacht’s owner, who turned out to be Mr. Deripaska. Ms. Vashukevich told The Times in a brief interview last month at the detention center that she had more than 16 hours of recordings from the yacht, including conversations with three visitors who she believes were Americans. She has called herself the “missing link” in the Russia investigation. Her posts from 2016 came to prominence only after Aleksei A. Navalny, a Russian opposition leader, included them in a video in early February that made accusations about official corruption. Mr. Navalny also charged that Mr. Deripaska had delivered Mr. Manafort’s campaign reports to the Kremlin. “Deripaska simply transmits this information to Putin,” Mr. Navalny said. “He’s very close to Putin after all.” Before traveling to Thailand, Mr. Kirillov grew worried about repercussions from the exposé and asked a childhood friend, Eliot Cooper, to contact United States authorities on his behalf, Mr. Cooper said. Mr. Cooper, who lives in Canada, said in a telephone interview that he called an F.B.I. hotline in February and proposed trading the recordings for the pair’s safety. He said he had told the hotline agent about one recorded conversation in which Mr. Deripaska and Mr. Prikhodko discussed wanting Mr. Trump to win. “I explained all of that to the F.B.I.,” he said. “They should have a transcript of everything and a recording of my voice.” Mr. Cooper said he had never heard back from the agency. The F.B.I. declined to comment. Mr. Cooper said that Mr. Kirillov had hidden copies and instructed associates to release them if he or Ms. Vashukevich were killed or went missing. “There is no investigation,” Mr. Cooper said. “The Americans are not interested. They want them to disappear, and Nastya in particular, because she is a living witness.” By the standards of Pattaya, a city notorious for its adult entertainment, the sex seminar for about 30 Russian tourists was tame. A hotel spokeswoman, Joyce Ong, said the workshop was run like a “normal corporate seminar,” and she denied earlier reports that the staff had called the police. None of those arrested were charged with sexual misconduct. Ms. Vashukevich was both Mr. Kirillov’s star pupil and one of the instructors at the seminars. The chief of Thailand’s Immigration Bureau, Suttipong Wongpin, said his department had restricted the pair’s visitors because letting them talk freely could harm Thailand’s relations with the United States and Russia. “The detainees,” he said, “will just say whatever they want.”",The New York Times
2018,From Thin Ice to Frozen Four: The Unlikely Saga of Minnesota Duluth,"ST. PAUL — The National Collegiate Hockey Conference played its postseason tournament this year in St. Paul’s Xcel Energy Center, the same site as this weekend’s Frozen Four. When Minnesota Duluth Coach Scott Sandelin arrived at the arena Wednesday for a team practice, he was relieved to learn the N.C.A.A. assigned the Bulldogs a different locker room than they used three weeks earlier. That weekend had been a disaster for the Bulldogs. Losses in the semifinals and the third-place game of the N.C.H.C. tournament had dropped them from a comfortable eighth to a shaky 13th in the PairWise rankings, the formula that determines the 16-team N.C.A.A. tournament field. Normally the top 14 teams in the PairWise, plus two others from lesser conferences with automatic bids, get in. But this was not a normal season. A run of upsets saw four teams outside the top 16 challenging for tournament titles and automatic berths. If all four got in — a complicated yet plausible scenario — Minnesota Duluth might miss the N.C.A.A. tournament altogether. That made for a stressful two-hour bus ride back to Duluth, as players monitored developments on iPads and smartphones. It took Notre Dame’s triumph in the Big Ten tournament for the Bulldogs to slide up to 12th and claim the final at-large bid in the field by the barest of margins: .0001 of a point ahead of Minnesota. By then the team was back in Duluth, watching the Irish score the overtime winner on the large flat-screen television in its Amsoil Arena dressing room. Players rejoiced as if they won the game themselves. “Guys were yelling and hugging each other,” Bulldogs captain Karson Kuhlman said. “It was good feeling knowing we got a second life going into the N.C.A.A. tournament.” That Minnesota Duluth then advanced to its second consecutive Frozen Four, beating Minnesota State, 3-2. in overtime and Air Force, 2-1, for the West Regional title, is nearly as surprising as three Big Ten teams filling out the rest of the field. Minnesota Duluth (23-16-3), relying on five freshman defensemen and the first-year starter Hunter Shepard in goal, faces Ohio State (26-9-5) in one of Thursday’s semifinals, with Michigan (22-14-3) and Notre Dame (27-9-2) squaring off in the other. The winners play for the title Saturday night. “It doesn’t matter how you get in,” said Sandelin, who coached the Bulldogs to the 2011 national title in the Xcel Energy Center. “The body of work over the year kind of puts you in that position. We had some good things happen, so we were pretty fortunate.” In one sense, the Bulldogs weren’t. The N.C.H.C. is the only one of the six conferences that still holds a third-place game, and a 4-1 loss to North Dakota in that contest put the Bulldogs in a precarious position. CollegeHockeyNews.com ran a PairWise comparison matrix that allowed users to plug in winners and losers and compute what an updated rankings might look like. Minnesota Duluth players jumped on that as soon as they came off the ice after their loss to North Dakota. An emotional Kuhlman sat at a postgame news conference fearing he had played his last game as a Bulldog. Shortly after the team bus left for the ride home up Interstate 35, Boston University, which began the day outside the top 16, upset the Hockey East regular-season champion, Providence, to win that tournament. To get into the N.C.A.A. tournament, the Bulldogs now needed favored Clarkson to beat Princeton in the E.C.A.C., or Notre Dame to down Ohio State in the Big Ten. In Bulldogs bus protocol, the seniors sit in the back and the freshmen toward the front, behind the coaches. Kuhlman said several players broke out iPads to watch a live stream of Clarkson-Princeton, while others scrolled Twitter for updates. Then Princeton won, 2-1, in overtime, becoming the fourth team outside the top 16 to claim an automatic berth. That left Minnesota Duluth’s fate to be decided by Notre Dame, and the reason why was intricate. The Irish and the Buckeyes were both in the top 16, but the result carried PairWise implications for the Bulldogs and the Golden Gophers, then 12th in the PairWise. Head-to-head results are part of the PairWise formula; the Irish beat the Gophers three times in four games, but Minnesota went 2-1-1 against the Buckeyes. Minnesota Duluth faced neither Notre Dame nor Ohio State. If Notre Dame won, Minnesota would slip behind Duluth. An Ohio State victory would give the Gophers the last spot. Near the front of the bus, the freshman defensemen Mikey Anderson and Matt Anderson, who are not related, pulled up the Notre Dame game on Mikey’s iPad. That game was headed to overtime when the bus arrived at Amsoil Arena. “I didn’t know the guys were tracking all of that, but I figured they might be,” Sandelin said. With the Bulldogs then back in their locker room, Cam Morrison’s game-winner for the Irish at 9:23 of overtime was greeted with a mix of joy and relief. Sandelin said he owed Notre Dame Coach Jeff Jackson a lot. “A couple of beers in Florida will probably work,” he added, referring to a coaches convention this month. Minnesota Duluth was not expected to be this good. It lost seven seniors from last year’s team, which fell to Denver in the national championship game, and three underclassmen departed early for the N.H.L. Sandelin began the season with 10 freshman, his most since 2005-6, and no clear No. 1 goalie to replace Hunter Miska, who signed with the Arizona Coyotes. Shepard, a sophomore, claimed the goaltending job in November and posted eight shutouts, a school record and second nationally. The Bulldogs gained confidence and credibility by winning the Ledyard Bank Classic at Dartmouth in late December while five players were away in the world junior championships; they beat Dartmouth in the championship game with only four defensemen. “We heard a lot of talk that we weren’t going to be ready, that we were young,” said the freshman defenseman Scott Perunovich, the team’s leading scorer and the N.C.H.C. rookie of the year. “That just wanted to make us keep getting better and better, and I think we came together a lot this year.” Especially on a particular bus ride. An earlier version of this article misidentified the Interstate that connects St. Paul and Duluth. It is Interstate 35, not 95.",The New York Times
2018,"From a Low Point, John Isner Finds a Way to New Heights","John Isner had time to kill. After a first-round loss to Ryan Harrison in Acapulco, Mexico, in late February, Isner was hanging his head. He had lost his first match in four of the five tour events he had entered in 2018, even falling in the first round at the Australian Open to 78th-ranked Matthew Ebden. “I was losing so early in events, and when that happens your confidence gets shaken,” said Isner, 32, who had won 12 ATP tournaments in his career but had never advanced beyond the quarterfinals at a major. “I didn’t have the feeling of making it deep into a tournament, and when you lose early, you have five, six, seven days to think about it.” He did not need to arrive in Indian Wells, Calif., for his next tournament until the following week, so Isner made a three-day stop in Los Angeles to work with Justin Gimelstob, one of his three coaches. Gimelstob, a former tour player who also works as a television commentator, had accompanied Isner for three years until family issues forced him to curtail his travel. “I have tremendous belief in him, I always have,” Gimelstob said. “People always oversimplify John because they think he’s all serve and he should be able to win that way.” Isner and Gimelstob did not make any major changes in those three days. Instead, they focused on adjusting small things like Isner’s footwork on the forehand, the position of his outside leg on the backhand return, and his racket position on the volley. They even tweaked the toss on his serve, even though the 6-foot-10 Isner has hit a staggering 8,800 aces in his 11-year career. By the time Isner arrived at the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, he thought he was ready to win. Instead, he fell to Gaël Monfils, 6-7 (5), 7-6 (3), 7-5, in his first match. Isner even held a match point with Monfils serving at 4-5 in the third set. Yet again, he had some time off to wonder what had gone wrong. But Isner was also entered in the doubles event with his fellow American Jack Sock, giving him a reason to stick around and someone to practice with and to hang around with at day’s end. Isner and Sock went on to capture the title, beating Bob and Mike Bryan in the final. “We just kept it loose and I was able to stay in match mode, even though it was doubles,” Isner said. “It helped so much to win the tournament. I was able to get that winning feeling back.” When Isner arrived at the Miami Open two weeks ago, he was feeling physically fortified, but still a little shaken mentally and emotionally. He and David Macpherson, his day-to-day coach, dissected past matches during nightly dinners, and Isner confessed to having some inner demons that were preventing him from closing out contests. “People think when you’re struggling and not winning matches it’s because you’re not working hard,” said Isner, who said that he gained a new perspective on his tennis, and his life, when he married his longtime girlfriend, Madison McKinley, last December. “That’s the biggest misnomer in tennis. All of us work hard. I know I do. But I also needed to put in some mental work with my coaches. I had to be a little bit vulnerable in hashing out what I’m feeling in the big moments and what was preventing me from playing my best in those moments. I had to get it out of my system.” The result was a more relaxed and free-flowing Isner, a player who cracked groundstrokes with new aplomb and roared through the Miami Open draw, upsetting second-seeded Marin Cilic, fifth-seeded Juan Martín del Potro and fourth-seeded Alexander Zverev to capture the first Masters 1000 title of his career. Two weeks shy of his 33rd birthday, Isner is the oldest first-time Masters 1000 champion. The victory also catapulted him to a career-high ranking of No. 9 and gave him the largest payday, at $1,454,982. This weekend, Isner will lead the United States in the Davis Cup quarterfinals against Belgium in Nashville. A win would put the team into the semifinals in September against either Croatia or Kazakhstan. The last time the Americans reached the semifinals was in 2012, when they lost to Spain. It has been 11 years since the United States, behind Andy Roddick, James Blake and the Bryan brothers, won its last Davis Cup. Though Belgium was runner-up last year, the team is without David Goffin, the No. 10-ranked men’s player in the world, and Steve Darcis, who are injured. In their place are No. 110 Ruben Bemelmans and No. 319 Joris De Loore. The two other team members, Sander Gillé and Joran Vliegen, are not ranked within the world’s top 1,000 singles players. The American squad has five players in the top 55, with Isner, Sock, Harrison, Sam Querrey and Steve Johnson. Jim Courier, the U.S. Davis Cup captain, plans to play Isner and Querrey, his two highest-ranked players, in singles, and then make a doubles decision among any number of combinations at the last minute. Courier was particularly encouraged by what he saw from Isner in Miami. “I was equally impressed by the velocity on his backhand and the quality of his forehand return,” said Courier, who is in his eighth year as the American captain. “In the past, he used to hang his head when things weren’t going right. He just needed to see some positives and the benefits of his hard work.” Courier and Isner think this is a group that can end the American Davis Cup drought. The players are close friends — practicing, playing doubles, even trash-talking through spirited poker games together. Gimelstob said that sense of camaraderie and teamwork, as well as managing expectations, might have helped propel Isner to a new height in singles. “John knows that it’s not supposed to be easy and you have to expect adversity,” he said. “Tennis is not like team sports where you can pass the ball. In an individual sport, you have to be the center, the point guard, the forward and the shooting guard, all in one. He’s always been second-guessed throughout his career as to whether he can be more than just a server. Now he knows he can be.”",The New York Times
2018,"From the Savory Side, the Salty Carricantes of Sicily","Wine School To describe a wine as “salty” may not seem like much of a compliment. Yet it can be high praise indeed. Some of the world’s greatest wines have a distinct saline tang. In France, where the vocabulary for describing wine dwarfs the capacity of English, to remark on a wine’s “salinité” is to toss a welcome though perhaps voguish verbal bouquet. In my experience, few wines demonstrate this notion of salinity as well as the whites in the Etna Bianco category, made largely or entirely from carricante grapes grown in the foothills of Mount Etna in Sicily. They are marked by a distinctive savory tang that the winemakers will tell you is blown in by the salty wind off the Mediterranean. Here at Wine School, where for the last month we have been drinking Etna Biancos, we prize savory wines. We also recognize that they are likely to be an acquired taste, especially for palates honed in the United States. For decades, the cliché about American wine drinkers was “they talk dry but drink sweet.” Jackson Family Wines, one of the world’s leading wine companies, built its success on its Kendall-Jackson Vintner’s Reserve chardonnay, which embodied the old saw by offering a sweetly fruity flavor without calling attention to it. Moët & Chandon used to make White Star, a special, sweeter cuvée of its nonvintage Champagne, specifically for the American market. That practice ended a few years ago, and now the United States receives the same nonvintage Moët Champagne as the rest of the world. Has the American palate matured? Wrong question. Vintner’s Reserve is still a top-selling bottle, and it’s misleading to generalize about American tastes. I think it is safe to say, however, that a growing number of Americans every year appreciate wines that offer the sort of subtlety and nuance that is rarely possible to achieve in the mass market. Not that these wines must be dry. Moderately sweet German rieslings can be among the most glorious, balanced, refreshing wines in the world. But often, when people have decided they love wine and want to make the effort to learn more about it, they begin to note that many good wines, particularly white, offer not the fruitiness that might be expected from fermented grape juice but savory qualities that are often described using terms derived from spices, herbs and minerals. So it is with Etna Biancos, whites with a pronounced savory quality that belies another wine cliché, that Italy cannot produce white wines with character. Perhaps that was true 30 years ago. But the quality and diversity of Italian whites nowadays is astonishing, from the Alpine Alto Adige and Valle d’Aosta regions in the extreme north to Calabria on the toe of the boot to the island of Sicily. As is customary in Wine School, I suggested three bottles. They were Benanti Etna Bianco 2016, Graci Etna Bianco 2016 and I Vigneri di Salvo Foto Etna Bianco Aurora 2016. Each of these wines was delicious in its own right and gave a clear idea of the potential of the carricante grape. Yet while they shared certain characteristics, they were entirely different. In common, they all had noticeably firm acidity, relatively low alcohol and those distinctive saline notes. The Benanti had salty, herbal, stony aromas, and though it seemed a bit dilute compared with the other two bottles, with acidity that was not quite as pointed, its flavors had staying power, lingering in the mouth long after the wine had been swallowed. The Graci was a denser wine, richer and with more body. The aromas and flavors were similar — herbs, citrus, saltiness — but the texture was more interesting. This was a wine you could roll around in your mouth even after swallowing, which I think was because of the residual feeling of its acidity. It was tangy, lip-smacking and refreshing. The Aurora seemed to be still more concentrated, with even more salinity and minerality than the other two, and with the herbal and citrus flavors as well. None of the wines were heavy, but all were lasting, evocative of their place and superb with one of my favorite dishes, bigoli with tuna, anchovies and sage. What made these wines different? Of course, each producer has its own sensibilities and intents, which alone are often enough to account for differences. These three wines also had different grape compositions. The Benanti was 100 percent carricante, while the Graci was 70 percent carricante and 30 percent catarratto, a white grape found throughout Sicily, and the Aurora was 90 percent carricante and 10 percent minnella, a rare Sicilian white found almost exclusively on Etna. The combinations are all permitted by Etna Bianco rules, which require the wines to be at least 60 percent carricante, up to 40 percent catarratto and up to 15 percent minnella. A higher designation, Etna Bianco Superiore, requires a minimum of 80 percent carricante, and all the grapes must come from the Milo area on the east face of Etna, which is regarded as the best area for carricante. One reader, Dan Barron of New York, found the richness of the Graci far more to his taste than the Benanti, and wondered whether the catarratto in the Graci might have accounted for that. My guess is no. While it’s possible that the presence of catarratto added amplitude to the wine, I don’t know of anybody around Etna who considers catarratto to be particularly desirable. Notably, Graci’s higher-end Etna Bianco, Arcurìa, is 100 percent carricante and is even more gorgeous, while Salvo Foti’s superb Etna Bianco Superiore, Vigna di Milo, is likewise entirely carricante, as is Pietra Marina, Benanti’s Etna Bianco Superiore, one of Italy’s greatest whites. Many readers were able to find the Graci, and almost everybody seemed to find that the warmer the wine got, the better it was. This is a crucial point for enjoying good white wine. Cold masks nuances as it does flaws. When you get a glass of pinot grigio from the local bar, you want it as cold as possible so that you taste nothing. But for good whites, you want access to every subtlety. “After a half-hour at room temperature, the wine grew exponentially in mouth-feel and floral aroma,” said Smellis of Brooklyn, who drank a 2016 Etna Bianco from Murgo. Several people noted similarities between the Etna Biancos and Muscadet, while another cited assyrtiko from Santorini. The Muscadet, grown near the Atlantic mouth of the Loire in France, seems an apt comparison, and the assyrtiko, a little-known grape from a volcanic island in the Mediterranean, maybe even more so. As Ferguson of Princeton, N.J., said acutely of the Etna Bianco, “You could taste the sea, but it was a warm Mediterranean, not the crisp Atlantic.” One might also cite Chablis. All of these wines have savoriness in common, with herbal, mineral flavors and, in the best versions, a distinct absence of fruit flavors save for citrus. Nothing is wrong with fruitiness in wine. I mentioned moderately sweet German rieslings earlier, which can be gorgeously fruity. Salinity and other savory flavors are simply another aspect of wine’s complexity. What the sweetness and fruitiness of spätlese riesling and the salinity of Etna’s carricante have in common is great acidity. It’s the spine of a wine that gives posture to the flavors, whatever they may be. You might say that acidity is good wine’s not-so-secret weapon.

2018,Fury in Germany as Rap Duo With Anti-Jewish Lyrics Gets Award,"BERLIN — In Germany’s hugely popular hip-hop music scene, one of the biggest albums of the past year was from two trash-talking rappers who rhymed about their prowess in bed and in the weight room and about violently dominating their opponents. The album has racked up sales, but has also attracted a different sort of attention. In one song, the pair boast about how their bodies are “more defined than Auschwitz prisoners.” In another, they vow to “make another Holocaust, show up with a Molotov.” Widespread condemnation turned into an uproar in the last week since the rappers, Farid Bang and Kollegah, won the Echo award for best hip-hop album at Germany’s equivalent of the Grammys on April 12. The lead singer of the country’s pre-eminent punk rock band objected to the award from the same stage that night. “In principle I consider provocation is a good thing,” Campino, the lead singer of Die Toten Hosen, said. “But we need to differentiate between art as a stylistic device, or a form of provocation that only serves to destroy and ostracize others.” Other winners have said they are returning their prizes. Posting on Twitter in German, the foreign minister, Heiko Maas, wrote: “Anti-Semitic provocations do not deserve awards, they are simply disgusting.” He also noted the unfortunate timing of the ceremony. April 12 is a day of worldwide solemnity. “That such a prize was handed out on Holocaust Remembrance Day is shameful,” he wrote. The country’s recording industry association had criticized the lyrics but defended its choice in the name of artistic freedom. Nominations are based on popularity and rankings on music charts, not artistic quality — a process the association has pledged to re-examine after the outcry. But beyond the resentment over the award, the episode has also provoked soul-searching about incitement in art, and the extent of anti-Jewish sentiment in German hip-hop in particular. And most troubling, many believe, is what it says about the rise in anti-Semitism among young people, and the millions of impressionable rap fans who are generations removed from the horrors of Nazi rule. Germany’s attempts to atone for the evils of its past, while confronting the troubles of its present, is its never-ending preoccupation. On Wednesday, in response to a video showing a man in Berlin wearing a Jewish skullcap being attacked by a group of young men speaking Arabic, Chancellor Angela Merkel vowed to commit her government to fighting anti-Semitism “relentlessly and with resolve.” “This fight against such anti-Semitic excesses must be won,” Ms. Merkel said. (The victim in the video turned out not to be Jewish — he was an Arab Israeli who said he was trying to prove to a friend that he could wear a skullcap in Germany without being hassled.) The objectionable lyrics in the winning album, titled “Young, Brutal, Good Looking 3,” do not explicitly deny the mass slaughter of some six million Jews by the Nazis, nor do they specifically incite hatred of Jews, both of which would have made them illegal under Germany’s strict laws banning Holocaust denial. Kollegah and Farid Bang did not respond to requests for comment. On the night of the ceremony, Kollegah replied to criticism by saying, “I don’t want to make a political debate out of this,” and invited anyone who wanted to discuss it to approach him at the after-party. In the past, they have defended their lyrics as art and exaggeration. On Facebook last month, Farid Bang apologized to Esther Bejarano, a 93-year-old singer and Auschwitz survivor who had spoken out about the lyrics. Both men have offered to let Jews come to their concerts for free forever as proof, they said, that they bore no hatred. But Jakob Baier, a researcher at the Hans Böckler Foundation focusing on anti-Semitism in German rap music, called the lyrics “despicable” and said they scorned the victims of Auschwitz. He noted that some of Kollegah’s other songs and music videos promoted conspiracy theories and the message that “the world is in control of evil, and the evil is marked as Jewish.” In the music video for his track “Apocalypse,” a banker in a London office tower is shown controlling the evil forces in the world, and wearing a Star of David ring. After a final showdown between good and evil, Kollegah — a 33-year-old convert to Islam whose real name is Felix Blume — raps, “Muslims, Christians and Buddhists lived together in peace,” pointedly not mentioning Jews. Allegations of anti-Semitism have dogged German hip-hop for years and were even the subject of a recent documentary, “The Dark Side of German Rap.” One song by the rapper Haftbefehl mentions a conspiracy theory about the Rothschilds, a Jewish banking family, and the video for another features images of Orthodox Jews carrying suitcases of money and diamonds over the lyrics “money, money rich.” Many lyrics are also homophobic and degrading to women — issues in rap music that transcend Germany’s borders. In one song, the rapper Shindy says that his openness to having sex — described in an obscene way — with Jewish women is proof he is not an anti-Semite. The scene’s politics lean heavily anti-Israel. Bushido, another best-selling German rapper, once used a map of the Middle East, without Israel, as his Facebook profile picture. In an interview on Wednesday, he said that he had done it in solidarity with Palestinians because of his own Arabic roots. “It’s not just about Israel, it’s about injustice everywhere,” he said. “But no one listens when you’re calm and polite, and so you have to use more drastic means.” Nevertheless, he faulted Kollegah’s and Farid Bang’s lyrics. Words that conjure images like “concentration camps, Auschwitz, Jews, people who were gassed — those shouldn’t be used,” Bushido said. With surveys increasingly showing that the Holocaust is receding from memory, many are concerned that downplaying the gravity of what happened under the Nazis can open the door for a return of discrimination against Jews. This comes amid a rise of far-right populism across Europe, and the arrival of some 1.4 million migrants and refugees in Germany, many from Middle Eastern countries where hatred for Israel is taught in schools. Some popular hip-hop artists hail from Germany’s inner cities and are of Turkish or Arabic descent. (Farid Bang, whose real name is Farid El Abdellaoui, has North African roots.) Ms. Merkel’s government has for the first time appointed a commissioner to combat anti-Semitism in response to reports that incidents are increasing, especially among the young. According to the Research and Information Center in Berlin, which records incidents of anti-Semitism in the German capital, 947 occurred last year, a 60 percent increase from 2016. Children in German schoolyards casually toss about “You Jew,” as an insult, and reinforce stereotypes about Jews, such as saying “Don’t be such a Jew” when trying to convince someone to lend some change. “At a time when hate against Jews is increasing around the world and a flood of anti-Jewish sentiment can be seen online, especially among young people,” said Monika Schwarz-Friesel, a professor of linguistics at Berlin’s Technical University, “to declare anti-Semitic and fantastical, conspiratorial song texts as ‘artistic freedom,’ and award them prizes is viewed by researchers of anti-Semitism as particularly irresponsible.” Anti-Semitic themes have plagued other German music genres — in particular, punk and metal music popular among the country’s neo-Nazis. But those groups have remained largely underground, often forced to perform outside Germany because of its Holocaust-denial laws. Popular German rappers, on the other hand, have a huge fan base; Kollegah has 1.4 million followers on Instagram. And the fans skew young. The music appeals to children and teens who share and debate the latest songs on social media and in schoolyards. “Young, Brutal, Good-Looking 3” topped the charts in Germany, Austria and Switzerland and was streamed 23 million times on Spotify in the first week of its release on the service. Some rap fans have said that the lyrics were being unfairly scrutinized by people who did not understand the genre, in which rappers constantly try to outdo and outshock their rivals. “Of course I think this line is tasteless,” Michael Fritzsche, 26, of Leipzig, said, referring to the offending lyrics. “But let’s be honest, a discussion about the political correctness in music lyrics should not be limited to rap.” But for all of the uproar over the words, Viola Funk, a journalist in Berlin who covers hip-hop, said she believed a larger point was being missed. “German rap is a scapegoat, because youth culture is always a scapegoat,” Ms. Funk, who directed “The Dark Side of German Rap,” said. “As if it didn’t have anything to do with society at large.”",The New York Times
2018,Would AT&T’s Time Warner Deal Help or Hurt Consumers? Judge Will Now Decide,"WASHINGTON — Lawyers faced off over the future of AT&T’s $85.4 billion blockbuster merger with Time Warner for a final time in a courtroom on Monday, sparring over what the deal would mean to consumers. The Justice Department, which sued to block the deal, argued that the merger would cost people millions of dollars a year by limiting competition. If the judge does approve the deal, the government said, the court should force the companies to sell off certain business lines to protect consumers. But the companies countered that the government had failed to make its case. They said consumers would benefit from the merger because it would allow Time Warner and AT&T to compete more effectively against Silicon Valley companies like Google and Netflix. “The only lessening of competition that would occur is if this merger is blocked,” said Daniel Petrocelli, the lead lawyer for AT&T and Time Warner. The judge, Richard J. Leon of United States District Court for the District of Columbia, is expected to rule on the case on June 12. He has given little indication of his thinking throughout the trial, and he gave no sign of his leanings on Monday, either. The six-week courtroom battle, featuring top executives and glimpses of trade secrets, has been one of the most closely watched antitrust cases in years. It has the potential to reshape the fast-changing telecom and entertainment landscape, which is facing new competition from tech companies. The judge’s opinion could also help set the course for antitrust regulation in the years ahead. A victory for the companies could embolden executives to pursue new deals. A government win could slow future deal-making. On Sunday, T-Mobile and Sprint announced a merger to better compete against AT&T, in a deal that is also expected to face close antitrust scrutiny. The case has centered on the question of harm to consumers and whether the merger would lead to price increases. The Justice Department presented several theories for why prices could go up hundreds of millions of dollars a year over all for cable subscribers. The core idea is that AT&T could threaten to withhold Time Warner content, like N.B.A. games and CNN, to extract more money from rival cable and satellite operators that wanted to run that “must-have” programming. The call for selling off business lines showed how little the two sides have changed their strategy throughout the trial. The Justice Department, which had made the same demand before it sued in November, says only the divestitures would solve antitrust concerns because restrictions on business practices are rarely well enforced. The government called witnesses from Dish’s Sling TV and from Cox, Charter and RCN, which provide cable and broadband service, to discuss their fears that AT&T, one of the nation’s largest satellite television providers, would use Time Warner’s programming as its weapon to hurt them. The Justice Department also relied heavily on an economic analysis by Carl Shapiro, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, that estimated monthly cable bills could go up at least 27 cents. “These witnesses came across the country to share their concerns,” said Craig Conrath, the Justice Department’s lead lawyer. He said the potential antitrust violations from the deal were not “theoretical.” “There are hundreds of millions of dollars in harms to consumers,” Mr. Conrath said. AT&T and Time Warner fiercely attacked those economic arguments during the trial and in the closing argument on Monday. Rivals are always motivated to argue against the activities of competitors, Mr. Petrocelli said. The companies assailed the economic analysis of Mr. Shapiro, saying the data sets used were not complete and cherry-picked points. “It is the centerpiece of this case,” Mr. Petrocelli said. But he said Mr. Shapiro’s arguments were “a complete failure of proof.” The companies’ ability to raise doubts about the Justice Department’s case put the government in a challenging position, analysts said. “The burden of proof is on the government, and the consensus view is that it would be an uphill battle for the government,” said Paul Glenchur, a senior telecommunications and cable analyst for Hedgeye Potomac Research. For a merger focused on the future of technology, the trial felt stuck in time. A clock on the wall was frozen at 5:05. Cellphones and other device were forced off. Lawyers relied on boxes of files and binders wheeled in on library carts. Judge Leon, with bow ties and cuff links, was a stickler for order and schedules. He took careful notes by pencil. Political questions have hovered over the trial, but have not been allowed in the courtroom. President Trump, a vocal critic of Time Warner’s CNN, said during the election campaign that the merger should be blocked. Makan Delrahim, the Justice Department’s head of antitrust, told the court in filings that the White House had not influenced his decision. Judge Leon, however, said he wanted to keep the trial focused on the merits of the deal. The outcome of the trial may not be a simple yes or no on the merger. Judge Leon may push the parties to work out a settlement that would let the merger proceed with the promise of assigning a third-party arbitrator to resolve business disputes over Time Warner content. He could also, as the government suggested, demand that some parts of the merged company be sold before the deal is approved. Whichever side loses is expected to appeal.",The New York Times
2018,G.E. Earnings Show Some Signs of a Turnaround,"General Electric reported a first-quarter loss on Friday, but there were also signs that the struggling industrial giant is beginning to stabilize its business. G.E.’s big power-generator division continues to drag down the company’s overall performance, and it is still burdened with financial liabilities that linger from the conglomerate’s pared-back finance arm, GE Capital. But G.E.’s other major industrial divisions, led by aviation and health care, delivered solid results in the quarter. That should provide some assurance to investors as the company charts a future dependent on its industrial lines. In a conference call, John L. Flannery, the company’s chief executive, called the quarterly results “a good start” to the year that showed “signs of progress” at G.E., with improving trends in industrial earnings, cash flow and profit margins. Especially heartening for investors, General Electric reaffirmed its profit outlook for the year, predicting earnings per share of $1 to $1.07, though likely at the lower end of that range, G.E. said. Analysts had been skeptical that G.E. could do that well. The average analysts’ forecast for the year was 95 cents a share, as compiled by Thomson Reuters. G.E. also reaffirmed that its free cash flow — funds available for the day-to-day running of a business — would be $6 billion to $7 billion for the year. The positive outlook for earnings and cash, despite the troubled power division, points to “the underlying performance in the core businesses,” Jamie Miller, G.E.’s chief financial officer, said in an interview. “We’re really making progress.” The company’s shares were about 4 percent higher at the close of trading. G.E. reported a net loss of $1.18 billion for the quarter, but it was mainly related to a one-time charge of $1.5 billion for liabilities in a subprime lender, WMC Mortgage, which G.E. once owned and is part of a federal investigation. The company’s decision to set aside the $1.5 billion, analysts said, was an encouraging step to contain the financial fallout from the investigation. “Risk is receding, not rising,” said Nicholas Heymann, an analyst at William Blair. Without that charge, the company’s operating earnings per share rose 14 percent, to 16 cents a share, or 5 cents above analysts’ estimates. Total revenue in the quarter rose 7 percent to nearly $28.7 billion, ahead of analysts’ expectations, helped by the contribution from the merger of G.E.’s oil-field equipment business with Baker Hughes last July. G.E. owns a majority stake in the combined company. But G.E.’s revenue from industrial operations, excluding acquisitions and currency swings, fell 4 percent, to $23.8 billion. This so-called organic revenue does not include the merger-related lift from the Baker Hughes deal, and the falloff in G.E.’s power-generator business more than offset the gains from aviation and health care. In its jet engine business, revenue rose 7 percent and operating profit rose 26 percent. It is not yet clear whether the Southwest Airlines accident this week, which left one passenger dead, will have any effect on the company’s aviation business. Investigators said an engine, made by CFM International, a joint venture between General Electric and France’s Safran, suffered a catastrophic failure in midair when a fan blade broke, creating shrapnel that punctured a window in the plane. G.E.’s power turbine business remains weak, with revenue down 9 percent and orders 29 percent lower. Since he became chief executive last August, Mr. Flannery has been wrestling with a series of setbacks. Last fall, he surprised investors by telling them the power-generation unit — long a pillar of strength for the company — was reeling. The division had badly misjudged the market, producing too many power turbines as global demand for electricity generation softened. At the time, Mr. Flannery warned that it might take a few years to fix the power business, prompting G.E. to cut its dividend for only the second time since the Great Depression. Then, in January, G.E. delivered two more jolts. The company announced it would take a big charge and set aside $15 billion over seven years to pay for obligations held by GE Capital, mainly on long-term care insurance policies. G.E. had been shrinking its once-huge finance arm for years, and its liabilities were thought to be few, and known. The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating the company’s handling of its insurance obligations and how it accounted for multiyear industrial services contracts. Mr. Flannery’s blueprint for General Electric is not yet complete, but he did elaborate on his management philosophy on Friday. G.E., he said, must become a “simpler, leaner, high-performance company,” with a small headquarters staff and most decisions made by the individual businesses. G.E.’s lighting and rail locomotive divisions are already up for sale, and others may follow. Mr. Flannery is also cutting costs aggressively. G.E. said it would trim expenses by more than $2 billion this year. “Flannery is doing a good job on the things he can control and he’s addressing the worry points,” said Deane Dray, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets.",The New York Times
2018,G.E. Makes a Sharp ‘Pivot’ on Digital,"No old-line company embraced the digital wave with more gusto than General Electric. The industrial giant spent billions, hired thousands of software engineers and even created image-morphing television ads to recast itself as “a digital-industrial company.” The scope of G.E.’s digital ambitions were put on full display in 2015, when the company set up GE Digital as its own business within the industrial conglomerate. Jeffrey R. Immelt, then chief executive, boldly declared G.E.’s goal to become a “top 10 software company” by 2020. Today, there are no such ambitions. The spending at GE Digital is being slashed, amid layoffs and sharply narrowed aims at G.E. under John Flannery, who became chief executive last August. Last November, Mr. Flannery told investors that expenses at GE Digital would be cut this year by more than 25 percent, or about $400 million. While he insisted the digital initiatives at G.E. are “very key” to the company, he added, “we want a much more focused strategy.” G.E. is now struggling with problems in its big power generation business, which badly misjudged the electric power market, and lingering uncertainties about the liabilities of its finance arm, GE Capital. Those two immediate concerns — along with how one of its engines made with France’s Safran was involved this week in a Southwest Airlines accident — will likely get the most attention from investors when G.E. reports its first-quarter results on Friday. But the rethinking of GE Digital, with its future still under review by Mr. Flannery, points to the difficulty of producing modern software for industrial businesses as they adopt digital technology. No one disputes the overarching vision of the so-called industrial internet of things — which includes low-cost sensors and a flood of data and clever software that should deliver insights to cut costs, conserve fuel and design better products, faster. But the company greatly underestimated the challenges of creating all the software needed to achieve that grand vision, said analysts and former G.E. managers. G.E.’s technical prowess, they said, lies in designing and manufacturing big machines like power-plant turbines, jet engines and medical-imaging equipment. Its traditional software skills have been in the specialized programs that control the machines and factory operations. GE Digital was a striking departure into cloud-based internet software, data analytics and artificial intelligence tools like machine learning. “G.E. reached too far outside its expertise and too fast,” said Steven Winoker, an analyst at UBS. “And it became a financial black hole.” Just how much G.E. has invested in its digital initiatives is uncertain, but it has been several billion dollars. In an article last year in the Harvard Business Review, Mr. Immelt wrote that in 2016 “we put about $4 billion into developing analytics software and machine learning capabilities.” G.E.’s digital effort dates to 2011, when Mr. Immelt recruited William Ruh, an executive at Cisco Systems. Later that year, the company set up a center in San Ramon, Calif., east of San Francisco. At the time, Mr. Ruh announced big plans to hire as many as 400 software engineers to write code for the industrial internet. The San Ramon work force swelled sharply to 1,400 in the summer of 2016, and to a peak of 2,000 last summer — before coming down to about 1,800, after a round of cuts earlier this year. During the buildup, G.E. recruited veteran software managers who had worked at leading tech companies, including Google, Microsoft and Apple. With the cuts at GE Digital and its narrowed focus, some of them have departed. In its early days, the San Ramon center concentrated on writing data analysis and modeling software for applications like predicting when a gas turbine or jet engine would need maintenance, before the machine failed. In 2013, G.E. called that software Predix. The product plan later broadened to include a cloud-based software platform for handling all kinds of sensor and machine data, and secure communications from the factory floor to data centers. G.E. even built its own data centers. The software platform under development was often referred to as an operating system for the industrial internet. When the product concept expanded, so did the Predix brand. Today, according to former G.E. engineers, Predix has been pared back to mainly a set of software tools to help write applications rather than being connected to layers of code for automating data analysis. The priority at GE Digital is now on selling products for specific industrial applications, sold as offerings in the “Predix portfolio,” and tailored for G.E.’s roster of existing industrial customers. Less emphasis is being put on all-purpose software for the wider industrial world. In an interview, Mr. Ruh described the change at GE Digital as “a pivot” rather than a retreat. “We’re still 1,000 percent behind our Predix portfolio,” he said. Two key products in that portfolio were acquired. In September 2016, GE Digital bought Meridium, a maker of equipment-tracking software, for $495 million. Two months later, it bought ServiceMax, whose software is used to manage industrial field service workers, for $915 million. The current strategy, Mr. Ruh said, “is about industrial apps” like those. It is a measured, step-by-step approach but one, Mr. Ruh said, that capitalizes on G.E.’s strengths — its industry knowledge and deep customer relationships — and is lifting sales. GE Digital remains a large player in an increasingly crowded field of companies offering industrial internet software of various kinds, in different market niches. The entrants include the big cloud suppliers like Amazon, Microsoft and Google; major business software companies like Oracle, SAP, IBM and SAS Institute; G.E.’s industrial peers such as Siemens, Honeywell and ABB; and start-ups like C3 IoT, Uptake and FogHorn Systems. The opportunity for G.E., analysts said, centers on its longstanding relationships with customers and selling to them. And so far, only 8 percent of its industrial customers are using Predix portfolio products, the company said. The New York Power Authority, the nation’s largest state-owned utility, is one of them. The utility is working with GE Digital to build apps that improve the efficiency of its power generation and distribution network. In pilot projects, the partnership has saved or avoided $3 million in costs, said Gil Quiniones, chief executive of the state power authority. The goal is $500 million in savings over the next decade. But for a technology project to help its customers reduce energy consumption, the state authority went with a start-up, C3 IoT. Brian Hurst, chief analytics officer at Exelon Utilities, a large electric utility corporation based in Chicago, is also working on early-stage projects with GE Digital. Mr. Hurst said the progress was encouraging and he saw no evidence that the cuts at GE Digital had affected their joint work. But it is something he is watching closely. “The technology is moving so fast,” Mr. Hurst said. “Today’s players may not be tomorrow’s players.” GE Digital, Mr. Ruh insisted, is building a business for the long term. Revenue from the Predix portfolio products reached $550 million last year, he said, and sales are growing rapidly. GE Digital’s total revenue of $4 billion also includes all of G.E.’s traditional industrial software, and the unit’s global work force is more than 4,000. “Our approach is heads-down,” Mr. Ruh said. “We’re going to show you success.” For his part, Mr. Flannery has consistently declared his support for G.E.’s digital-industrial vision — but that does not guarantee the future for GE Digital. Mr. Flannery is selling off businesses to streamline the company. The lighting and railway locomotive divisions are up for sale, and others could follow. A smaller G.E. might not need a stand-alone digital unit. Some analysts recommend putting all the software in the industrial divisions, like power and aviation, closer to customers. “San Ramon shouldn’t exist,” said Scott Davis, chief executive of Melius Research, an independent financial analysis firm.",The New York Times
2018,G.O.P. Pollster Withdraws From Role Advising Both Pence and Haley,"The Republican pollster who had planned to split time advising both Vice President Mike Pence and the United Nations ambassador, Nikki R. Haley, on national security issues withdrew from the dual role on Sunday night, a White House official said. The move by the veteran strategist, Jon Lerner, who has no national security background, came two days after President Trump learned of the unusual time-sharing plan between Mr. Pence and Ms. Haley. Mr. Trump was displeased by the move for several reasons, according to three administration officials. “Tonight, Jon informed the vice president that he was withdrawing from coming on board as national security adviser, and the vice president accepted his decision,” said Alyssa Farah, the press secretary for Mr. Pence. “Vice President Pence holds Jon Lerner in the highest regard and expressed his deep gratitude for Jon’s willingness to consider joining our team.” Mr. Lerner will continue in his role advising Ms. Haley and, one White House official said, continue to informally advise the Pence team. Mr. Trump was upset about the move for two main reasons: Mr. Lerner’s background with the “super PAC” that supported Senator Marco Rubio of Florida in the Republican presidential primaries, and his work advising the anti-tax group Club for Growth, which savaged Mr. Trump in ads during the campaign. At least one official suggested to the president that Mr. Lerner may have been connected to extensive opposition research efforts against him. Mr. Lerner has been a close adviser to Ms. Haley since her successful 2010 run for governor in South Carolina. When Ms. Haley was selected for the United Nations role, she insisted that Mr. Lerner join her as her deputy. Mr. Lerner is also close with Nick Ayers, Mr. Pence’s chief of staff. When Mr. Lerner’s new dual role was reported on Thursday night by The Washington Post, several West Wing officials reacted with alarm, saying that few had been properly consulted, and that no one had explained Mr. Lerner’s history to the president, according to the people familiar with what took place. Joe Hagin, a deputy chief of staff in the White House, told colleagues that the simultaneous roles might not even be permissible. And Mr. Trump, told of whom Mr. Pence had chosen, said, “Why would Mike do that?” according to one West Wing official. That discussion was first reported by the website Axios. Several top advisers, such as Mr. Trump’s national security adviser, John R. Bolton, and the nominee for secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, as well as the White House chief of staff, John F. Kelly, were told of the selection, officials said. But, like Mr. Trump, none knew the full context. Ms. Haley’s central role in the deliberations over a military strike on Syria in the last few days exacerbated frustrations among some. Mr. Trump made clear to advisers that he was still unhappy on Sunday, and that he did not want to see Mr. Lerner with a seat at the table in the White House. So the Pence team decided it was not worth pursuing, one adviser to the vice president said.",The New York Times
2018,G.O.P. Support Shows Cracks as Scott Pruitt’s Ethics Inquiries Widen ,"WASHINGTON — Some of the most reliable conservatives in Congress are starting to speak out against Scott Pruitt, the chief of the Environmental Protection Agency who is now facing a barrage of ethics and spending questions. Previously, conservative Republicans had shown a reluctance to question the actions of top Trump administration officials. Their new outspokenness against a prominent architect of President Trump’s regulatory rollback represents a major break from the past. In an interview this week, Senator John Boozman of Arkansas said of Mr. Pruitt, “I think there are legitimate concerns about him.” He applauded Mr. Pruitt’s industry-friendly environmental policies, but said, “I think the president at some point is going to weigh in.” Mr. Boozman serves on the Senate environment panel as well as the powerful Appropriations Committee, which controls the E.P.A.’s spending. On Thursday, John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 ranking member of the Senate, said that Mr. Pruitt was “just fine” on policy, “but obviously this controversy continues to swirl and it needs to be resolved, one way or the other.” Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, chairwoman of the Senate Energy Committee, said she intended to summon Mr. Pruitt to her committee for questioning. “The administration has a decision to make” on Mr. Pruitt’s future, she said. Also on Thursday, the E.P.A.’s inspector general opened a new investigation into Mr. Pruitt’s use of the agency’s security team for personal travel. ​[Expenses, Emails and a Phone Booth: The Investigations Faced by Scott Pruitt.] Mr. Pruitt is expected to face a grilling next week when he is scheduled to testify before the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on the environment. Representative Greg Walden of Oregon, chairman of the House Energy panel, said that Mr. Pruitt would have to answer the “many questions” that Mr. Walden and other Representatives have about his performance. It’s a far cry from a year ago, when the Senate confirmed Mr. Pruitt as head of the E.P.A. and Republicans rhapsodized about the man who had built a career by suing the agency he would now lead. They celebrated Mr. Pruitt’s zeal to roll back Obama-era regulations on water and air pollution. Now, however, Mr. Pruitt is caught in a barrage of questions surrounding his illegal purchase of an office phone booth, his expenditures on first-class travel and the ethics of his rental of a condominium linked to an energy lobbyist. Mr. Pruitt’s fate ultimately depends on Mr. Trump, who has publicly supported him. But Republicans are not only calling for him to face further Congressional inquiry — Mr. Boozman in the interview also urged Mr. Pruitt to explain himself before his two powerful committees — but are also opening investigations into his spending. On Wednesday, the White House budget director, Mick Mulvaney, said he was opening an investigation into Mr. Pruitt’s decision to spend $43,000 on a secure phone booth for his office, after a Monday report by a congressional watchdog agency concluded that the expenditure was illegal. Last week, Representative Trey Gowdy, the South Carolina Republican who is chairman of the House Oversight Committee, opened an investigation into Mr. Pruitt’s expenditures on first-class travel, which the E.P.A. has said were necessary because passengers have made threatening remarks to Mr. Pruitt during flights. Mr. Gowdy, who gained prominence for his investigations into Hillary Clinton over the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya, that left four Americans dead, on Sunday had pointed words for Mr. Pruitt. ""I would be shocked if that many people knew who Scott Pruitt was,” Mr. Gowdy said on Fox News. “So the notion that I have to fly first class because I don’t want people to be mean to me, you need to go into another line of work if you don’t want people to be mean to you, like maybe a monk where you don’t come in contact with anyone.” Privately, a number of Republican staffers and strategists say that last week’s Senate confirmation of Mr. Pruitt’s deputy, Andrew Wheeler — a former coal lobbyist who worked for years on Capitol Hill — would make Mr. Pruitt’s departure easier because Mr. Wheeler would be in place as acting E.P.A. chief and could be relied upon to implement an agenda of rolling back environmental regulations. Some Republican lawmakers have also pointed out the similarities between Mr. Pruitt’s case and that of Tom Price, Mr. Trump’s former secretary of health and human services. Mr. Price was forced to resign after racking up at least $400,000 in travel bills for chartered flights. “The ethical lapses associated with Scott Pruitt are troublesome,” Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana said. “It will be the President’s call,” Mr. Cassidy added, noting: “He let Price go.” Alex Castellanos, a Republican strategist, suggested that, at a moment when Mr. Trump’s troubles include news conferences by a pornographic film actress, the raiding of his lawyer’s office and hotel room, and questions about his ties to Russia, the ethical questions surrounding Mr. Pruitt’s spending may have slid under the radar. But if they continue, he said, Republicans are unlikely to be sympathetic. “Maybe when Pruitt’s 30-person Secret Service detail carries him through Disney World in a sedan chair like a mandarin, people will have had enough,” Mr. Castellanos wrote in an email. “That’s Pruitt’s real problem. Pruitt represents the opposite of Donald Trump’s populism: He thinks he is more worthy than the little people he represents.” Senator John Barrasso, who leads the Senate Environment Committee, has long been a cheerleader for and defender of Mr. Pruitt. His home state of Wyoming is the nation’s largest producer of coal, and Mr. Barrasso has, in particular, celebrated Mr. Pruitt’s efforts to loosen rules on coal pollution. But his tone changed markedly after the release of Monday’s report on Mr. Pruitt’s phone booth spending. “The Government Accountability Office has found that E.P.A. failed to notify Congress before installing this privacy booth,” said Mr. Barrasso in a statement. “It is critical that E.P.A. and all federal agencies comply with notification requirements to Congress before spending taxpayer dollars. E.P.A. must give a full public accounting of this expenditure and explain why the agency thinks it was complying with the law.” Many of Mr. Pruitt’s critics from the right have zeroed in on the question of his use of taxpayer dollars. Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa, a favorite of the Tea Party movement, said: “He needs to watch his expenditures. It’s important that we protect our American taxpayers.” Of course Mr. Pruitt still has his champions in Congress — advocates who say that the attacks on his spending are manufactured by environmental activists who dislike his policies. “I think he’s doing a great job,” said Representative Lamar Smith of Texas, the chairman of the House Science Committee who has worked closely with Mr. Pruitt on efforts to change the E.P.A.’s use of scientific research. “I don’t think we ought to be distracted by the agenda of his liberal opponents.” “I think he’s the best E.P.A. director we’ve ever had,” said Senator Roger Wicker of Mississippi. “I think he is being criticized because he’s changing the agency in a very positive way.” Last week a group of 21 conservative groups wrote a letter to Mr. Trump making the same point. “Precisely because of Pruitt’s record of leadership, radical environmentalists and the biased media are trying to force him out of office,” they wrote. Nevertheless, G.O.P. strategists see an important shift. “There are times when the legislative branch gets really sick and tired of the executive branch — and says so. I don’t think you’ve seen that in a while, ” said John Feehery, a Republican strategist who worked for the former House Speaker Dennis Hastert and the former House Majority Leader Tom Delay. “Pruitt has made a lot of people very angry.” An earlier version of this article misidentified the role of Tom Delay in the House of Representatives. He is a former majority leader, not a former speaker.",The New York Times
2018,Gabe Kapler Is Unlike Any Manager Phillies Fans Have Known (and Booed),"On Baseball When Gabe Kapler came of age as a baseball fan, in Southern California in the early 1980s, he named his dog Pete for his first sports hero, Pete Rose, who played far away in Philadelphia. Pete the dog was a dirty, grimy mutt, Kapler said, some sort of terrier mix — a hustler, like Rose. Back then Kapler loved to wear a red satin Phillies warm-up jacket, and a few years later he adopted another Philadelphia athlete, Charles Barkley of the 76ers, as a favorite. That was the extent of Kapler’s ties to Philadelphia before the Phillies named him their manager in October, at age 42. As a boy, he rooted mainly for the Toronto Blue Jays, because that was the name of his T-ball team. He played for six major league clubs — Detroit, Texas, Colorado, Boston, Milwaukee and Tampa Bay — but never the Phillies. He is nothing like the last few managers to lead the team to the World Series. Dallas Green, a former Phillies pitcher and farm director, had a booming voice and a domineering presence. Paul Owens, who was also the general manager, was nicknamed Pope for his resemblance to John Paul II. Jim Fregosi, a raspy-voiced former All-Star, was a baseball lifer who stayed at a Holiday Inn by Veterans Stadium. Charlie Manuel, a plain-spoken hitting savant from Virginia, remains the city’s kindly baseball uncle. So who, exactly, is Kapler? He is a 12-year major league outfielder who once took a hiatus to manage a Class A team. He has been a blogger and a bodybuilder, and he is fascinated by statistics in a way no other Phillies manager has been. He works by candlelight in spring training, he plays Ping-Pong with his players, and for all the interviews he will do this season, he may ask more questions than he answers. “He’s very intellectual, but at the same time kind of an oddball, definitely,” said Josh Reddick, a Houston Astros outfielder who played for Kapler in 2007, on a Red Sox farm team in Greenville, S.C. “He’s been like that for years. He’s one of those guys, if he’s going to do something, he’s going to do it to the fullest extent.” Reddick spoke in spring training, so he was not referring to Kapler’s bullpen moves in the Phillies’ season-opening series in Atlanta. In the first three games, two of them losses, Kapler went to the bullpen a staggering 18 times, including a call to an infielder. In the opener, Kapler pulled starter Aaron Nola from a shutout after just 68 pitches, and the relievers blew the game. On Saturday he summoned the left-hander Hoby Milner to face Freddie Freeman for the third day in a row, but there was one problem — Milner was not actually warming up. After the game, Kapler said he took responsibility for that mishap, using the word “miscommunication” repeatedly with reporters and emphasizing the “long view.” One curious series aside, Kapler has long appealed to some of the more astute minds in baseball, including Joe Maddon, who managed Kapler with the Rays and said he had envisioned him as his future bench coach if the opening ever arose. Maddon appreciated Kapler’s bond with teammates and willingness to challenge conventional thought. Maddon, who now guides the Chicago Cubs, is the original iconoclast among modern managers. His methods played well in the obscurity of Tampa Bay, with a young franchise that had never won before. But Kapler’s first job comes with a flagship National League team in a town that has never seen anyone quite like him. Does he know what awaits him? “He’s strong enough to absorb any blows he’s going to get in the beginning, because definitely, the cheesesteak guys aren’t going to dig on that early on,” Maddon said. “Maybe the sushi people will be O.K., but not the cheesesteaks. So he’s going to have to fight through that.” Maddon is from Hazleton, Pa., not far from Philadelphia. He laughed and continued: “I know these folks, I’ve been there. But they have a nice team, and as they continue to blossom and his stuff works, the cheesesteak guys will start eating sushi.” The Phillies, who are in New York for a series against the Mets, lost 96 games last season, their sixth in a row without a winning record. But they were 37-36 from July 16 through the end of the year, and rookies like Rhys Hoskins, J. P. Crawford and Jorge Alfaro fueled hope of an imminent turnaround. Their progress led the general manager, Matt Klentak, to add the veterans Carlos Santana and Jake Arrieta as free agents. It also persuaded him to replace Manager Pete Mackanin, 66, despite having extended Mackanin’s contract in May. Mackanin — now a special assistant to the general manager — had been the right fit for the Phillies’ rebuild, Klentak said, but a new phase, it seems, is underway. “Once our young players arrived in the big leagues and demonstrated that they were here to stay, we knew that things were about to change,” Klentak said. “We were looking for somebody who could connect with young players and really help to finish off their development at the major league level and create a new type of Phillies culture.” Klentak worked for the Baltimore Orioles in 2010, when Buck Showalter became the manager and instantly changed the team’s outlook. Unlike Showalter, of course, Kapler has never managed in the majors before. But he could be the kind of transformative figure the Phillies need. The Phillies were a power at the start of this decade, in the midst of a five-year run as N.L. East champions that included two World Series appearances and the 2008 championship. They had little incentive to change their principles, and were among the last teams to adapt to the statistical revolution sweeping the game. Now the Phillies have a growing group of analysts in the front office and a manager so fluent in numbers that he speaks confidently about the virtues of FIP (fielding independent pitching) compared with earned run average in predicting pitchers’ performance. “I like xFIP even better,” Kapler said, “because ballpark factors play in.” Kapler spoke in an hourlong interview late in spring training in Clearwater, Fla., his office lit by candles, with Norah Jones music playing in the background. He keeps the door to his bathroom closed, he said, because nobody wants to stare at a toilet. “None of this lighting, this lamp, none of it was there,” Kapler said. “There was a big brown desk right here, and a big chair behind it. It almost felt like a principal’s office — or a jail cell.” Kapler preferred standing at his desk in a corner, by the whiteboard, which was covered by a pull-down screen that bears an image of a Phillies championship ring; he did not like the plain white style he inherited. Above the couch, in a collage of inspirational quotations from Maya Angelou, Albert Camus, Malcolm X and others, Kapler made sure to include Simón Bolívar, the Venezuelan military leader who died nearly 200 years ago. “We needed a Latin American Spanish speaker when our players come and sit down,” Kapler said. “Maybe they don’t know who Robert Frost is, but they all know who this leader is. I wanted to continue that inclusion.” Kapler had a French press in the office; he grinds his own coffee beans. On a shelf was a bottle of wine and a box of chocolates, a gift from a coach’s wife. The chocolates had been there for weeks, and he had not eaten one. He is very disciplined, he said, and chooses when to indulge. “I just do it when I want to, and not out of desperation,” he said. “It’s more like: ‘I plan to indulge on Friday of next week with friends. We’re going to go out and get cheesecake and steak with au gratin potatoes.’” Kapler did not hit a home run in high school, but his body gave him a chance for a future in the game: He was tall and wiry strong, and scouts could project that he would grow into a ballplayer’s frame. Even so, Kapler was drafted late — the 57th round, in 1995 — and became a physical marvel. At 6 feet 2 inches and 190 chiseled pounds, he posed shirtless for the covers of fitness magazines as a rookie for the Detroit Tigers in 1999. This was the height of baseball’s steroid era, and while accusations dogged Kapler, he wrote an eloquent denial for Baseball Prospectus, detailing his precise workout regimen. It is part of Kapler’s extensive digital footprint as a writer for that website, Fox Sports and his own lifestyle blog, for which he once extolled the powers of coconut oil. More seriously, Kapler also explored his dismay at having misjudged the character of a former teammate, Chad Curtis, who is now in prison for sexually assaulting underage girls. In another column, Kapler expressed his disgust at the “degradation” of bullying and hazing in baseball. His slogan with the Phillies is “Be Bold,” and he said he would celebrate individuality, not stifle it. “Where do you want to come to work more: where you’re looking over your shoulder all the time, or where people are like, ‘Hey, great to see you, glad to be in the same space as you’?” Kapler said. “It just seems really reasonable to me to create an environment of positivity.” The veteran reliever Pat Neshek, who spent most of last season with the Phillies and returned as a free agent, said Kapler’s accessibility was a welcome change. He staged a talent show for the players in spring training and devised a social-media competition pairing veterans with rookies to see who could add the most followers. “If you came in here last year, nobody really talked,” Neshek said. “The environment wasn’t really friendly for a lot of young guys to feel comfortable, or a lot of older guys to feel comfortable. Now, you feel like you can just go into his office and chat him up for like 20 minutes if you wanted to — whereas, last year, that wasn’t really an option.” With Greenville, Reddick said, Kapler made low-level prospects feel like big leaguers. He was strict only about nutrition, making sure Reddick got up early every morning for breakfast, teaching him how to nourish his body for a long season. That was also a focus of Kapler’s three years as director of player development for the Los Angeles Dodgers, whose general manager, Farhan Zaidi, said Kapler had empowered players. “I want to have as few rules as possible, because I want guys to be accountable for their own behavior and their own work habits,” Zaidi said, describing Kapler’s approach. “Not just accepting or staying the status quo, in any part of the operation, is one of his greatest strengths,” Zaidi added later. “I’m sure he’ll do that at the big league level and have a lot of success.” Among Kapler’s innovations this spring was frequent shuffling of outfielders within an inning, putting his best defender in the spot where each hitter was most likely to drive the ball. Kapler said it was not about innovation but about upending assumptions; he assumes the outfield plan makes sense, but he is not sure. “It’s about being open when people say, ‘Wait a second, did you think about this?’” Kapler said. “‘Did you think about how the person might feel who’s getting swapped out?’ There’s a science to it. There’s a test and retest.” If he had more time, Kapler said, he would love to take his iPad to a coffee shop and lose himself in research. He is fascinated, among other things, by the many factors involved in moving the runners with a 3-2 count. He said he learned something new every day. “What separates him in any decision-making context is that he asks a ton of questions,” Klentak said. “He polls people all the time.” Seated with Philadelphia baseball writers at a winter-meetings luncheon, Kapler asked each to text five friends and ask them to name the most popular athlete in Philadelphia sports history. (The winners: Chase Utley, Brian Dawkins and Allen Iverson.) Kapler wants to immerse himself in his new surroundings, and he said fans had been universally welcoming so far. In truth, the locals may get an unfair reputation for hostility to newcomers. The fans adored Dick Vermeil, a California native who arrived to coach the Eagles at age 39, in 1976. Vermeil poured his soul into the franchise with an emotional vulnerability that resonated with the city, where his face still appeared on billboards many years after his final game. “So what do I know about Phillies fans?” Kapler said. “They’re passionate, they’re caring, they pay very close attention. They care most about how much effort we put in and how prepared we are. The promise I can make to the Philadelphia fans is: We will not be out-prepared, we will not be outworked, we will not be outfought. I think that will put them at ease, if nothing else, and I also think they’re sensible and rational.” Sensible? Rational? Philadelphia? Hear Kapler out. “The label Philly fans get is that they’re tough,” he said. “Well, they just want you to play well, play with passion, sacrifice your body and never take a play off. Is that tough, or is it … normal? I see it as normal.” The sports scene in the Philadelphia area is thriving now, for a change.

2018,Opinion | Gaming: The System,"Mr. Yagoda’s most recent book is “The B Side: The Death of Tin Pan Alley and the Rebirth of the Great American Song.” I had to buy two items at CVS — a bottle of mouthwash for me and some red yeast rice pills for my wife. I plucked the Listermint from the shelf, took it to the cashier and gave her my phone number and a $10 bill. The 38 and 1/16th-inch-long receipt had just what I was hoping for: a coupon for $5 off a purchase of $15 or more, expiration date three days later. I headed straight for the vitamin section, where the economy-size house-brand red yeast rice was on sale — buy one for $22.99, get one free. I brought my two containers to the same cashier, who took the coupon and unjudgingly charged me $17.99. But wait, there’s more. I’d get the equivalent of 2 percent of that price back in CVS Rewards bonuses for future purchases, and 1.75 percent in cash via my credit card rewards program, a total of 67 more cents to my name. Am I pitiful or what? Don’t answer that question. Or at least don’t answer it till you hear me out. My CVS behavior is just one data point suggesting that I’m the precise person for whom the marketing strategy of “gamification” is intended. That is, saving some money on vitamin supplements is nice, but that’s not really what brought me to the drugstore. I was there for the buzz, the shots of happy I got when the cash register spit out a receipt the length of a 4-year-old. It’s all in the game. I’ve long been aware of these tendencies of mine but didn’t realize just how many of them there are, and how much they affect what I do, until I did an inventory recently. The gaming actually starts first thing in the morning, when I shamble over to the scale and get a digital readout of my “score.” Down is a win, up is a loss — but I can hedge against the latter in the afternoon, when I climb on the elliptical machine and score over 400 (calories, that is). Which reminds me that the Fitbit Charge 2 on my wrist not only displays my heart rate at any given moment but also keeps track daily of hours slept, calories burned, steps taken and stairs climbed. A couple of my little games are arguably beneficial to the world at large. About a year ago, my utility company started providing monthly feedback on households’ energy use, compared with neighbors in comparable houses, with particularly efficient neighbors in comparable houses and with one’s own use the previous year. The latest statement says our house used 11 percent less than the average of all our neighbors — ping! — and 4 percent less than we did in the same period last year, but 23 percent more than those annoying efficient neighbors. My work is cut out for me. I monitor cumulative miles per gallon on my Ford C-Max Hybrid, 43.5 at the moment. Further, every time I brake to a stop, I get a score based on how much energy I allowed to fritter away by too-slammy braking; coming to a very gradual stop elicits a 100 and hearty “Congratulations!” on the dashboard. With my intricate credit-card protocol, however, I edge from borderline pathetic but ecologically friendly into, I fear, pathological. I have already mentioned the 1.75 percent cash-back bank card. But depending on the circumstances, I’ll use one of six other cards, which provide me with benefits ranging from a 5 percent discount (Target purchases with a Target card) to 2 percent cash back (restaurant purchases with my second bank card). The catch: All the benefits except the Target discount have to be claimed, which I don’t always do, meaning I’m giving “breakage” back to the companies. I learned that term in “The Gamification Revolution,” by Gabe Zichermann and Joselin Linder. It’s one of several recent books to explore how game practices and principles have been and can be applied in a lot of other areas. The book and some others — including “Reality Is Broken,” by Jane McGonigal — put my vigorous gaming in context and taught me that companies like CVS know exactly what they’re doing. In Mr. Zichermann and Ms. Linder’s terms, the company has established a rapid feedback game, which works pretty much like a slot machine, without the bells and whistles and with the stipulation that you always win … something. The books also helped me understand the particular kind of game that animates this trend, and my behavior. It’s not a zero-sum, winners-and-losers sort of game, like Monopoly or cage fighting, but rather one that continues as long as you want to play and one that, in a sense, you can’t win. Ms. McGonigal calls this an “infinite” rather than “finite” game and gives the example of Tetris. You will flail around and be crushed eventually, but you can attain small triumphs along the way, maybe even achieve a personal best, and in any case you can always embark on a new game, no quarter required. The only computer game I play, the bubble-bursting Bubble Bazinga, has exactly this model. In the same way, I can’t “beat” the credit card companies, but merely continue to accumulate modest savings from moment to moment. Then I die. My gamified life may be nutty and sad, but it doesn’t hurt anyone. At least that’s what I thought until a few months ago, when my new car insurance company, Liberty Mutual, invited me to join a program its website describes this way: “Using a small device that observes your driving habits, we’ll notice the safe choices you’re making on the road and reward you for them.” The company promised a rate reduction of at least 5 percent and up to 30 percent, based on driving performance over a three-month period. Best of all, an app would let me track the size of my discount in real time. If you’ve read this far, you know what my answer was. I quickly learned that the key “driving habits,” as far as Liberty Mutual was concerned, were jack-rabbit starts and sudden stops. Eliminating the starts proved easy, but braking was a problem. When a car pulled in front of me, I slowed down gradually enough for my C-Max to register approval. But when I got home, I saw the app had dinged me for it, dropping my discount by a percentage point. It got in my head. Subsequently, I found myself laying off the brake and drifting perilously close to vehicles, all with the goal of keeping my discount percentage up. It had come down to this: safety versus the game. Clearly, things had gone too far. I told myself that saving a couple of hundred dollars on car insurance wasn’t worth losing my life, and I started going to the brake more assiduously. My apparent eagerness to risk life and limb to save a couple of bucks a month had led me to reflect further. Had I essentially let my rat-like impulse for buzzes turn me into a Mario Brother? Well, yes. But I told myself the Liberty Mutual experience had taught me a lesson, or at least a goal: I control the game, the game doesn’t control me. With that in mind, I think I’m past the point of no return. For me, the ungamified life is not worth living.",The New York Times
2018,Gary Sanchez’s Homer Gives Yankees a 9th Straight Win,"Yankees 2, Angels 1 ANAHEIM, Calif. — A towering home run by Gary Sanchez, a throwback pitching performance by C.C. Sabathia and some tense relief work by Chad Green and Aroldis Chapman were enough to carry the Yankees to a 2-1 victory over the Los Angeles Angels on Sunday night at Angel Stadium. It was the ninth consecutive victory for the surging Yankees, who will carry that momentum to Houston for a four-game series against the defending champion Astros — the first meeting between the teams since a riveting seven-game American League Championship Series last fall won by the Astros. Sonny Gray will pitch for the Yankees in the opener on Monday night against Charlie Morton, who tossed five shutout innings against the Yankees in Game 7 of the A.L.C.S. The Yankees’ victory on Sunday night completed their first sweep here since 2003. Their visits to Anaheim have often been fraught — the Angels have twice eliminated the Yankees from the playoffs, and their Rally Monkey used to spook the otherwise unflappable Derek Jeter. In their visit here last year, the Yankees lost Sabathia to a hamstring injury that kept him out for three weeks. But backed by overwhelming support from Yankees fans this weekend, they won two tight games sandwiched around a blowout on Saturday. The difference on Sunday was Sanchez’s 447-foot, two-run, fourth-inning homer off the left-hander Tyler Skaggs that cleared both bullpens and landed in the left-field bleachers. The home run followed a one-out double by Giancarlo Stanton. It was the only threat the Yankees managed against Skaggs and three relievers. The Yankees had only two other hits — one of which was an infield single by Gleyber Torres down the third-base line that was snagged with a diving stop by Jeffrey Marte. A replay review showed that Marte’s throw to first was a split-second too late, and the out call was overturned. By the end of the night, there were some signs of frustration from the Yankees hitters, as Stanton and Sanchez swung their bats in disgust after flying out and striking out, respectively. Aaron Judge struck out three times, bringing his total to 10 for the series against the Angels. Sabathia, though he continued his strong start to the season with his deepest effort yet — allowing one run in seven innings — expressed his frustration with the strike zone of the home plate umpire Angel Hernandez. He yelled at Hernandez while leaving in the mound in the fourth inning and had to be restrained by shortstop Didi Gregorius. “Obviously the offense is a big story for us,” Yankees Manager Aaron Boone said, “but we’re not doing this without the starting pitching we’ve been getting.” Gregorius created more work for Sabathia with a rare rough night in the field. He threw away a routine grounder by Mike Trout in the third and fell down when he fielded a slow grounder by Albert Pujols in the seventh. But Sabathia worked around those mistakes — and another jam in the sixth when the Angels scored their only run on a pitch that bounced well in front of the plate and past Sanchez, allowing Upton to race home. It was the fifth time in their current streak that the Yankees held an opponent to one run. Green relieved Sabathia and escaped trouble of his own, striking out Zack Cozart with runners at first and second to end the eight. Chapman struck out Ian Kinsler in a tense seven-pitch at-bat with the tying run at second and Trout in the on-deck circle to end the game.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Gaza Screams for Life,"Op-Ed Contributor Ms. Yaghi is a writer based in Gaza. MALAKA, Gaza Strip — The five veiled women were gesturing, confidently, at other women to get closer. They wanted more voices to join in. My friend and I had already made it past the designated protest line and were next to the journalists and the ambulances standing by. We got closer still. Rhythmically, the women chanted “Going Back,” a cult song by the Palestinian activist poet Abu Arab, drawing demonstrators into their small concert. They ululated and then sang some more. A couple of children were jumping up and down, screaming out the few lyrics they knew: “I will return to my country. To the green land, I will return.” The crowd, a few hundred strong, armed with nothing but cellphones, clapped along. People stood on a farmer’s land, on the edge of Al-Zaytun, an eastern area of Gaza City, looking out onto the green fields beyond the Israeli snipers’ helmets and sand barriers. A group of clowns with white face paint and red noses squeaked noisily in the rising and falling tones of Gaza’s Arabic dialect and hopped around. One of them grabbed a mic in front of a TV camera and started imitating news correspondents, quacking unintelligibly but as determined as if he were saying real words. This was Sunday. On Friday, the first day of what was supposed to be an extended peaceful sit-in, Israeli soldiers had shot into another crowd of some 30,000 Palestinians who had gathered by the border to commemorate the killing in 1976 of six Palestinian citizens of Israel during another protest still, over Israel’s expropriation of Arab land. At least 15 demonstrators were killed last week. On Sunday, people lined up some 200 meters away from the fence separating them from the Israeli soldiers. Palestinian men in civilian clothes wouldn’t allow them any closer. Only one man in a mobility scooter couldn’t be stopped from entering the hot zone between the crowd and the fence. When he entered the area, several rounds of bullets sounded out, but he wasn’t hit. “They don’t want to kill another disabled activist,” one of the journalists said. He was referring to Ibrahim Abu Thuraya, who had lost his legs (reportedly in a 2008 Israeli airstrike) and was shot in the head during a demonstration in Gaza in December. “Otherwise, he would have been killed a while ago,” the journalist added, about the man in the special scooter. More bursts came, sudden and loud. The protesters got down. When they realized it was tear gas that had been fired, they straightened up. Lines of white smoke streaked up the blue sky and then dropped to the ground; a low cloud draped the figure of the disabled man on his machine. Moments later, paramedics rushed to help him. Eleven people were injured on Sunday in various protests throughout the Gaza Strip, according to Gaza’s health ministry. One of the women who had been howling, her eyes lined in kohl and blurry with tears, said: “This march is uniting us, if nothing else. Men and women of all backgrounds.” A sense of togetherness did seem to have developed among the small number of people gathered in front of the lurking Israeli snipers. “It’s not a march to return to our land at this very moment. It’s a way for us to speak and to raise our voices,” the woman said. Behind the protesters three boys aged 10 to 13 were playing football, kicking the ball high in the sky, well within range of the snipers’ viewfinders. The protesters who gathered under the burning midday sun displayed a kind of resigned hope. As if to say: We have nothing to lose, so we come here to scream our lungs out. Some knew well that they risked more than burned skin and a sore throat; they had been injured on Friday. One man came on crutches and hopped about on one foot, the other foot swinging from a scaffolding of metal sticks and screws. I left the protest thinking of the rest of Gaza — shellshocked for years, its borders closed and its United Nations-funded infrastructure in decay. I thought of the kids in my neighborhood who play football in what used to be the ground floor of a tall residential building, with bare concrete columns and poking iron rods as their only audience. And I thought: Once again, Gaza the Injured has come out to protest, and to scream for life. An earlier version of this article misstated the location of Ibrahim Abu Thuraya’s killing. He was shot dead in Gaza, not the West Bank.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Gaza: The Lesser Child of Israel’s Occupation,"Op-Ed Contributor Mr. Levy, an Israeli journalist, has been covering Israel and Palestine for 30 years. TEL AVIV — Sometime in the mid-1990s, I bade farewell to the Gaza Strip. In thrall to the great illusion, sweet and dizzying, that were the 1993 Oslo peace accords, I was sure that Gaza was about to be liberated from Israel’s occupation. The fate of that stretch of land mattered to me very much. There were nearly 700,000 Palestinian refugees there at the time, many already second- and third-generation. Most lived in camps, in disgraceful conditions. Two decades later, Gaza is even worse off. The number of refugees there has almost doubled, reaching 1.3 million, out of a total population close to 1.9 million. Its residents are even less free. In fact, they have been under blockade by Israel — with help from Egypt — after the militant group Hamas took power in 2007. Unemployment has reached nightmarish figures: more than 46 percent overall in late 2017, and close to 65 percent for people under 30. Israel continues to tighten its hold, building an underground wall into the sandy soil to block tunnels that Hamas has dug. This Friday, like the three Fridays before, thousands of Gazans faced off hundreds of Israeli soldiers across a fence. They are expected to gather again for more protests every Friday until May 15, the day that commemorates what Palestinians call the Nakba, or catastrophe: the creation of the state of Israel in 1948 — which meant the loss of hundreds of Palestinian towns and villages. The Gazan protesters, most of them barehanded, wear cheap and tattered clothing. Behind them are Palestinian ambulances, waiting for the next casualties. Some demonstrators have tires, ready to be set on fire; others hold mirrors, hoping to temporarily blind the soldiers of one of the world’s strongest, best equipped armies on the other side. Israel, being Israel, is deploying unbridled force against a helpless population. Dozens of snipers, backed by tanks, fire live ammunition against demonstrators whose only weapons are their own bodies — and maybe a tire or a mirror. Israel has always acted like this in Gaza, because it can; the West Bank, by comparison, seems like an island of moderation and enlightenment. And most Israelis, it seems, couldn’t care less. For Gaza is the lesser child of the Israeli occupation, and also the lesser child of the world. Gaza is far from the holy sites, far from the elegant hotels and fashionable bars of Jerusalem and Ramallah, and far, too, from what little attention the world still pays to the Palestinian problem. Israel uses that remoteness effectively. Although it has moved out of Gaza, its occupation hasn’t stopped. The jailers who once worked inside that prison now operate outside it, which is more comfortable for them anyway. The Israeli government ramped up its abuse after Hamas seized control of the Gaza Strip in June 2007. It couldn’t have wished for more than Hamas’s rise: No one would expect it to negotiate with those fundamentalists. The rest of the world has boycotted any talks with them — though for reasons not entirely clear. It speaks with North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, and President Hassan Rouhani of Iran, but it won’t speak with Ismail Haniya, the political leader of Hamas. So Israel is permitted everything in Gaza. And it has turned the territory into its training field, a giant lab — for gauging the reactions of the nearly two million people it keeps under siege there, and for testing its innovative weapons, as well as the limits of what the world will let it get away with. This practice started with the retaliation operations of Unit 101 in the 1950s, payback for Palestinian terrorist attacks. It continued during the brief occupation of Gaza in 1956, during what Israel calls the Sinai Campaign (aka the Suez Crisis), and it resumed again during the early days of occupation after 1967, when Ariel Sharon — then an army commander, later the prime minister — set up death squads in Gaza. It’s no coincidence that the First Intifada broke out in Gaza in 1987. And it’s no coincidence that Israel has embarked on three savage military offensives there over the past decade, killing thousands of people, wounding tens of thousands, leaving hundreds of thousands homeless and sowing unbelievable ruin. This would not have been possible in the West Bank, if only because there are too many Jewish settlements there now, abutting Palestinian villages. The test case was Operation Cast Lead. In just over three weeks in December 2008 and January 2009, according to the Jewish Virtual Library, Israel killed 1,434 Palestinians in Gaza, many unarmed — compared with 14 Israelis, most of them soldiers, killed by Palestinians. The ratio is gruesome: about 100 to 1. The world was put to the test then. Had it taken substantial action against Israel, the country might not have dared be so brutal again. A United Nations investigation known as the Goldstone Report cast heavy blame on Israel (and some on Hamas). Still, Israel read past the lip service and understood that it would have to pay nothing, not even for acts suspected of being war crimes or crimes against humanity. Just three years later, in November 2012, it embarked on Operation Pillar of Defense, which was relatively restrained. But two years after that came Operation Protective Edge — the most brutal of its assaults on Gaza, which killed more than 2,200 Palestinians. The decade-long siege of Gaza is an unparalleled collective punishment. Israel’s methods, disproportionate under international law, are carefully planned and considered. At one point, the military justified restrictions on food imports into Gaza by calculating the number of calories a person there needed daily to survive. No wonder living conditions have only gotten worse over the years. Gisha, an Israeli human rights organization, estimates that the number of Palestinians who were allowed to leave Gaza, including for medical treatment, averaged under 6,000 a month last year — less than half the monthly average for 2016 or 2015. A United Nations report was already warning in 2012 that Gaza would be uninhabitable by 2020, and matters have only gotten worse in the meantime. But the fate of these almost two million human beings forced to live in a vast cage — most of them youngsters with no past, no present and no future — mainly because of Israel’s inhuman policies, doesn’t seem to touch the country’s conscience. Israelis live in denial; they barely even talk about Gaza. Much of the local media, betraying its mission, hardly covers life there: No matter what, Gaza is simply characterized as a hive of terrorism and a constant threat to our security. “Go to Gaza!” is a common Hebrew curse. After the failure of the Camp David summit meeting of July 2000 and then the Second Intifada, in 2000-05, many Israelis lost both hope in peace and interest in the Palestinian tragedy. Israel has turned right, and nationalistic, even racist. Yet the truth is that Gaza is a disaster zone, and one of Zionism’s greatest victims.

Want to get this article as a newsletter in your inbox? Sign up here. You can also follow us on Instagram. Dear Readers, “Poetry is not a luxury,” Audre Lorde once wrote. “It is a vital necessity of our existence.” That quote has stuck in my mind this week, as National Poetry Month comes to a close. I’m what you might call a poetry luddite. But as I was sifting through our archives (reading about poetry), I was struck by what may be obvious to better-read poetry enthusiasts: That poetry and protest have long been intertwined. (In Lorde’s case, she was writing about the power of poetry to elevate the voices of women and people of color.) In the United States, poets have used verse to oppose slavery, war, segregation, and racism. Poetry played a huge role in the second-wave women’s movement of the 1970s. It has become a rallying cry in the age of Black Lives Matter and the Trump era. These days, there is also a quieter rebellion taking place, involving young poets, many of them women, who use social media as their distribution model — bucking the stuffy trends of the book publishing and poetry worlds, creating audiences of their own. We asked four of those poets to create original work for us on the theme “How I Write.” Those poems are below, along with a few of our favorite poetry-related articles and interactives. Have a poetic weekend. ______ ‘In Every Woman There Is A Writer’By Amanda Gorman I believe in every woman there is a writer:a poet who fiercely writes her future brighter,who pulls dawn-tight all-nightersfor the victory of women who give on beside her,for the history of women which lives on inside her.An Angelou, a Cisneros, a Chimamanda,she stands as tall as a man, a letterwhich has never known surrender,not despite her gender, but because of it;because just by writing, she is fighting.New times will not be writtenby her silence worn in the face of men,but by the defiance sworn in the chase of her pen. Amanda Gorman, 19, is the first-ever youth poet laureate of the United States and the founder of One Pen One Page, a program devoted to elevating youth voices through writing and leadership. ‘Verses Feel Like Finding Unhallowed Ground’ By Nikita Gill Undoing my vulnerability into words,has always felt like the softest prayer.Learning how to become and unbecomeinside the boundaries of letter after letter.I remind myself that I do not have to beanyone else but myself inside this templemade from sentences, all that is requiredof me is devotion, complete and ample.Everything comes to me in the quiet here.The inspiration, the memories, the conversations.The verses feel like finding unhallowed groundAnd rebuilding all of it into this sacred notion.I try to leave the memories undisturbed,after sculpting the poems inside them,Scoop them gently into the basket of my hands,and because they belonged on their ownlike sky lanterns, I simply light them and release them. Nikita Gill, 30, explores themes like loss, love and displacement in her now three published books. ‘Beasts Onto the Page’By Amanda Lovelace i write with one handcradling a pen& the otherclutching a battle-axebecause i’m soft enoughto open the windows wide& invite the beasts onto the pageyet hard enough to knowto keep them there. Amanda Lovelace, 26, is the author of the new collection, “The Witch Doesn’t Burn in This One.” ‘Keep Going’By Cleo Wade I write with the spirit of my ancestors. They whisper to me, “keep going.” Cleo Wade, 29, is the author of “Heart Talk: Poetic Wisdom for a Better Life.” ______ • Make a blackout poem! Remember blackout poetry?

Want to get this e-mail in your inbox? Sign up here or follow us on Instagram. Dear Readers, I don’t have kids, so my morning responsibilities are, shall we say, limited (yep that’s a link to my dog’s Instagram page). Which makes me all the more impressed by what my parent colleagues manage to accomplish by the time they arrive at work: Feeding small humans, getting them to school, conversations about puberty (that happened) as well as, you know, navigating public transit and getting to work on time. But this labor is often invisible, with many mothers who work for pay outside the home in particular left feeling that they must avoid making their mom-lives key components of their professional identities — lest they be viewed as uncommitted or unfit for the job. It’s a fear that’s not unfounded: Women’s wages are more likely than those of men to take a hit once they have children (see a stunning graphic about this here). Female job applicants with children, meanwhile, are as much as 44 percent less likely to be hired than women with similar qualifications but without children, according to research out of Stanford. That “motherhood penalty,” as it is known, is worse for women of color, who are more likely to be the breadwinners in their homes. (This is an absolutely crucial piece of journalism on black mothers and infant mortality I’ll come back to in a moment.) It exists despite research showing that moms are actually more productive and ambitious than women without children (no time for nonsense, right?). But perhaps, slowly but surely, that mom taboo is changing. In recent weeks, it seems like working-mothers are everywhere — and talking about their mom lives openly. [For more coverage of women and gender issues, subscribe to Gender Letter, a new newsletter.] Last week, Senator Tammy Duckworth, an Illinois Democrat, became the first senator in history to give birth while in office. She’s hardly hiding it: She used her pregnancy as an opportunity to alter a Senate policy that restricted family members from the chamber floor. Her colleagues unanimously approved the rule change on Wednesday, which now allows for children under one. Moms are among the record number of women who are running for office on both sides of the political spectrum this election year. And as many campaign, they are rejecting research suggesting that motherhood to voters should be conveyed in safe doses — instead proclaiming their expertise with multi-tasking (something moms know well) as an asset they would apply to cutting through gridlock. (One mom, a gubernatorial candidate in Maryland, is breastfeeding in a campaign ad.) “Motherhood in this midterm season is not just a credential,” my colleague Susan Chira wrote this week. “It’s a potent weapon.” Susan wrote a book about the working mom dance called “A Mother’s Place.” This week, she was part of The New York Times team that won journalism’s highest honor, the Pulitzer Prize for public service, for their work to help expose sexual misconduct, well, everywhere. Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, the fierce investigative reporters who unleashed a global reckoning with their stories about Harvey Weinstein, meanwhile, framed their acceptance speech as how they would explain it later to their two young daughters.“When these girls are much older, and mature enough to understand terrible violations, and humiliation, and pain, we are going to sit them down and tell them the story of our investigation, and our team’s work, and how all of us became part of something much bigger than ourselves,” they said. Here’s what else is on my mind this week:______ • Black mothers and maternal mortality: Black babies are now more than twice as likely to die as white infants — a racial disparity that is actually wider than in 1850, 15 years before the end of slavery.

Dear readers, In the first trial, only one of the more than 50 women with stories so similar to the case at hand was permitted to take the stand. In the first trial, the jury questioned why all these victims hadn’t spoken up sooner. In the first trial, the jury deliberated for six days — and remained deadlocked. And Bill Cosby, the once-beloved comedian charged with drugging and sexually assaulting Andrea Constand, remained free. Free to perform, in January, at a Philadelphia jazz club, where he joked about his struggles with blindness and played drums with a quartet. Now Mr. Cosby, 80, faces up to 30 years in prison. As the guilty verdict came in Thursday afternoon, with the jury convicting the actor of three felony counts, I had to remind myself: that first trial was just 11 months ago. In terms of collective consciousness, it might as well have been a lifetime. It was before #MeToo. It was before Harvey Weinstein, before Larry Nassar, before Matt Lauer, and Kevin Spacey, and Charlie Rose, and so many others whose names are less known but whose victims make up this army. It was before the spark that lit a worldwide movement; before the world seemed to be fully listening. My colleague Timothy Williams wrote on Thursday that the two trials present what social scientists might call “a natural experiment.” Because in the retrial, the jury heard from five women beyond Ms. Constand who testified about having been abused by Mr. Cosby, not just one (those incidents happened too long ago to be prosecuted). In this trial, the jury asked questions about the legal definition of consent, and were told by the judge to use common sense. “Common sense has evolved,” wrote the law professor Deborah Tuerkheimer in the hours after the verdict came in. In this trial, the verdict came on the second day of deliberations. In this trial, as Gloria Allred, the lawyer for many of the accusers, put it outside the courtroom: “Women were finally believed.” I’m thinking about that and more this week. Read on for what I’m reading, musing and raging about, as well as a couple of LOLs.

Murmurs of a possible comeback for figures felled in recent months by accusatons of sexual misconduct, including the comedian Louis C.K. and the chef Mario Batali has raised the question: What does this mean for #MeToo?

2018,"Gender Pay Gap? Maybe Not in the Corner Office, a Study Shows","The pay gap between men and women has rightly become an important topic of conversation in offices and boardrooms across the country. Despite the efforts of some companies to address the disparity, women last year earned 82 percent of what men earned, according to a Pew Research Center report. The subject was the focus of a “60 Minutes” segment on Sunday night. Now comes a bit of news that may spark some more discussion: There may be no pay gap at all between male and female chief executives of publicly traded companies. That’s the stunning conclusion of a new study by two professors who looked at the compensation of corporate leaders at 2,282 companies from 1996 to 2014. The findings are sure to be controversial — though they shouldn’t be considered a sign that the gender pay gap has meaningfully improved more broadly. Nor is it a sign that there has been a rush of woman appointed to chief executive. (There hasn’t been.) But it is a counterintuitive data point that is likely to be thrown into the mix of a debate in executive suites and boardrooms everywhere. The authors of the study, Sandra Mortal, from the University of Alabama, and Vishal K. Gupta of the University of Mississippi (along with a researcher, Xiaohu Guo), called it a “welcome finding in today’s zeitgeist of gender equality.” That’s not to say the conclusion will be viewed positively. Last year, The Wall Street Journal wrote an article with the headline “Female CEOs Earn More Than Male Chief Executives.” It argued that female chief executives were being paid more than their male counterparts, with a median compensation level of $13.8 million, compared with $11.6 million for men. The information was accurate. But the article was immediately criticized, both for being based on far too small a sample (there were only 21 female executives, compared with 382 men) and for a conclusion suggestive of a trend that is not a reality for most women. Fortune magazine wrote that “such stories suggest that America’s biggest corner offices are a haven for gender equity — which does not appear to be the case.” [For more coverage of women and gender issues, subscribe to Gender Letter, a new newsletter.] The new study, however, appears to be exhaustive. “We controlled for several possible confounding factors,” the authors wrote in a post on the website of Harvard Law School’s Forum on Corporate Governance and Financial Regulation. Those factors included the chief executives’ tenure, characteristics of the firms (size, performance and risk), and the size and independence of the boards. The authors added that their model accounted for the fact that compensation for chief executives and the number of women in the role had increased over time. “Our results reveal that there is no significant difference between male and female C.E.O. compensation,” they said. The study also “casts doubt on the veracity” of the previous studies showing that female chief executives were paid more. “The truth seems to be that, once relevant confounding factors are accounted for, male and female C.E.O.s earn similar compensation, which is what standard economic theory would suggest and most people would like to see happen in society,” they said. One of the most interesting theories about why women may have bridged the pay divide at the highest levels has been offered by previous studies and experts: that a premium has been applied because there is such a limited supply of women in the chief executive role. Some readers may find that an offensive idea on its face — that women in effect are being overpaid because of their scarcity — but it’s one that has gained currency among some academics. In an interview, Professor Mortal said she was surprised by the results of her own study. “I would have expected that women were paid less,” she said. “There is still is discrimination against women in getting to the top,” she added, but said she welcomed the news that women were well paid “once they actually are there.” The authors acknowledged that in some extreme situations, men are still paid more by a wide margin. For example, Fast Company pointed out that in 2016, the highest-paid male chief executive was Tom Rutledge of Charter Communications, whose compensation was valued at $98.5 million, far beyond what Meg Whitman earned ($35.6 million) as the head of Hewlett Packard Enterprise. But Professor Gupta said such examples were “outliers in statistical language.” “It is certainly possibly that in the outlier group there is a gender difference, but we didn’t look at that,” he added, saying he was focused on averages. He speculated that the pay gap at the top may have narrowed because the chief executive role is so publicly prominent. “We think it is a visibility issue,’’ he said. “It is highly visible to all the stakeholders.” That may be true, but it doesn’t explain why more public companies don’t have female chief executives. Professor Gupta said that “is not an easy question to answer.” Perhaps providing a contradictory view, a recent study of nonprofit organizations found that there were more female chief executives than male, but notably, the women were paid less — 21 percent less if managing a budget of more than $50 million, according to GuideStar, a research firm that focuses on nonprofits. The new study looked only at public companies. Joanne Lipman, author of “That’s What She Said: What Men Need to Know (and Women Need to Tell Them) About Working Together,” said that irrespective of the study’s results, ”female C.E.O.s face a host of obstacles that male C.E.O.s do not.’’ “Female C.E.O.s should receive hazard pay,” she said. Ms. Lipman cited a handful of statistics that show female chief executives are more likely to be blamed for poor performance than their male counterparts; that women are disproportionately hired as chief executives in times of crisis, creating what has been called a “glass cliff”; and that female business leaders are often targeted more by activist investors, a topic that this column first raised in 2015. There is, of course, a lot more research to do. It would be interesting, for instance, to better understand how the pay of female chief executives leads, or doesn’t, to higher pay for other female executives. But for now, perhaps this can be considered a little bit of good news in a journey that is far from over.",The New York Times
2018,Gender Progress in Macho Australia?,"Letter 52 Want the Australia Letter by email? Sign up and forward to your friends for heaps of global coverage and provocative Australia insight. ______ When Francesca Donner, director of The New York Times Gender Initiative, arrived in Australia a few weeks ago, she was almost immediately swept up in the wave of #MeToo and news media activities. In addition to public panels on the #MeToo movement, there were conferences, university discussions and a dinner with young female New York Times readers to talk about our coverage. Everyone, it seemed, had something to say about #MeToo. On her way back to New York, Francesca jotted down a few impressions about Australia’s gender movement and how it compares with what’s happening in the United States. Her thoughts raised as many questions as they answered, and we hope you’ll share your insights as we unpack the issue. Notebook from Sydney Because I’m director of the New York Times Gender Initiative, many people I met on my travels wanted to talk me about women and Trump and women and sexual harassment and women and Harvey and women and the workplace and women and women and women. But they also had a few things to share, too. The rumblings from women and people in their 20s and 30s began almost at once: “Australian politics is a boys’ club. The journalists here don’t cover politicians as aggressively as they do in the U.S. Exhibit A (and B and C and D): Barnaby Joyce!” “And the press! The press! There are so few publications we identify with! Most young people just turn away and shrug.” “And the defamation laws! It’s almost impossible for the press to cover sexual harassment. Meanwhile, sexual harassment is rife in universities, at workplaces and on and on!” And yet. The Sydney Opera House was hosting a day all about women called “All About Women.” Attendees who were mostly women (and a few odd men out) turned out in the thousands. The festival aired around the country on local TV stations. People tuned in. And yet. The ABC devoted episodes to International Women’s Day and two ABC national radio stations (Fran Kelly and Richard Glover) invited me on to talk Harvey Weinstein and, you guessed it, women. And yet. Gay marriage had been recently legalized. And the city of Sydney would pay homage to the passing of the law at its 40th Anniversary Mardi Gras celebrations. And yet. Barnaby Joyce, the former deputy prime minister, a champion of family values, who had fathered a child with a staff member who was not his wife, and accepted a rent-free townhouse from a millionaire politician, had stepped down from his post. On the surface it looked like progress but underneath, was it? It got me thinking: What should women (and others) in Australia realistically expect from a gender movement? Are hopes pinned too high? Or do expectations not go far enough? So here are my questions for you, Australia: How do you think the movement in Australia compares with the wave of accountability sweeping the rest of the world? And what does gender progress in a macho country like Australia look like, anyway? Tell us what you what you think.

Sign up and forward to your friends for insight and discussion about Australia and the world. ______ Whenever we ask Australia Letter readers for feedback on big, complicated issues — from China to race to gender — thoughtful responses pour in, making our entire bureau more informed about the country we cover. This back and forth is vital. It’s what journalism in a networked world can and should look like. And so before I share your input on #MeToo and gender in Australia — based on questions last week from Francesca Donner, director of the New York Times Gender Initiative — I wanted to again just say thank you to everyone who has written in, this time and in the past. Also, just to explain how I pick which emails to include in these roundups — I generally look for trends in the feedback, ideas or thoughts contributed by more than one reader. In this case, many of you wrote about how “gendered” Australia is, splitting off men and women from a young age, which is why I’ve included more than one comment about that. I also look for a mix of perspectives and backgrounds, and I try to mix up the tone in a way that reflects the mood and range of reader feedback. Sometimes I lightly edit for space or clarity; there’s never enough room for everyone’s comments (sorry about that). But generally, my goal is to give you back a curated and interesting version of what you, as a group, gave us.

Now for your answers to our questions about #MeToo in Australia, gender and where it’s heading next, followed by stories of the week, and a call from our food critic for restaurant recommendations in Perth. I think the #MeToo movement in Australia — which has gone after a couple of high-profile media personalities — has not been as visible or vocal as in the U.S. You mention the defamation laws, which is one reason why, but I also believe it’s because we don’t have a strong female leader advocating for women’s rights. Don’t get me wrong, there are some excellent investigative journalists exposing serious issues (Tracey Spicer, Kate McClymont etc.), but we don’t have a Rose McGowan or Ashley Judd — someone who is willing to speak out not just about their own experience but about the broader discrimination and harassment issues facing women. As a result the #MeToo movement relies on investigative media stories for attention and when the news moves on, #MeToo gets left behind. I think the other constraining factor is a cultural one. Many Australians like to say ‘we’re nothing like the U.S.’ For example we’re not (or at least we think we aren’t) as litigious, we don’t love guns and our politics isn’t as brash or cultlike (I’m thinking of all the clapping when a politician gives a speech). This gives Australians an excuse to say #MeToo is really an issue for Americans, not us. I don’t believe this, but it’s a belief that sits below the surface for many. A local leader of the movement could address this. Gender progress here is the same as everywhere else. The #MeToo movement has brought to light the unacceptable and appalling behavior of many men. However, this reflects only what’s above the surface. It’s what’s below the surface that needs to be addressed if we want real, long-lasting change. And what sits below the surface is the gendered way we treat girls (and boys) from the day they are born. We accept and excuse certain behaviors for boys (I’m thinking of boisterous loud and aggressive behaviors). If as a society we can look at a behavior and say it is acceptable or not, and take the gendered bias away, then we would have a fairer world. Girls and boys will grow up expecting the same behavior from each other, and call each other out when they don’t. Alas, I have grown up in a world that hasn’t done this, and I see my 6-year-old daughter facing the same bias. — Pip Nagy If the world thinks of us as a particularly macho country, it’s the inertia of our popular cultural image. It’s a ‘Crocodile Dundee’ vision of Australia as rough-speaking, rugged, rural and masculine. But Australia is changed and changing, shedding its caricatures. Today, more than a third of Australians were born overseas. Two-thirds of us live in capital cities and women outnumber men in all but one of them. Not to mention Paul Hogan hasn’t lived in Australia since last century. There will always be Australians who maintain and proclaim our so-called macho image. However for many, and for the majority of younger people, this image is an anachronism. Gender progress reflects this change, demonstrated in the #MeToo and Time’s Up conversations flourishing in Twitter feeds and public spaces. The global wave of accountability has had an impact beyond public panels and television specials. #MeToo has played first fiddle to several falls from grace in Australia, among them an iconic entertainer and a high-profile politician. It has infiltrated debates about national and institutional policy and civil and criminal law. If the ripples in Australia have not matched the tidal wave seen in the States, it may only be a matter of time until a critical mass of Australian voices joins the global conversation. For the moment, whether our hopes are too high or expectations too low depends on who is being asked the question. — Jill Masters What Francesca observed is the two Australias. Australia is a largely progressive, politically engaged, compassionate nation — #auspol is one of the most active Twitter discussions in the world. The community is highly reactive to issues of the day, cares a lot about public perception and the ‘pub test,’ and egalitarianism / equality (to the point of suffocating ambition and achievement, cf. ‘Tall Poppy Syndrome’) is one of Australia’s strongest national values. We got right on board with #MeToo. We were primed to do so by a strong debate around domestic violence that had been riding high since Rosie Batty was Australian of the Year. In a way, our shift in psyche was not as severe as it was in other countries. Tracey Spicer trying to claim credit or ownership of it, and last week implying that it was a thing that happened in America to differentiate it from her Now campaign, has actually been quite infuriating and insulting to the many hundreds of thousands of Australian women who said #MeToo, including myself. But there are other parts of our culture, particularly in rural areas, that mitigate that liberation, and the fight against sexual and domestic violence. The tolerance of such violence parlays into the tolerance of Barnaby Joyce. I come from New England — it’s my home electorate — and I know every square inch of it well. The University of New England has the highest rate of sexual harassment and assault of any university campus in the country. Smaller towns in the area like Inverell have domestic violence and sexual/indecent assault rates as much as two and half times the state average. There are few local supports for domestic violence and sexual assault victims. The communities are so small and social pressure so high that most crimes of this nature remain unreported. In the city, and even larger coastal towns, there is a refusal to accept such behavior; support services are provided; and #MeToo resonated strongly. #MeToo was heard in places like New England, but they didn’t join in — to do so would have meant social death. With such small populations, spread out over such vast land spaces, you need your neighbors, you tolerate abuse, and you don’t speak out about such troubles. You keep the peace so you can stay living in your town — the next town might be two or three hours’ drive away, not 10 minutes, and there’s certainly little to no public transport to get you out of town if you needed it. Given that, you won’t be surprised to learn that more young women than young men leave their rural communities and do not return. — Raphaella Kathryn Crosby The change in the role of women due to second-wave feminism in the 1960s is the key cause of Australia’s negative birthrate and the aging of the population. On this basis feminism is biologically dysfunctional whilst patriarchality is biologically functional. Therefore the promotion of feminist sexual equality in politics, business and society in Australia is not the way for the greatest number of young women to find happiness in marriage and children or in the best interests of Australia. So how do we change our currently biologically dysfunctional culture to one in which the maximum number of young women can find happiness in marriage and children and restore a positive birthrate? I don’t know the answer, but if there is one, I suspect it will come from women, not men — and from women born in the 21st century. In the interim, helping Australians understand the negative impacts of feminism and not supporting or promoting it further would seem a prudent course. When a society uses its young women for wealth creation, rather than procreation, it eats the seed corn of its future. As a result of feminism women are no longer pregnant and barefoot in the kitchen but now are increasingly well heeled and childless in the boardroom. — Paul McFadyen I am a junior in college in the U.S. and am currently studying in Australia for the semester, in Brisbane. Before I left, I was under the impression that the cultural norms of gender would be similar to what I had experienced in the U.S. — not perfect but actively seeking ways to improve itself for the most part, or at least in my opinion. News such as the legalization of gay marriage and the extent of the #MeToo movement here along with other stories you had mentioned convinced me of this. But the first thing I noticed when I got here was how gendered everything was. The floors of my dorm were gendered, my orientation week consistently paired people only in opposite genders, the police officer who came in to talk about sexual assault proposed that the girls play up their feminine stereotypes to trick the assumed sex-obsessed males in order to prevent rape. In my residential college of over three hundred people, I can only name one person who is openly gay. During dinner, one of the freshmen asked me if it was true “if the United States really had people who didn’t believe in male or female, and called themselves they instead” as the rest of the table snickered. In general, I find that the men are overwhelmingly masculine and the women are overwhelmingly feminine in a polarizing sort of way. This is all while I take classes at the university in anthropology in which we talk openly about the same topics in gender and sexuality as I did in those classes back home. To summarize, I have found through living here that the external culture and internal culture of gender and sexuality have not quite aligned in the way I had assumed. This might just be the demographic I am most exposed to, or the city I am living in, but it truly has been quite surprising. — Ann Bisognano ______ Federal investigators in the United States raided the office of President Trump’s personal lawyer this week.

Now he has a corner office at N.H.L. headquarters in Manhattan, where he is completing his first season as senior vice president for player safety. While he might seem like an unusual choice for the position, Parros said the two jobs are more similar than they might seem. “I kind of say, joking around I guess, but when I was playing, I was protecting 23 guys, and now, I’m protecting 800 guys,” Parros, 38, said. “I always did see it like that. Whatever you think of my career, I was definitely always concerned that no one was taking runs at my guys, and making sure there was a presence on the ice if they did.” He has the final say on league suspensions and fines for unsportsmanlike, illegal and even reckless play, but his work involves far more. “We hope we maintain a safe environment for the players,” he said. “We hope we can affect the game in a positive manner and keep it safe.” Parros, who scored 18 goals in 474 regular-season games and helped the Anaheim Ducks win the Stanley Cup in 2007, was never suspended as a player. He acknowledged that he was in the league more for his size than his skill. Sometimes, that meant engaging in fights — 169 of them. Because of a heightened emphasis on speed and finesse, fighting has declined drastically, to 0.26 fights per game from 0.65 fights per game in 2008-9, when Parros participated in 23 regular-season fights with the Ducks. The player safety department was created in 2011. “I think the game has been cleaned up quite considerably, but there are still dangers out there,” he said. “We’re trying to figure out what those are and how to deal with them.” The deputy commissioner Bill Daly said Parros was a very good fit for this role. “I know that many people think that, because of the role he played during his N.H.L. career, he must not ‘think the game,’” Daly said. “Just the opposite is true.” Parros spends much of his time talking to team officials and players about ways to make the game safer. Although a player who tests the limits of the rules might not warrant a suspension or a fine, Parros often lets him know the league is watching. “The game has changed dramatically,” Parros said. “It’s tremendously faster than when I played. Some of the things we deal with now deal with the speed of that game. There are a lot more accidental collisions. There’s a lot more things that happen with less intention than when I played. There was a lot more head-hunting going on, head shots, perhaps more reckless behavior. Guys looking to hurt or injure, in some manner.” Parros’s department has four advisers: Stephane Quintal, Parros’s predecessor; Damian Echevarrieta, the group vice president, who has an encyclopedic memory of past infractions; Patrick Burke, the senior director; and Ray Whitney, the director. Quintal and Whitney are also former N.H.L. players. The department’s nerve center is a windowless room down the hall from Parros’s office. Each N.H.L. game is monitored in real time by a staff member on two screens, often one with the home team’s television feed, the other with the visiting team’s feed. National network feeds are also used. “In today’s game,” Parros said, “you can see everything.” If an incident merits closer examination, the monitors alert Parros and his advisers by phone, including details like the infraction, the player’s suspension and fine history, the opponent, and, perhaps most important, the player’s next game. Video of the incident is available. Parros said it is vital to make a decision as quickly as possible so he can tell the team’s general manager if the committee is contemplating a suspension. He describes the process as “case law,” in that most infractions have precedents. “I might have an inclination of what I want to do,” Parros said, “but I’ll wait to get all the thoughts in and parse through the thoughts and figure out if I want to proceed further.” A player facing punishment always receives a hearing to tell his side of the story — by telephone, often the day after a game. When a decision is made, a detailed explanation, with video, is posted on the league’s website. In the final minutes of the first period of a March 6 game in Boston between the Bruins and the Red Wings, for example, Boston’s David Backes was penalized for a high, hard, late check against Detroit’s Frans Nielsen, who was forced to leave the game. Parros and his assistants were alerted minutes after the period ended. He solicited advice from the others, and Backes’s hearing was scheduled for noon the next day. Backes received a three-game suspension, without pay, the first of his career. Parros grew up in Randolph, N.J., but Princeton contacted him only after he played at a summer camp in Montreal, then was told that he should play a year in juniors. He scored 30 goals in 54 games for the Chicago Freeze of the North American Hockey League, then enrolled at Princeton, where he scored 20 goals in four seasons. Parros spent summers working out with the Los Angeles Kings, who drafted him in the eighth round in 1999. “By the time I was a junior in college, I realized I’d be putting all my eggs in this basket,” Parros said of playing hockey. “I didn’t want any regrets: ‘Close to being a pro but never made it.’ I didn’t really overly prepare for business interviews, Wall Street, all that stuff.” Parros played two full seasons for the Kings’ farm team in Manchester, N.H., then a full season for the Kings before they cut him in 2006. He played two games for the Colorado Avalanche before he was traded to the Ducks, where he spent most of six seasons. Parros then closed his career with the Florida Panthers and the Montreal Canadiens. In October 2013, he sustained a concussion and was hospitalized after he fell face-first to the ice during a fight in his first game with Montreal. He sustained another concussion in a fight two months later. Parros retired in 2014. But he was not done with hockey. He lived in Las Vegas, attending games in nearby cities for two years. Then Quintal, who in 2014 succeeded Brendan Shanahan as the head of the player safety department, called Parros. He worked under Quintal last season. “I was scouting for myself, freelance scouting,” Parros said. “You never know who you’re going to see up in the press box. It was just for me to stay current in the game, to stick around. Show my face, make sure I still knew what was going on.” Parros says he is quite happy with his latest career opportunity. “This is an interesting job,” he said. “I don’t call it a fun job, because it’s not fun to take guys off the ice and dock their pay and tell G.M.’s and everybody else that they’re being held out. But it is an interesting job. I’m enjoying it.” An earlier version of this article quoted incorrectly from comments made by George Parros comparing the way hockey is played now to how it was during his career. He said, “There was a lot more head-hunting going on, head shots, perhaps more reckless behavior” — not “There’s a lot more headhunting going on, head shots, perhaps more reckless behavior.”",The New York Times
2018,"George Wallace Tapped Into Racial Fear. Decades Later, Its Force Remains Potent.","Retro Report Separated by as much as half a century, the two men’s public lives run strikingly parallel. It’s as if they drank from the same political cup: George C. Wallace, the Alabama governor who ached to become president, and Donald J. Trump, the developer and showman who made it to the top. They are bound by their streaks of opportunism and by their campaigns tailored to resentful voters brimming with the conviction that society’s deck is stacked against them. “What both share is the demagogue’s instinctive ability to tap into the fear and anger that regularly erupts in American politics,” Dan T. Carter, a historian and Wallace biographer, wrote in The New York Times during the 2016 presidential campaign. Retro Report, a collection of video documentaries examining major news stories of the past and their enduring impact, begins a new series with a look at the rise and fall of Mr. Wallace, a four-time governor and three-time presidential candidate who embodied the populist conservatism now associated with Mr. Trump. Mr. Wallace is probably best remembered for his fierce opposition to racial integration. Having lost a campaign for governor in 1958 with relatively tolerant views on race, he vowed not to be outdone on that score ever again. In January 1963, delivering his first inaugural address, he pledged to protect “the great Anglo-Saxon Southland” with this battle cry: “Segregation now, segregation tomorrow and segregation forever.” Five months later, in an exercise that was more stagecraft than true resistance, he made a futile “stand in the schoolhouse door” to keep two black students from enrolling in the University of Alabama. But his appeal for many white working-class men and women extended beyond Alabama’s borders and even beyond matters of race. When he ran for president — briefly in 1964, more substantially in 1968, 1972 and 1976 — he found ready support among white ethnic groups in the industrial Midwest, which even then were wilting economically as factories closed and populations migrated south and west. Perhaps not coincidentally, it is the very region that gave Mr. Trump his surprising triumph in 2016. The two men fired up crowds in similar fashion. Both appealed to “forgotten” Americans, stoking fear and loathing of “the other” — blacks in Mr. Wallace’s case, immigrants in Mr. Trump’s (though he also has had race cards up his sleeve, as with his embrace of “birtherism” to discredit President Barack Obama). The message from both was that a nefarious other, enabled by a bumbling government, was stealing work and wealth from upright Americans. “Wallace understood that there were people who were hurting, struggling, losing jobs,” B. Drummond Ayres Jr., who long covered the South for The Times, told Retro Report. “He tapped into that and appealed to that, because folks that are struggling often feel put upon.” The similarities between then and now are unmistakable. Mr. Wallace demonized the federal government as an oppressor trampling on states’ rights. Mr. Trump and his ardent supporters denounce Washington as “the swamp” and its bureaucracy as a malevolent “deep state.” Mr. Wallace told listeners in 1968 that they had been treated like “a doormat long enough.” Mr. Trump said when he declared his candidacy that the United States had become “a dumping ground for everybody else’s problems.” Mr. Wallace sneered at the press, often singling out The Times for special scorn. Mr. Trump can hardly pass up a Twitter opportunity to rail about “fake news,” especially in the “failing” Times. He has gone so far as to call the news media in general an “enemy of the American people.” In speeches, both took delight in belittling people. Mr. Wallace made rhetorical pin cushions of “pointy-head college professors who can’t even park a bicycle straight.” At one of his rallies, he called out to a longhaired male protester, “Oh, I thought you were a she.” Mr. Trump has yet to meet a demeaning adjective he doesn’t like, with his “Crooked Hillary,” “Lyin’ Ted,” “Liddle Bob Corker” and other insults. Both exhorted audiences to get physically rough with hecklers. Both called for certain malefactors to be put to death. “Bam, shoot ’em dead on the spot!” Mr. Wallace said in 1968, referring to those rioting in America’s cities. Last month, Mr. Trump said drug dealers should be executed. The two men even had similar speech mannerisms, often saying the exact same sentence twice in rapid succession. For a time, a George Wallace presidency was not an outlandish notion. He ran well on the American Independent Party ticket in 1968, capturing 13.5 percent of the popular vote and the 45 electoral votes of five southern states — Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana and Mississippi — plus a “faithless elector” in North Carolina, a state won by Richard M. Nixon. In 1972, Mr. Wallace seemed to have the wind at his back in pursuing the Democratic presidential nomination, until he was gravely wounded by a would-be assassin’s bullets at a campaign stop in Maryland. From then on, his was a life in a wheelchair and in constant pain. (The gunman, Arthur Bremer, now 67, served 35 years of a 53-year prison sentence and was paroled in 2007.) Mr. Wallace had one more presidential race in him, in 1976, but he quickly faded. Six years later, he was elected Alabama governor for a fourth time. But long before then, he cast himself as a changed, even chastened, man on race relations. In 1973, he crowned the University of Alabama’s first black homecoming queen, Terry Points. More substantively, he began speaking remorsefully about his race-baiting past — how wrong it was and how sorry he was. In 1979, he went to a church in Montgomery, Ala., where the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. had once been pastor. There, he spoke of having learned the meaning of suffering. “I think I can understand something of the pain that black people have come to endure,” he said. “I know I contributed to that pain, and I can only ask your forgiveness.” African-Americans in Alabama granted him redemption. They voted for him in large numbers in his final runs for governor. After he died in 1998 at age 79, Representative John Lewis, an icon of the civil rights era, wrote in The Times that “George Wallace should be remembered for his capacity to change.” Even so, questions linger about the genuineness of his personal road to Damascus. After all, as time passed, he needed to appeal to Alabama’s expanding black electorate if he hoped for political survival. “Only the good Lord knows whether or not he was sincere,” Mr. Ayres said. But at least Mr. Wallace, once a great divider, had the capacity to say “I’m sorry.” For all their oratorical similarities, that is where he and Mr. Trump notably diverge. “I’m sorry.” Those are two words conspicuously missing from the Trump lexicon.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | George Weah: Don’t Forget About Liberia,"Op-Ed Contributor Mr. Weah is the president of Liberia. MONROVIA, Liberia — I grew up in the Gibraltar area of Clara Town, a slum in Monrovia, the capital of Liberia. Sport was my passport out of poverty. A combination of luck and hard work enabled me to make my improbable journey from the dusty football fields of Clara Town to glamorous stadiums in Europe. I played professional football for the biggest clubs in the world and was honored to be the first African named FIFA World Player of the Year. On Jan. 22, I returned to the Samuel Doe football stadium in Monrovia — a beloved venue where I had played numerous games — to take the oath of office as the president of Liberia. It was the nation’s first peaceful, democratic transfer of power in almost 75 years. I stood in the stadium proud and aware of the great responsibility of leading Team Liberia. Growing up as a poor child, I intimately saw and experienced the hardships an ordinary Liberian faced. I know the difficulties and horrors our people suffered before and during the crippling conflicts that tore Liberia apart from 1989 to 2003. In the mid- and the late ’90s, I often returned home as a good-will ambassador for the United Nations Children’s Fund to help draw attention to my people’s plight and to work to disarm child soldiers. I moved back to Liberia in 2003. The arrival of peacekeepers the same year, first from our West African neighbors and then from the United Nations, helped end 14 years of successive, brutal civil wars, which killed around 250,000 people and displaced around two million. Liberia’s people were traumatized, the public sector virtually decimated and the infrastructure reduced to rubble. Through the United Nations, the world offered a hand and we took it. On March 30, the U.N. Mission in Liberia successfully completed its mandate, having helped disarm and rehabilitate combatants and helped families to return home. Liberia’s police and army, which once preyed on the population, began to be professionalized. Over the years, the U.N. mission helped the Liberian government extend state authority and promote human rights. Liberia held three successful presidential elections, assumed full responsibility for our own security and overcame the horrors of Ebola. We began to repair the torn social fabric of our country. We began to heal and to build. We are grateful for the remarkable work and bravery of the U.N. mission personnel. We honor and remember the sacrifice of the 202 peacekeepers who lost their lives in Liberia. President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf played an integral role in Liberia’s revival and helped build the foundation on which we stand today. I carry forward the torch from her. I am excited and humbled, ready to get to work. I must acknowledge the enormous tasks ahead. We need to build a stable and sustainable peace and ensure that our dire socioeconomic situation does not undermine the hard-fought gains of the past 15 years. Liberia’s economy is broken and the government is broke. According to the World Bank, the gross domestic product per capita was $455 in 2016. Inflation is at 15 percent and rising, and unemployment is at record highs. The U.N. human development index ranks Liberia 177 out of 189 countries. We are determined to move forward. The core of my efforts will be helping the worst off in Liberia. Education will play a central role in pushing the economy forward. We are rebooting our educational system so that everyone can have access to quality education. I am disbursing funds to enable our 12th graders to take the standardized West African Examinations Council examination and attend universities across the region. The most effective way to improve the lives of the poor and reduce inequality is to ensure that government officials do not skim public resources. I intend to use legislation and build upon our current code of conduct to limit conflicts of interest involving government employees, enhance transparency over public processes and punish violators. We are also drafting legislation to make our ministries more effective and efficient in addressing the specific challenges they face. We are decentralizing the government to make it more accessible to the people. We are reforming our land rights regulations to ensure equity for all Liberians. We are investing in infrastructure and roads to improve connectivity across the country and promoting agriculture to ensure self-sufficiency and nutrition for all. To sustain a peaceful and stable Liberia, we are examining ways to strengthen national integration by enacting laws promoting national unification. We are working on reforming our judicial system to ensure the basic rights of all citizens are protected. It will require sustained engagement from both my government and the citizens of the country. We do need the assistance of our friends outside Liberia. Building a stable, prosperous, democratic Liberia in the heart of West Africa is firmly in the interests of all nations, including the United States. To ensure economic growth and make Liberia attractive for investment, I have committed to removing unnecessary regulations and bureaucratic hurdles. We need urgent reforms in a number of areas, including removal of restrictions on dual citizenship and regulations that limit land ownership to Liberian citizens. Liberia is open for business and my government will take every measure to support economic growth and bring prosperity to all our people. But we do need continued support from our international partners. Don’t forget Liberia as we move from recovery to development. We are not asking for charity; we are looking for a chance. We need partners to walk with us on the road to progress and development.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | German Conservatism Is Making a Comeback,"Anna Sauerbrey Ms. Sauerbrey is an editor on the opinion page of the newspaper Der Tagesspiegel. Berlin — After years of Angela Merkel’s formless centrism and the rise of the far right, is German conservatism making a comeback? Last Saturday the Werteunion, or Union of Values, met in the small town of Schwetzingen, near Heidelberg, to adopt what its members called the “conservative manifesto.” Their mission: taking back their party from Ms. Merkel’s faction and redirecting it to its traditional, conservative roots. The Werteunion was founded in March 2017, but the event in Schwetzingen, the group’s first national meeting, was also the first time most people in Germany had heard of it. Whether it gains traction, and whether its principles change as it grows, remain to be seen. But there’s no argument that the Werteunion fills a hole in the political landscape, and responds to the rightward tilt of many voters. It’s not too early to ask: Will the Werteunion render the resurgent far right obsolete? Or will it legitimize it? Alexander Mitsch, one of the Werteunion’s founders, is typical of the new German conservative. He joined the Christian Democrats in the early 1980s, he told me, when Helmut Kohl first became chancellor. He engaged in local politics, but left when his career in the private sector took off. Flash forward to the fall of 2015, when the images of tens of thousands of migrants and refugees crossing the German border became daily television fodder. Mr. Mitsch said he felt that the state was failing, and that he needed to act: “I did not want my children to ask me one day, ‘Dad, you knew back then, so why didn’t you do anything?’” Like many Germans, and not only those on the right, Mr. Mitsch says he is worried that political Islam could change the country. He feels that the Western European culture needs to be defended. He demands a full stop of immigration until the country can process the pile of open asylum cases. And he is convinced that the Christian Democratic Union won’t retrieve its conservative roots as long as it is led by Angela Merkel. According to Mr. Mitsch, the Werteunion has more than 1,000 members nationwide — a tiny fraction of the Christian Democrats’ 420,000 members. But there’s a reason its meeting in a small western German town made national news: The nation’s politics are changing rapidly, and there’s a sense that everything is up for grabs. The Werteunion is also a sign of a larger trend. For about a decade, conservatism seemed to be vanishing from a German society intent on becoming ever more progressive. In recent months, however, conservative intellectuals and policymakers have started to speak up. A few weeks ago, Uwe Tellkamp, one of Germany’s most renowned novelists, claimed that “95 percent” of immigrants were not really refugees, but migrants seeking a better living. He’s wrong — in 2017, 43 percent of all immigrants applying for asylum were granted humanitarian status — and Mr. Tellkamp faced harsh criticism for using false figures in such a charged debate. But his comments also caught fire on the right. A group of conservative publicists and intellectuals published a “declaration” of solidarity, signed initially by some 30 people, members of a conservative salon. As of this week, the declaration, expressing concern over “Germany being damaged by illegal mass immigration,” has more than 100,000 signatories. Traditionally, the anchor of German conservatism in the Bundestag has been the Christian Social Union, the Bavarian sister party of Ms. Merkel’s Christian Democrats. In the run-up to this year’s state elections in Bavaria, it too has been hardening its position on immigration and integration, explicitly to block the far-right Alternative for Germany party, known by its German abbreviation AfD. “If we talk and act in a manner that broad groups have painfully missed recently, we can render the AfD obsolete,” said Alexander Dobrindt, who heads the Christian Social Union’s caucus at the Bundestag. In January, Mr. Dobrindt published his own conservative manifesto in the German newspaper Die Welt. The majority in Germany, he writes, thinks and feels “bürgerlich” — a term often rendered in English as “civic,” but in German, it also encompasses a sense of tradition, orderliness and normality. According to Mr. Dobrindt, the “civic” majority is underrepresented in the public debate, which, he claims, is dominated by left-leaning opinion leaders. It is time, he writes, for a “conservative revolution.” But what would be gained if the AfD vanishes yet populist thought seeps into mainstream politics? On the one hand, the “new conservatives” share some of the tangible policy positions held by the AfD — a reduction in immigration, repatriation of migrants, stronger domestic security policies. These are not new conservative policies per se, and they are a part of mainstream politics. But with the traditional right embracing them so loudly in the context of a resurgent far right, there’s no question that the far right itself is gaining ground as an ideology. There’s a new radicalism in the new conservatism. Like the AfD, the new conservatives see immigration not just as a practical problem that poses difficulties for the welfare system, integration, housing and security. Many frame it as an existential threat to Germany’s national identity, and to “the Occident” more broadly. “Existential” threats can legitimize extraordinary measures. Many new conservatives like to think of themselves as rebels against the Merkelian status quo. They often call themselves the “silent majority,” large in number but underrepresented in the country’s news media and political institutions. It’s an old trope, and not unique to Germany, but again, context matters — and in today’s climate, it reinforces the idea that there is something fundamentally wrong with our democratic system. The implication is that the system does not recognize the true interests of society. It also suggests that the system can no longer be changed by democratic deliberation, but that a more fundamental opposition may be needed, and a deposing of the elites allegedly manipulating the system in their favor. In brief, the new conservatism is populist. Their words betray them. The term “conservative revolution,” which Mr. Dobrindt used in his Die Welt essay, goes back to Armin Mohler, a journalist who in the 1950s was the private secretary to the far-right novelist Ernst Jünger. Mohler published a history of the conservative anti-democrats of the 1920s, who embraced the phrase and, in doing so, arguably made it easier for Nazism to rise a few years later. The historical allusion may not have been intended. Mr. Dobrindt appears to see himself as a longtime and upright conservative fighting the evil of populism, reclaiming some of the key concepts the far right has snatched from German conservatives during times of ideological neglect: patriotism, the nation, “Heimat” (or “home”). This may be authentic. The question is: Will the semantic magic work? Or will the embrace of far-right ideas as “bürgerlich” politics render them acceptable to the German public?",The New York Times
2018,German Food Bank Reopens Doors to New Foreign Applicants,"BERLIN — A German food bank is to begin considering non-German applicants again next week, after setting off a national debate on refugees and poverty by deciding to bar any more foreigners from signing up for its service. The food bank, in the western city of Essen, found itself at the center of a storm that brought it international media attention, vociferous support from some Germans — reflected in increased donations — and a public rebuke from Chancellor Angela Merkel. Its case became a talking point in the continued conversation over the country’s decision, three years ago, to welcome more than a million refugees. Jörg Sartor, volunteer director of the food bank, the Essener Tafel, said he had made the initial policy change in part because the proportion of foreigners among the organization’s users had risen over those years to three-quarters of its clients from one-third. But on Wednesday, Jochen Brühl, the chairman of the national Tafel organization, which oversees a network of 934 food banks, appeared keen to play down both the initial decision and the reversal. “With all the media attention, Mr. Brühl said, “one should not forget that this decision was temporary from the beginning.” Mr. Sartor, a retired coal worker, made the initial change when the food bank found itself needing to limit its intake of clients in December, but it became a subject of widespread controversy in February, after being reported in a local newspaper. The Essen food bank has 120 volunteers and distributes food to nearly 6,000 people. Mr. Sartor estimated that it would turn away about 60 non-German applicants a week while the admissions bar was in place; it continued to serve foreigners who were already on its books. Critics said such organizations should make decisions based on need, not on nationality, but many Germans applauded the Essen food bank’s approach, arguing that when with regard to social services, poor Germans should come first. “Racists at the Essener Tafel? As if!” read one headline in the newspaper Bild. One volunteer resigned over the policy. Protest graffiti appeared on the Essener Tafel’s offices in an old water tower and on the food bank’s trucks. And as the controversy attracted national coverage, Ms. Merkel declared, “You shouldn’t categorize people like this.” The decision to reopen the pantry to all applicants was taken by representatives of the food bank and the city, and announced on Tuesday. If intake needed to be limited again, the announcement said, priority would be given to older people and families with young children, and would not be determined on the basis of nationality. “We now have to talk about the fact that the food banks aren’t the problem, poverty is,” Mr. Brühl said. The Tafel food banks give donated food to people who have trouble making ends meet. To prevent chaotic handouts, they require newcomers to demonstrate proof of need. In Essen, applicants are seen on Wednesdays and are then assigned a specific weekday on which to pick up food. Non-Germans can start applying again next Wednesday.",The New York Times
2018,"Gerson Leiber, 96, Dies; Artist Created Museum With Designer Wife","Gerson Leiber, an American modernist painter whose ambitions were stunted until he attended art school in Budapest, where he had served in the Army during World War II, died on Saturday at his home in Springs, N.Y., a hamlet in East Hampton. He was 96. He died of a heart attack hours before his wife of 72 years, Judith Leiber, the renowned handbag designer, died, also of a heart attack, at 97. They were buried together on Monday. Jeffrey Sussman, the couple’s biographer and spokesman, said Mr. Leiber, who had congestive heart failure, told his wife on Friday night, “Sweetie, it’s time for both of us to go.” They were a tight-knit couple who built distinctive and, at times, complementary careers — he, an artist raised in Titusville, Pa.; she, a Hungarian-born artisan whose handbags were sought-after accessories for first ladies dating to Mamie Eisenhower. In 2008, they opened the Leiber Collection, a museum dedicated to their work on their property in Springs, where the expansive gardens were designed by Mr. Leiber. Mr. Leiber, known as Gus, was noted for energetic, lyrical and colorful paintings, which he continued to create into his 90s. “He was a true modernist, experimenting with form and technique and exploring Abstract Expressionism alongside the artists who would go on to define the movement, like de Kooning and Pollock,” said Jess Frost, associate curator of Guild Hall, the entertainment, arts and education center in East Hampton, N.Y. Ms. Frost, who had cataloged the Leibers’ work at their museum, added, in a telephone interview, “He shifted easily between styles and was fearlessly committed to a new body of work that at times was altogether different from what he had been doing a year earlier.” Mr. Leiber’s paintings ranged from abstract landscapes to representational, if stylized, fashion figures — some of which Ms. Leiber used for her handbag designs. He also made prints and sculptures. In 2014, Mr. Leiber showed some of his later paintings in an exhibition at the Carter Burden Gallery on West 28th Street in Manhattan. “It’s very rare to paint for 70 years, every day, which is what he did,” Marlena Vaccaro, the gallery’s director, said in a telephone interview. “His skill level, his commitment to the process of painting, was an inspiration. He kept his creative flow going and did not repeat the past. His paintings had a vital and beautiful quality to them.” Mr. Leiber called the paintings in the show “the summation of a long search for clarity, honesty and beauty.” His works are in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the National Gallery of Art in Washington and the Whitney Museum of American Art, among other museums. Mr. Leiber was born in Brooklyn on Nov. 12, 1921. His family — including his mother, Rebecca, and his father, William, a junk dealer — moved to Titusville, in northwest Pennsylvania, when he was a boy. While in school he developed an interest in art, but his hopes of becoming an artist were limited by his family’s poverty; to help make ends meet he worked as a soda jerk and newspaper delivery boy. After working as a printer at the local newspaper, he entered the Army and was assigned to its Signal Corps. Sergeant Leiber was stationed in North Africa and Italy before he was sent to Budapest as World War II was ending. There, in 1945, he met Judith Peto, who had begun selling her unusual handbags and purses to American soldiers. In their first encounter, on a street in Budapest, he invited her to attended the opera. She later told him that her family had a room to rent to a military officer. “She knew nothing about how the U.S. military made housing decisions,” Mr. Leiber told The New York Times last year. “She did, however, speak excellent English. I couldn’t find her a tenant, but I did fall in love.” Recalling their courtship, he told The New York Post last year that he brought the Peto family “a few gifts of large cans of chicken from the mess hall.” Judith Peto encouraged him to attend art school, where his talent thrived. They married in early 1946 and immigrated soon after to the United States. When the couple visited his family in Titusville — home to a 19th-century oil boom — Mr. Leiber asked his mother where she had put the drawings of nude models he had sent her from Budapest. She had burned them all, she replied, because “they were immoral.” The Leibers soon headed to New York, where he enrolled in the Art Students League, coming under the influence of the painter Will Barnet. He also studied engraving at the Brooklyn Museum Art School. Ms. Leiber designed handbags to support him while he was in school, and years later he urged her to open her own company. “It sounds romantic,” Ms. Frost said, “but they shared a mind.” Mr. Leiber — who is survived by a brother, Dr. Joseph Leiber, and two sisters, Martha Dermer and Sarah Stachel — had said that he and his wife were fulfilled without having children. Their children “hang on walls and from arms and shoulders,” he told The Times in 1970, adding, “As a couple we felt complete and still do.” An earlier version of this obituary, using information from a family spokesman, omitted the names of two of Mr. Leiber’s survivors. In addition to his brother, Dr. Joseph Leiber, he is survived by two sisters, Martha Dermer and Sarah Stachel.",The New York Times
2018,"Gertrude Jeannette, Actor, Director and Cabdriver, Dies at 103","On her first day on the job, Gertrude Jeannette, believed to be the first woman to drive a cab in New York City, got in an accident — on purpose. She had pulled up in front of the Waldorf-Astoria hotel in Manhattan looking for a fare but was cut off by other taxi drivers. “In those days they didn’t allow black drivers to work downtown; you had to work uptown,” Ms. Jeannette, who was African-American, later recalled. “They said, ‘Say, buddy, you know you’re not supposed to be on this line.’” As cabbies hurled insults and hemmed her in, she remained calmly on the line — until, that is, a Checker cab lurched in front of her. “I rammed my fender under his fender, swung it over to the right and ripped it,” she said in 2011 at a ceremony in her honor at the Dwyer Cultural Center in Harlem. When the other driver got a good look at her, she recalled, he screamed: “A woman driver! A woman driver!” She was later reprimanded by an inspector, but she drove off with her very first customer. Ms. Jeannette, who was also one of the first women to get a motorcycle license in New York, and who later overcame a speech impediment to become a Broadway, film and television actor as well as a playwright, producer and director, died on April 4 at her home in Harlem. She was 103. Her niece Angela Hadley Brown confirmed the death. Ms. Jeannette got her hack license in 1942. She had responded to an ad in a newspaper looking for women to replace the male cabdrivers who had been drafted into World War II. “Women were going into plants and everything else, taking over jobs,” she recalled in a 2005 interview. “I said, well, I know one thing — I can drive a car.” “Thirty-two of us took the test and only two of us passed,” said Ms. Jeannette, who learned how to drive a Chrysler truck at the age of 13 in Arkansas. “But the other girl didn’t get her license because she had citations on her driver’s license. And so I, I was the first.” (Ms. Jeannette is widely thought to be the first woman to get a taxi license in New York City, said Allan Fromberg, the deputy commissioner for public affairs at the Taxi and Limousine Commission, but records from that period have been lost or destroyed. The first unlicensed female cabdriver in New York City was Wilma K. Russey in 1915.) Ms. Jeannette never wanted to act, she said, but was pushed into the theater. With the money she earned driving, she had set out to correct her childhood stammer by enrolling in the one speech class she could find, at the American Negro Theater, housed in the basement of what is today the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in Harlem. Acting instruction was part of the curriculum, and she studied alongside Sidney Poitier, Ruby Dee and Ossie Davis. She was quickly singled out for her stage presence and cast in her first Broadway production, “Lost in the Stars,” which had its premiere at the Music Box Theater in 1949. She would go on to land roles in Broadway productions like “The Long Dream” (1960), “Nobody Loves an Albatross” (1963), “The Amen Corner” (1965), “The Skin of Our Teeth” (1975) and “Vieux Carré” (1977), written by Tennessee Williams, with whom she became friends. Her film credits include “Cotton Comes to Harlem” (1970), “Shaft” (1971) and “Black Girl” (1972). Ms. Jeannette began writing plays in 1950 in response to what she saw as an absence of authentic black characters on the stage. “I saw parts that I knew I wouldn’t play,” she said in an interview in 1995. “And so I started writing about women, and strong women, that I knew that no one would be ashamed to play.” Gertrude Hadley was born on Nov. 28, 1914, in Urbana, Ark., about 15 miles from the Louisiana border. Her father, Willis Lawrence Hadley, taught at a mission on a Native American reservation near Spiro, Okla. Her mother, Salley Gertrude Crawford Hadley, was a homemaker. Gertrude grew up on a farm with five brothers and one sister, climbing walnut trees, playing stickball and fishing for trout. During the Depression, she moved with her family to Little Rock, Ark., and enrolled at Dunbar High School, a segregated school, where she recalled beginning each day singing “Lift Every Voice and Sing.” On her prom night, she met her future husband, Joe Jeannette, a heavyweight prizefighter 35 years her senior, who was in town from New York. The pair danced the Lindy Hop, a popular dance in Harlem, and by the end of the song he had asked her to marry him. “Just because I’m a small-town girl, I’m not a fool,” she recalled telling him, in 2005. “And I walked off the floor.” He persisted, and they eloped to New York in 1933. Mr. Jeannette was the president of the Harlem Dusters, a motorcycle club, and he taught his wife how to ride a motorcycle under the elevated train tracks (now demolished) on what is now Frederick Douglass Boulevard in Harlem. “The ‘el’ train, they had these big pillars,” she recalled. “And he would push me with no motor running, take the motorcycle and push me around, and have me to guide in and out those ‘el’ posts to get the swing of the motorcycle.” She got her motorcycle license in 1935, the same year she had her only son, Robert. He died at age 5. Her husband worked as a bodyguard of sorts for Paul Robeson, the baritone singer, actor and political activist. In 1949, the Harlem Dusters, including Gertrude, traveled to what was to be an open-air concert in Peekskill, N.Y. “That’s the first time I saw the Ku Klux Klan,” Ms. Jeannette recalled in 2015. “They came out to lynch Paul Robeson.” Klansmen set fire to crosses on the field, and American Legion members, protesting what they saw as Mr. Robeson’s affinity for the Soviet Union and communism, clashed with concertgoers. The melee became known as the Peekskill Riots. When the American Negro Theater closed in 1949, many of the company’s black actors moved to California or elsewhere. Some, including Ms. Jeannette, were barred from working during the Red Scare of the 1950s; she was singled out, she said, because of her association with Mr. Robeson. So Ms. Jeannette — “Mother Gertrude” or “Ms. J,” as she was known in Harlem — set up a succession of theater companies in the neighborhood, including the H.A.D.L.E.Y. players (the letters stand for Harlem Artist’s Development League Especially for You) in 1979. “She had many opportunities to go to Hollywood, but she always stayed in Harlem,” said Ward Nixon, who was the company’s artistic director. “She stayed in Harlem to make sure the community had top-notch theater.” A demanding director, Ms. Jeannette mentored a generation of young black actors in New York. She wrote five plays, which grappled with racism, politics, family ties and the importance of education. Her first, and her favorite, was “The Way Forward” (1950), which drew upon her childhood in Arkansas. In “A Bolt From the Blue,” she explored the so-called Bronx Slave Market — groups of black women who huddled outside department stores searching for jobs as day laborers or domestic workers in the 1930s and ′40s. “They were wonderfully dramatic pieces, punctuated by lighter moments throughout,” Mr. Nixon said of her work. “You always walked out of one of her plays feeling uplifted and encouraged.” She continued to act into her 80s and retired from directing at 98. Her husband died in 1956. She is survived by 10 nephews and 6 nieces. “Ms. Jeannette left on this earth the feeling of hope,” Mr. Nixon said. “That wherever you are in life, and whatever you want to do, you can always rise up.” An earlier version of this obituary referred incorrectly to Dunbar High School in Little Rock, Ark., which Ms. Jeannette attended. It was not a one-room schoolhouse.",The New York Times
2018,Get In Free if You’ll Wear a Swastika: A German Theater’s Provocation,"BERLIN — A play based on Adolf Hitler’s youth is sparking controversy for an unusual opening-night deal: Audience members willing to wear a swastika (provided by the theater) during the performance get in free. Those who prefer to pay full price are asked to wear the Star of David. And the opening night is on the 129th anniversary of the dictator’s birth. Producers of the play at the theater in Konstanz, a picturesque city in the south of Germany, say the action is part of an attempt to reinvigorate the national conversation about the dangers of fascism. But the production or collection of Nazi symbols with the intent for distribution or public use is illegal in Germany. The local public prosecutor’s office confirmed it had received several complaints in the days before the play’s opening on Friday. “By breaking a taboo, one must bring back the debate,” Christoph Nix, who has run the theater for over a decade, said in an interview. He added that the last thing he wanted to do was to upset Jewish people. But in Germany, such an action is controversial, whatever the intended goal. “Shall I wear a Jewish star like my parents were forced to? For me it isn’t a disguise,” Ruth Frenk, the head of the local chapter of the German-Israeli Society, said in an interview. In an open letter, Ms. Frenk and the head of a local group promoting interfaith dialogue criticized the theater, its decision to open the play on the anniversary of Hitler’s birth and the opening-night deal for free tickets. “The bizarre marketing ploy by the City Theater of Konstanz is not acceptable,” they wrote. Andreas Mathy of the public prosecutor’s office confirmed in a statement that it had received “several” complaints, but said it declined to investigate because the symbols were clearly covered by laws ensuring freedom of artistic expression. The theater has given an assurance that the symbols are crucial to the performance and that spectators will have to return the items before they leave. The play itself, “Mein Kampf” by George Tabori, which producers describe as a loud and colorful caricature, tells the story of a Hitler as young man trying to get established in the Vienna art scene, where he is befriended by an older Jewish man who takes pity on him. It was first performed in Vienna in 1987 and was made into a film in Germany in 2009. “We’re not talking about the actual piece, we are taking about the tastelessness around the admission,” Ms. Frenk said. “I don’t think it will make the piece any better.”",The New York Times

The country is about to spend a lot of time talking about James Comey again. Comey’s much-anticipated book will publish next week, and he will begin a publicity tour befitting a former president this coming weekend. My column this morning looks at Comey’s full, complicated legacy. I argue that he’s never deserved the harshest criticism he has received — as a partisan hack, out to get Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton or anyone else. I instead think of Comey as akin to a figure in a Greek tragedy, one whose greatest strength turned into his biggest weakness. Either way, he may well go down as the most significant supporting player of the Trump era. Syria. Syrian forces hit a suburb of Damascus on Saturday with bombs that reportedly unleashed toxic gas.

I’ll devote at least one newsletter to your answers this week. In the meantime, the debate over The Atlantic’s firing of Kevin Williamson — the writer who has called for the execution of women who get abortions — continues: In USA Today, Kirsten Powers argues that the issue isn’t about excluding conservative voices (even though a lack of ideological diversity in media is a real problem). She writes: “He was fired for being unable to have a reasoned, civil debate about abortion that doesn’t involve fantasizing not just about the government killing women who get abortions, but about how they kill them.” Slate’s Ruth Graham writes that Williamson’s views actually do a favor to abortion-rights advocates. “It would have been clarifying to see a pro-life writer follow his movement’s rhetoric to its logical endpoint: If abortion is murder, tens of millions of American women are murderers,” she writes. In his Sunday column, Ross Douthat agrees with the first of those two Graham arguments: that Williamson may hurt the pro-life cause. But Ross adds that liberals are too quick to excuse pro-abortion extremism, which is willing to kill human beings “for reasons of eugenics or convenience or any reason at all.” And Paul Krugman says that the issue comes from a structural problem on the political right: “The left has genuine public intellectuals with actual ideas and at least some real influence; the right does not.”",The New York Times

2018,"Getaway Driver in Brink’s Heist Merits New Parole Hearing, Judge Rules","A state judge has ordered a new parole hearing for Judith Clark, a former left-wing militant who took part in a 1981 armored car robbery that left three dead, saying the State Board of Parole’s decision last year to deny her parole was arbitrary and capricious. The judge, John J. Kelley of State Supreme Court in Manhattan, said the three-member board had focused too heavily on the severity of the crime and had given too little weight to Ms. Clark’s long record of good works in prison as well as to Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo’s decision in December 2016 to reduce her sentence. The judge ordered that a new parole hearing be held within 60 days. “Ms. Clark has undergone a remarkable transformation over the three decades during which she has been incarcerated,” Justice Kelley wrote in a decision made public on Friday. “Ms. Clark has taken responsibility for her actions, expressed remorse and tried to improve the lives of her fellow prisoners, as well as many others.” Ms. Clark, 68, drove a getaway car during the attempted robbery of a Brink’s armored car in Rockland County in 1981. The heist was part of a scheme by the May 19th Communist movement and a revolutionary black group to steal $1.6 million for financing a guerrilla uprising. Two police officers and a security guard were shot and killed during the robbery. Ms. Clark represented herself at trial, expressing no remorse and telling the jury that revolutionary violence was a “liberating force.” The sentencing judge said she was beyond rehabilitation and sentenced her to 75 years to life. Ms. Clark has evolved over 37 years to become a model prisoner, earning bachelor’s and master’s degrees, leading educational programs for inmates, and starting programs to fight AIDS and improve prenatal care. Her efforts to obtain clemency gained wide attention, particularly as other participants in the Brink’s robbery were released. Citing her “exceptional strides in self-development,” Governor Cuomo commuted her sentence in late 2016, cutting the minimum time to 35 years and making her eligible for parole. Still, when she came up for parole a year ago, law enforcement groups, conservative judges and Republican politicians fought her release, deluging the board with letters. The three-member board voted unanimously to keep her in prison, determining that her release was “incompatible with the welfare of society.” “You are still a symbol of a terroristic crime,” the board said in a statement. Justice Kelley, however, ruled that the board had failed to followed state law and court precedents. Courts have held that parole decisions should not be based solely on the severity of the crime and the defendant’s conduct at trial, but must give more weight to whether the inmate has been rehabilitated and no longer poses a risk to society. The law’s intent, he wrote, “is to base parole board determinations on a forward-looking paradigm, rather than a backward-looking approach.” The state parole board did not immediately respond to the ruling. “The board has received the decision and is reviewing it,” Patrick J. Bailey, a spokesman for the state Department of Corrections, said.",The New York Times
2018,Getting Married? Forget Sweet Nothings; Let’s Talk About Money,"Wealth Matters If there is one statistic that does not lose its ability to scare, it’s how many marriages end in divorce. “About half” is thrown about often, if a bit loosely. Research has added nuance to that figure. Factors like age, education and socioeconomic status contribute to reducing the likelihood of divorce. So, too, does the number of marriages: First marriages are less likely to end in divorce than third marriages. Still, the numbers do not fill a young (or old) heart with joy. The response for many wealthy people is the prenuptial agreement, which details what each spouse is entitled to financially if the marriage ends in divorce. Whether a person’s betrothed or own family raises this issue, the ensuing conversation is likely to be about as romantic as deciding who takes out the trash. Any discussion, after all, will focus on the parameters for who gets what at the end of a marriage that has not even started. This is where Nathan Dungan, a wealth educator and founder of Share Save Spend, a financial consulting firm in Minneapolis, is trying to take a smarter approach to any conversation around prenuptial agreements. He wants to require both partners to attend what could be called Prenup 101. It is far from something couples can take casually. Mr. Dungan has developed work sheets and quizzes to complement extensive counseling that lasts at least six months, though ideally closer to a year. He calls the whole process “onboarding” — a far more welcoming description than “divorce planning.” “You want to say, ‘We’re in this together,’ but then there’s this big wrench that gets put in place,” he said. “What if we looked at it as an opportunity and not this huge problem?” To this end, the work sheets ask open-ended questions about how people feel about money: “What is money to me?” “What things matter most to me in life?” “Why is it important to understand how each person is wired with respect to money?” “They have homework assignments they need to do,” Mr. Dungan said. “Some are together, some are separate.” But emphasis is put on the discussion, he said. “Part of this is to recognize that this is not a romantic conversation,” Mr. Dungan said. “We get that, but it’s an opportunity for them to step into this and talk about their own family of origin and their own money story.” Mr. Dungan said his goal is to take the prenuptial agreement out of the conversation and present the couple with an opportunity to have an honest conversation about money. He wants them to learn if they are spenders, savers or sharers when it comes to money in their lives. Andrew, who comes from a prominent Midwestern family and asked that his last name not be used, said his family had been a client of Mr. Dungan’s since he was a teenager. He’s in his late 20s now and has been married for four years. His wife became part of the family’s financial discussions while they were dating. Still, when they got engaged and the process ramped up, the conversations were not easy. “There were things that got brought up that my wife and I never knew were bothering us,” Andrew said. Mr. Dungan helped them ask about their attitudes toward money. “It allowed my wife and me to learn why this is important and to understand this isn’t a ‘me vs. you’ thing,” he said. The process took about six months until a prenuptial agreement was signed. “It can feel like you’re against each other from the start,” Andrew said. But in the end, he was glad they were both on the same page. “It lets you start your marriage on the right foot,” he said. Mr. Dungan’s method appeals to people who are confident and open enough to at least discuss money within their own families. That’s usually how they know about him in the first place: as clients of his getting advice on wealth and inheritance. But many prenuptial financial conversations are not well planned. More often, couples wait until weeks or even days before their wedding before talking about a prenuptial agreement — a hasty decision signed in what the industry calls “the shadow of the altar.” Casting that kind of uncertainty on a wedding can dim the sunny days most couples expect. But such an approach can also have unintended ramifications. The person who is being presented with the prenuptial agreement can feel unprepared or, worse, ambushed. As for the agreement itself, that kind of rush also increases the likelihood that whatever is signed will not hold up in court. Part of what makes a prenuptial agreement enforceable is a full disclosure of existing assets. To do this, there needs to be time for both parties to understand what is involved. “It’s difficult to challenge a prenup in New York,” said Jacqueline Newman, managing partner at the New York law firm Berkman Bottger Newman & Rodd. “But if it’s literally thrown to the person in the shadow of the altar, courts consider all of that. It’s not smart on the part of the person who wants a prenup to give it to someone last minute.” Inherited assets and family gifts are generally protected in divorce proceedings. But if, say, income from a trust was used to pay for the family’s lifestyle, it could be subject to division in a divorce, said Silvana D. Raso, managing partner at Schepisi & McLaughlin, a law firm based in New Jersey. The same, she said, holds true for a family business, even if a new spouse is only partly involved in managing it and receiving income from it. Both concerns can be handled in a properly drafted agreement, but doing so takes time and discussions. Ms. Newman, however, noted that for the so-called non-monied spouse, a prenuptial agreement can offer access to funds supporting the couple’s married lifestyle that would not be available in a divorce, such as otherwise untouchable inheritance funds. There is consensus on what makes a good prenuptial agreement: time to discuss all the issues and draft a document that is fair to both sides and perhaps even has provisions to change over time. But getting to that document can cause lasting problems in a family if the process is not handled with care. Mr. Dungan’s classes attempt to fend off emotional distress, much of which can revolve around how families talk — or don’t talk — about money. Alison Comstock Moss, chairman and chief executive of Paul Comstock Partners, which advises clients on a total of $2.2 billion in assets, recalled a client who told his future son-in-law that he would not get a dime from the family if the marriage ended. The son-in-law, who was himself financially successful, had not planned to ask for anything from his wife’s family in the prenuptial agreement. Years later, the marriage is happy, but the two men still do not get along. “Knowing all the parties involved, I don’t think the intent was to be nasty,” Ms. Moss said. “I think they got bad advice and the way they communicated with each other was really hurtful.” A better way to have handled the situation, she said, would have been to ask a simple question about expectations, which would have allowed the son-in-law to speak his mind. But an approach like that requires planning, education and openness about financial expectations, which may not be possible if the focus is on the agreement itself. Mr. Dungan said that his process still led to the same end — a prenuptial agreement — but that it got there in a way that required more thought. “We’re not robotically moving through this process,” he said. “We’re creating a dynamic that allows them to have the best outcome.”",The New York Times
2018,Getting Your Desktop Windows in Order,"TECH TIP If your screen has become jumbled with too many open files, folders and programs to manage, you can quickly sort the pile. Q. When moving back and forth between laptop and external monitors and generally just having a ton of stuff open, I can’t find certain windows quickly in the clutter, or have trouble resizing them because I can’t reach the bottom corner with the mouse. Is there a quick way to snap these windows in line? A. Both the Windows and Mac operating systems include several shortcuts for moving, resizing or organizing open windows that have drifted off the screen — or are buried under other open files, folders and programs. Some windows may get even harder to find if you switch your monitor resolution or use a dual display. On a Windows PC with a bunch of open windows, right-click on the title bar and select the Maximize command. Then click the task bar and choose Cascade Windows from the menu. The open windows on the screen will form a neat, overlapping stack with visible title bars you can browse. In Windows 7 and later, you can use the system’s Snap feature to drag a window to the side of the screen to anchor it. The Windows 10 Snap Assist tool now shows other open windows as thumbnails on the screen after you have snapped the first window. For resizing and moving, you can expand a window by clicking the square Maximize icon on the far-right side of a window’s title bar. When you right-click a Windows title bar, or press the Alt key and the space bar, you also get Move and Size options in the menu. When you select Move and then slide the cursor to the center of the screen, you can use the arrow keys on the keyboard to nudge the window over; press the Enter key when you have it where you want it. Selecting the Size option lets you use the keyboard arrow keys to resize the window. On a Mac, you have a few ways to reel in wandering windows. If you are not sure what you have open, go to the Mac’s Mission Control view to see miniature versions of all the open windows at once — and select the one you need. Just press the Mission Control key (often F3 on an Apple keyboard) or the Control and up-arrow keys; you can also get into Mission Control by clicking its icon in the desktop dock, using the Control Strip on compatible MacBooks or swiping up with three fingers on a trackpad. To move and resize windows even if the desktop Dock is in the way, hold down the Option key and click the green dot in the window’s upper-left corner to resize the window to fit the screen. Clicking the green dot by itself expands the window to the full-screen size. You can drag any of the four sides of a window to change the size, and holding down the Shift and Option keys while you drag an edge resizes the whole window proportionally. If you can click on part of a visible window, you can also go to the Window menu in the Mac’s tool bar and choose Zoom to resize the window to fit the screen. If you eventually get down to just two open windows, Apple’s Split View feature (available in OS X El Capitan and later) allows you to position both of them evenly on each half of the screen. Just hold down the green button in the first window and drag it to one side. Then let go of the green button and repeat the steps with the other window on the other side of the screen.

2018,Opinion | Ghana Deserves This Cathedral. Don’t Fight It.,"Opinion Dr. Okeke-Agulu is a professor of art history at Princeton. Last month, the president of Ghana, Nana Akufo-Addo, unveiled the design for a national cathedral that the government will build in Accra. This is a huge deal. It signals that the country is poised to consolidate the gains of decades of democracy. And the new interdenominational Christian cathedral will inspire ambitious civic architecture projects across the continent that harness the talents of Africa’s emerging artists. Not everyone is cheering, though. Some West Africans have complained that the mixing of church and state is ill advised. They argue that it’s a worrisome case of official partisanship in a part of the world rived by religious conflicts. Others say the money for the project should have instead been invested in schools, hospitals and infrastructure — stuff that, according to them, Africa really needs. They are right to point to these endemic problems; but they are wrong to connect them with the cathedral. The cathedral is the first major project in Africa by the Ghanaian-British architect David Adjaye, who was knighted last year for his services to his field. He is perhaps the most exciting architect in the world. His reputation is built on his stunning designs for Rivington Place in London, the Moscow School of Management Skolkovo, and, most spectacularly, the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington. This Accra commission is not just a recognition by his homeland of Mr. Adjaye’s acclaim. It also signifies that Africa can build a major work by a leading architect at the top of his game. This is a remarkable thing: Ghana will get to brag about a globally recognized architectural landmark. Mr. Adjaye has proposed a monumental building with delicate timber elements on the concave facade, a reminder of the curved seats of Asante royal stools. And its staggered, high-pitched roofs are a welcome nod to traditional Akan architecture. While Mr. Adjaye is known for incorporating local designs into his buildings, the poetry of the cathedral’s allusions to indigenous traditions raises the bar. To embellish the building’s interior, he will collaborate with well-known Ghanaian and other African artists. Mr. Adjaye has designed a fabulous church, with chapels, a baptistery and a 5,000-seat auditorium where state religious events will take place. But I’m thankful it’s more than that; it also includes an art gallery, a music school and a bible museum. The wide expanse of steps leading to the building makes this a veritable public space, which major African cities like Accra have lacked for too long. When it’s finished, it will be a place “where religion, democracy and local tradition are seamlessly and symbolically intertwined,” Mr. Adjaye’s firm said. I hope it becomes a model for how art museums in Africa can also be multifunctional public institutions. And this is why the criticisms of the cathedral are misplaced. The project should not be a symbol of what is widely perceived as the profligacy and megapastor-mania of the new-age churches in Africa and the third world. Nor should it be confused with the big white elephants of past dictators, like the humongous Basilica of Our Lady of Peace, the “Basilica in the Bush” built by Félix Houphouët-Boigny, then Ivory Coast’s leader, in his hometown. Instead, the cathedral, as a religious and cultural institution, will be supported by diverse segments of the population, beyond just the church and the state. Also, there’s something worrisome about the idea that until every home in Africa gets a mosquito net, every village a school, it should not build concrete dreams and inspiring structures. This mind-set has strange old bedfellows in the refusal of colonial governments to build universities in West Africa in the early 1900s (because what the colonized needed was basic education) and the defunding of higher-education institutions in many parts of the continent beginning in the 1980s (because poor countries could not afford them). To rise, Africa has to aim beyond basic needs. It must have infrastructure projects and superb schools that will also propel its growing economies. It must have also enduring and inspirational buildings and environments that unapologetically reflect its rich and complex histories, while also affirming the possibilities of a democratic and prosperous continent. The cathedral project is an emphatic example of necessary institutions, like public museums, that provide space for collective social, cultural and, yes, spiritual transactions. Ghana has been heading in this direction since the 1990s, after years of military coups, dictatorships and economic distress. In 1992, the National Theater in Accra, designed largely by two Chinese architects and paid for by China, opened. Now, tourists and locals marvel at its elegant design and flock to its dance and theater programs. In 2008, the presidential palace was rebuilt. Inspired, like the cathedral, by Asante royal stools, it greatly changed how that part of Accra looks. But these buildings were designed by foreign architects. This, too, has a history. During the age of exploration and the slave trade, Europeans built the massive forts and castles dotting the African coast, including the 17th-century Osu Castle, known as Fort Christianburg, which was the seat of Ghana’s government until a few years ago. Most major buildings in colonial and independent Africa were designed by Europeans and Americans, including Maxwell Fry and Jane Drew from Britain, and the African-American architect J. Max Bond Jr., whom Mr. Adjaye considers a professional idol. African governments, it seemed, did not trust their own artists. Granted, inspired African architects were hard to find well into the late 20th century. But not anymore. Mr. Adjaye belongs to a generation of African architects that includes Diébédo Francis Kéré, Kunlé Adeyemi, Mphethi Morojele and Mokena Makeka, a generation poised to take on the ambitious projects that will define the architectural character and identities of rising Africa. Their works will be seen around the world as among the great structures of our era. We need more architects like them and far more projects like Mr. Adjaye’s awesome cathedral.",The New York Times
2018,Giancarlo Stanton Bothered by Pressure? No. Furniture? Maybe,"DETROIT — When Giancarlo Stanton left Yankee Stadium after his first homestand in New York amid a crescendoing chorus of boos, there was no shortage of theories as to why the newly acquired slugger had such a miserable first week in the Bronx. Maybe the jeers — from a homestand in which he had twice fanned five times in a game — had gotten into his head. Maybe he was trying too hard to make a good first impression. Maybe he was not cut out for the scrutiny of New York. As it turns out, maybe it was something else all together. Maybe it was the furniture. When Stanton arrived back in New York on April 1 after the Yankees’ first series of the season, in Toronto, the furniture he had ordered for the apartment he is leasing with Mets pitcher A.J. Ramos had not yet arrived and there were still repairs and upgrades that needed to be done. That meant that when Stanton was not at Yankee Stadium that week studying video, working on his swing in the batting cages and getting acclimated to his new surroundings, he was unpacking his belongings, working the phones to sort out furniture delivery and lighting upgrades, and making sure everything was all set for a visit from his father, uncle and aunt that week. Stanton stayed some nights at a hotel. “Just think of anybody moving, and add 50,000 people at the stadium at your work,” said Ramos, who was in town with the Mets the first three days Stanton had returned. “It adds a little more pressure.” Stanton vaguely alluded to these issues in Boston last Tuesday, when he was asked if he had been trying to do too much at the plate during the Yankees’ homestand. “No,” he said. “I just felt there was a lot going on. Focusing on maybe too many things. But not trying too hard, I don’t think.” Asked to elaborate, Stanton smiled and said, “Not to worry about.” Stanton later declined to comment when he was asked if setting up his place had been a distraction. “I’m not going to make excuses,” he said. Since the start of the Yankees’ series in Boston last week, Stanton has begun to more closely resemble the hitter who belted 59 home runs last year and won the National League Most Valuable Player Award. He is 6 for 17 with a double, triple, three runs batted in and five strikeouts in four games. Stanton and Manager Aaron Boone had the same answer when asked to describe how Stanton was swinging the bat this weekend compared to a week ago: “Much better.” “My balance points are better,” Stanton added. “I’m picking the ball up better. So, I’ve just got to continue.” That rounding into form comes at a propitious time: the Yankees, who were rained out in Detroit on Saturday and Sunday, return home Monday for a two-game series against Stanton’s former team, the Miami Marlins. Stanton is looking forward to seeing his old manager, Don Mattingly, and some of his friends who were not traded away in the Marlins’ winter sell-off. One person he will not see is the Marlins chief executive, Derek Jeter, who will travel with the team but not attend the games, saying it would be awkward for him to return to Yankee Stadium. Stanton said he holds no enmity toward Jeter, who tried to strong-arm him into accepting a trade to St. Louis or San Francisco, threatening to hold onto him through a lengthy rebuild of the Marlins. Stanton, with the leverage of a no-trade clause, pushed back, and eventually a trade with the Yankees was worked out. “I don’t think there’s any crazy bad blood beside what you guys stirred up,” Stanton said, referring to the news media. “We were very honest with each other in our meetings and that’s the business side of it, but there’s no bad blood on this side.” Among the many new factors facing Stanton in New York is the weather, which has certainly done little to warm his blood, or that of any of the Yankees. Since their series under a dome in Toronto, the opening-pitch temperature for nine of the Yankees’ 10 games has been under 54 degrees. They have had three games postponed by rain or snow, all of which has limited their time outdoors for batting and fielding practice. If that deprived Stanton of getting used to his new surroundings at Yankee Stadium, his acclimation to New York has also taken place on the fly. When the Yankees left spring training in Tampa, they flew to Atlanta for an exhibition the next night, March 28, and went directly to Toronto for the season opener. It was only after that series when Stanton arrived to New York. “It was a load, getting oriented to New York and trying to get his condo set up,” Stanton’s father, Mike, said in a telephone interview. “I think it’s your natural instinct when you move in somewhere to try to get it set up as quickly possible. But in retrospect, he didn’t have a lot of down time.” Boone said the logistics of setting down roots in a new city are part of a ballplayer’s life, even if it is something that Stanton is doing for the first time since his rookie season in Miami. Soon, he said, Stanton would be settled into a new routine and there will be comfort in that. “It’s part of the gig, part of the way we’ve lived our whole life,” said Boone, who switched teams five times in his final nine seasons in the majors. “Look, I want to get into the flow of the season as I know the players do — the routine of it — as much we can. A lot of times getting moved in, especially with a new club, learning people in the organization, playing in crappy conditions — it’s all part of it.” The Yankees, after returning to New York on Sunday night, will be anchored there for nearly two weeks, giving Stanton another chance — and not just at Yankee Stadium — to feel at home.

2018,"Giancarlo Stanton Is Bumped Down, and Yankees Edge Blue Jays","Yankees 4, Blue Jays 3 The score was tied in the bottom of the fifth inning on Thursday night, and the Yankees’ No. 3 hitter laced a ball to right, driving in a run to put the Yankees ahead of the Toronto Blue Jays. The No. 3 hitter, however, was not Giancarlo Stanton, the Yankees’ prized off-season acquisition who had occupied that spot all season, but rather Didi Gregorius, the team’s shortstop. Looking to shake things up for Stanton, who had struggled badly since a dominant performance on opening day, Yankees Manager Aaron Boone moved him from third to fourth in the lineup. It would be hard to declare the move a dramatic success, with Stanton going 1 for 3 with an infield single and a walk, but no matter how the sausage was made, the team walked away with a 4-3 win. Boone played down the lineup change, saying it was partially inspired by Toronto’s starter, Aaron Sanchez, being tough against right-handed batters. But Boone assured reporters that there were no plans to move Stanton even further down the lineup should he continue to struggle. “I’m not ready to move him down-down in the order,” Boone said. “I still want him surrounded by impact guys. You move him down, and then all of a sudden, he’s one good at-bat maybe from getting locked back in, and then all of a sudden, you’re in a situation where it’s a blatant pitch-around and those kinds of things.” Stanton, who had plenty of experience hitting fourth during his eight years with the Miami Marlins, managed to go the entire game without striking out — just the fourth time he has done that in 17 appearances for the Yankees — but Toronto’s pitchers were remarkably aggressive against him. Sanchez went right after Stanton with a mixture of fastballs and changeups — starting an at-bat in the third inning with a 94-mile-per-hour fastball right down the middle that Stanton harmlessly tapped to the shortstop for a one-pitch out. The closest Stanton came to a home run was in the first inning, when he worked an eight-pitch at-bat and hit a rocket to deep left that found its way into Teoscar Hernandez’s glove. But the scattered crowd on a cold night at Yankee Stadium got one later, as Stanton’s fellow titan, Aaron Judge, obliged with some fireworks in the seventh inning, hitting a 394-foot blast to left that provided an insurance run that proved crucial. Before Judge’s blast, the Yankees, who were expected to be a team that heavily relied on home runs, had simply chipped away against Toronto. The first run came on a groundout by Tyler Wade. The second came on a bloop single by Ronald Torreyes that barely found its way over the outstretched glove of Aledmys Diaz at shortstop. The third came on Gregorius’s sharp single. Each of those four runs proved necessary, as a shaky relief outing by David Robertson nearly wasted C.C. Sabathia’s solid return from the disabled list. Sabathia, who had been out with a sore right hip, pitched four and one-third innings, allowing four hits and two runs, neither of which was earned. Chad Green and Dellin Betances combined for two and two-thirds scoreless innings, but Robertson ran into trouble in the 8th, loading the bases with a single and two walks and then allowing a run-scoring single by pinch-hitter Curtis Granderson. But Robertson, known as the Houdini of the Bullpen, lived up to his nickname, getting out of the inning with no further damage. He then handed things over to Aroldis Chapman, who pitched a scoreless ninth to secure the win, which was credited to Green as Sabathia did not complete five innings. If there was a complaint on a day when most things went right for the Yankees, it was a pair of passed balls by Gary Sanchez, the catcher who sometimes struggles to catch. The first was especially costly, as Sanchez was crossed up on a high cutter by Sabathia and as the ball shot away from him, a run scored. Inside Pitch Tommy Kahnle, who has a 6.14 E.R.A. in six appearances as a reliever this season, was placed on the 10-day disabled list with right shoulder tendinitis. Boone said it could be a few weeks before Kahnle is able to return. An earlier version of this article misstated the direction to which Aaron Judge hit his seventh-inning homer. It was to left field, not right.",The New York Times
2018,Giancarlo Stanton Quiets the Boos by Leading the Yankees’ Homer Barrage,"Yankees 7, Rays 2 This was the kind of offense the Yankees envisioned when they traded for Giancarlo Stanton, the major league’s home run leader in 2017: A lineup featuring Stanton, Aaron Judge and Gary Sanchez, one that would terrorize opposing pitchers with the ever-present threat of tape-measure home runs. It did not seem too far-fetched to imagine, assuming all three stayed healthy for an entire season, that they could combine for something close to 150 home runs — or more than the entire Kansas City Royals team hit in their 2015 championship season. But along with spectacular power comes the potential for humiliating failure, in the form of striking out. And at the Yankees’ home opener on Tuesday, Stanton — who led baseball with 59 home runs as a Miami Marlin last season — had possibly the most humiliating day of his major league career, fanning in all five of his at-bats. On Wednesday, however, Stanton erased much of that humiliation — and converted many of the boos he had heard the day before into cheers — with the kind of breathtaking home run that in today’s game makes all those whiffs easier to accept. Stanton’s laser-like, two-run blast in the first inning, a line drive clocked at 117.9 miles per hour off the bat and measured at 458 feet, gave the Yankees a 2-1 lead over the Tampa Bay Rays. From there, the home team followed the preseason blueprint: Sanchez, who hit 33 home runs in just 122 games last season, followed with a two-run homer in the third inning, and two innings after that it was Judge, whose 52 home runs in 2017 were second-best in baseball, who added another two-run blast. When the smoke had cleared the Yankees had a 7-2 victory over the Rays behind a robust performance from the middle of a lineup that may become a modern-day Murderers’ Row. “It’s good that we all got one today,” Stanton said. “And hopefully, soon, we’ll put some back-to-back-to-backs in there.” Stanton’s home run was his first since the Yankees’ season opener against the Blue Jays in Toronto last Thursday, when he hit two. But his first appearance before the demanding Yankee Stadium crowd, which often seems to want to put players through a uniquely Bronxian rite of passage, ended with the sound of boos after his five strikeouts. Even the result — an 11-4 Yankees win — did little to quell the fans’ disappointment with Stanton’s debut. “You put up a performance like that, you should get booed,” Stanton said after the home opener. The sense of discontent clearly lingered overnight; more than a few boos were heard as Stanton headed to the plate in the first inning against Rays’ starter Blake Snell on Wednesday. But Stanton quickly elicited a more positive roar from the crowd when he lined a hanging slider into the second deck in left field, and punctuated the blast with a resounding bat flip and by taking a mock football handoff from Yankees coach Phil Nevin as he rounded third base. There was clearly some satisfaction in hitting that first home run before a Bronx crowd that in previous years had booed slow starts from such future stars as Tino Martinez, Jason Giambi, and Didi Gregorius, who had the unenviable task of replacing Derek Jeter at shortstop in 2015. Still, even a home run as impressive as Stanton’s earns only so much equity in New York; he struck out in his next three at-bats, with the crowd grumbling a little louder each time. Stanton has now struck out in eight of his first nine Yankee Stadium at-bats. But as Manager Aaron Boone pointed out, the benefits that come from players like Stanton, Judge and, to a lesser extent, Sanchez are often accompanied by strikeouts. Yankees batters struck out 14 times on Tuesday and 11 more on Wednesday, but won both games, scoring 12 of their 18 runs on homers. “I think the strikeouts are going to come with it,” Boone said. “We have guys with huge power that are also going to punch out from time to time. The bottom line is, I want competitive at-bats out of them. Between him and Aaron, as long as they’re getting on base a lot and hitting for power it’s a recipe for success.” Sanchez, who came into the game batting .053, with only a double in his first 19 at-bats, followed Stanton’s first strikeout of the game with his first home run of the season, a high fly ball into the left-field seats off Snell that made it 4-1. Two innings later, Judge, who was hitting .278 but had gone 25 plate appearances without a home run, hit his first, another two-run shot to left that extended the Yankees’ lead to 7-1. Luis Severino (2-0, 1.38 E.R.A.) settled down after a rocky first inning in which he allowed a run on two hits, including a run-scoring double by C.J. Cron that sailed over Stanton’s glove in left, limiting the Rays to just two more singles before leaving with one out in the eighth inning. “We lean on those guys a lot,” Boone said, referring to Stanton, Judge and Sanchez. “Those three guys are going to make you pay when you make a mistake. But G set the tone for it all. When he squares it up he really makes an impact.” Which makes it easier to accept the many times that he doesn’t.",The New York Times
2018,Giannis Antetokounmpo’s Big Night Helps Bucks Force Game 7,"Giannis Antetokounmpo had 31 points and 14 rebounds and the Milwaukee Bucks pulled away late to beat the visiting Boston Celtics, 97-86, on Thursday night to force a Game 7 in their first-round series. Khris Middleton and Malcolm Brogdon each added 16 points, with Brogdon hitting a momentum-swinging 3 from the left corner to give the Bucks a two-possession lead with 5 minutes 22 seconds left. The Bucks held the Celtics at bay from there to force a winner-take-all game Saturday night in Boston. The up-and-coming Bucks haven’t played a seventh game in the playoffs since losing to the Atlanta Hawks in the first round in 2010. Both teams went on extended runs to take big leads, but the Bucks made the last big push to close out the Celtics. Boston had to settle for perimeter looks down the stretch. The Celtics couldn’t hit enough 3s, finishing 10 of 36 (28 percent) on the night, and the Bucks limited Boston on the glass. On offense, Antetokounmpo led the Bucks’ charge right at the heart of the Celtics’ defense. After Eric Bledsoe picked off an inbound pass by Jayson Tatum, Antetokounmpo converted an offensive rebound with a putback off the glass for an 89-81 lead with 3:08 left. It was part of a late 11-3 run to help the Bucks pull away for a 10-point advantage. With his team facing elimination, Antetokounmpo vowed to be more aggressive following a 5-point loss in Game 5. Antetokounmpo, a two-time All-Star, produced down the stretch, scoring 20 points in the second half on 8-of-14 shooting. Tatum finished with 22 points, and Terry Rozier had 18 for the Celtics. After holding the edge on the glass for most of the series, Boston got outrebounded, 48-39. CURRY MAY PLAY ON SATURDAY Stephen Curry has resumed full practice with contact and could play for the defending champion Golden State Warriors as soon as Game 1 of the Western Conference semifinals against New Orleans on Saturday night. Curry practiced on Thursday wearing a protective black brace over his sprained left knee, which has sidelined him since March 23. Coach Steve Kerr listed Curry’s status as questionable for Saturday, but that could change if Curry responds well on Friday after one more day of full practice. GOALTENDING CALL WAS MISSED LeBron James’s block on Indiana’s Victor Oladipo in the closing seconds of Game 5 of the Cavaliers’ first-round Eastern Conference series against the Pacers on Wednesday should have been called goaltending, the N.B.A. said. The league said the video shows James blocked Oladipo’s shot, taken with 5.1 seconds left, after it made contact with the backboard. The play could not be reviewed because it was not called on the floor. James then hit a 3-pointer at the buzzer, giving the Cavaliers a 98-95 victory and a three-games-to-two lead in the series.",The New York Times
2018,Giants Select Saquon Barkley; Jets Choose Sam Darnold,"EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — All of the quarterback intrigue that dominated the buildup to the N.F.L. draft, the silence and subterfuge and misdirection, somehow failed to ensnare the Giants, who did not tip their highest pick in 14 years so much as sprinkle clues about their intentions over the last four months. Their decision to take the versatile rusher Saquon Barkley of Penn State at No. 2 affirmed General Manager Dave Gettleman’s opinion, declared last week and reiterated Thursday night, that the perceived devaluing of a running back is a myth, and corroborated the team’s stated comfort with Eli Manning quarterbacking the team this season and, it seems, beyond. The prudence of that decision, and others that guided Gettleman to these conclusions, will be measured by the production of Barkley, the highest running back taken since Reggie Bush was the No. 2 pick in 2006, but more so by the development of every quarterback the Giants could have chosen as a potential successor to Manning. That group includes Sam Darnold of Southern California, who will play his home games in the same stadium as the Giants. The Jets’ quixotic quest for the next Joe Namath led them to use the No. 3 pick on Darnold, who becomes the franchise’s latest investment of precious draft capital toward snapping a hex at the sport’s most important position. By taking Barkley — an easy pick, Gettleman said — the Giants gifted the Jets a perfect situation: their choice of every remaining quarterback except Baker Mayfield of Oklahoma, whom Cleveland took at No. 1. In Darnold, listed at 6-foot-4 and 220 pounds, the Jets nab a mobile passer considered by many draft analysts as the safest in his class, even if he may not be ready to start right away. Darnold turns 21 in June. “I’ve told people this from the start: I think I can fit into any system,” he said. “If it’s different from U.S.C., it’s going to take me a couple of weeks to get used to. But I’m ready for it. I’m ready for the challenge. I’m ready to blend into the system and learn about my teammates.” Darnold threw 13 interceptions and lost nine fumbles last season — evoking Mark Sanchez, another turnover-prone quarterback from U.S.C. drafted high by the Jets — but General Manager Mike Maccagnan said Darnold’s upside far outweighs the giveaways. “Sometimes it’s trying to do too much, sometimes making the wrong reads — it’s things we can learn from,” Maccagnan said. By contrast, the Giants sound ready to immediately unleash Barkley, whom Gettleman called the best player in the draft. “I want to earn everything,” Barkley said. “If I’m not doing what’s needed to be done to get that starting job, then I don’t want it.” If Gettleman’s job is to balance the team’s long-term interests with its short-term competitiveness, picking Barkley theoretically does both. It diversifies the Giants’ offense under Manning, adding a star runner to complement the star receiver Odell Beckham Jr., while alleviating the transition of Manning’s eventual successor. But choosing Barkley also doubles down on Gettleman’s confidence that Manning, 37, can reverse his decline in the offensive system deployed by the new coach, Pat Shurmur. “If you have to try to make yourself fall in love with a player, it’s wrong,” Gettleman said, when asked whether Manning’s status tempted him to trick himself into wanting a quarterback. “You will never be happy with the pick.” With Barkley, listed at 6 feet and 233 pounds, Manning will be handing off to a back who can run as well as he can catch and return kicks. Last season with the Nittany Lions, he accounted for 1,903 yards from scrimmage and 21 touchdowns, and averaged 28.4 yards per kickoff return with two touchdowns. Before moving outside Allentown, Pa., Barkley grew up in the Bronx, where he cheered for the Jets, whose logo is tattooed in red on his father’s forearm and who might have been his ideal destination. In a different year, perhaps. But not this one, not with the Jets (again) committed to drafting a quarterback. Aside from the Jets, only three other teams have failed to make the playoffs in the last seven seasons: Chicago, Tampa Bay and Cleveland. The Bears and the Buccaneers identified their franchise quarterbacks in recent drafts, and the Browns, after years of dysfunction, believed they found theirs on Thursday, when they took Mayfield. The Jets, after a failed free-agent pursuit of Kirk Cousins, had been on the clock at No. 3 for nearly six weeks. Though they knew they would be drafting a quarterback, they did not know which one. They gained that position with a gambit as aggressive as it was desperate, surrendering picks No. 6, 37 and 49, plus a second-rounder next year, to Indianapolis for the right to move up three spots. Preparing to take his third quarterback in four drafts with the Jets, Maccagnan could not afford to sit at No. 6 and risk other needy teams, like Buffalo or Arizona, maneuvering ahead of him (the Bills and the Cardinals moved up Thursday night to take quarterbacks, with Josh Allen going to Buffalo at No. 7 and Josh Rosen to Arizona at No. 10). Maccagnan needed to be comfortable with, at worst, his third-rated quarterback. “We felt very good about the players that would be there,” Maccagnan said. Darnold joins the Jets at a pivotal time in the A.F.C. East, with Buffalo and Miami no closer to overtaking New England than the Jets are, and with the Patriots nearer to the end of the Tom Brady era than the beginning. The Jets’ chances of disrupting New England’s divisional supremacy, of contending season after season, depend on Darnold’s progress and aptitude for maximizing the talent around him. Darnold will get an opportunity to ascend the depth chart at once, competing with last year’s starter, 38-year-old Josh McCown, and Teddy Bridgewater, whom the Jets signed in free agency after he missed most of the past two seasons because of a knee injury. “We’re not going to throw him in there,” Coach Todd Bowles said. “But at the same time, we’re not going to hold him back, either.”",The New York Times
2018,"Gillian Ayres, Abstract Artist Besotted by Paint, Dies at 88","Gillian Ayres, a leading British abstract painter whose pursuit of beauty led her to use evocative colors, texture her works with thick layers of oils and occasionally to hurl paint at her canvasses, died on Wednesday in North Devon, England. She was 88. Her son Sam Mundy said the cause was heart and kidney failure. “Painting is a visual, silent medium, but I love it and I am obsessed by it,” Ms. Ayres told The Guardian in 2001. She was besotted by paint — what it felt like physically and what she could do with it. She used her hands, brushes, parts of cardboard boxes and brooms to arrange the vivid images that distinguished her work for more than 60 years. She often spent more time staring at a work-in-progress to determine how to organize shapes and space than she did painting it. In an interview three years ago, Ms. Ayres recalled routinely painting all night as a younger artist. “I used to go a bit potty,” she told the Christie’s auction house in an article about her in 2015. “It was almost like I couldn’t stop. That doesn’t happen now, but I still need the whole day ahead of me. I don’t need a dental appointment or any other ruddy appointment interrupting!” In her later years, Ms. Ayres would risk her safety to climb a ladder, her hands filled with gobs of paint, ready for a workout with a giant canvas. Like other abstract artists, she did not discuss the meanings, if any, in her works. She insisted that she thought only about the shapes, the space and the colors. “People like to understand, and I wish they wouldn’t,” she told The Financial Times in 2015. “I wish they’d just look. It’s visual.” Gillian Ayres was born in London on Feb. 3, 1930. Her father was a part-owner of a hat factory whose customers included the British Army. Her mother, the former Florence Brown, was a homemaker. For a while, she attended school in an air-raid shelter in London. When she was attending a girls’ school in 1943, books on van Gogh, Gauguin, Cezanne and Monet inspired her to paint. And at 16, she insisted on attending art school and was admitted to what is now called the Camberwell College of Arts in London. Chafing at the rigidity of the teaching, she left shortly before taking the final exam. She got a job as a hotel chambermaid in Paris, then returned to London to work in an art gallery with Henry Mundy, a painter she had met at Camberwell. They married in 1951 and divorced 25 years later. By the mid-1950s, Ms. Ayres was a rising abstract painter, splattering paint on a canvas on the floor like Jackson Pollock. “The whole idea of the canvas as an area in which to act, an area and what one does with it — I wanted to find out about that, obsessively,” she told The Telegraph in 2010. Ms. Ayres came of age in Britain with abstract artists like Howard Hodgkin and Victor Pasmore. Roger Hilton, an older artist she admired, wrote a note to her in the early 1950s that she often referred to in the ensuing decades, she told The Independent in 1995. It described the abstract painter’s journey into the unknown, armed only with colors, shapes and space-creating powers. “Can he construct with these means,” the note said, “a barque capable of carrying not only himself to some further shore but, with the aid of others, a whole flotilla, which may be seen eventually as having been carrying humanity forward?” Ms. Ayres made her journey into abstract art in Britain as a woman among far more men. “Nobody else was doing anything as adventurous or uninhibited, like throwing paint at the canvas, which only had parallels in America,” Alan Cristea, whose London gallery represents Ms. Ayres’s original prints, said in a telephone interview. “But she refused to be classified as a woman artist; she thought that was silly.” Yet, he added, “She became sort of a role model for women of the younger generation.” Her work has been widely exhibited in Europe, and when she had a show in Manhattan, at the Knoedler Gallery, in 1985, the New York Times critic John Russell praised her as a “full-bodied, adventurous and uncompromising painter.” He later wrote, “Pushing the medium to its limits, she communicates a kind of reckless radiance that comes across in paintings large and small, square or round.” Ms. Ayres taught at St. Martin’s School of Art in London and the Winchester School of Art in Hampshire, where she was the head of painting. Mark Hudson, an art critic for The Telegraph and a former student of hers, recalled in an article on Friday how influential Ms. Ayres had been. “Within months of her arrival,” he wrote, “a substantial number had stopped painting aimless landscapes and started producing large-scale, gestural, Ayresesque abstracts — a development that had more to do with Ayres’s force of personality than any kind of systematic instruction.” In addition to her son Sam, Ms. Ayres is survived by another son, Jim Mundy, and a granddaughter. She continued to live with her former husband for most of the years after their divorce. Ms. Ayres stopped painting about a year ago because of illness. “I always knew in my heart of hearts that the day she couldn’t paint, she wouldn’t live very long,” Sam Mundy, also an abstract artist, said in a telephone interview. “I’m surprised she lasted a year not painting.”",The New York Times
2018,Giuliani Is Back! Three Books on Larger-Than-Life New York Politicians,"Newsbook As Rudolph Giuliani joins President Trump’s legal defense team, here are biographies on three men (including Giuliani) that illuminate the world of New York City politics. BOSS TWEED The Rise and Fall of the Corrupt Pol Who Conceived the Soul of Modern New YorkBy Kenneth D. Ackerman. 437 pp. Carroll & Graf Publishers. (2005) William Magear Tweed, or Boss Tweed as he was called, was first elected to public office in 1852. According to this biography, he perfected a system of corruption that helped him control “the courts, the legislature, the treasury and the ballot box.” He laundered at least the equivalent of $1 billion today, much of which went into his or his associates’ pockets. Tweed was a complex figure, because despite his criminality, he improved the lives of the poor in New York City; he funded schools and hospitals and helped the disadvantaged navigate President Abraham Lincoln’s draft law, which allowed the rich to buy their way out of service. Our reviewer called Ackerman’s book an “excellent” biography: The story of Tweed’s rise and fall is told in a crisp, clear way.” CITY FOR SALE Ed Koch and the Betrayal of New YorkBy Jack Newfield and Wayne Barrett466 pp. Harper & Row. (1989) This book, which picks up a century after Tweed’s reign, opens with Ed Koch being sworn in for a third term as mayor of New York. It provides an inside look at the corruption within Koch’s administration, like his behind-the-scenes cooperation with politicians he had promised to oppose. The writers showcase colorful characters, including politicians, mobsters and journalists. RUDY!An Investigative Biography of Rudolph GiulianiBy Wayne BarrettAssisted by Adam Fifield498 pp. Basic Books. (2000) This biography, published after Giuliani’s failed run for Congress, is described by our reviewer as “almost like flowers laid on his political crypt,” evidence of ”the City Hall curse,” which claims that no New York mayor will rise to a higher office. Though Giuliani presented himself as the city’s savior for cleaning up the streets and overseeing private sector job growth, Barrett presents him as flawed, both for his need to be in the spotlight as well as his political deceptiveness. “Barrett’s knack for mining official records enabled him, with his assistant, Adam Fifield, to strike investigative gold,” wrote our reviewer. An earlier version of this article misstated William Tweed’s middle name. It was Magear, not Marcy. An earlier headline also referred to him as a mayor. He was a politician, not a mayor.",The New York Times
2018,Giuliani to Join Trump’s Legal Team,"Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York City mayor and longtime friend of President Trump, will join the president’s legal team in an effort to “quickly” resolve the special counsel investigation into Russian election interference and possible ties to Trump associates. Mr. Trump will also bring on Jane Serene Raskin and Martin R. Raskin, former federal prosecutors based in Florida, according to Mr. Trump’s lawyer Jay Sekulow. Mr. Giuliani is himself a former federal prosecutor. “The president said: ‘Rudy is great. He has been my friend for a long time and wants to get this matter quickly resolved for the good of the country,’” Mr. Sekulow said in a statement. The three new lawyers give Mr. Trump a broader legal stable to rely on as he faces not just the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, but the threat of an investigation by federal prosecutors in Manhattan into the president’s longtime personal lawyer and fixer, Michael D. Cohen. Federal agents raided Mr. Cohen’s office and hotel room last week. Mr. Trump has a difficult time retaining top-flight lawyers as the inquiries have increasingly unsettled him, and he has angrily chafed against his lawyers’ legal strategies. Mr. Trump and his associates believe the issues in New York pose a far greater challenge to the president than even Mr. Mueller’s investigation. They do not know what was taken from Mr. Cohen’s office, and it is not clear what exactly investigators are looking into. But the fact that the authorities were able to get a federal judge to give them permission to raid Mr. Cohen’s office and residences has led Mr. Trump and his associates to believe the government possesses some evidence of wrongdoing by Mr. Cohen. In hiring Mr. Giuliani, Mr. Trump has turned to someone who is a reliable, loyal surrogate and an attack dog on television. Mr. Giuliani is a former top official at the Justice Department and served as the United States attorney in Manhattan. But at age 73 he is no longer known as a powerhouse white-collar litigator and in recent years has been more active as a worldwide consultant. One person close to Mr. Trump said the Raskins will be the longer-term and more durable additions to the team. Mr. Giuliani, by contrast, is coming on board as a short-timer not only to appear on television but also to see if he can use his decades-long ties with Mr. Mueller to re-establish a working relationship with the special counsel’s team. The relationship between the president’s lawyers and Mr. Mueller’s team blew up after agents raided Mr. Cohen. Mr. Giuliani’s main focus will be on bringing an end to Mr. Mueller’s investigation into whether Mr. Trump obstructed justice and links between his campaign and Russia. As part of those efforts, Mr. Giuliani will take the lead dealing with Mr. Mueller’s office on an interview with Mr. Trump. The president and his lawyers do not believe Mr. Trump has any real legal exposure but are wary of the interview. At the same time, though, they have determined that for Mr. Mueller to complete his inquiry in a timely manner, Mr. Trump will need to sit down for questioning. Mr. Giuliani plans to try to work with Mr. Mueller to come up with a way to question Mr. Trump that both sides are comfortable with. The addition of Mr. Giuliani comes at a particularly tumultuous time for the president. Last month the president’s lead lawyer, John Dowd, quit the team after he determined the president was not following his advice. For much of the past month, the team has been led by Mr. Sekulow, who has had to assemble a new group of lawyers to deal with the issues in New York and another team to confront Mr. Mueller. At the same time, Mr. Mueller has been pressuring Mr. Trump to sit down for an interview. The president, who initially said he was eager to answer Mr. Mueller’s questions under oath, is said to be more skeptical of an interview in the wake of the raid on Mr. Cohen’s office. After Mr. Dowd quit, many well-known lawyers turned down the opportunity to join the president’s legal team. Some said that they did not believe Mr. Trump would listen to them and that their firms did not want to be associated with the president. But after the raid on Mr. Cohen, many more lawyers have become interested in working for Mr. Trump, according to people briefed on the matter. The lawyers believe the government overstepped its bounds by executing a warrant at a lawyer’s office and have contended the government violated the attorney-client privilege between Mr. Cohen and his clients. Mr. Trump negotiated the discussions to have Mr. Giuliani join his team with Mr. Giuliani directly, a person close to the process said. Mr. Trump had repeatedly offered Mr. Giuliani the job of attorney general during the transition, but Mr. Giuliani turned it down because he wanted to be secretary of state. Mr. Trump turned to Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama, to be attorney general, but has publicly criticized Mr. Sessions for recusing himself from the Russia inquiry. Mr. Trump has said that Mr. Sessions should be protecting him from the inquiry. Some close to the president believe he could try to replace Mr. Sessions with Mr. Giuliani in the coming months, although Mr. Giuliani would face an extremely difficult confirmation hearing in the Senate. When Mr. Giuliani sought the secretary of state job, Trump advisers, including the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, raised concerns about his business dealings and paid speeches to a shadowy Iranian opposition group that until 2012 was on the State Department’s list of foreign terrorist organizations. Mr. Giuliani will be taking a leave of absence from his law firm, Greenberg Traurig, while he works for Mr. Trump. Three people close to the former mayor said that Greenberg Traurig lawyers were distressed that Mr. Giuliani was taking on the new role. Many at the firm were already uncomfortable with Mr. Giuliani’s work for the Trump campaign, his outspoken opinions and his role in helping to write the president’s first travel ban that affected mostly Muslim countries. James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director Mr. Trump fired, is critical of Mr. Giuliani in his new book, “A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership.” (Mr. Giuliani was Mr. Comey’s boss when Mr. Comey went to work for the United States attorney’s office in Manhattan in 1987.) “Though Giuliani’s confidence was exciting, it fed an imperial style that severely narrowed the circle of people with whom he interacted, something I didn’t realize was dangerous until much later: a leader needs the truth, but an emperor does not consistently hear it from his underlings,” Mr. Comey wrote.",The New York Times
2018,"Giuliani, in Meeting With Mueller’s Office, Is Said to Be Negotiating Trump Interview","Rudolph W. Giuliani, the new head of President Trump’s legal team, met with the special counsel’s office on Tuesday as he tries to expedite the end of the far-flung inquiry into possible collusion between the 2016 Trump campaign and Russian officials, three people familiar with the meeting said. Mr. Giuliani declined to confirm whether a meeting took place. But the three people briefed on the sit-down — the first since the former New York City mayor joined the legal team last week — described it as a productive effort to reopen negotiations over a possible interview that the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, is seeking with the president. News of the meeting was first reported by The Washington Post. In an interview, Mr. Giuliani said that his goal in the coming days was to find out where Mr. Mueller stands, particularly as it relates to the credibility of James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director whom the president fired in April 2017. Mr. Comey has been interviewed by Mr. Mueller, and he has been deeply, personally critical of the president in his media tour promoting his new memoir. “At this stage of an investigation, it’d be highly unusual to let an ordinary client testify,” Mr. Giuliani said. However, he added, “This isn’t an ordinary client. This is the president of the United States.” He said that they were trying to assess whether Mr. Mueller “and his staff are truly objective,” particularly in terms of Mr. Comey. “Obviously, if they’ve already made up their minds, we’d be stupid to do that.” Mr. Trump’s legal team is not united on precisely how to deal with Mr. Mueller’s office going forward. But a person familiar with the discussions said that they expected to visit with Mr. Mueller’s team in the next few days as they try to find a path forward. Mr. Giuliani’s longtime law partner, Marc L. Mukasey, is likely to join the team after a success this week in a trial in Connecticut, two people close to the team said. Mr. Trump has expressed different views at different times about whether he wants to sit for an interview with Mr. Mueller. But some people on the president’s team believe that the only way to wind down the special counsel investigation is to negotiate an interview, or something in its place, that would satisfy the questions Mr. Mueller has. Those talks broke down when the United States attorney in the Southern District of New York executed a sweeping search warrant on the home, hotel room and office of Michael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump’s longtime personal lawyer. Mr. Trump has denounced that investigation, and he has maintained that there was “no collusion” between his campaign and Russians seeking to influence the 2016 election. But Mr. Giuliani is a well-known name who was willing to take on Mr. Trump’s case, and he has a personal relationship with Mr. Mueller from his own days working for the Justice Department. Some of Mr. Trump’s lawyers believe that the existing law does not allow for the prosecution of a sitting president, meaning that Mr. Mueller is most likely to simply issue a report to Congress, regardless of whether Mr. Trump takes part in an interview.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Give Poor New Yorkers a Break on Subway and Bus Fares,"Editorial The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section. It isn’t every day that a chance comes along to improve the lives of hundreds of thousands of people in poverty in a single stroke. Yet Mayor Bill de Blasio has been handed just such an opportunity, with the proposal to offer half-price MetroCards to the 800,000 New Yorkers living at and below the federal poverty line. The current price of a monthly MetroCard — $121 — is a costly burden for these residents, who rely on public transit more heavily than others but spend far greater portions of their income than better-off New Yorkers to ride city subways and buses. The proposal from the newly elected City Council speaker, Corey Johnson, would bring much-needed relief. Under the plan, the city would spend about $212 million to offer half-price MetroCards for these New Yorkers, money that would be included in next year’s budget. Council officials say the funding would be enough to serve the 360,000 low-income residents expected to take advantage of the discount. The City Council would also like to offer the benefit to military veterans who live in New York City and are enrolled in college. Antipoverty advocates have embraced the idea for years. So have we. But Mr. de Blasio is dragging his feet, saying that the idea is a “noble” one, but that the city cannot afford it. Given the mayor’s free-spending ways, we’re somewhat perplexed by his hesitation. The city’s budget has increased every year since Mr. de Blasio took office, to $87.4 billion this year from about $70 billion in 2014 fiscal year, the last budget negotiated under Mayor Michael Bloomberg. The city should continue to add to its reserves and increase spending only with caution. It should keep an especially careful watch on the city’s swelling payroll, which has added billions of dollars in recurring costs under Mr. de Blasio. But the MetroCard program is a responsible addition. Seniors, people with disabilities and some students already receive reduced fares. The city can afford to extend that benefit to the poorest New Yorkers. The mayor has said that he supports it in theory, and that it should be paid for by a millionaire’s tax. Yet the elusive millionaire’s tax requires Albany’s approval, and isn’t likely to happen. Thankfully, Mr. Johnson has given the idea new life, joining forces with antipoverty activists who have long fought for the measure to put pressure on the mayor. Standing with them this week at a rally outside City Hall to support the half-price MetroCard were the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus Vance Jr.; the Brooklyn district attorney, Eric Gonzalez; and the Bronx district attorney, Darcel Clark, who view the proposal as another tool to chip away at the poverty that can lead to crime. Mr. Vance said earlier this year that he would no longer prosecute people based solely on fare-beating, a sordid use of the courts that costs taxpayers about $50 million every year. In Manhattan alone, about 8,000 people were prosecuted for fare-beating in 2017, according to Mr. Vance’s office. A study from the nonprofit Community Service Society in 2016 found that New Yorkers living at the federal poverty level — $12,752 for a single person and $19,749 for a family of three — are often spending more than 10 percent of their annual income on public transportation. The group, which has long pressed for the half-price MetroCard, estimates that an individual would save about $700 a year under the initiative. Mayor de Blasio has taken to saying lately he wants to make New York City “the fairest big city in America.” Here’s a good place to start.",The New York Times
2018,Given Their Initials,"Wordplay MONDAY PUZZLE — Not all Monday puzzle themes are completely straightforward. Sure, you’ve got your simple letter or sound addition or subtraction themes, or your vowel progressions. Other themes, even if they’re easy, will insist that you train your brain to think somewhat outside the box, and I’ve heard from people who say that they just can’t put the theme together in their minds, even on a Monday. That has to be discouraging. There is good news, though: If you are asked to solve a tougher-than-usual theme, the surrounding entries and the clues will be gentle. You’ll find extra toeholds sprinkled throughout the grid so that you can fill in enough to enable you to take that educated guess at solving the theme. So hang in there if you are just getting started. There’s a way to do this. Erik Agard — who just broke records at the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament by not only solving faster than the seven-time champion, Dan Feyer, but by solving faster than anyone has ever solved an A Division final puzzle before — returns with a shiny, Monday puzzle. This is the kind of theme that might not make much sense until you get to the revealer at 52A, but that’s O.K. There’s something to be said for a Monday puzzle that holds its secrets until the end. I think it makes the solve more exciting, and there’s no letdown from having guessed the theme right out of the gate. You might have noticed that the three starred clues all have answers that have two things in common. First, the three theme entries are all actors. Second, their initials are A. G. Why do we care about that? Well, Mr. Agard has noticed a connection between those initials and an older nickname for cinema: SILVER SCREEN, that revealer I mentioned. The connection, if you have forgotten your high school chemistry, is that Ag is the chemical symbol for silver and all of these actors are stars of the screen. In nontheme news, I liked TAKE A CUT (especially crossed with HECK YES, which cracked me up), NIGIRI (because sushi would be my main food group if I could afford to eat it every day) and learning what SWAG SURFing is: 7A: My more technically inclined colleagues and I took a meeting about this clue (“Small computer program”), and while it is true, it was determined that not only could APPLETs be big computer programs sometimes, but that the term APPLET is somewhat outdated. 40A: Clue of the day, in my opinion: “Here’s the kicker!” is something people say when they are getting ready to deliver the punch line to an unbelievable story, but don’t let that distract you. Today, Mr. Agard and the editors are just offering a FOOT. 62A: These porch tinklers are wind CHIMES. Why, what were you thinking? 1D: I have an ULTA shop not too far from where I live and have bought cosmetics there. Unfortunately, they’ve recently been accused of reselling used merchandise. 12D: Well, yes. TED Cruz has been “in the news.” 28D: From the Department of Sushi Pedantry: I don’t know if this would have fit, but a more accurate clue would have been “Sushi consisting of thin slices of fish over rice balls,” which is your individual piece of NIGIRI sushi. Sushi consisting of thin slices of fish over (a bed of) rice is known as chirashi. So there. Man, I’m hungry. Is it lunchtime yet?

2018,Giving Babies Antibiotics or Antacids May Increase Allergy Risk,"Babies given antibiotics or antacids in infancy may be at increased risk for allergies in childhood. Researchers retrospectively studied 792,130 infants covered by a health insurance program. Of these, 131,708 received antibiotics, 60,209 got histamine-2 receptor antagonists and 13,687 were given proton pump inhibitors. Both H2 blockers and P.P.I.s are prescribed for gastroesophageal reflex, or GERD. The study, in JAMA Pediatrics, followed the children for an average of four and a half years. It found that infants given H2 blockers or P.P.I.s were more than twice as likely to have a food allergy as those who were not; the risk was especially high for allergy to cow’s milk. Those given antibiotics were at a 14 percent increased risk for food allergy, a 51 percent increased risk for anaphylaxis (a potentially fatal type of allergic reaction), and more than double the risk for asthma. The authors suggest that both antacids and antibiotics disrupt the normal intestinal bacteria and that this may explain the association. “Let’s not prescribe these medicines for things that are very common in babies,” said the senior author, Dr. Cade M. Nylund, an associate professor of pediatrics at the Uniformed Services University. “Just because a baby spits up doesn’t mean that it’s a disease that requires treatment with a P.P.I. And we have to avoid overprescribing antibiotics for upper respiratory infections and other viral illnesses.”",The New York Times
2018,Gleyber Torres Arrives as Part of a Pinstriped Youth Movement,"On Baseball The text message startled Austin Romine, in a good way. Before taking the field as the starting catcher on Sunday, Romine heard from a friend that he was the oldest player in the Yankees’ lineup. Back in the clubhouse later, Romine shook his head and smiled. It was not long ago that he was the young guy, surrounded by veterans. “It creeps up on you,” Romine said. At 29, Romine almost did not qualify for the Yankees’ don’t-trust-anyone-over-30 lineup, which cruised to a 5-1 victory over the Toronto Blue Jays. He batted ninth, just behind Gleyber Torres, who made his major league debut at 21 years 130 days old. He is the youngest player in the American League. “A little bit surprised, excited and super happy,” Torres said on Sunday morning after a restless night of sleep. Less than 24 hours before, on Saturday afternoon, he had been facing the Toledo Mud Hens in Moosic, Pa., batting .347 for the Yankees’ Class AAA team, when Manager Bobby Mitchell pulled him from the game in the seventh inning. “He told me, ‘Hey, just stay in the dugout,’” said Torres, who seemed to know what that meant. “I said, ‘Wow.’” Soon enough, Torres had found his new locker, in a spot of honor at Yankee Stadium. He dresses between Gary Sanchez and Aaron Judge: three pillars of a pinstriped youth movement. Torres got a jersey-number upgrade, too, from 81 in spring training to 25, like Jason Giambi and Mark Teixeira, the former first basemen. Those players came to the Yankees on free-agent deals worth a combined $300 million. Torres arrived in a much different way than almost any other Yankee: as another team’s sapling, not a redwood. Torres had never played above Class A when the Chicago Cubs traded him and three others to the Yankees for Aroldis Chapman in July 2016. “We were all extremely excited about it,” said the injured outfielder Billy McKinney, who was also part of the deal. “I thought it was really cool, because it was, I guess, a little bit different from the Yankees’ culture.” Instead of pushing for a long-shot berth in the 2016 World Series, General Manager Brian Cashman played matchmaker for the Cubs and the Cleveland Indians, who got reliever Andrew Miller for outfielder Clint Frazier. Torres said he did not watch that Cubs/Indians World Series, because he was playing in the Arizona Fall League. He had moved on. “I think everybody wants to play with the Yankees,” Torres said. “I got the opportunity, and I’m excited for that.” The Yankees could have given second base to Torres and third base to Miguel Andujar — who was 4 for 4 on Sunday — out of spring training. Instead, after camp began, they traded for Brandon Drury and signed Neil Walker. That was the Yankees at their best, protecting themselves with affordable veteran placeholders until the kids push their way up. “They’re earning their time,” Manager Aaron Boone said. “Maybe a little bit different — this early — than maybe we thought, but hats off to them for putting us in that position right now.” Think of Robinson Cano tearing through the minors in early 2005, bumping Tony Womack off second base in the first week of May. That could be Torres now. He had a forgettable debut on Sunday, with a strikeout, a ground-ball double play, a foul out and a fly out to right. But Cano went 2 for 23 in his first week, and turned out just fine. Giancarlo Stanton compared Torres’s swing to that of another second baseman, Javier Baez, one of the infielders who had blocked Torres’ path in Chicago. Baez hit .273 with 23 homers last season and, like Torres, was a consensus top-10 prospect before his promotion. “There’s a lot going on, but it’s very precise,” Stanton said of Torres’ swing. “He’s got some cool action in there and some pop at the end.” Torres has played only 14 games at second base in the minors, and 23 at third. His main position, shortstop, belongs to Didi Gregorius in the Bronx. But McKinney called Torres an electrifying defender — “He can make fireworks happen, I like to say,” McKinney said — and Boone praised his overall acumen, without citing a standout tool. “I don’t necessarily think there’s anything that’s ‘wow,’” Boone said. “He’s not going to go out in B.P. and hit the ball, like some of our guys, a mile. He’s not going to wow you with his speed. But he does everything really well on the baseball field. “He can hit, he uses the entire field, his strike-zone recognition — I think he’s going to be a guy that walks, over time. He’s a really good defender at all three spots and can legitimately play short, that’s the kind of defender he is. That baseball I.Q., baseball clock — he just seems to have all those things.” Torres sped up his career clock, and now he has arrived. The hard part awaits. “Like I tell all the guys, making it to the big leagues, it’s like nothing,” Gregorius said. “Staying in the big leagues for a long time, that shows your worth.”",The New York Times
2018,Gleyber Torres Is Joining the Yankees,"Gleyber Torres cannot help an erratic staff of starting pitchers. Nor can he help shake Giancarlo Stanton from his April funk. But the Yankees hope that calling up Torres from Class AAA on Saturday will provide a jolt before they fall much farther behind the Boston Red Sox in the American League East. Torres, the Yankees’ much-ballyhooed top prospect, will be in uniform — and quite likely in the lineup at second or third base — on Sunday at Yankee Stadium against the Toronto Blue Jays. Torres, who was acquired nearly two years ago from the Chicago Cubs, was pulled from Scranton/Wilkes-Barre’s game in the seventh inning on Saturday so he could head to New York, according to a baseball official who was speaking on the condition of anonymity. The New York Post first reported the move. Torres, who was hitting .370 with a .415 on-base percentage and a .543 slugging percentage in Class AAA, will be joining a team in need of a boost. The Yankees beat the Blue Jays on Saturday to improve to 10-9 and pull within six and one-half games of the Red Sox, who were beaten in a no-hitter in Oakland Saturday night. The Blue Jays are in second place, four games behind the Red Sox. Torres has been playing exclusively at third base over the last week, and if he plays there with the Yankees, the current third baseman, Miguel Andujar, will be moved to another spot — either first base or designated hitter. Andujar, who is filling in for Brandon Drury (migraines), has been the Yankees’ hottest hitter of late. He is 9 for 20 over his last five games, with five doubles, a triple and two home runs. Torres is considered a better defender than Andujar. A more pressing need, though, is at second base, where the Yankees were forced to turn to the utility player Ronald Torreyes after Tyler Wade and Neil Walker got off to poor starts. Wade is hitting just .086, and Walker, who has also played first base, is hitting .183. Torreyes is hitting .417, but he has little power and the Yankees value his versatility. Though Torres is only 21, his debut has been anticipated for some time. The Yankees intended to call him up last season, but in late June he tore ligaments in his left elbow while sliding headfirst into home plate. The injury to his nonthrowing arm required Tommy John surgery and cost him the remainder of the season. The Yankees prohibited Torres from playing winter ball to ensure he was fully healed, and the inactivity showed during spring training. But Torres has worked his way into better shape in the minors. Tim Naehring, the Yankees’ assistant general manager, has been following Scranton/Wilkes-Barre and keeping an eye on Torres. A week ago, the Yankees felt Torres needed a little more time in the minors. “I think it’s just getting him into the flow of the season,” Manager Aaron Boone said last weekend in Detroit. “At that point, we’ll probably have a decision we have to make.” On Saturday, it was made. An earlier version of this attributed an erroneous distinction to Gleyber Torres. Torres, who turned 21 in December, will not be the youngest player in Major League Baseball; there is at least one younger player in the league. The error was repeated in a picture caption.",The New York Times

2018,Opinion | Going Cashless Is Risky,"Letter To the Editor: Re “My Journey Into a Cashless Future,” by David Gelles (Sunday Business, April 1): Going cashless seems like a good idea, but it isn’t. Many have “go bags,” filled with essentials so that they can get out of town in case of a disaster. But if there is such an event, credit cards won’t help. Drive away and try to check into a motel, and the credit card network may be down. In addition to a go bag, it helps to have some ready cash on hand, mostly in fives, tens and twenties. That will get you what you need when your credit card won’t. RICHARD WATT, NEW ROCHELLE, N.Y.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Going to Church With Jimmy Carter,"Margaret Renkl Ms. Renkl is a contributing opinion writer. I knew I was in trouble as soon as I pulled into the parking lot of the Quality Inn in Americus, Ga., last Saturday night. It was long past dark but I could see well enough to note the out-of-state license plates — New Mexico, Pennsylvania, California, Alaska — places far from this peanut-farming land. We were all there for the same reason: to see Jimmy Carter teach Sunday school at the Maranatha Baptist Church in the nearby town of Plains. And if the crowded parking lot was any indication, finding a seat the next morning would be a challenge. After the inauguration of Ronald Reagan in 1981, President Carter returned to Plains, his hometown. Throughout the longest and most influential post-presidency in American history, he has continued teaching Sunday school, and the public is always welcome to sit in. President Carter’s commitment to human rights — executed largely though Habitat for Humanity and The Carter Center, which works to eradicate poverty and disease and cultivate democracy — earned him a Nobel Peace Prize in 2002. In his acceptance address, President Carter said, “God gives us the capacity for choice. We can choose to alleviate suffering. We can choose to work together for peace.” Even when he isn’t teaching Sunday school, his unwavering Christian faith informs everything he says and does. My own faith in religious and democratic institutions has not been so unwavering, especially not since white Christians put a demagogue in the White House. But I have always wanted to go to his Sunday school class. When President Carter, now 93, announced that he was cutting back on his teaching schedule at the church and publishing a new book — “Faith: A Journey for All” — it seemed almost like a sign. Jimmy Carter still has faith in this country, and I hoped his Sunday school lesson might restore my faith, too. The sanctuary of the Maranatha Baptist Church seats 350 people, and there’s a spillover room with a live video feed for another 100 or so. “Based on recent attendance trends, visitors who arrived before 6 a.m. had no problem obtaining a sanctuary seat,” the church’s website reads. In my motel room I set the alarm for an hour I haven’t seen since 1998, the last time there was a newborn baby in my house. Fifteen minutes before it went off, I heard the pipes rattling as someone in the next room took a shower, so I jumped in the shower myself. Trying to beat a total stranger to Sunday school is not exactly in the spirit of Christian charity, but I wanted a seat in that sanctuary. In springtime, rural Southwest Georgia is as pretty a place as you will find on this earth — wildflowers swathing the fallow fields and blooming along the edges of red soil already plowed for planting, bluebirds hunting from fence posts, mockingbirds sending dueling songs into the pines — but I couldn’t see any of that from Highway 280 in the predawn darkness. I arrived at the church and was given a number — 41 — and told to park in the pecan orchard because the lot was already full. At 7:45 it would be time to get in line to be checked by the Secret Service. I wasn’t there early enough to be guaranteed a seat in the sanctuary, a church member said, but it wasn’t out of the realm of possibility. Thanks to the early riser in the motel room next door, I made it into the sanctuary. While we waited for President Carter to arrive, I chatted with a Baptist minister sitting in the pew behind me about a recent interview with Stephen Colbert, in which Mr. Carter hinted that he considers the sitting president of the United States a liar. Asked what it takes to be president, he told Mr. Colbert, “I used to think it was to tell the truth. But I’ve changed my mind lately.” There were flashes of the same impish wit on display at the church in Plains. “Do we have any visitors this morning?” he joked to the crowd. He asked where we were all from, and voices sang out from places like Cameroon, Israel, Uzbekistan. When it was time for the lesson itself, President Carter stood smiling and spoke without referring to notes, moving to the lectern only to read from the scripture. The text was from the Acts of the Apostles, passages concerning the priorities of the early church. “They worshiped together. They had fellowship together. And a third thing: They took care of each other’s needs, even in a sacrificial way,” he said. He spoke particularly about the generosity of Barnabas, who sold his own field and gave the money to Jesus’ apostles to distribute to the needy. President Carter is not a pacing, gesturing, booming-voiced orator, but he is a brilliant teacher — moving nimbly between his memories, his concerns for the world and what the Acts have to say about the right relationship of human beings to one another. He asks questions, nods encouragement when an answer is close but keeps nudging until someone hits on the point he’s trying to make. “We have lost faith in a lot of things that have always nurtured us,” he said. “Many people in the world have lost faith in democracy. We’ve lost faith in the sanctity of telling the truth and the value of education. We’ve lost faith in the equality of people. In our country’s history, some of our greatest struggles have been over the issue of equality.” Then he asked the congregation what year women in the United States gained the right to vote. Several called out “1920!” But it was a trick question. “That was white women,” he reminded us. “A lot of white people don’t remember that distinction.” He spoke movingly about his first security briefing as president-elect, about the solemn responsibility of the country’s commander in chief to safeguard nuclear weapons. “If we don’t figure out as collective human beings how to get along with each other, even the people we don’t like and with whom we don’t agree — say the Americans and the Russians, the Americans and the Chinese, the Americans and anybody else — if we don’t figure out collectively how to get along with each other and take care of each other, that might be the end of humanity.” President Carter is a realist, and he’s concerned about the current state of the world, but he was also careful to say he doesn’t believe the worst will happen — “I’m a Christian, and I believe God’s will and God’s love will prevail, but I worry about it.” And he returned again to his call to “take care of each other, even the people that we don’t like, even our enemies.” At the Maranatha Baptist Church, a Sunday school lesson is a master class in responsibility and goodness and, above all, love. He reminded the congregation that Barnabas was known among the early Christians as “the encourager.” And encouragement is clearly something Jimmy Carter knows a great deal about.",The New York Times
2018,Golden State Killer’s Victims: The Families Who Never Gave Up Hope,"LOS ANGELES — At 15, in the throes of a teenage rebellion, Debbi Domingo ran away from her mother’s home in Goleta, Calif., a small town near Santa Barbara. Two weeks later, she returned home to a swarm of police cars in the cul-de-sac. Her mother and her mother’s boyfriend had been brutally murdered after being tied up and beaten so badly that detectives were initially unsure of their identities. It was 1981 and the authorities struggled for any clues that could lead to a possible motive or suspect in the killing of her mother, Cheri Domingo, then 35, and her boyfriend Gregory Sanchez, 27. The police looked into possible drug use or unpaid debts. Officers questioned Ms. Domingo’s father for hours, chasing the possibility that he might have attacked his ex-wife. A conclusive answer did not come until three decades later, when a major break in a very cold case led to the arrest of Joseph J. DeAngelo, 72. Law enforcement officials consider him the Golden State Killer, who is believed to have committed more than 50 rapes and 12 murders. “This not a club anyone really wants to be a member of,” Ms. Domingo said Thursday, speaking by phone from her home in Lubbock, Tex. For her, learning that her mother’s murder was part of a series of attacks was “comforting” in an odd sense, she said. “From my perspective, when it was looked at as something totally isolated, it’s easy to feel very insignificant, like your case is easily forgotten.” Over the last several years, Ms. Domingo has immersed herself in the world of armchair detectives and online sleuths. She has spent hours on social media trying to be a “squeaky wheel” — putting together clues that might identify the killer. A handful of other victims joined together to do same, talking almost daily. They formed a kind of sorority based on shared pain and relentless focus. The process, Ms. Domingo said, was “therapeutic.” “We just did not give up hope,” she said. “To see that the DNA matches came through, that he’s alive and that they have him in custody — that’s what we were all praying for.” The Golden State Killer had terrorized one of his victims in the very town where Mr. DeAngelo was arrested Tuesday. Linda O’Dell and her husband were sleeping in her Citrus Heights home in 1977 when she awoke to find a strange man in their bedroom, who told her not to move. She thought she might be having a nightmare as the man tied them both up, so tight that her husband soon could not feel his hands. He untied her ankles and took her to the living room, where he held a knife to her throat and raped her. He stayed in the house, drinking beer, for several hours; before he left, he demanded her wedding band and engagement ring, warning her he would cut her fingers off if she couldn’t remove them. He also took her state photo identification, which would haunt her for years to come. “I couldn’t identify him because he had a ski mask on the whole time,” Ms. O’Dell, 63, said. “But he had my photograph and my driver’s license, so I always had this fear that he could be standing next to me at the grocery story and I’d have no idea. That was always a fear.” She could hardly believe that he had been living in Citrus Heights, so close to where he had attacked her. For a long time, she could not talk about what happened. Ms. O’Dell said her sister had provided comfort, moving in for a year after the attack because Ms. O’Dell was afraid to be alone while her husband was at work. She said she shared her story freely now because she felt more empowered. “I was 22 years old and there was a lot of shame and there wasn’t empathy for victims. And I felt embarrassed. I felt judged. I didn’t feel like a victim back then. I didn’t want people to know it about me,” she said. “But I’m part of the Me Too movement now, and I feel like I’m strong and healthy. There’s power in being this way.” By the fall of 1977, the man who was then known as the East Area Rapist had been terrorizing women in the suburbs of Sacramento for more than a year. Margaret Wardlow, then 13, had been captivated by the case, reading about the methodical ways he had sought and attacked his victims. Her mother, who was then 55, tried to assure her that they were too old and too young to make for appealing targets. But one night in November, Ms. Wardlow awoke to a man holding a flashlight in her face, whispering angrily. Initially, she thought it was a neighbor playing a joke to get her out of bed before school. Then, she saw a clock showing it was 2:30 a.m. “Then I knew clearly: This is the East Area Rapist,” she said. “I knew he got off by frightening people and I thought the less enjoyable time he has here the better.” Knowing that he had yet to kill anyone, Ms. Wardlow said she had focused on getting the rape over with. As he tied her up and blindfolded her, he asked if she wanted him to kill her mother or her. She recalled responding coolly, “I don’t care.” While the attack was over within minutes, he stayed in her home for more than an hour. He had placed plates on her mother’s back, warning her he would kill her if he heard the plates rattling — just as he had warned the husbands of other women he raped. He had entered through the sliding glass door upstairs and left through the front door, Ms. Wardlow said, turning on the kitchen sink and stove fan for ambient noise. She recalled hearing her mother screaming for help. Soon after, a neighbor arrived with a shotgun. Investigators later confirmed Ms. Wardlow’s hunch that she had been attacked by the serial rapist, who used the same method over and over again. A couple of years after the attack, Ms. Wardlow and her mother moved to Orange County, Calif., where murders that the authorities believed to be linked to the same suspect had occurred. Her mother urged her to go to therapy, but she refused. Ms. Wardlow said that to this day she has not spoken of her attack to a professional. It was only a year and a half ago, after Ms. Wardlow had searched “East Area Rapist” on the internet, that she realized the serial rapist who had attacked her had become a serial killer and was never caught. “I always felt like I triumphed,” she said. “I felt like I controlled what happened as much as I could, I had influence over that night. I felt like I was the victor and I’ve always gone with that.” Jennifer Carole had just turned 18 when her father and stepmother, Lyman and Charlene Smith, were murdered in their Ventura home in March of 1980. Her younger brother, then 12, found their bodies in their bedroom when he went to mow the lawn and heard their alarm clock going off. At first he thought nothing of it, but he grew concerned when it continued to ring. The killer had sexually assaulted Ms. Smith and bludgeoned both husband and wife to death with a log from the fireplace. Their killing sparked enormous fear and unrest in the small town. Even with her own loss, Ms. Carole expressed sympathy for the surviving rape victims, who have had to carry their trauma with them for so many years. “I don’t know what you do after you’ve been raped and terrorized,” she said. “The people who are alive, they are the ones that really suffered.” Ms. Carole, now 56, said that after the murders she, as the oldest sibling, took methodical steps to manage the logistics involved, which she said helped give her a sense of order. It wasn’t until a year later, while at college, that she began experiencing panic attacks and difficulty focusing. Now living in Santa Cruz, she said she has seen a counselor about the trauma and that she and her brothers are living full, productive lives. Still, she expressed immense relief that the killer was finally caught. “He’s a narcissist and a psychopath. There isn’t a word we can say that will mean a thing to him,” she said. “I don’t want him on death row. He does not deserve a private room or notoriety. He deserves terror, just like what he did to us. He needs to be living in fear. That would be so highly satisfying for me.”",The New York Times
2018,Goldman Sachs May Be Getting Its Groove Back,"Goldman Sachs has gotten its groove back — for the first three months of 2018, at least. After a year of uncharacteristic struggles, the bank benefited from wild swings in prices for stocks and other assets to rake in cash in the first quarter, according to an earnings report released on Tuesday. Accustomed to dominating its rivals in the trading business, Goldman spent the past year trying to figure out how to rev up an operation feeling the pressure of new regulations and facing competition from non-bank trading platforms. As a result, it lagged its closest competitors last year. No longer. Goldman booked $10 billion in revenue for the quarter, its highest total in three years and a 25 percent increase over the same period in 2017. It reported profits of $2.8 billion, compared with $2.3 billion a year earlier. Investors were unimpressed. After rallying in early trading on Tuesday, Goldman shares fell more than 1 percent. Its competitors’ shares had followed a similar trajectory, falling or barely moving after they reported quarterly earnings on Friday and Monday. The stock market’s roller-coaster ride in the year’s first quarter enlivened Wall Street. It was a welcome change after a period of steady gains and muted trading activity that depressed bank profits, which are typically driven by frequent changes in the markets. While other big banks, including Bank of America, Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase, reported only modest improvements in trading revenue for the quarter compared with the same period last year, Goldman’s haul jumped 23 percent. The surge came not just from an increase in stock trading, but also from growth in Goldman’s trading in bonds, currencies, commodities and other assets. “It’s good to see a big recovery from last year,” said Devin Ryan, an analyst at the investment bank JMP Securities. Goldman needed the boost. Last month, as widespread concerns about the vitality of its core businesses appeared to confound the bank’s leaders, Lloyd Blankfein, the longtime chief executive, suggested he was willing to step aside within the next two years. Positive momentum this year could help smooth the transition for Mr. Blankfein’s heir apparent, David Solomon. The upturn in trading was not the only good news for Goldman. The bank has been bulking up its lending business, which Mr. Blankfein has said the bank would rely on to maintain steady growth the next time financial markets start to skid. Goldman said on Sunday that it had bought Clarity Money, a lending app with more than one million users. The increase in lending appeared to pay dividends in the first quarter. Revenue from loans and other debt products rose more than 50 percent compared with last year. The push also helped Goldman take advantage of rising interest rates, which contributed to the business’s $550 million in interest income for the quarter. Investors apparently want something more. The hedge fund manager Douglas Kass said in a message posted on Twitter early Tuesday that he expected Goldman’s stock to drop. “All the gain relative to expectations came from lower tax rate,” he said. Those in the market for bank stocks have mostly shown little enthusiasm for the biggest institutions’ first-quarter performances, despite their apparent strength. Mr. Ryan of JPM Securities said he was not surprised that banks were recording healthy results because they had gotten plenty of help from the Trump administration’s tax cuts and a general improvement in the United States economy. Investors, he said, wanted to know that the banks could continue their stellar performances after the initial stimulus from the tax cuts fades. “People are looking for signs of sustainability,” Mr. Ryan said. “I don’t think we’re getting indications thus far on the earnings calls that the outlook is much better than what’s already been anticipated.”",The New York Times
2018,Goldman’s Gains in Trading Raise a Familiar Dilemma: DealBook Briefing,"Good Tuesday. Here’s what we’re watching: • A ‘Geneva Convention’ for cyberwar? • Did Goldman’s trading business perform too well? • The U.S.-China fight has pushed deeper into tech. Some links require subscriptions. Want this in your inbox each morning? Sign up here. Goldman Sachs’s strong first-quarter earnings raise a familiar dilemma for the bank. The results got a significant fillip from trading, a business Goldman must do well in, but not so well that investors think the bank is too dependent on it. And a breakdown of first-quarter revenue shows the dominance of trading. Revenue from trading in stocks, bonds, currencies, commodities and derivatives totaled $4.39 billion during the first three months of the year. That works out at 44 percent of total revenue, well above the 37 percent share that trading had in 2017. Stock and bond markets are unpredictable, even in relatively good times, so the helpful trading conditions this quarter may not last. What can Goldman’s senior executives do to persuade investors that the bank is a lot more than a trading shop? They can point to the fact that David M. Solomon is in line to succeed Lloyd C. Blankfein, Goldman’s current C.E.O. Mr. Solomon ascent took place in the bank’s powerful investment banking division, not its trading operations. Goldman’s leaders can continue to talk about the steps the bank is taking to widen its client base and diversify into other businesses that might have more stable revenue, like its relatively new consumer lending operations. But such businesses are going to take time to make a meaningful contribution. And it’s important to remember that other major businesses at Goldman are also volatile. Investing and lending, which mostly involves making longer-term investments in companies, and whose revenue can be unpredictable, made up 21 percent of total revenue in the first quarter, the second largest contribution. Despite the bumper results in trading along with investing and lending, Goldman’s shares slid slightly on Tuesday, suggesting investors are waiting on longer-term trends than one quarter’s results. But the volatility of revenue is not the only reason investors are often skeptical about Wall Street firms. The huge amounts that they pay out in compensation is also a concern. When revenue rises, so does pay. As a result, money that could have fallen to the bottom line at other types of companies instead gets paid out to traders and bankers. Compensation at Goldman Sachs made up 45 percent of non-interest revenue in the first quarter, up from 44 percent the first quarter of 2017. — Peter Eavis Taxes and market volatility lifted Goldman Sachs’ bottom line during the first quarter. Here are the numbers: — Goldman reported earnings of $2.83 billion, up 26 percent from a year ago. — Earnings per share came in at $6.95. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected $5.58 a share. — Revenue increased to $10.04 billion from $8.03 billion a year ago. Analysts had expected revenue of $8.74 billion. — Overall trading revenue rose 31 percent from a year ago. — Revenue from stock trading climbed 38 percent. — Fixed-income trading revenue increased 23 percent. — Fees from investment-banking revenue rose 5 percent to $1.79 billion, driven by an increase in underwriting revenue. Starbucks said it would close more than 8,000 of its stores in the United States on May 29 to conduct racial-bias training for nearly 175,000 employees. The move comes amid an outcry prompted by the arrests of two African-American men at a Starbucks location in Philadelphia last week. The two men were arrested after asking to use the restroom in the shop. An employee refused their request, because the men had not bought anything, according to officials. The men sat down and were asked to leave, and an employee eventually called the police. The prosecutor’s office in Philadelphia reviewed the case and declined to pursue charges against the men because of “a lack of evidence that a crime was committed,” according to a spokesman. Tom Buerkle of Breakingviews writes that Starbucks is setting an example for corporate America: “Facing a backlash over the arrest of two black men at a Philadelphia shop, the chain will shut all of its company-owned U.S. outlets for an afternoon of racial-bias education. The swift response backs up Starbucks’ social goals and offers a lesson to others.” Some may be optimistic that the $1.5 trillion tax cut will extend the business cycle. The strategists at Morgan Stanley are not among them. “While there’s a fair amount of debate about how much this fiscal expansion extended the economic cycle, for markets our analysis suggests we’re closer to the end of the day than the beginning. Hence, there’s less reason to behave like it’s ‘morning in America’ than ‘happy hour in America.’” Key points • Morgan Stanley argues that while the tax cuts will help lift growth in the near term, its benefits are already priced into the markets. • The new tax law creates economic cliffs, as many key provisions in the law are not permanent and end in just a few years. • The tax cuts may make it more difficult for the government to turn to fiscal stimulus to fight the next downturn. In conclusion “While this policy supports growth in the near term, it may worsen the next downturn while limiting the fiscal reaction to it. Even if those concerns are unfounded, we think much of fiscal stimulus’ ‘good news’ is already in the price of key markets.” It was another blockbuster quarter for Netflix. The streaming video company added 7.41 million subscribers during the first quarter. Its profit jumped 62 percent, and sales grew 40 percent. Netflix also said it plans to spend $10 billion on content and marketing this year. Shares are up 8.6 percent Tuesday and 75 percent this year. That easily beats the S.&P. 500, which has gained just 0.2 percent this year. It also tops the performance of its fellow FANG stocks. Facebook is off 4.5 percent this year, Google-parent Alphabet is up about 3 percent, and Amazon has risen 28 percent. Stephen Ju, an analyst over at Credit Suisse, writes in a note titled “Getting Closer and Closer to Achieving Escape Velocity”: “Netflix continues to reap the benefits of its programming win streak, as it wields its large content acquisition budget as a weapon to put greater distance between itself and its competitors (especially as Disney prepares to exit the platform). And we find it hard to argue with the accelerated pace of subscriber additions as the conceptual proof of its capital allocation decision, and we also expect the Street to continue to underwrite the investments.” Twitter is having an even better day. Its shares are up 12 percent after a Morgan Stanley analyst upgraded the stock to equal-weight and raised its price target to $29. It is the eighth upgrade since it reported third-quarter earnings in October, according to Bloomberg. The stock is up 87 percent over that period. In pledging not to help any government — including the U.S. — with cyberattacks against “innocent civilians and enterprises,” Microsoft, Facebook and 29 other tech companies are trying to distance themselves from the messy business of national cyberwarfare. That may reassure some tech workers. (Earlier this month, Google employees protested their company’s work on a Pentagon project, saying the tech giant “should not be in the business of war.”) The NYT’s David Sanger says the impetus came largely from Microsoft’s president, Brad Smith, “who has been arguing for several years that the world needs a ‘digital Geneva Convention’ that sets norms of behavior for cyberspace just as the Geneva Conventions set rules for the conduct of war in the physical world.” Also striking: Who hasn’t yet signed, including Google, Apple and Amazon. The context: The U.S. and Britain just yesterday warned about sweeping Russian cyberattacks on governments, businesses and private individuals. Elsewhere in tech: Tesla halted production of its Model 3 to work out kinks. Netflix reported its strongest subscriber growth since going public. Investors are considering dropping Facebook from their FAANG bets, while a federal judge gave a photo-scanning lawsuit against the company class-action status. Amazon Business is reportedly holding off on selling drugs to hospitals. Coinbase is buying the paid inbox service Earn.com. And TaskRabbit has gone offline to investigate a possible hack. Trump administration officials said that moving to block China’s ZTE from using U.S. components wasn’t a trade-related decision. But it’s hard not to see as the latest salvo in Washington’s fight with Beijing, particularly over technology. (Another Chinese tech giant, Huawei, is scaling back its U.S. presence.) China’s trade deficit with the U.S. is widening. But China offered an olive branch today by loosening regulations for foreign makers of electric vehicles. On currency concerns: The Treasury Department chose not to label China as a currency manipulator. President Trump disagreed: “Russia and China are playing the Currency Devaluation game.” The truth is more complicated. Now that Mr. Hannity has been revealed as a legal client of Mr. Cohen’s, the media world has wondered what Fox News star wanted from the lawyer used by President Trump and the disgraced Republican donor Elliott Broidy. Mr. Hannity has denied paying Mr. Cohen legal fees and asserted that none of their talks involved a matter involving him and a third-party — i.e., a settlement. (The talks, he said, were brief and about real estate.) More eye-catching is the Fox News host’s contention that he might have slipped Mr. Cohen a few bucks for attorney-client privilege, which appears to be right out of “Breaking Bad.” (And legally erroneous.) • President Trump has nominated Richard Clarida, an economist specializing in monetary policy, as the Fed’s vice chairman.

2018,Good Going!,"Wordplay SATURDAY PUZZLE — Today’s puzzle, by Andrew Kingsley and John Lieb, is edgy and evocative; I dare say that I felt like one of the cool kids as I worked my way through it. The pop culture references are groovy (Twyla THARP, JESSE Pinkman, EDD “Kookie” Byrnes), and there’s the requisite pot culture reference too (GANJA). Even the seed entry at 1A was modern and ironic, and put me in a jestful mood while blogging — please don’t take offense at the caption on the creepy photo above; sometimes a little fear can bring on the wisecracks, as you know. Those fossils are in reality very small, under eight inches long. In addition to enjoying the whole vibe of this grid, I just loved a ton of clues, even some of the little ones — possibly a result of two heads being better than one when constructing for a Saturday. I thought OILER, EGO, HOLIER, BUN (talk about hipsters, you guys!) and LEG were all awesome and got misdirected mightily throughout. On a different note, if you’ve still got some puzzling to do, you should get yourself “Women of Letters,” a packet of 18 puzzles by female constructors that’ll cost you no more than a charitable donation. Once in a while, everyone wins, and that’s the truth! 15A: Words ending in “aj” sound a little Slavic, but the language referred to here is ESPERANTO. We hear about how many global languages are in sharp decline; I guess I had assumed that Esperanto was one of them, especially since the goals of a universal language, like simpler communication and world peace, seem less attainable than ever. There are actually people using it in many countries — you can even learn it on Duolingo and go on an Esperanto world tour with free home stays. 20A: In the department of “you either know it or you don’t,” I call this one a double. First of all, you have to think of the name of this powdery concoction, and then you have to spell it. I vaguely knew of “pixie sticks” — paper straws with sort of puckery sugar in them like you find on sour gummy candy — but they actually go by PIXY STIX. 29A: Like other epics, “Aladdin” has a sprawling and contested history; apparently it was not one of Scheherezade’s original tales at all, nor did it necessarily take place in the Middle East, and the protagonist might have originally been a Chinese peasant. The 1992 Disney version, though, was definitely set in a city named Agrabah, which drew influence from AGRA and its amazing palace, the Taj Mahal. To be frank with you, researching this topic was surprisingly confusing, but I must refer to this 2015 poll, in light of 1A. Apparently, at one time, there were plenty of people in the actual United States perfectly willing and eager to drop bombs on Agrabah, that fictional city. 32A: Believe it or not, today ABUJA debuts in the puzzle as “Nigeria’s capital,” even though it replaced Lagos (which has been an entry dozens of times) in 1991. 55A: Phrase clues like this are always tricky: “This looks like the end for me!” can be interpreted as bleak or (bear with me) sunny, as in “I am there!” which is what I thought at first. IM A GONER is the bleak version that fits. This entry crossed another phrase entry, NICE MOVE, that could have been any manner of expressions. 10D: This entry seemed wrong for all kinds of reasons, but TOKYO, indeed, currently has 12 restaurants given three stars by Michelin (Paris? 10. New York? Five). Those of us who think of Michelin as a French tire company trying to lure people into the countryside with restaurant reviews can be forgiven, though, as the guide got to Asia only about a decade ago. Some Tokyo restaurants and chefs have been a bit reticent about its sudden dominance — or just humble. 38D: I chortled when I solved this entry, a debut, “Lowest one in the pack.” After consulting with Cesar Millan and the canine members of my household, of whom there are three and that is the truth, it has been determined that I, dear reader, am this household’s OMEGA DOG. Andrew: Another Kings-Lieb creation! Well, maybe more of a Ki-Lieb creation, since John did the lion’s share of the work on this one. After Oxford Dictionaries declared POST TRUTH as 2016 “Word of the Year,” I knew it had to be a 1-across. Thankfully for this puzzle (and sadly for everything else), facts are still flexible and POST TRUTH is still relevant. NO PUN INTENDED was my other significant contribution (I sifted through a sea of dad jokes for the right clue, so I hope you groaned at the one I chose), and then John brought the sparkle with the other stacks. John: Writing a themeless from scratch is a daunting task, so when Andrew brought me a promising, half-filled grid and asked me if I wanted to fill in the rest, I jumped at the chance! This ended up being a “2-for-1” puzzle, as the last across entry in the first draft ended up as the seed for our first published collaboration last August (A puzzle of the week, by the way! — CL). I was on a “Mr. Robot” watching binge at the time we wrote this and was psyched to get RAMI MALEK into the grid. Also, Andrew and I are excited to be hosting the second edition of Boswords, Boston’s crossword puzzle tournament on Sunday, July 29. Registration opens on June 15 and you can find more information at www.boswords.org, including info about last year’s tournament. We hope to see some of you there!

2018,"Good Grief, Charlie Brown! You’re Graffiti","Kenny Scharf’s oozing, vividly colored cartoon figures have covered billboards in downtown Manhattan for decades. Now, his whimsical psychedelia will appear in New York in the forms of Charlie Brown, Snoopy and the rest of the Peanuts gang, as part of a new public art project bringing Charles M. Schulz’s characters to cities around the world. The project was commissioned by Peanuts Worldwide, which oversees all representations of Schulz’s indelible comics. Seven artists were chosen to form the Peanuts Global Artist Collective and interpret the characters. Nina Chanel Abney, for example, has created a digitalized, geometric rendering of Snoopy and Woodstock riding skateboards. The provocateur Rob Pruitt, known for startling juxtapositions, has placed Snoopy next to a panda bear, while the graffiti artist André Saraiva has Snoopy interacting with Mr. Saraiva’s signature stick-figure doodle. The other artists are Tomokazu Matsuyama, the duo FriendsWithYou (Samuel Borkson and Arturo Sandoval III) and the collective AVAF, founded by Eli Sudbrack. “I think I taught myself how to draw by copying Peanuts characters and strips over and over, especially the details — the grass, the snow, the wobbly lines,” Mr. Pruitt said in a statement. The murals, approximately 15 feet wide by 10 feet tall, will go up on office buildings in Hudson Square on April 16. (A map of their specific locations will be put up at the Children’s Museum of the Arts the day of.) They will remain up for three months, with similar projects going up in Paris; Seoul, South Korea; Berlin; San Francisco; Tokyo and Mexico City.",The New York Times
2018,"Opinion | Good Riddance, Mr. Speaker","Christopher Buskirk Mr. Buskirk is editor and publisher of the journal American Greatness. PHOENIX — In 2016, Wisconsin turned red for Donald Trump but Paul Ryan’s Janesville remained stubbornly blue — so perhaps it is no surprise that the speaker of the House won’t seek re-election. For Republicans, this is an unalloyed good. For his entire career, Mr. Ryan has been the wunderkind who couldn’t deliver. As the No. 2 on the Romney ticket in 2012, he was supposed to add youth, depth and a key that would unlock coveted Midwestern electoral votes. He didn’t do that, either. It required the New Yorker Donald Trump to pick that lock. This didn’t worry Mr. Ryan’s many supporters among the Republican ruling class. Congress, they assured us, was his natural habitat. In 2015, his reputation for policy-oriented nerdiness got him the chairmanship of the powerful Ways and Means Committee, where he was supposed to reform the nation’s entire fiscal regime with a superhuman knowledge of both the details and the substance of the nation’s finances. He didn’t. Undaunted, Mr. Ryan took the speaker’s chair later that year after playing Hamlet and claiming implausibly that he didn’t want the job and would accept it only if Republicans thrust it upon him. He promised fidelity to the conservative catechism and a return to budget sanity, but he didn’t follow through. His fecklessness led the Tea Party base that had swept him and his colleagues to power to grow even more disenchanted with the Republican congressional leadership. For seven years, the leadership raised countless millions of dollars and won first the House, then the Senate, and finally the presidency, in part by promising to repeal Obamacare. Nothing was more central to Republican identity between 2010 and the rise of President Trump. But when given the chance, Mr. Ryan couldn’t get the House to pass repeal. The bill the House finally sent to the Senate wasn’t a repeal but a dilution. It never became law, either. Likewise, Mr. Ryan, a longtime budget hawk, was incapable of returning the House budget process to regular order. And rather than reducing spending and the deficit, he increased both. Worse, Mr. Ryan is at odds with the president and a majority in his party on immigration and border control. The bill for those contradictions and failures has finally come due. In order to inspire the necessary loyalty and camaraderie to pass legislation effectively, House Republicans need to know that the speaker has their back. But Mr. Ryan didn’t. When Representative Adam Schiff, Democrat of California, made a spurious allegation against Representative Devin Nunes, Republican of California, Mr. Ryan backed Mr. Schiff and sidelined Mr. Nunes for months. Mr. Nunes was subsequently cleared. It’s no wonder that Mr. Ryan couldn’t hold the conference together on big votes. Republicans want and deserve a speaker with the courage and tenacity of Mr. Nunes — one who supports his troops when they’re under fire. Intellectually and politically, Mr. Ryan is part of the Reagan Revolution’s third generation. And as it is with many entrepreneurial families, it is the third generation that squanders the family fortune. They don’t know how it was created, and in their own lives they have known nothing but wealth. Reaganism remains a rich legacy, but Republicans can’t live off the interest. The predictable response from Democrats will be that Mr. Ryan couldn’t square his principles with the reality of Mr. Trump’s presidency. That might score a quick rhetorical win, but it misses the bigger political picture. America is in the midst of a major political realignment that is redefining both the left and the right. Mr. Trump’s sudden ascendance to power is a symptom of the larger trend and also a catalyst for the intellectual and political reformation that is currently underway on the right, which has led to the announced departures of standard bearers of the ancien régime like Senator Jeff Flake, Senator Bob Corker and now Mr. Ryan. The job for House Republicans will be to select a new leader who isn’t just more of the same. The last effective leader was Newt Gingrich. Since he stepped down in 1999, Republican leadership has been either corrupt or incompetent. Tom DeLay was indicted (although he was eventually acquitted); Dennis Hastert is a convicted felon. John Boehner was a do-nothing placeholder who now works for a marijuana company; and Eric Cantor so infuriated his own constituents that he was defeated by an underfunded economics professor who still holds the seat. What we need is a clean break with the time-markers and careerists who are content being the party of no. Mr. Ryan came up under the Boehner-Cantor regime, and their sensibilities have stayed with him. Like them, he failed to advocate — let alone pass — legislation supporting the agenda he claimed to believe in. His coda will be the omnibus spending bill passed last month. Not only did the bill fund Democratic priorities, and not fund Mr. Trump’s border wall, it also made the wall’s construction illegal on a stretch of the Texas-Mexico border that is home to the federally owned Santa Ana Wildlife Refuge. Mr. Ryan’s legacy will be one of lost opportunities and youthful promise unfulfilled. He’s left a mess that his successor will have to clean up. House Republicans under Mr. Ryan became a disorganized rabble rather than the energetic and effective conference confidently enacting the agenda that one would expect from a party that controls both houses of Congress and the presidency. Republicans need a leader who is in step with the president and his agenda, one who emphasizes pro-citizen immigration policies, pro-worker economic policies and an America First national security policy that is circumspect about foreign military intervention. Equally important, the next leader must be someone who commands the respect and obedience of the conference. Voters gave Republicans power because they believed that the policies the party promised offered them a better future. Republicans must repay that trust with action. Just as Moses couldn’t enter the promised land because he had broken faith with God, much of the current House leadership has broken faith with its voters. House Republicans need to find their Joshua — a leader who sees the party’s future and can bring its members together to build it. Ambitious politicians are always willing, but who’s ready?

2018,Opinion | Goodbye to the House My Grandmother Built,"Yasmine El Rashidi Ms. El Rashidi, a journalist and novelist, is a long-time resident of Cairo. CAIRO — I spent the three days of Egypt’s presidential elections late last month packing up and carrying out, with my brother, the final items of our lifelong home — a 22-room villa my grandmother had built in Cairo in 1940, along the banks of the River Nile. It was where my mother was born and lived her whole life. And I as well. My grandmother, Esmat, had dreamed of a house that would withstand generations, and when she married, she forewent standard bridal gifts in exchange for money to save toward building it. First, in 1938, she bought the land; then, she had the concrete and metal fence constructed around it. Soon enough came the house itself. It took up almost an entire block on the residential island of Zamalek, with extended and (at first) unobstructed views of agricultural lands and the Nile. The gardens were lined with mango trees; a fig tree and an olive tree stood at opposite corners, planted out of the belief that they would give the house a longer life. Back in the 1920s, modernism embodied the imagination of a newly independent state, and in the 30s, the early years of Egyptian nationalism, my grandmother, a politically inclined and strong-willed feminist, commissioned the architect Ali Labib Gabr, the dean of Cairo University’s architecture school and a pioneering architect in Egypt, to design the house under her direction. He mixed large arches and multileveled floors, majestic wood-and-glass-paneled doors that disappeared into the walls, vast windows that brought the garden into the house and small windows of different shapes and configurations. It was Modern verging on Art Deco, with the exception of two grand rooms for entertaining that were embellished with ornate cornices and other detailing in the French Beaux-Arts style still most widely favored at the time. Every aspect was carefully considered, including the bathroom tiles that curved at the corners rather than meeting at the edges. The house came to be widely documented, and listed as part of the city’s architectural heritage, legally never to be altered or demolished. It became a landmark in the neighborhood, as well as, perhaps, the most dominant character in all our lives. Growing up, I always thought of the house as ours. My mother, the youngest of four siblings, had been the last to marry, and when that time came, rather than leaving her aging, widowed mother to live alone, she stayed. The house was formally divided into two floors, and my mother moved back from the south side of the house into the bedroom she was born in, now with my father. It is there that she slept — alone again, after my parents divorced in 2001 — during all the years until she moved out on March 23. I grew up upstairs with my parents and elder brother, and my brother and I occupied the house like it was ours alone. We ran up and down the backstairs two steps at a time, played hide-and-seek everywhere — taking cover in fireplaces and secret rooftop rooms, squeezing into a dumbwaiter — and opened the doors of the garden each afternoon to play with neighborhood children. We took over the basement for experiments; my brother housed a mini-zoo on the roof, with gazelles, rabbits, pigeons, guinea fowl, myna birds and parrots. We spent hours, which made up weeks of our lives, tapping at walls, floors and steps in search of an echo that might reveal the cavity where my grandmother was said to have buried a box of treasures. It was after my grandmother died in 1984, just a few years into President Hosni Mubarak’s three decades in power, that I came to learn the house would never be entirely ours. Inheritance laws adhered to Islamic jurisprudence, and Esmat’s one son would get more than my mother or her two sisters. Many cousins soon got involved. In those years, other nearby villas were sold and demolished, and the cityscape around us drastically changed. High-rises replaced gardens, two or three to a single plot of land. Our house was sought after — not for its architectural value, but because developers saw it as sitting on prime land along the Nile. Second to buying it out ourselves, which we couldn’t afford, placing it in the hands of a buyer who would preserve it was the best we could do, and that task became a mission for my mother, pitting her against her family in a standoff that lasted 30 years. In my early 20s, as the country was beginning to reform economically and I was starting to write, I moved downstairs, inhabiting my grandmother’s floor, and my brother and I took on the cause of protecting the house ourselves. We searched widely for possible patrons who might make our home their own or turn it into a cultural center, a library or a museum. The interest that came, when it did, was always from abroad. Egyptian businessmen and patrons of culture seemed intent on investing in new developments, suburbs and multimillion-dollar modern homes, but not the center of the historic city, not the heritage already there. For 30 years the garden bell rang with real estate agents promising “respectable” buyers. Every deal fell through, and it seemed like the house might stay in this limbo forever. I wrote the house into my novel in 2014: It was the only true-to-life character in the book, and the only thing in my life, and the neighborhood, that seemed unchanged through the revolution of 2011, as our hopes for real change after Mubarak’s fall first rose only soon to be shattered. Ours was the last of family homes still inhabited by its original owners, and everyone remarked how it was the one thing that they could depend on always being there. And yet, when I wrote it into fiction, I conjured the moment where we might, indeed, pack it up. On April 1, the day that President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi’s re-election was confirmed, we handed the house to its new owners, who had circled it for two years, admiring it. My mother had at last found her buyer, a woman whom she felt would be the next best custodian to the house and its legacy. We walked through its every room together on that last day, and once the handover papers were signed in the garden, I returned inside alone to close all the doors, windows and shutters. I then led myself out of the main door, locking it behind me. Those final moments walking out, as well as the months that preceded — as we sifted through nearly 80 years of a family history, packing and throwing out and giving things away — felt like a closing, the end of an era, both for my family and for modern Egypt, independent since 1922. The house now has foreign owners, and the country — perhaps at its most conservative and repressive — is a far cry from what I ever expected it to become. The latest elections came and went, for me, unacknowledged, too farcical to consider. What might have been a turning point, a political opening, became an end. My mother’s new apartment overlooks her old garden; from her balcony, I see what used to be mine. The new owners haven’t moved in yet, but their groundsman and his family occupy the basement of our old house, and spend their days sitting on the plastic garden chairs we left behind. When the sun is setting, shutters left open offer a glimpse into my brother’s childhood bedroom; I forgot to roll them down, and the room’s white muslin curtains still hang. I feel shut out of our home, my lifelong prism into the city, and out of the future of this country.",The New York Times
2018,Goodwill Working to Help Dropouts,"Most people know Goodwill Industries International primarily through the stores that sell donated goods. But it is a $5 billion nonprofit that provides employment, education and job training for those who have difficulty finding jobs, including older people and people with criminal backgrounds and disabilities. Goodwill has 162 branches in the United States and Canada, which operate largely independently. According to Goodwill’s website, more than $4 billion of its income derives from sales at its retail stores. The remainder comes from other sources, including corporate, foundation and government grants. Over the most recent five-year period, from 2010 to 2015, the high school dropout rate fell to 5.9 percent from 7.4 percent, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. But that still means millions of Americans are without diplomas. In 2015, about 2.4 million young adults from the ages of 16 to 24 were not in school and did not have a high school degree or equivalency. Research shows that high school dropouts are nearly three times more likely than college graduates to be unemployed. Even when employed, high school dropouts earn about $8,000 a year less than high school graduates and approximately $26,500 a year less than college graduates. [READ MORE: A Chance for Dropouts, Young and Old, to Go Back to School] Much of adult education focuses on helping dropouts get a Graduate Equivalency Degree (G.E.D.), or high school equivalency credential, but research has shown that G.E.D. holders generally earn only as much as high school dropouts. According to one study, dropouts and G.E.D. recipients earned $10,000 less in their 30s than those with a high school diploma. About 3,000 students have graduated from Indiana Excel Center schools since 2010. The graduation rate was 24 percent in 2016-17, an increase from 15 percent in 2012. A useful comparison is YouthBuild, a national nonprofit that helps young adults who are not in school or working with employment and educational opportunities. It has a higher degree completion rate — either a diploma, G.E.D. or vocational certification, depending on the school. But it serves only students up to their mid-20s and is less flexible with program attendance. At the Indiana centers, 45 percent of those who have graduated are white, 31 percent black, 11 percent Hispanic and 13 percent other. Forty percent of students are from 18 to 21 years old, while 18 percent are 30 to 39 years old and 9 percent are 40 years or older. According to a 2017 report, 38 percent of graduates were enrolled in postsecondary education, and of those 76 percent have continued to be enrolled in a college or university for at least two years. The same report found that 70 percent of graduates were employed and had a 50 percent wage increase six months after graduation. That compares with only 30 percent of students who were employed upon entering an Excel Center. Most students take an average of 12 to 18 months to graduate after entering Excel, but there is no time limit. School enrollment typically ranges from about 100 to 350 students — about 20 students per class. The Indiana State Legislature spends $35 million annually funding adult education for dropouts, with much of that money going to the Goodwill Excel Center.",The New York Times
2018,Google’s Parent Company Spends Like It’s Thinking of a Future Beyond Ads,"SAN FRANCISCO — Alphabet, Google’s parent company, is spending like it is beginning to prepare for life after advertising. Currently, Alphabet makes nearly 90 percent of its money from selling advertising on the internet, and gobbles up heaps of data about its users to help marketers target those ads more effectively. But a close reading of Alphabet’s financial results for the first quarter of 2018, which were announced on Monday, showed that the Silicon Valley giant is accelerating its efforts to diversify into other businesses. Alphabet has made investments in areas like self-driving cars and online computer services for businesses for years, but spending in those areas was up dramatically in the first quarter. The company’s capital expenditures, which included installing undersea cables and the construction of new data centers, were $7.7 billion — more than triple the same period last year. Ruth Porat, Alphabet’s chief financial officer, said that increase reflected a “commitment to growth” because the company had spent heavily on computing infrastructure, for both its own internal use and customer needs like Google Cloud — the unit that provides technology services to other companies. Alphabet’s expenses rose 27 percent in the quarter. Ms. Porat said the heaviest spending came from research and development costs — mainly the hiring of additional technical staff. The company said its total employees had increased to 85,050 from 73,992 in the same period a year ago. Over all, Alphabet said its net income rose 73 percent, to $9.4 billion, from the same period a year earlier, boosted in part by an increase in the value of its outside investments. Revenue rose 26 percent to $31.1 billion. Ms. Porat also pointed out an increase in spending for advertising to promote newer products including Google’s own hardware — a relatively new business manufacturing branded smartphones, laptops and smart speakers — and the company’s artificially intelligent digital assistant. “They are thinking about their future,” said Collin Colburn, an analyst at Forrester Research who focuses on search advertising. “They want to diversify beyond just advertising being such a big part of their business.” That focus on variety comes as the data-collection practices that underpin the entire digital advertising industry are under intense scrutiny after the personal information of up to 87 million Facebook users ended up in the hands of the political research firm Cambridge Analytica. Google’s advertising business is more than twice the size of Facebook’s, and the company’s portfolio of data about its users is as expansive — if not more so — than that of the social network. Still, the search giant’s core business showed no sign of slowing in the first quarter. Revenue from Google’s advertising business, which includes ads shown on Google search and commercials running before YouTube videos, increased 24 percent during the quarter. However, Google’s advertising profits were weighed down by an increase in traffic acquisition costs — the fees that it pays companies like Apple to make sure that its search engine is the default option when people open a browser on the iPhone. Also among the company’s expenditures in the quarter: $2.4 billion to buy the Chelsea Market building in Manhattan, where the company had set up some of its New York offices. On a conference call with investment analysts, Sundar Pichai, Google’s chief executive, avoided answering questions about the potential effects of new regulations concerning data privacy in Europe. The new law, which goes into effect on May 25, will restrict how companies like Google can collect, store and use personal data from users across Europe. Mr. Pichai said the company has been preparing for the law for more than 18 months, but didn’t discuss how the new regulations may affect the company’s bottom line.",The New York Times
2018,Got a Few Million? Christie’s May Have a Monet for You. Or Five.,"Rockefeller still rings true as one of the greatest names in wealth and philanthropy — most everyone has heard of the center, the foundation, the oysters. Peggy and David Rockefeller were also known for their prodigious art collecting, and Christie’s New York is staging an auction of their trove, with multiples sales spread over three days, May 8 to 10. The house will offer masterpieces by Matisse and Picasso, as well as truckloads of valuable porcelain. Highlights from the collection have been touring the globe to increase anticipation. All the proceeds from the sale — appropriately enough to be held at Christie’s headquarters at Rockefeller Center in New York — will go to 12 charities designated by the couple. It has the potential to be the largest single-owner sale, and the largest charitable one, in history. The heart of the collection is a group of five works by Claude Monet (1840-1926), the most-represented artist in the Christie’s lineup, which will be auctioned in the first evening sale. The pictures arrive freighted with anticipation, given that five paintings by the artist have brought more than $40 million each at auction. The Rockefeller grouping forms a kind of Monet variety pack, spanning 1868 to 1917 and offering an overview of his career. “It’s very rare that you have five masterpieces by one artist in a single collection,” said Adrien Meyer, a co-chairman of the Impressionist and Modern department at Christie’s. “They cover all of Monet’s facets.” The works include one urban scene, “Extérieur de la Gare Saint-Lazare, Effet de Soleil” (1877), and three water scenes: “Bord de Mer à Sainte-Adresse” (1868), “Camille Assise sur la Plage à Trouville” (1870-71) and “La Seine à Lavacourt” (1879). The most valuable piece is from Monet’s popular Water Lilies series, “Nymphéas en Fleur” (1914-17). That’s the one the auction house expects to bring the most money: from $50 million to $70 million, Mr. Meyer said, given the track record of similar pictures. The Rockefellers doted on this picture in particular. “As you were coming down the staircase in the country, there was the Monet Water Lilies,” said Jessica Fertig, a senior Impressionist specialist at Christie’s, referring to the family estate in Pocantico Hills in Westchester County. “It was such a part of their life.” The art historian Paul Hayes Tucker, a scholar of Impressionism who has written five books on Monet, said that the lineup spoke well of the Rockefellers’ taste. “It’s elastic, catholic and embracing of all the periods, the real hallmark of enlightened collecting,” he said. Mr. Tucker said he discovered Monet as a student at Williams College in Massachusetts, where he later taught. Since then, he said the painter “has been my companion, my guide, my soothsayer.” But only from a distance: He has never owned one of Monet’s works. That privilege is reserved for a lucky few like the Rockefellers and Scott M. Black, the Boston-based founder of the investment firm Delphi Management. Mr. Black’s collection of more than 50 works includes three Monets, which he has lived with on and off over the years, when they are not on loan to museum exhibitions. Mr. Black made a fortune picking winners in stocks, which is why his clients include business titans like Michael R. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City. And in his estimation, Monet is a consistent performer. “He didn’t have too many off days,” Mr. Black said. “He’s my favorite single painter of the 19th century.” And he knows the comparables, as they say in the investment game: He owns works by Degas, Renoir, Cassatt and Pissarro. “There’s such an exuberance on the canvas,” he said. “It’s such a pleasing aesthetic experience.” Mr. Black bought his first Monet for around $1 million in 1986 — what he now considers a bargain. “It’s worth a lot more now,” he said. From the marketplace’s perspective, one notable facet of the demand for Monet’s work is its universality. “It attracts a broader market than ever,” Mr. Meyer said. “Every major Monet we’ve sold in the last few years has had serious bidders from America, Europe and Asia.” That’s music to the ears of anyone at an auction house. “It makes him an extraordinarily stable and sound name,” Mr. Meyer said. “He’s become a brand.” Of course, the brand wasn’t always gold-plated. The word Impressionism was coined by the French critic Louis Leroy, writing for the satirical magazine Le Charivari in 1874, to insult Monet’s “Impression Sunrise,” painted a few years earlier. Leroy imagined a conversation between two viewers in which one scolded, “Wallpaper in its embryonic state is more finished than that seascape.” Mr. Tucker noted that it wasn’t just Leroy who had been skeptical of Monet’s talent. As recently as the 1950s, Monet’s late work — now the most prized of all for its abstract beauty — was misunderstood and shunted aside. “Impressionism fell out of favor, with some exceptions, between the world wars,” Mr. Tucker said. “And many of the late works had been left in the studio. People didn’t know them.” Even the Water Lilies, Mr. Tucker added, were “still avant-garde for some in the 1950s.” It took the influential director of the Museum of Modern Art, Alfred H. Barr Jr., to bring conventional wisdom around. In this endeavor, he had an assist from the influential critic Clement Greenberg, most famous for his canonizing of Jackson Pollock. Just a few years after pooh-poohing the painter’s last phase in The Nation as offering “the mere texture of color as adequate form in painting,” Mr. Greenberg finally came around. He wrote in the essay “The Later Monet” that “the 20 years by which Monet outlived Cézanne turn out not to have been in vain.” Fast-forward to today, when Impressionists are beloved drivers of museum attendance, as evidenced by “Public Parks, Private Gardens: Paris to Provence,” currently at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and featuring 13 Monets. It seems that only Renoir could use a bit of public-relations help. His more flowery scenes, particularly some of the female portraits, not only seem unlikely to come back in style, they have active detractors: The Instagram account renoir_sucks_at_painting has some 12,000 followers. Renoir certainly has his acolytes, though perhaps it’s telling that his record sale, of $78.1 million, was set, at Sotheby’s, almost 28 years ago. Even Mr. Black had relatively faint praise. “With Renoir, you don’t really want to buy one after 1890,” he said. “It was downhill after then, let’s be frank.” (Fans will be happy that the Barnes Foundation in Philadelphia has an exhibition, Renoir: Father and Son/Painting and Cinema, opening May 6.) But anyone wanting to write off Renoir, or anyone else, is encouraged to remember that markets are made by buying low and selling high. The wheel of fortune has a way of turning. As for Monet, it could be said that Mr. Barr and Mr. Greenberg did their job too well — that is, if you’re thinking of buying one. The lowest estimate for the Christie’s Monets, for “Bord de Mer à Sainte-Adresse,” is $2 million to $3 million. Even investment gurus have their limits. When asked if he would be raising a paddle at Christie’s for any of the five Monets, Mr. Black demurred. “No, the prices are too high,” he said. “But I’m going to come down to see them.”",The New York Times
2018,"Gothic or Helvetica? For Brands, Fonts Help Tell a Story","Advertising When ads for the Netflix show “Stranger Things” first appeared in 2016, the glowing, blood-red, unevenly shaded font that spelled out the title told viewers exactly what they could expect. The retro typeface — and a haunting, one-minute title video — became synonymous with the supernatural thriller series and, as the show gained in popularity, memes centered largely on its instantly recognizable title have become plentiful. “You’re dealing with text and how people respond to the font,” said Peter Frankfurt, executive creative director on the “Stranger Things” project and founding partner of Imaginary Forces, a visual storytelling and brand strategy company. “None of us ever conceived this would ever be the phenomena that it is.” Hollywood has long known this marketing trick, with movie studios strategically choosing fonts, colors and lighting for a film title that will reflect its tone and genre. And in a crowded marketplace, many mainstream consumer brands — like Southwest Airlines, Remax and Domino’s Pizza — have placed more focus on fonts as a crucial part of their marketing. “It’s becoming more and more important,” added Steve Matteson, creative type director at Monotype, a company that creates, licenses and designs fonts for brands. When Southwest Airlines revamped its brand in 2014, it overhauled its font and logo as part of the upgrade. It wanted to create the image of an airline that cared about customer loyalty — one that had heart. So, Southwest changed its all-caps Helvetica font to a thicker, custom-made Southwest Sans font that included lowercase letters — changes meant to convey a softer, friendlier tone. It also added a tricolor heart to the logo, along with the tagline “without a heart, it’s just a machine.” “Now we have a unique font that really embodies our personality as a brand,” said Helen Limpitlaw, director of brand communications at Southwest Airlines. “We’re in a very competitive category and we’re trying to avoid that sameness.” The new typeface now appears on Southwest’s planes, ads, airport signage, uniforms, website and in-flight items. Before, the colors and fonts used by the airline varied from platform to platform. “The voice felt very fractured, it was a disconnected experience,” said Rodney Abbot, senior partner at Lippincott, a brand strategy and design firm that worked with Southwest. A survey of Southwest customers showed that 95 percent found the new identity appealing, according to the National Brand Monitor in 2014. “We’ve definitely seen an increase in revenue, an increase in bookings and brand momentum,” Ms. Limpitlaw said. Font style, size, shape, thickness, color, and depth all tell a story. “The typeface is an expression of the tone of voice,” Mr. Abbot said. Experts say the right fonts can help brands stand out in a competitive market. But they need to know whom they’re targeting and what they want to say. “Speaking to a mom is different from speaking to a teenager or a 65-year-old retiree,” said Frank Liu, chief creative officer at Siegelvision, a branding and communications firm. Monster Beverage is a good example of a company knowing who it wanted to speak to. In 2002, it rolled out its Monster Energy drink logo, which featured three neon-green claw-marks in the shape of an “M” on a black background, with “Monster” in white Gothic-like lettering under it. The eye-catching logo and colors exuded energy and youth and connected with fans of sports like snowboarding and Formula One racing, who were its target customers. “The graphics absolutely nailed it for that demographic,” said Paul Friederichsen, a partner at the Blake Project, a brand marketing and consulting firm. Now, 16 years later, Monster’s logo remains valuable and recognizable. Legacy companies are sometimes nervous about making changes, but they risk stagnating if they don’t. “People are afraid to rebrand these days because of the haters out there on the internet who can tear things apart,” Mr. Matteson said. When the retailer Gap changed its iconic Spire-like font to Helvetica as part of a 2010 rebrand, customers pushed back hard. “The new logo lost all the personality the original mark had acquired over the years and was rolled out without explanation or rationale,” said Matt See, senior art director at Siegelvision. “It felt like no thought was put into it.” The company ultimately switched back to its original logo. Experts recommended that companies retain font experts and conduct plenty of surveys before making a change. When the real estate giant Remax decided to overhaul and update its logo and font for the first time in 44 years, the company spent two years and surveyed 20,000 people in the United States and Canada before pushing ahead with the changes. “At the end of the day, all of these images were going to be on yard signs throughout the world, so we wanted to be sure that it resonated with the consumer,” said Abby Lee, vice president of marketing and media strategies at Remax. “Trying to change a brand after 45 years with 115,000-plus agents out there is quite a task.” The company needed the font upgrade because its typefaces didn’t translate well in the digital world: The firm’s recognizable hot-air balloon logo and aging fonts became blurred on mobile devices. This posed a significant problem because 34 percent of current home buyers are millennials — a group that relies heavily on digital devices. Done right, fonts allow brands to showcase their human side and personality, which can then connect with consumers emotionally. “It’s about understanding the power of typography,” said Mr. Frankfurt. “There are so many different ways that type communicates to us and acts in a voice and takes on a personality and it’s more prevalent than ever.”",The New York Times
2018,Government Watchdog Finds Racial Bias in School Discipline,"WASHINGTON — Black students continue to be disciplined at school more often and more harshly than their white peers, often for similar infractions, according to a new report by Congress’s nonpartisan watchdog agency, which counters claims fueling the Trump administration’s efforts to re-examine discipline policies of the Obama administration. The report, issued by the Government Accountability Office on Wednesday, is the first national governmental analysis of discipline policies since the Obama administration issued guidance in 2014 that urged schools to examine the disproportionate rates at which black students were being punished. Critics of the Obama-era guidance have questioned whether students of color suffer from unfair treatment under school discipline policies. The G.A.O. found that not only have black students across the nation continued to bear the brunt of such policies, but the effects were also felt more widely than previously reported — including by black students in affluent schools. Additionally, the agency found that school suspensions began to fall the year before the Obama administration urged schools to move away from the overuse of such measures, undermining claims that the guidance forced schools to cut suspensions. While the Obama administration’s aggressive civil rights investigations did reveal that black students were subjected to harsher treatment than their white peers for similar infractions, the G.A.O. found that it did not impose any new mandates on districts to reduce their suspension rates. The findings are likely to bolster arguments for preserving the 2014 guidance and undercut conservative claims that the guidance has resulted in federal overreach and a decline in school safety. On Wednesday, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos hosted groups of educators and advocates for and against the disciplinary guidance, the 12th set of round tables the department has held in the past year — and the first Ms. DeVos attended in person. Nina Leuzzi, a prekindergarten teacher at a Boston charter school, said she kept her word to her class of 20, predominantly minority 4-year-olds, in making her case to the secretary for why the guidance should stay. When the children asked her why she was traveling to Washington, she told them it was to keep them safe. “Rescinding this would send the message that there is no longer a concern about discrimination in our schools,” Ms. Leuzzi said. Nicole Stewart, a former vice principal in San Diego, told Ms. DeVos that pressures to reduce suspensions had made schools dangerous. She said administrators did not expel a student with a knife at her school because he had a disability. Weeks later, he slit a student’s throat, she said. “It is no wonder that our kids don’t think that rules and consequences apply to them,” Ms. Stewart said. “We are not modeling what consequences look like in the real world.” Ms. DeVos is facing new pressures after Republicans linked the guidance to the February mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., and President Trump assigned her to lead a school safety commission that will consider whether to repeal the guidance. Ms. DeVos has declined to say publicly whether she believes that racial bias plays a role in the disproportionate rates at which black students are punished in school. But according to attendees at Wednesday’s meeting, the secretary opened her remarks by acknowledging that the conversations were taking place on the 50th anniversary of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s assassination, and that racial disparities in discipline were a problem in the country. Evan Stone, co-founder of Educators for Excellence, which represents nearly 30,000 educators across the country, said the acknowledgment gave him hope. “Still, we have a real uphill battle ahead,” said Mr. Stone, who attended the meeting with Ms. Leuzzi and five other teachers who are part of the group. Members of Congress urged Ms. DeVos not to make a decision on the guidance until the G.A.O. report was made public. The Education Department did not issue a response to the G.A.O. findings, as is customary, and did not respond to a request for comment on the report. The Obama administration guidance was issued based on data that showed that, in 2012, black students were being suspended at three times the rate of their white peers. According to the G.A.O. analysis, in the 2013-14 school year, black students accounted for 15.5 percent of all public school students, but represented about 39 percent of students suspended from school. The agency also found the disparities for black students started in preschool, and persisted regardless of the type of school they attended — disparities were particularly acute in charter schools — or the disciplinary action they received. And black students were the only race in which both boys and girls were disproportionately disciplined across six disciplinary actions examined, which included corporal punishment, in- and out-of-school suspensions, expulsions and school-related arrests. Moreover, the agency found that black students were suspended more often than their white peers in schools of all poverty levels. In the most affluent schools, 7.5 percent of black boys had been given out-of-school suspensions, while 1.8 percent of white boys had. The finding marks the first time that national discipline rates have been analyzed by poverty level, and challenges a common claim that poverty, more than race, may be driving disproportionate rates of disciplinary actions. Daniel J. Losen, director of the Center for Civil Rights Remedies at the University of California at Los Angeles’s Civil Rights Project, called the finding “groundbreaking.” He said it affirms other research that shows that even black boys raised in rich neighborhoods were likely to earn less than their white peers. “This further shows that poverty is not explaining the disparities,” Mr. Losen said. “There’s a racial discrimination problem, and that can no longer be disputed.” The G.A.O. analysis was requested by Representative Robert C. Scott, Democrat of Virginia, and Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York. The agency was charged with identifying patterns in disciplinary actions among public schools, the challenges that school districts faced with discipline reform, and how the Departments of Education and Justice have addressed the issue through enforcement measures. The investigation took place from November 2016 through March, and included data analysis and interviews with officials in the Education and Justice Departments, as well as district leaders in five states. The report was praised by Democratic lawmakers as evidence that the 2014 guidance had value. The guidance informed schools that wide racial disparities could signal discriminatory practices that could result in a federal investigation and loss of federal funding. It also suggested a number of strategies for managing nonviolent behavior without resorting to kicking students out of school. “The G.A.O.’s first-of-its-kind analysis confirms that racial bias contributes to pervasive discipline disparities,” Mr. Scott and Mr. Nadler said in a joint statement. “The G.A.O.’s findings underscore the need to strengthen the guidance, not rescind it as some have recommended.” But critics who want to see the Obama-era guidance rescinded said the report’s scope was too narrow to draw broad conclusions. “None of these findings change the basic story line,” said Michael J. Petrilli, the president of the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, a research organization. “What we’ve learned is discipline reform is being applied unevenly. If you are concerned there are some specific districts and schools that are responding particularly poorly to this, I don’t think this study gets at that question.” Mr. Petrilli also said the report did not answer the question at the heart of the Obama-guidance criticism: whether racial bias accounted for all the disparities. The G.A.O. examination illustrated how racial bias was unfolding in some districts. For instance, at a school district in Kentucky where black students were 10 times as likely as white students to be disciplined, school officials acknowledged that 61 types of violations were undefined, which allowed staff to punish black students more harshly. In interviews, district officials also reported that they maintained broad discretion in how they disciplined students, and that more serious offenses, like those concerning weapons, violence and drugs, still resulted in removing students from school. And all of the school districts reported that while they embraced the opportunity to revise their approach to discipline, their biggest barrier was not student behavior. It was the lack of resources to tackle cases of trauma and mental health issues that increasingly plague the nation’s children.",The New York Times

2018,Grace Jones on a Lifetime of Doing Whatever She Pleases,"The documentary “Grace Jones: Bloodlight and Bami” showcases the 69-year-old music and fashion icon at her most fierce and most vulnerable. Grace Jones opened her life to the filmmaker Sophie Fiennes starting in 2005. The result is the documentary “Grace Jones: Bloodlight and Bami.”CreditCreditDina Litovsky for The New York Times Grace Jones was sitting in an opulent hotel suite in Paris, naked underneath a fur coat, opining about her act. “The performer, out there, takes a risk,” she said, sipping Champagne. “It’s a lonely place. But it’s a fascinating, lonely place.” That’s a signature moment from “Grace Jones: Bloodlight and Bami,” a documentary that traces nearly five years in the life of the singular vocalist, unparalleled stage goddess, fashion renegade and general paragon of the fabulous life, who will be 70 in May. This is also Grace Jones: “I look like a bug from outer space.” At that particular moment she was wearing a black headpiece that covered her eyes and extended behind her like an exoskeleton. Alongside her gift for one-liners, Ms. Jones’s extraordinary collection of chapeaux — “I have a nice hat head,” she said demurely in a phone interview last month — is on display in the film, which opens April 13. Directed by Sophie Fiennes, it tracks Ms. Jones starting in 2005 as she records an album, gigs around the world and, most revealingly, visits family in her native Jamaica, where she and her clan discuss their strictly religious upbringing and the violence of her stepgrandfather, known as Mas P. (“Bloodlight” is Jamaican musician slang for the red light of a recording studio, and bami is a local flatbread.) Even on modest family outings, she rocks notable headgear. “The stage Grace, it’s not a facade, it’s not a fake — it’s a manifestation,” said Ms. Fiennes, a British filmmaker and sister of the actors Ralph and Joseph, who has also made films about the Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Zizek and the painter Anselm Kiefer. “Grace is always living the limitless possibilities of being — the possibilities of every moment, that you could live it more extremely,” Ms. Fiennes said, adding, “I always remember when she saw the film, she stood up and said, ‘I love the smell of your film.’” Ms. Jones also taught her how to hula-hoop. Since the cameras stopped rolling, her career has had a reboot: she’s headlined major festivals like Afropunk in Brooklyn, released a best-selling memoir and seen her iconic styles revived. She’s even name-dropped in “Black Panther,” whose Dora Milaje fighters have a bit of her aesthetic. “People always said I’m ahead of my time, but how far ahead of my time? Am I just arriving right now?” she said, laughing. “I don’t want to sound like a crazy ex-acid tripper,” but “it does all seem to come together in a very cosmic way.” Speaking one night from her brother’s home in Los Angeles — Ms. Jones is nocturnal, or as she put it, “I’m a vampire, so get over it” — she discussed her newfound willingness to show a softer side of herself. These are edited excerpts from the conversation. You’re used to being on camera, but was it different to have documentarians follow you for years? Once I decided I trusted Sophie, I just pretended she wasn’t there. When you grow up in the modeling world, you get to a point where you are all the time having your guard up about how you look. There was maybe one time, I thought, oh, Sophie dear, I look a little bit fat there — [laughs] not like in my pictures. And I just say to myself, what am I doing? This is not about that. It’s O.K. to be myself. Your stage presence is so fierce, what did it feel like to show yourself in more vulnerable, intimate moments, like meeting your newborn granddaughter? Normally I don’t like people to see that vulnerable side of me, it’s not a side that I normally would share with the world. But when I decided to do the film, I felt strong enough, actually, to show the vulnerable side. A lot of my stage performance [persona], I found out later, was actually coming from Mas P, who was my bully, who was an abuser. And I always thought maybe that is why that stronger side was there, to protect the little girl in me. I like to call the little girl Bev [her middle name, which she went by as a child, is Beverly], and Grace is the protector. [Laughs] I’m starting to sound like Sybil. In the film, we see how often you still have to keep people in line about how to respect your vision. There’s a lot of fantasy connected to me, I know that. I had to be very strict on managers, because sometimes they do have other agendas. I literally managed myself for 15 years. I learned a lot from working with Chris Blackwell [the Island Records founder, who released her debut studio album, “Portfolio,” in 1977]. I still call him one of my mentors. I believe he tested me on some things — when we were recording sometimes, and he wouldn’t show up, just to see if I was going to handle everything right. And when things would go wrong, I would walk out of the studio. I’ve done a lot worse than what you’ve seen in the film. If I don’t want something, people will tell you, there’s nothing you can do — you couldn’t pay me enough, you can’t buy me to do something I don’t like, and that’s just how I am. I don’t know if it’s from growing up in a very, very strict family. It could be that — after I got out of there, and I had my own say, that I’m going to stick with how I am feeling. You’re also always fighting to get the right contract. How did you build that expertise? I just would not have lawyers ever have any meetings without me being there. They always say, “Oh, just go, do your tour, do your thing, look pretty, go on TV, let us worry about that.” I didn’t do that. I would come to every meeting with the contract, and if I didn’t understand, I’d have them explain it to me. I’d come with a sandwich, and sit among all the guys. I’ve had new artists see me on a flight and come up to me with a contract and say, can you read this for me? You lament the dwindling of night life culture: “11:30 in New York, and people are leaving a party. Honey, they must be depressed.” Is it hard to find people who can keep up with you? Oh definitely. Nowadays, even the younger ones — I’m going, oh my God, come on, what’s wrong with you guys? It wasn’t just keeping up with me — in the ’80s, all of us would just seem to have more energy. I used to love giving parties in my apartment in New York, it was a loft apartment, where I mean, God, people were crashing the parties and it would be some famous movie star. They would sleep in the bathtub, or anywhere. You’d wake up and there’d be bodies everywhere. Do you ever feel old? Never. I feel wiser. In your book you mention that you’re not a fan of a lot of pop artists, like Miley Cyrus and Nicki Minaj. Who do you like to listen to now? I love the Jamaican reggae artists that nobody really hears of over here, I think the only one that has broken through is Chronixx. I loved Amy Winehouse, I thought she was very unique. Sam Smith. I heard lately a girl, she has that kind of French name and she’s kind of looking like a mini-me — she was wearing the hair kind of like me, a suit. Janelle Monáe. Her new single sounds Janet Jackson-y. Oh no. Well, there goes that. You see, this is the problem, when you can’t tell who’s who anymore. It just seems like everyone’s on the same merry-go-round technically, every voice has something put to it, so that everybody sounds the same. It sounds mechanical, there is no warmth. I refuse to let them put stuff on my voice, absolutely not. Did you learn anything about yourself from watching the film? I’m funny! I found myself laughing at myself more than I normally would, going, oh my God I can’t believe I did that, did I really say that? Because it’s not scripted, it’s not like I have to rehearse any lines — things would sometimes come out of my mouth and I’d go, oh Jesus. An earlier version of this article omitted part of the title of the documentary about Grace Jones. It is “Grace Jones: Bloodlight and Bami,” not “Bloodlight and Bami.”",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Graft in South Africa: The People Deserve Better,"Editorial The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section. It may seem unfair to single out South Africa for its corruption. It’s not the worst offender in sub-Saharan Africa, and far from the worst in the world — India, China and Russia rank far worse on the Transparency International list, and South Africa has functioning democratic institutions and a lively press. But countries should be measured less against the rest of the world than against their own potential and promise, and on that score, the same African National Congress that Nelson Mandela led to a triumphant victory over apartheid a quarter century ago has become gorged on corruption. What is particularly galling, as Norimitsu Onishi and Selam Gebrekidan reported in The Times, is that so many of the millions filched from state coffers were earmarked to lift up the poor left behind by apartheid. While politically connected companies and individuals have grown wealthy, the gap between them and the poor, most of them blacks, has only grown. A recent report by the World Bank and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development found that despite some progress since the end of apartheid, South Africa remains “one of the most unequal countries in the world.” The potential for change was evident when the A.N.C. finally forced President Jacob Zuma out of office in February. Mr. Zuma’s nine years in office were a byword for obscene corruption, and he now faces corruption, racketeering, fraud and money laundering charges. His successor, Cyril Ramaphosa, promised in his first state-of-the-nation address that “this is the year in which we will turn the tide of corruption in our public institutions.” Yet President Ramaphosa is himself a veteran A.N.C. member and made a fortune largely through his ties to the party, and his cabinet includes officials who stand accused of corruption. Mr. Mandela may have been partly responsible for the state of affairs when he struck a grand bargain with the white minority that finally gave the black majority control over politics but left many economic resources in the hands of whites. That, according to current perceptions cited in The Times article, created incentives to give and receive bribes. Yet while the flawed transition may explain the rise of corruption, it cannot justify the perfidy of officials who were reared on the ideals and aspirations of the movement Mr. Mandela led. The corruption described by Mr. Onishi and Ms. Gebrekidan is not simply bribery, but rather elaborate schemes to siphon off tens of billions of public dollars intended to improve the lives of the very people the A.N.C. promised to lead to a new, equal and just nation. That is one reason that it is fair to single out South Africa. Another is that the “beloved country” of Alan Paton’s South African classic has the democratic tools to combat the blight of corruption, as the unfolding case against Mr. Zuma demonstrates. The question is whether Mr. Ramaphosa or the A.N.C. are any longer capable of wielding them.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Grandma Wants to Return Home. I Can’t Tell Her Home Is Gone.,"Op-Ed Contributor Mr. Qabbani took part in the 2011 nonviolent protests for freedom that preceded the Syrian civil war. My grandma, one of the millions of Syrians who have been internally displaced by war, just turned 90 amid the news of the chemical attack last week in the city of Douma, on the outskirts of Damascus. A mother of six children, she once lived in what has become a scene of utter destruction in the region known as Ghouta. Appalling images of the chemical attacks now are making headlines as President Trump threatens retribution, with the risk of raising the carnage to a new level. But the chemical attack is not what concerns many Syrians the most. The civil war, well into its seventh year, has made death part of daily life. And while the violence is often carried out with conventional weapons, the attack last week was not the first time weapons of mass destruction have been used in Syria. What matters most to Syrians is the sheer scale of killing and displacement, not what weapon has been used to cause it. And what worries my grandma is whether she can ever return to live in her ruined house. Recently, such a return seemed possible, thanks to a lull in violence after the Syrian regime made military advances in eastern Ghouta. The government forces now control many cities in those once very green and peaceful eastern suburbs of Damascus. But now eastern Ghouta’s beautiful agricultural landscape has again become a theater of extreme violence and inhumanity, recently described as “hell on earth” by the United Nations. Back in August 2013, the area was subjected to a chemical attack that left some 1,400 dead. Although my grandma is old, she follows the ebb and flow of developments on the battlefield that she still considers her neighborhood — a region where she spent more than 70 years. Dreading the probable impact of the terrible news, her children have not yet told her that her house has been destroyed and looted. So she continues to want to return as soon as possible, and her family continues to put her off. The spacious two-floored, three-bedroom house in eastern Ghouta has always been precious to Grandma. It was a gift from her father upon his death. Back in the 1940s, for a Syrian woman to have a whole house in her own right was a mark of advanced empowerment. She treasured the gift, lived in it for decades, and has always taken pride in her ownership. Indeed, every time I visited Grandma on weekends before the civil war broke out, she would tell us stories about her house and how she spent much of her lifetime’s savings to renovate and maintain it. In the Syrian culture, a house is worth more than its economic value. It is the source of emotional and physical well-being and security. Family ties are strong, and the idea of placing your mother in a home for the elderly is not socially acceptable; it would bring disgrace to the whole family. Losing a house is particularly devastating for the elderly. Before Grandma was forced to leave, she would rarely spend a night outside her house. Now she has been displaced for some five years, staying at her children’s homes in Damascus, and changing beds every couple of months. Being displaced is difficult for her. But losing all hope of returning home would feel like losing a beloved child forever. Because the seven-year-old uprising-turned-conflict is shattering my grandmother’s dream of return, I too feel some guilt about her situation. In 2011, as a peaceful protester, I took part in the initial uprising, alongside many young people chanting peacefully for freedom and political rights. I never imagined that nonviolent demonstrations would lead to a devastating all-out war that would displace my beloved grandma and make me a refugee. I have a mix of feelings when I see the picture of Grandma’s collapsing house. It represents not only my childhood memories, which now feel almost unreal in the midst of the relentless violence, but also my crushed struggle for freedom. I cannot stop visualizing everything that used to be in the house, from its old steep stairs to the polished wood front door, through which my grandma’s head would peep in welcome as we arrived to visit. The inside was nothing special, but the arabesque scrollwork and embroidered greenish furniture in the large salon looked like antiques in a deserted museum. The destruction of my grandma’s house is not the tragedy. The destruction of an old woman’s sense of place and hope of return to where she wishes to die is. Her house was not destroyed with chemical weapons. It was knocked down with conventional ones. Along with the assassination of Grandma’s dream of dying in peace, the hope of a nation for freedom and a better future has been under attack for more than half a decade now in Syria while the world looks the other way. It is likely that my grandma will die before her house is reconstructed. But the disgrace of the world leaders who failed her and many other Syrians will surely live on.",The New York Times
2018,"Gray Ghosts, the Last Caribou in the Lower 48 States, Are ‘Functionally Extinct’","Trilobites HELENA, Mont. — The battle to save the so-called gray ghosts — the only herd of caribou in the lower 48 states — has been lost. A recent aerial survey shows that this international herd of southern mountain caribou, which spends part of its year in the Selkirk Mountains of northern Idaho and Washington near the Canadian border, has dwindled to just three animals and should be considered “functionally extinct,” experts say. The Selkirk herd had been disappearing for the last several years. In 2009, the herd, the southernmost in North America, had about 50 animals and was declining. Wildlife officials in Canada began a last-ditch effort to protect them by killing wolves, which occasionally preyed on the few caribou that remained. But the root cause of the extirpation of this herd and the decline of others in Canada is extensive industrial development in British Columbia, experts say. “The functional loss of this herd is the legacy of decades of government mismanagement across caribou range,” said Mark Hebblewhite, a wildlife biologist at the University of Montana. British Columbia “has permitted logging, road building, unsustainable recreation, oil and gas development, and mining to continue in mountain caribou habitat,” he added. “The tragic outcome was very predictable.” Known as gray ghosts because they are only rarely glimpsed, they differ from other types of caribou, which are plentiful on the tundra. The feeding behavior exhibited by the animals, which are also called deep snow caribou, is unusual. As snow builds up in the winter they head higher into the mountains, where they stand on snow to be able to reach and feed on lichen called Old Man’s Beard that grows on the branches of old-growth trees. The total number of southern mountain caribou in Canada declined to 3,800 this year from 4,500 the year before, and their existence is considered precarious. “Only an interconnected system of protected habitat and land managed for conservation will prevent the loss of mountain caribou,” said Candace Batycki, a conservationist with the Yellowstone to Yukon Conservation Initiative in Alberta.",The New York Times
2018,Greek Court Upends Rules Limiting Migrants’ Movements,"ATHENS — The authorities in Greece were scrambling on Thursday to respond to a top court’s ruling that migrants arriving on Greek islands could travel freely around the country, a decision that could relieve pressure on detention centers but potentially undermine a European Union agreement to manage the flow of refugees. There are no “serious or overriding reasons of public interest” to justify a measure, known as “geographical restriction,” prohibiting migrants on Greek islands from going to the mainland while their applications are being processed, according to a ruling by the Council of State, Greece’s highest administrative court, on Wednesday. In March 2016, the European Union reached an agreement with Turkey to try to ease a migrant crisis on the Continent. Under the terms of that deal, refugees arriving on Greek islands from Turkey had to remain in their port of entry while their applications were reviewed, leading to camps where thousands languish in deplorable conditions and where frustrations often boil over into riots. Athens has been reluctant to lift restrictions on migrants’ movements, fearing that doing so would remove disincentives for refugees and their traffickers to cross the Aegean. “We’ll see how we will tackle it,” said Yiannis Balafas, a deputy migration minister. But he added that the decision was unlikely to “topple” the deal between Turkey and the European Union. The decision on Wednesday, which is not retroactive, will not apply to the more than 15,000 refugees already being held in detention centers for months or even years while their asylum applications are reviewed. Greece and Turkey have a long history of tensions over territory and sovereignty, which could aggravate the situation. “The tension does not help the management of the refugee and migration issue,” the migration minister, Dimitris Vitsas, said on Tuesday. “On the contrary, it creates problems, so it is in our interest and that of Turkey to reduce the tension and the rhetoric.” With spring weather improving in Europe, the number of refugees trying to reach European shores has begun to rise again, and dozens arrive each day. That is significantly less, however, than the thousands who crossed the Aegean each day at the peak of the refugee crisis in early 2016. The 28 countries in the European Union granted asylum to 538,000 people in 2017, almost 25 percent less than in 2016, according to Eurostat, the statistics arm of the organization. Syrians, Afghans and Iraqis made up 64 percent of those granted protection. More than 60 percent of those granted asylum had applied in Germany, with the next largest numbers of successful applications in France, Italy and Austria. Greece accepted 12,015 applications for asylum last year, Eurostat said. Gavriil Sakellaridis, the head of Amnesty International’s Greece chapter, said the Greek court decision had created new responsibilities for the government in Athens. “We expect the Greek authorities to respect this decision and transfer asylum seekers reaching the islands to the mainland,” he said on Wednesday.",The New York Times
2018,"Greek Fighter Jet Crashes After Encounter With Turkish Aircraft, Officials Say","ATHENS — A Greek Air Force jet crashed into the Aegean Sea on Thursday, killing the pilot, as he returned from a mission to intercept Turkish aircraft that had violated the country’s airspace, Greek officials said. The Turkish government did not comment publicly about the accusations of an encounter. The state-run Anadolu news agency quoted unnamed military officials as disputing scattered reports that there had been a dogfight between jets from the two countries and denying that any Turkish Air Force jet had been in the area. Greek officials said nothing about what might have caused the crash, or whether it was connected to a confrontation with Turkish jets, though they stressed that the crash occurred several kilometers from the site of the interception mission. The Hellenic Air Force identified the pilot as Capt. Giorgos Baltadoros, 33, a father of two children, and Defense Minister Panos Kammenos described him on Twitter as a “hero who fell defending national sovereignty and territorial integrity.” An official at the Greek Defense Ministry said the jet was returning from a mission to intercept two Turkish F-16 jets farther east, near the Greek island of Lesbos. “The mission had finished and it had been on its way back with another Greek plane,” said the official, who was not authorized to speak publicly. Close encounters between Greek and Turkish aircraft are common in the Aegean, which is flanked by Greece to the west and Turkey to the east, and where the traditional foes have engaged in lingering territorial disputes. Air patrols in the Aegean and interceptions of Turkish aircraft that Greece considered to be in its airspace have spiked in recent weeks, increasing friction between the neighbors, both members of NATO. Greece said its troops fired tracer rounds on Monday night as a warning after a Turkish helicopter with its lights off flew close to the Greek islet of Ro in the southern Aegean. The conflicts have escalated at a time of high tension on Turkey’s southeastern flank, along its border with Syria. Turkey, Iran and Russia are deeply entwined in the complex civil war, Israel has struck at Syrian and Iranian targets, and the United States and its allies are weighing strikes against the Syrian government for suspected use of chemical weapons.",The New York Times

(One tip: Don’t say “Green Card.”) Couples must prove that their relationships are real by providing proof they live together or photographs of their time together. Still, officials and immigration lawyers caution that answering all of the questions correctly doesn’t necessarily result in a green card. And lately, the bar has been a lot higher for immigrants in the country illegally. Here is a sampling of questions gathered from immigration lawyers that you can test with your partner. (In the real world, officers can separate applicants to make sure they’re not gaming the system.) The questions will get more difficult as we go on. How did you meet? How soon after you met did you start dating? When did you meet each other’s families? How did you decide on getting married? Where did you buy the ring? What was the wedding like and who attended? What did you do afterward? Where did you eat? The goal is to tell the immigration officer your love story. In approaching the interviews, immigration officers assume the relationship is a fraud. The green card process is long and drawn out, and the burden of proof is on the couple. Anyone caught lying could face prison time and a fine of up to $250,000. The immigrant could also be barred from getting a marriage-based green card ever again. “We have seen more scrutiny and more questions about marriage lately,” said Kate Lincoln-Goldfinch, an immigration lawyer in Austin. Depending on the interview, an immigration officer might also ask more difficult questions: Draw me a diagram of your bedroom. How do you enter your home? What subway does your spouse take? What did you do last night? What did you do for Christmas? What gift did you give your spouse? When was the last time your spouse saw the mother-in-law? Where did you first meet your spouse’s brothers and sisters? Does your spouse have any tattoos or hospitalizations? The officer could also do a number of other things: Visit your home or park outside to see if you both actually live there. Talk to your neighbors. Dive into public records. If the immigration officer is still not convinced once the process is complete, the applicant could receive a notice of intent to deny. The applicant has a chance to respond and, if the response is denied, file a new petition or appeal, which can be expensive. In some cases, applicants are referred to immigration court. Red flags that immigration officials look for are disparities in age, religious and linguistic differences, and if either person has already been through the immigration process with someone else. One tip from an immigration lawyer: Have an attorney present during the interview, and make eye contact, which in some cultures is not the norm. An officer could “judge this person through the lens of American culture, even though that person could be newly in the U.S.,” said Michael R. Jarecki, an immigration lawyer in Chicago. Let us know how you did in the comments. Or if you’ve been through the process in real life, share your experiences. And here are more questions.",The New York Times
2018,Gregg Popovich Is Absent for Game 3 After Wife’s Death,"Gregg Popovich did not coach Game 3 of the Spurs-Warriors N.B.A. playoff series on Thursday night after his wife’s death. Erin Popovich died at 67, the Spurs announced on Wednesday. She had been married to Gregg for 40 years, and they had two children and four grandchildren. A cause of death was not reported, but she had been ill for some time. The Popoviches met when Gregg was an assistant coach at Air Force and Erin was the daughter of a team trainer. Following a 110-97 loss to the defending champion Golden State Warriors, the Spurs are down three games to none and are one loss away from being eliminated from the playoffs. One of Popovich’s assistants, Ettore Messina, coached the team for Game 3 in San Antonio. N.B.A. players rallied around Popovich on Wednesday and Thursday. Popovich, 69, is one of the most successful and respected coaches in N.B.A. history. In addition to the five championships the team has won, he is known for his wry and combative style with reporters and his strong left-of-center political views. After Cleveland beat the Indiana Pacers on Wednesday night, the Cavaliers’ LeBron James reacted to the news: “I’m a huge Pop fan. I love Pop. That’s such a tragedy. My best wishes go out to Pop and his family. That’s devastating news.” The interview with James drew criticism because many viewers, judging from James’s reaction, believed that the reporter, Allie LaForce, had sprung the news on him unexpectedly. But James posted a video later saying he had been warned before the interview that he would be asked about Erin Popovich’s death. “It’s bigger than the game,” Kevin Durant of the Warriors said on Wednesday night. “It’s bigger than winning and losing. It’s about the brotherhood we built as N.B.A. players and everybody in the N.B.A. family."" Many other current and former players offered their sympathy and good wishes. Steve Kerr, coach of the Warriors and a close friend of Popovich’s, declined to comment on Erin’s death, reportedly too shaken to do so. An earlier version of this article misidentified Kevin Durant’s team. He plays for the Golden State Warriors, not the Oklahoma City Thunder. (Durant used to play for the Thunder.)",The New York Times
2018,Grenfell Tower Survivors Still Displaced 10 Months After Blaze,"LONDON — Nearly 10 months after the fire in London’s Grenfell Tower residential high-rise that killed at least 71 people, many of the families left homeless are still living in hotels or other temporary accommodations. More than 200 households were displaced by the fire on June 14 that ripped through the 24-story tower, whose residents were mostly low- and middle-income. Additionally, nearly 100 families from nearby towers damaged by the fire are also still in emergency accommodations, Dominic Raab, a junior housing minister, told lawmakers last week. The local council that oversees the upkeep of Grenfell and the recovery process has spent about $280 million to secure new housing for the displaced families. Many of them complain, though, that they are dissatisfied with their options and that their needs are not being met. The council spent nearly $30 million alone on hotel bills between June and February, according to figures obtained by the Press Association under the Freedom of Information Act. “We kept saying we didn’t want to live higher than the third floor or in a large tower block because of the trauma we went through,” said Asma Kazmi, a mother of three who survived the fire. “For seven months, they showed us flats on high-up floors in big tower blocks,” she said, rolling her eyes. “We just accepted temporary housing to get out of the hotel, but all this moving and limbo is really harming our children,” Ms. Kazmi added. “My 5-year-old is so confused and still asks me when we are going home.” The Grenfell blaze has come to symbolize inequality in one of London’s wealthiest neighborhoods, where incomes can vary greatly from block to block. Grenfell Tower residents had complained about fire safety for several years and accused the authorities of ignoring those complaints. Residents also allege that regulators put cost before safety, saying that cheap, combustible materials used on the exterior of the building in a major refurbishment in 2014 might have helped spread the flames. The police have said that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the local council and the organization that managed the tower block had committed corporate manslaughter. The council and the management organization have refused to comment on the allegations while a criminal investigation into the causes of the fire’s rapid spread is still in progress. Grenfell United, an organization for the survivors of the fire, said that the council’s recovery efforts lacked a “humanitarian aspect.” Shahin Sadafi, a spokesman for Grenfell United, questioned why the local council started to buy properties before asking survivors what kind of housing they needed. He said that many people were frustrated and angry because the housing being offered ignored their expressed preferences. People are asking not to be housed in properties that overlook the charred tower, or have only one exit, he said. “Yet, they are being shown those exact types of properties.” John Walker, a displaced tenant of a nearby building that was damaged by the fire, said residents’ voices “are still not being heard.” “If this happened to a luxury residential block, everyone would have already been rehoused,” he said. Another major complaint from survivors, local activists and politicians is what they say is the slow pace with which the council has acted, which they say has led to a waste of resources. Local politicians say the $30 million spent on hotels would have been enough to rebuild the original tower at least three times over. An independent task force that has been assessing the recovery for Grenfell residents said the local council had made a “huge effort” at rehousing. But the task force also said it had not yet seen enough evidence that the council’s strategies, plans and resources were translating into improvements for enough of the survivors and for the wider community. “Converting plans into action and delivery on the ground remains patchy,” the task force said in a report published last month. The task force said the council’s property purchases had created the best opportunity so far to move residents out of temporary accommodations, but added that the target of permanently rehousing all households by the first anniversary of the fire was a “huge challenge” that was unlikely to be met. A spokesman for the council said that employees were working around the clock to ensure that families were rehoused as quickly as possible. “We are moving at the pace of the survivors, and we believe nobody should be forced to make a decision on what is a very big decision at a very traumatic time,” the spokesman said. Last month, the British housing secretary, Sajid Javid, acknowledged that progress had been far too slow. He told Parliament that only 62 of 202 displaced households had been resettled into permanent housing. Alan Carter, a member of Justice4Grenfell, a community-led organization, said that while many survivors had found it difficult to make snap decisions about their futures, the council had not been prepared to give them the guidance and options necessary to meet their needs quickly. “The waiting has been agonizing for some of the bereaved families,” Mr. Carter said. “The council keeps talking about progress,” he added. “But the fact that we have dozens of people in hotels nine months after such a terrible tragedy is really shameful and unacceptable.”",The New York Times

2018,Grindr Sets Off Privacy Firestorm After Sharing Users’ H.I.V.-Status Data,"Grindr, the social network aimed at gay, bisexual and transgender men, is facing a firestorm of criticism for sharing users’ H.I.V. status, sexual tastes and other intimate personal details with outside software vendors. The data sharing, made public by European researchers on Saturday and reported by BuzzFeed on Monday, set off an outcry from many users. By Monday night, the company said it would stop sharing H.I.V. data with outside companies. The criticism of the company continued on Tuesday, with officials in Europe and the United States joining in. A consumer group in Norway filed a formal complaint with the country’s data protection agency, accusing the company of breaching European and Norwegian laws. Two United States senators sent a letter to Grindr’s chief executive, asking whether the app had asked users to opt in before it shared their most personal details with third parties. In a statement on Monday, the company said that sharing user data with outside companies was a standard industry practice and that Grindr had “policies in place to further protect our users’ privacy from disclosure.” On Tuesday, in response to questions about the Norwegian group’s accusations, a Grindr spokesman said: “We welcome the questions about our policies and always look for opportunities to improve. ” An increasing number of online users in the United States, along with some members of Congress, are questioning the tech industry’s largely unfettered collection and data-mining of consumers’ personal details. The Grindr controversy also highlights the widening regulatory gap between the United States, which lacks a comprehensive federal consumer privacy law, and Europe, where privacy is viewed as a fundamental human right, with laws to back it up. Grindr, which is owned by the Kunlun Group, a company based in Hong Kong, has more than 3.6 million active users. The Norwegian Consumer Council, a nonprofit group in Oslo that first raised concerns about the company’s practices, said the dating app had shared users’ H.I.V. status with two software companies, Apptimize and Localytics. Although the app encrypted the H.I.V. status data, the analysis found that Grindr had shared other highly sensitive details — including users’ romantic aims and self-identified tribes like “leather” or “bear” — with an ad-targeting company without encryption. In a complaint to the Norwegian data protection agency, the group said Grindr had violated a European data protection law that requires special protections for processing sensitive data including details about health and sex. The group said Grindr had also violated a provision in the law that requires companies to obtain informed consent before using people’s data for new purposes. In its statement, Grindr said that it worked with software vendors to improve its platform and that, in doing so, it may share details about users’ H.I.V. status or location. The company reminded users that “Grindr is a public forum” and that they should know that data they included in their profiles, including their H.I.V. status, would become public. “As a result, you should carefully consider what information to include in your profile,” the statement said. But consumer advocates said Grindr had used intimate personal details for purposes that the app’s users had never signed up for or even knew about. “It’s totally invisible to the user, which is why they feel betrayed and a loss of control when sensitive data about them is shipped to some third party,” said Justin Brookman, the director of consumer privacy and technology policy at Consumers Union, the advocacy arm of Consumer Reports. “I hope this will get app developers and other companies to rethink their promiscuous data-sharing practices.”",The New York Times
2018,Groups in Myanmar Fire Back at Zuckerberg,"SHANGHAI — Civil society groups in Myanmar on Thursday criticized Facebook’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, arguing that he mischaracterized his company’s effectiveness at detecting and quashing messages encouraging violence in the country. Taking aim at comments Mr. Zuckerberg made in a recent interview, the groups said that Facebook had no consistent methods for dealing with hate speech in Myanmar. The same problems keep recurring, they said, with the company routinely failing to follow up on their comments and suggestions. In a conversation with Ezra Klein of Vox this week, Mr. Zuckerberg referred to a pair of chain letters that were widely shared in Myanmar on Facebook Messenger last year. One message warned Buddhist groups about an imminent attack by Muslims, expected on Sept. 11. The other, spread among Muslims, cautioned of violence from Buddhist nationalists on the same date. “So that’s the kind of thing where I think it is clear that people were trying to use our tools in order to incite real harm,” Mr. Zuckerberg said. “Now, in that case, our systems detect that that’s going on. We stop those messages from going through.” In an open letter, the organizations, which have worked with Facebook to flag dangerous and misleading content, including the chain letters, said the messages had spread for days, caused widespread fear and set off at least three violent incidents. They also said there was no system at all, only a group of organizations and volunteers doing their best to keep up with a torrent of vitriol. “In your interview, you refer to your detection ‘systems.’ We believe your system, in this case, was us — and we were far from systematic,” the letter says. “From where we stand, this case exemplifies the very opposite of effective moderation: It reveals an overreliance on third parties, a lack of a proper mechanism for emergency escalation, a reticence to engage local stakeholders around systemic solutions and a lack of transparency.” Facebook responded to the criticism in a satement on Friday. “We are sorry that Mark did not make clearer that it was the civil society groups in Myanmar who first reported these messages,” it said. “We took their reports very seriously and immediately investigated ways to help prevent the spread of this content. We should have been faster, and are working hard to improve our technology and tools to detect and prevent abusive, hateful or false content.” Myanmar highlights existential questions about Facebook’s mission and responsibilities. The site has closely connected people in the country — in many cases, Facebook is the only online service they use. It has also become a major channel for the spread of hate speech and propaganda that has encouraged and obfuscated ethnic cleansing of the country’s Muslim Rohingya, according to human rights groups. Almost 700,000 Rohingya have fled to neighboring Bangladesh since last summer, when the military started a crackdown in the country’s western Rakhine State. Last month, United Nations investigators said Facebook played a role in spreading hate speech that incited violence against the Rohingya. For Mr. Zuckerberg, the timing of the letter is bad. Both he and his top deputy, Sheryl Sandberg, are making multiple media appearances this week to address questions about how the company handles users’ personal data. The company has faced harsh criticism for reports on how information about millions of users may have been improperly leaked to a political consulting firm connected to President Trump’s 2016 campaign. The criticism has sent the company’s stock tumbling. Next week, Mr. Zuckerberg is expected to appear at multiple congressional hearings. Among the half-dozen signatories of the letter posted on Thursday in Myanmar are Phandeeyar, a leading technology hub in the country that helped Facebook draft its Burmese-language community standards; Myanmar ICT for Development Organization, which monitors online hate speech; and the Center for Social Integrity. The letter lists what the groups say are several problems with Facebook. It says the company lacks adequate tools to report messages that might incite violence. It also says Facebook failed to provide channels for organizations to communicate with data and engineering employees who might have been able to devise solutions to the problems. “Presumably, your data team should be able to trace the original sources of flagged messages and posts and identify repeat offenders, using these insights to inform your moderation and sanctioning,” the letter says. Jes Petersen, chief executive of Phandeeyar, said problematic messages in Myanmar were not a one-time problem. “There’s multiple cases of similar things that have happened where we’ve done everything we can to bring it to Facebook’s attention but we don’t see much happening on their end,” he said. “That’s a big part of the problem.” Victoire Rio, a social media analyst in the country who previously worked at Phandeeyar, said another major issue was Facebook’s lack of Burmese speakers for local monitors to communicate directly with. “It’s evident to us that there are not enough resources and not enough human resources dedicated to Myanmar,” Ms. Rio said. She added that the company’s Burmese-speaking reviewers were based in Dublin, and from the company’s recruiting pages it seems it is struggling to find qualified candidates. The groups also faulted Facebook’s lack of transparency. They said that after they had reported the messages that Mr. Zuckerberg cited in his interview, they heard nothing from the company about what happened or how Facebook would better respond. “I was seriously concerned and looking for anyone I could,” Ms. Rio said. “I was surprised to hear that Mark had been contacted about this fairly quickly, the use of strong language was effective.”",The New York Times
2018,"Growing Crisis Threatens Scott Pruitt, E.P.A. Chief, as Top Aides Eye the Exits","WASHINGTON — A spreading crisis has threatened to engulf Scott Pruitt, the chief of the Environmental Protection Agency, who until recently ranked among the stars of the Trump administration. Now, he is mired in a series of ethical questions about his housing arrangements, staffing decisions and costly travel at taxpayer expense. Senior White House officials say that Mr. Pruitt’s fate has become uncertain. On Thursday, one of the central questions facing the E.P.A. chief — his decision in 2017 to rent a room in Washington from the wife of a top energy lobbyist — was exacerbated when an E.P.A. ethics official walked back his earlier assessment that Mr. Pruitt had done nothing wrong. In a new memo made public Thursday, the official said that he did not have all the facts when he made his initial finding. On Wednesday one of Mr. Pruitt’s top advisers, Samantha Dravis, resigned and Mr. Pruitt’s chief of staff, Ryan Jackson, has grown frustrated enough that he has also considered resigning, according to three people in whom Mr. Jackson has confided. Most ominously for Mr. Pruitt, however, senior White House officials signaled Thursday that the E.P.A. chief’s standing was shaky. “I can’t speak to the future of Scott Pruitt,” said Hogan Gidley, a White House spokesman, on Fox News on Thursday morning. It added up to a major crisis for a cabinet member who, despite months of criticism over costly first-class travel and other practices, had aggressively helped the otherwise tumultuous Trump administration achieve one of its central goals — the rapid rollback of regulations covering climate change, clean water and the use of chemical pesticides. In recent days, even as controversy swirled, Mr. Pruitt launched a rollback of the Obama administration’s stringent regulations on planet-warming vehicle tailpipe pollution. In a powerful signal of the depth of concern among conservatives that they may be losing one of their standard-bearers, allies of Mr. Pruitt including the Heritage Foundation, Tea Party Patriots, and Americans for Prosperity, the advocacy group funded by the billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch, launched a coordinated social media campaign to save his job. “As head of the @EPA, @EPAScottPruitt has been a leader in rolling back former President Obama’s job killing regulations,” the Tea Party Patriots wrote on Twitter, urging the group’s 190,000 followers to retweet the message “If you support Scott Pruitt’s conservative leadership at E.P.A.!” Ultimately, of course, Mr. Pruitt’s fate will rest in the hands of Mr. Trump. Asked on Thursday by reporters aboard Air Force One if he was bothered by the latest reports on Mr. Pruitt, Mr. Trump replied, “I have to look at them,” and added, “But he’s a good man, he’s done a terrific job.” Last week Senator Thomas Carper, a Democrat from Delaware, wrote a letter to the E.P.A. inspector general requesting an investigation into allegations that Ms. Dravis did not attend work or perform her duties for most of November, December and January while continuing to draw a salary. The March 28 letter, obtained by The New York Times, said the information “raises questions” about whether the agency is adhering to internal rules regarding employee time and attendance. A spokesman for the E.P.A. inspector general, Jeffrey Lagda, confirmed that his office has received the request and said he could not comment on whether the agency has taken up the investigation. Jahan Wilcox, a spokesman for the E.P.A., disputed the allegation. “It is completely baseless and absurd to assert that someone with her responsibilities and office would have been away from her duties and responsibilities for months at a time as alleged,” Mr. Wilcox said in a statement. Last week, when questions arose about Mr. Pruitt’s 2017 lease — in which he rented a room for $50 a night from the wife of J. Steven Hart, an energy industry lobbyist — the E.P.A. made public a finding by the agency’s ethics counsel stating that the price Mr. Pruitt paid for the use of the apartment was reasonable market value. However, in the follow-up memo, obtained Thursday by the Campaign Legal Center, a watchdog group, the same in-house lawyer said he did not have all the facts when making his initial assessment of the lease. In a second memo he also released a copy of the lease, which shows Mr. Hart’s name crossed out and the name of his wife, Vicki, inserted. Walter J. Shaub, a senior ethics official under President Barack Obama, said the original ethics opinion had been predicated on the understanding that Mr. Pruitt was leasing only one room in the apartment. But since then, there have been reports that Mr. Pruitt’s daughter stayed there while she was a White House intern. “If it turns out Pruitt’s daughter was allowed to stay in the other room, he had both rooms in the residence. There’s a big difference in what you’d pay to stay in a flop house with strangers and what you’d pay to have a place to yourself,” Mr. Shaub said. At the White House on Thursday, officials said they had deep concerns about Mr. Pruitt’s conduct and worried that more allegations of misconduct could surface, further angering Mr. Trump, who has been displeased with the torrent of negative headlines about this E.P.A. chief. The president was particularly put off by Mr. Pruitt’s performance in an interview on Fox News, aides said. Asked about it on Air Force One on Thursday, Mr. Trump would only say: “It’s an interesting interview.” But officials also noted that Mr. Pruitt was among the president’s favorites and a darling of his conservative base, making it possible for him to survive. In the interview Wednesday with Fox News, Mr. Pruitt pushed back on suggestions he had committed an ethical violation by renting the apartment. Asked if renting from the wife of a Washington lobbyist violated Mr. Trump’s mantra of “draining the swamp,” Mr. Pruitt responded, “I don’t think that’s even remotely fair to ask that question.” In the same interview, he also denied responsibility for giving generous pay raises to two of his staff members that have also come under fire. The two aides, Sarah Greenwalt and Millan Hupp, had both worked for Mr. Pruitt in Oklahoma, where he served as attorney general before coming to the E.P.A. Ms. Greenwalt’s salary was raised to $164,200 from $107,435, while Ms. Hupp’s was raised to $114,590 from $86,460. “My staff did and I found out about that yesterday, and I changed it,” Mr. Pruitt said. “The officials that were involved in that process should not have done what they did.” At the E.P.A. headquarters in the William Jefferson Clinton building a few blocks from the White House, several senior staffers separately used the word “toxic” to describe the atmosphere at the agency, with its political appointees adopting a bunker mentality amid the questions about Mr. Pruitt’s behavior. Some career civil servants at the agency, many of whom have worked there through several presidential administrations and are dismayed over Mr. Pruitt’s policies, appeared hopeful at the prospect of the administrator’s downfall. One longtime agency official said some employees are now openly taking bets on how long the administrator will hold on to his job. The allegations of ethical missteps by Mr. Pruitt are now causing dismay among some of the Republicans he brought into the agency as well. One of those is Mr. Jackson, Mr. Pruitt’s chief of staff, a seasoned Washington insider who previously worked for years for Senator James Inhofe of Oklahoma, who is known as Congress’ most vocal denier of the established science of human-caused climate change. Mr. Jackson’s frustration with his boss underscores how even the anti-regulation conservatives who once hailed the arrival of Mr. Pruitt have become disillusioned. Last year, Mr. Pruitt gained attention after requesting special privileges and protections including a full-time security detail and the installation of a $25,000 secure telephone booth in his office. At least five agency officials were demoted, reassigned or requested new assignments after raising objections to Mr. Pruitt’s spending and security decisions, The New York Times reported on Thursday. Mr. Pruitt’s friends say they believe the ethics questions are the result of a campaign by environmentalists. Robert E. Murray, the chief executive of Murray Energy and a major supporter of Mr. Pruitt’s, called him “the star” of the Trump administration. “Things are coming in such a wave, it’s obvious that it’s a coordinated campaign,” said David Rivkin, an attorney who represents industry opponents of E.P.A. rules and who has worked closely with Mr. Pruitt for years. Mr. Rivkin said that he expected Mr. Pruitt to survive the storm. “It’s happening because he’s the most effective cabinet member,” he said.

2018,Grumpy Investors Can’t Find Anything to Look Forward To,"The stock market is forward-looking. That’s a problem when there’s not much to look forward to. Stocks sank for the fourth-straight day on Tuesday, as investors looked past a series of outwardly positive earnings reports and fixated on threats to the nine-year-old bull market. Foremost among them is the Federal Reserve. Super-low interest rates from the central bank have fueled the rally, pushing up the prices of stocks and bonds since the Great Recession. But that was then. Now, the Fed is slowly withdrawing some of its support. It is shrinking its portfolio of government bonds and lifting interest rates. As a result, a yearslong tailwind for the stock market is disappearing. The new environment is evident in interest rates on government bonds, closely watched by many investors. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note touched 3 percent in trading early Tuesday. That benchmark interest rate — which influences the price of borrowing for both consumer loans and corporate bonds — has not been that high since early 2014. Other pressures rattled the markets, and worries began to set in after 3M and Caterpillar reported a gloomy outlook. The threat of a trade war, or even a real war, is unnerving investors. Oil prices have surged higher because of tensions in the Middle East, as well as President Trump’s public musings about withdrawing the United States from its nuclear deal with Iran. Those rising commodity prices represent something of a double worry for investors. For one, they feed into price inflation, making it even more likely that the Fed will continue to raise interest rates. (One of the Fed’s main objectives is keeping prices stable.) At the same time, higher commodity prices eat into profit margins for companies, which is bad for their stock prices. Last year, investors might have shrugged off those concerns, preferring to focus on the buoyant global economy and the prospect of a major reduction in American corporate tax rates. That tax cut came to fruition in December, and it supercharged corporate profits, but that was a one-time event. Investors were heartened by the tax cuts, said Evan Brown, director of asset allocation at UBS Asset Management. But their focus has shifted since then. “The market’s attention is rotating to other things, and one of those things is rising inflation and rising yields,” Mr. Brown said. “One of those things is the potential for increasing trade tensions.” Other events are looming, and investors see little to be excited about. With congressional elections later this year, the prospects of pro-business legislation — or any legislation, for that matter — are dim. The biggest economic action out of Washington might be the Fed raising interest rates — a clear negative for investors. In short, it’s up to companies themselves to give investors reasons to believe their shares can keep climbing. Recent earnings reports suggest that is becoming harder to do. Shares of Alphabet, the parent of Google, dropped sharply Tuesday despite the company reporting Monday that quarterly profits rose 73 percent to $9.4 billion. Investors appeared concerned with a surge of spending at the company that hurt its profit margins. Earnings reports also provoked a sell-off in the industrial firms 3M and Caterpillar. Investors were rattled by lower sales and profit forecasts and by sluggish demand for the products that 3M sells to auto body shops. Its shares sank 6.8 percent. And investors, after initially applauding Caterpillar’s first-quarter results, were unnerved when a Caterpillar executive told analysts that the first quarter might be a “high-water mark” for the year. The shares fell 6.2 percent. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index sank 1.3 percent, and the Dow Jones industrial average finished with a loss of 1.7 percent. The Nasdaq composite dropped 1.7 percent. The decline in the S.&P. on Tuesday left the benchmark index down 1.5 percent for the year.",The New York Times
2018,Guards Waited Hours to Stop a Prison Riot That Left 7 Inmates Dead,"A bloody melee in a maximum-security prison in South Carolina raged for more than four hours Sunday night before guards moved in to stop it, state officials said Monday. The riot, sparked by gangs within the prison who were warring over territory, money and contraband, left seven inmates dead and 17 injured, many of them stabbed or slashed by improvised blades. Law enforcement personnel waited to enter three troubled housing units at the Lee Correctional Institution, a maximum-security prison in Bishopville, S.C., about 40 miles east of Columbia, until they could assemble enough officers to deal with the problem safely, the head of the state prison system said on Monday. In the end, no prison guards were injured. But one inmate who witnessed the riot told The Associated Press that felled prisoners’ bodies began stacking up while the guard stayed outside for hours. Bryan P. Stirling, director of the South Carolina Department of Corrections, defended the response in a news conference Monday. He said that when the first of a series of “inmate-on-inmate altercations” broke out at 7:15 p.m. Sunday, the handful of guards on the scene, knowing they were outnumbered, backed out and called for support. The first large response team did not enter the site of the first fight until 11:30 p.m., he said. “We are not going to just send one or two officers in there,” Mr. Stirling said. “We’re going to gather a force that is safe for all our officers, and we’re going to go in and we’re going to take that dorm back with force. And if there’s any resistance, we’ll be able to put that resistance down immediately.” When the trouble started, Mr. Stirling said later in a telephone interview, there were only two guards on duty in each of the three housing units, and they were armed only with pepper spray. Each housing unit holds about 250 inmates. Assembling an armed SWAT team in a rural area on a Sunday night takes time, he said. By the time the authorities had regained control, the disturbance at the prison was one of the worst of the last quarter-century. And it was an embarrassment for South Carolina, where officials have been trying to address prison problems with new sentencing policies to reduce the inmate population and higher pay for guards to reduce turnover. Gov. Henry McMaster, a Republican, said on Monday that the riot was “unfortunate” but that flare-ups among criminals were inevitable. “We know that prisons are places where people who have misbehaved on the outside go for rehabilitation, and also to take them from the general population,” he said. “It’s not a surprise when we have violent events take place inside prison.” Mark Keel, chief of the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division, said that the exact cause of the riot, and the details of the individual killings, were being investigated. Larry Logan, the coroner for Lee County, S.C., where the prison is located, said that autopsies had not yet been completed, but that it appeared that all of the dead suffered stabs and slashes from improvised weapons. Lee Correctional Institution, which opened in 1993, houses about 1,500 male inmates, and has a reputation for trouble. In 2013, Michael McCall, then the warden at Lee, said it was the most dangerous prison in South Carolina. The state uses both publicly and privately run prisons; Lee Correctional is public. Two officers were stabbed there in a 2015 fight. An inmate was killed during a fight in July 2017, another was stabbed to death in November, and a third was killed in February. Prison managers have also struggled to keep contraband out. In 2014, officials discovered a crashed drone in the bushes near the prison, and said they believed that drones had been used to smuggle drugs and forbidden cellphones into the grounds. Phones continue to be a problem at Lee, Mr. Stirling said on Monday, because they allow criminals “to continue their criminal ways from behind bars, which is not only dangerous within our institutions, but it’s also dangerous outside our institutions.” Mr. Stirling said he has been trying to persuade the Federal Communications Commission to block cellphone signals at the prison. Federal officials have resisted such requests, fearing that blocking the signals would make it impossible for those in need of help to call 911 in an emergency. At the time of the riot, Mr. Stirling said, there were 44 prison staff members at the facility. Until recently, the figure would have been fewer than 20, he said, but the prison recently began having night shift workers start work earlier and the day shift stay later, so they would both be on hand while prisoners are counted and locked up for the night. Mr. Stirling, who served as chief of staff for Nikki Haley when she was governor, said his department is short-staffed, with 500 fewer front-line officers than it needs. But he said that recent budget increases for the department, supported by Ms. Haley and others, have allowed him to increase guards’ pay and begin closing the gap. New sentencing and corrections policies enacted in 2010 have been easing some of the strain on the state prison system. The Pew Charitable Trusts found that the state’s prison population declined by 14 percent from 2009 to 2016, saving the state $491 million. State Representative J. Todd Rutherford, a Democrat, said on Monday that the riot showed that more remained to be done. He and other lawmakers have sponsored a bill that would reduce mandatory minimum sentences on drug crimes, and would apply retroactively. Mr. Rutherford said he did not support blocking cellphone signals at the prison, preferring a “managed” system that would allow corrections officials to track inmates’ phone use. And he said the length of time it took to assemble enough guards to quell the riot was understandable, given how far out of the way the place was. “I’m a lawyer, and I go to Lee Correctional a lot,” he said. “It’s in the middle of Bishopville, and there’s simply nothing there.” The corrections department released the names of the seven dead inmates, all of whom were serving time for violent crimes. Damonte Marquez Rivera had the longest sentence, life plus 90 years, for murder; Eddie Casey Jay Gaskins had the shortest, 10 years, for first-degree domestic violence.",The New York Times
2018,Gun Culture Is My Culture. And I Fear for What It Has Become.,"Feature In the wake of mass shootings, a lifetime of gun ownership leads to unsettling questions. CreditCreditIllustration by Melinda Josie Two weeks before Christmas, I had a 9-millimeter pistol concealed in my waistband and a rifle with two 30-round magazines in the passenger seat beside me. I was driving down from the mountains to meet a fellow I didn’t know at a Cracker Barrel off I-40 in the North Carolina foothills. He was looking to buy a Kel-Tec Sub-2000, and I had one for sale. Other than that, I didn’t know him from Adam except for a few messages back and forth on Facebook. We were both members of a Facebook group where people post pictures of firearms and buyers private-message to ask questions and make offers — sometimes cash, sometimes trade. I needed money to pay a buddy for an old ’70s model Lark teardrop trailer, and that rifle wasn’t doing anything but taking up space in the safe. What I was doing was perfectly legal. In North Carolina, long-gun transfers by private sellers require no background checks. Likewise, it’s perfectly legal to sell a handgun privately so long as the buyer has a purchase permit or a concealed-carry license. But as I headed up the exit to the restaurant where we agreed to meet, I felt uneasy. I was within the law, but it didn’t feel as if I should have been. He was backed into a space parallel to the dumpster, a black Ford F-250 with a covered bed, just as he described on Facebook Messenger. As I pulled in, he stepped out. He smiled, and I nodded. “You can just leave it in the seat so we don’t make anybody nervous,” he said as I rolled down my window. There were families in rocking chairs in front of the restaurant. Customers were walking to their cars to get back on the road. I climbed out of my truck so he could look the rifle over while I counted the money he’d left on his seat. He was about my age, somewhere in his early to mid-30s, white guy with a thick beard. He spoke with a heavy Southern accent not much different from my own. Said he built houses for a living, and that was about all the small talk between us. He liked the rifle. I needed the cash. We shook hands, and off we went. There is rarely a moment when I’m not within reach of a firearm. When I lie down at night, there is an old single-shot New England Firearms Pardner leaned against the headboard, a loaded Smith & Wesson M&P Shield pistol on the nightstand. When I sit on the couch to work on an essay or a novel, there is a CZ 75 pistol on the coffee table. When I go to town for groceries, one of those two pistols is concealed inside my waistband. Where I live in the mountains of North Carolina, I am not alone. With fewer than a dozen guns in the safe, I wouldn’t even be considered a gun nut. Most of my friends have concealed-carry licenses and pistols on their person. If there are 10 of us in a room, there are most likely 10 loaded firearms, probably more, with a few of us keeping backups in ankle holsters. Rarely do we mention what we carry. We don’t touch the guns or draw them from their holsters. They are unseen and unspoken of, but always there. I can’t remember a time in my life when I wasn’t around guns. When I was a kid, there was a gun rack hanging on the wall in the living room. My father kept a single-shot .410 and an old bolt action .22, small-game guns, though he didn’t hunt anymore. I can remember watching older boys shoot skeet at a junkyard in the woods behind my house, my fingers plugged in my ears while orange clays turned to smoke against a backdrop of post oak and poplar. I can remember the first time my father taught me to shoot a rifle, how he had me sit on the concrete driveway and use my knee for a rest, aiming for a cardboard target in a honeysuckle thicket across the road. I think I was 8 or 9. I pulled the stock in too high on my shoulder, and craned my neck awkwardly to line up the iron sights. I didn’t know what I was doing, but I knew the rules: Always assume a firearm is loaded. Always keep the gun pointed in a safe direction. Know your target and what’s beyond it. I come from a country people whose culture was destroyed by bulldozers and buildings. My father’s family settled in and around Charlotte in the late 1700s. As a child, I would ride around with my grandmother in her light blue Oldsmobile. Where Winn-Dixies and Food Lions stood, she remembered fields where she worked tobacco and picked cotton. I grew up in a tiny holdout spot of country where I ran through a pasture of chest-high field grass to fish a farm pond most evenings, where just a mile down the road my uncle still kept a kennel of hounds to run rabbit each fall. Guns were often a bridge between father and son. But my dad didn’t keep a .38 Special on the bedside nightstand like my best friend’s father down the street. I never walked into the house and found him cleaning and oiling a dozen pistols at the kitchen table the way I did with my next-door neighbor’s dad. For my family, guns had always been a means of putting food on the table. My father never owned a handgun. He kept nothing for home defense. I was in eighth grade the first time I had a gun put to my head. It was December 1997, a year and four months before Columbine, at my middle school in Charlotte. A teacher named Mr. Madison sent me and three other boys outside to look for stuff to put under a microscope — rocks, tree bark, empty snail shells, anything we could find. The school was located in a neighborhood three miles from downtown. A sewer line ran parallel and cut a wide trail through the woods between two residential streets. We were at the edge of the clearing. I saw someone walking up with a hood over his head. When he got close, he pulled the gun and jammed it into my temple. I can remember that it was a little snub-nosed revolver, a brushed-steel frame. I can remember what it felt like pressed into the side of my head, how my heart raced when I went for my wallet, how I couldn’t breathe. I had $50 my grandmother sent me for my birthday. My mom was going to take me to a skateboard shop after school to buy a new deck. There have been times I wondered what might’ve happened if it’d been like every other day, if I hadn’t had a dollar to my name. If my wallet had been empty, would he have just walked away or become so frustrated that he pulled the trigger? Luckily, I had the money, and he took the $50 and ran. When he was gone, the four of us rushed for the classroom and tried to tell Mr. Madison what happened, our words broken by shattered breath, him screaming: “Slow down! Slow down!” The rest of the day we recounted our story over and over to the principal. In the end, what happened was swept under the rug. My parents said the school was probably trying to keep the story off the news. When I was 14, I couldn’t imagine the impact that robbery would have on the rest of my life. I couldn’t foresee a grown man feeling uncomfortable when he was corralled by passers-by on the street, an unnerving anxiety turning him to stone when he was surrounded by strangers. I remember an afternoon in my early 30s at a therapist’s office describing the years that followed that incident, and she speculated that I surrounded myself with the people I did as a form of protection. There’s a part of me that thinks that’s too easy an answer, that it’s passing the buck instead of taking responsibility. But for those next few years, I ran around wild. I sat in the back of a police cruiser praying the officers wouldn’t pop the trunk on the car parked in front of my truck, knowing my friend had a shotgun and a quarter pound of weed sitting on the spare. I rode in the passenger seat while a buddy rolled down the window and fired a pistol into the night, blowing off steam after a breakup, empty casings spitting against the windshield. I dropped to the ground as gunfire rang from a car at a bonfire party. I pushed friends behind the brick foundation of a house as a shootout erupted over pills. There were times when someone could have easily been shot and killed. The second and last time I had a gun put to my head it was by the police. After a drunken fight, I left a friend’s apartment to walk five miles and sleep on the porch of a buddy’s house across the river. I was walking down the side of Wilkinson Boulevard in Belmont. I was carrying a shoe box. I saw a police cruiser pass me and make a U-turn at a stoplight up ahead. When the Crown Vic came back, the driver jumped the median and next thing I knew there were multiple cars, lights flashing, officers ordering me to the ground. They had their guns drawn. There was a K-9 unit, and the German shepherd wouldn’t quit barking. I was lying flat on my stomach, and one officer came forward and put his knee in my back, his service weapon pushed into the base of my skull. They let the dog close enough that I could feel him barking against my ear. They said I matched the description of someone who’d burglarized some houses nearby. They asked what was in the shoe box, and I stuttered, “Papers.” They asked if they opened the box if there was anything inside that would hurt them. With my face in the grass and the officer’s weight making it hard to breathe, I was so terrified that I couldn’t mutter a single word. I just shook my head, and they opened that box to find nothing but a stack of notebook papers, a pile of half-assed stories I’d written. They told me I could get up, and I stood there trembling while they apologized. They gave me a ride across the river and dropped me off at the Mecklenburg County line, told me they were sorry but they couldn’t take me any farther. I moved to the mountains not long after that. As soon as I arrived in Jackson County, I knew I’d never leave. A hundred and fifty miles west of where I grew up, I found a community that reminded me of my grandmother, where folks still kept big gardens and canned the vegetables they grew. They still filled the freezer with meat taken by rod and rifle — trout and turkey, dove and rabbit, deer, bear, anything in season. I keep a close-knit group of friends here, most of whom are at least 20 years my senior. Our generational difference is erased by a shared passion for wilderness and time spent in the field with gun in hand. This past Christmas, one of the men I hunt with, a man we call Son in Law, handed down a Model 94 Winchester to his grandson. The grandson would be the fourth generation to hunt with that rifle. A few weeks later, the boy took that .30-30 lever action into the field and killed his first deer with it — the same as his uncle, his grandfather and great-grandfather. Those types of things are rare now, even in places like Appalachia. I’m the youngest member of my hunting camp — me 34, everyone else in their mid-to-late 60s, a few on up past 70. Among these men, there are centuries of experience gathered around the campfire each night. After more than 40 seasons wandering the same woods, they’ve come to know the land intimately. They toss around names — the Owl Boxes, the U.F.O. Hole, the Refrigerator Stand — places they’ve killed deer for decades. They tell stories about men who have died, hunters like Goat Man, who carried an onion in his pocket and plowed down trees in his beat-up Bronco; or Hawkeye, who ran moonshine and damn near drank a boy to death after the kid slapped a sack of weed on the poker table and declared, “Boys, that’s the shit that killed Elvis.” The old men talk, and I listen. I killed my biggest deer to date on the 2nd of November from a tree one of those men sent me to. Fifteen feet up a hickory, I watched a tree line at the edge of a clear cut. I heard heavy footsteps and eased around the right side of the tree for a look, and there he stood. The buck walked to my left, and I slipped behind the trunk, shouldered the rifle and balanced the fore end on a tree step I’d augured into the opposite side for a rest. He was broadside when I slid the cross hairs onto his shoulder. The clear cut, strewn with downed timber and studded with sawed stubs, was too rough to track and drag, so I didn’t want to risk a shot for heart and lungs and have the deer run a hundred yards. I wanted to drop him where he stood. Pin his shoulders together and buckle him. Just before the deer strolled behind a cedar sapling, I touched the trigger, and the .308 blew apart the morning. A hundred and fifty grains of copper-jacketed lead hit just behind the shoulder and blood-shot the backside to pudding. The buck stooped forward and sprinted, back legs driving him over tangled ground. He made it 40 yards before he crashed. From my stand, I could just make out the white of his stomach through the brush. I watched his ribs rise with each breath, that breathing slowing, slowing, then gone. There is a sadness that only hunters know, a moment when lament overshadows any desire for celebration. Life is sustained by death, and though going to the field is an act of taking responsibility for that fact, the killing is not easy, nor should it be. I climbed down a half-hour later but didn’t walk straight to the deer. Instead I went to the place where I shot him, a yard shy of that cedar sapling, and followed the blood trail to where he lay. He was a big-bodied eight-point that would feed me for a year. I knelt there and ran my hands across his coat. It took nearly an hour to drag him back to the trail, another half-mile from there to the truck. A few days later, I was driving back home from hunting camp in McCormick, S.C., with the head of that eight-point in a cooler in the truck bed, the rest of the deer hanging to age at the processor. On a long straightaway, I passed a state trooper driving in the opposite direction. In the rearview, I saw him slam on the brakes and make a U-turn in the middle of the road, blue lights flashing. I was running just under 60 in a 55 and didn’t think there was any way he was pulling me over. The 9-millimeter I always carry was loaded and concealed on my side. Until that moment I’d never been pulled over while carrying a concealed weapon. I knew the protocol. I knew what I was legally obligated to say. But I was nervous as hell as the trooper stepped out of his cruiser, situated his campaign hat and approached the side of my truck. He was a young black man with braces on his teeth. He looked to be in his early 20s, had kind eyes and was built like a linebacker. He asked for my license and registration, and I told him I needed to inform him that I had a concealed-carry license and that there was a weapon on my person. He asked where the gun was located, and I told him roughly 4 o’clock. He asked if I could get to my wallet, and I told him the pistol was pretty close to my back pocket. There was a moment of hesitation when he considered what to do next. Then he told me to move slowly as I took my wallet from my pocket. When the trooper had my license and registration, he went to his cruiser. In a few minutes, he came back to the window and issued me a warning for speeding. I asked if there was anything I could’ve done differently to make him more comfortable when he first approached the truck. The trooper told me what I’d said was fine. He said that some officers might have been uncomfortable with where the pistol was located, being holstered near my wallet, but that he felt we had a good rapport. Depending on the officer, some might have asked me to step out of the truck so they could remove the weapon. He smiled and told me: “But this is South Carolina. Most every car I pull over has a gun.” As I headed toward the mountains, all I could think about was Philando Castile, the young African-American man who had a permit to carry and was shot to death in his car in front of his girlfriend and her young daughter by a Minnesota policeman after notifying the officer that he had a weapon. All I could think about was how things might have been different if the situation was reversed and that young black state trooper with braces had been behind the wheel, a white trooper cautiously approaching the car. It was impossible not to think that if I were black, I’d be too scared to carry a gun. It was impossible not to recognize how gun culture reeks of privilege. Last summer I drove back to Charlotte to visit my father for his birthday. While I was there, I went into a Cabela’s store in Fort Mill, S.C., to buy him a new depth finder for his fishing boat. After I found what I was looking for, I headed across the store to see if there were any good deals on ammo. There were floor displays of AR-15s, and probably a hundred or more other rifles and shotguns for anyone to walk up and hold. I watched a kid about 8 or 9 pick up one of those ARs and shoulder it to the center of his chest. He held the gun awkwardly, cocked his head hard to the side, squeezed one eye closed to aim and dry-fired the weapon. I watched two men, presumably his father and grandfather, smile and laugh, then break out their cellphones to snap a few pictures. I remembered how when I was his age, I used to love going to the sporting-goods section of Walmart to look at fishing lures and camouflage clothes. I’d walk over near the register and push the manual turntable on the curio display to look at all the rifles and shotguns. There were usually a few big game guns — a gray stock Remington 783 in .30-06, maybe a Marlin 336 lever action — a couple of pump shotguns, a single shot .410 or 20-gauge. There were always Ruger 10/22s and Marlin Model 60s, the .22LRs kids unwrapped when their grandfathers gave them their first rifles for a birthday or Christmas. There were always guns, but nothing like the assault weapons that line the shelves today. Maybe it’s how I was raised and the types of firearms my family kept, but the idea of owning a rifle designed for engaging human targets out to 600 meters just never interested me. I keep a Savage 10 in .308 to hunt whitetail and hogs. I have a CZ 920 that’s absolute hell on a dove field. I have a handful of .22 rifles that I use for plinking at the range and hunting squirrels and rabbits each winter. Then there are the weapons I keep for defense — the shotgun by the bed, the pistols — firearms whose sole purpose would be to take human life if I were left with no other choice. I’ve witnessed how quickly a moment can turn to a matter of life and death. I live in a region where 911 calls might not bring blue lights for an hour. Whether it’s preparation or paranoia, I plan for worst-case scenarios and trust no one but myself for my survival. My friends see no difference between the guns I own and their ARs. One or two of them rationalize assault weapons the same way I justify what sits by my bed. When I ask if those rifles are really the best option for home defense, they joke about the minute hand of the doomsday clock inching closer to midnight. They post Instagram photos of Sig Sauer MCXs and tac vests loaded with extra magazines, their bug-out bags by the door as they wait for the end of the world. But a majority defend their ARs the same way I defend the guns I use for plinking and hunting. They say they own them because they’re fun at the range and affordable to shoot. They use the rifles for punching paper, a few for shooting coyotes. Every weekend they fire hundreds of rounds from custom rifles they’ve spent thousands of dollars building. They add bump stocks and Echo Triggers to increase rates of fire and step as close to Title II of the federal Gun Control Act as legally possible without the red tape and paperwork. They fire bullets into Tannerite targets that blow pumpkins into the sky. None of them see a connection between the weapons they own and the shootings at Sandy Hook, San Bernardino, Aurora, Orlando, Las Vegas, Parkland. They see mug shots of James Holmes, Omar Mateen, Stephen Paddock, Nikolas Cruz — “crazier than a shithouse rat,” they say. “If it hadn’t been that rifle, he’d have done it with something else.” They fear that what starts as an assault-weapons ban will snowball into an attack on everything in the safe. I don’t believe that politicians are going to ban ordinary guns or overturn the Second Amendment, but I understand their reasoning because I understand what’s at stake. I think about that boy picking up that AR in Cabela’s, and I’m torn between the culture I grew up with and how that culture has devolved. There are changes I know must come, changes to what types of firearms line the shelves and to the background checks and ownership requirements needed to carry one out the door. And there is an unrelenting fear of what could be lost — a subsistence culture already threatened by the loss of public land, rising costs and a widening rural-urban divide; the right of individuals to protect their own lives and the lives of their families. A few days after the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., in February, I sat down with a buddy over coffee at the firehouse where he works. The news was on in the background. I told him I’d be fine with an assault-weapons ban. He cut a look in my direction as if I’d absolutely lost my mind. I asked him why anyone needs to own an AR, an AK, an SKS. He said that the question is irrelevant, that the reason doesn’t supersede the right. I could feel my blood pressure rising and my face getting warm. I could see in his eyes that he was equally agitated. Despite everything we have in common, despite the fact that he’s my best friend and we were going squirrel hunting in a few days, the two of us fundamentally disagree. Someone came into the room and changed the subject, and I could sense that he was as thankful as I was. As sad as it is to say, the silence is easier. While the two of us sat there sipping coffee, there were kids on the television in the background, high school survivors who were willing to say what we are not, and I was ashamed. One recent afternoon I rode with my girlfriend, Ashley, an hour east to Asheville. It was the first week of March, but a warm spell had the willows green along the creek in the pasture at our house. It was one of those pretty, late-winter days with bluebird skies when the trees are still naked on the mountains and you can see every shadow and contour of the landscape. Knowing how I hate going to the city, she bribed me with a trip to the Field & Stream sporting-goods store if I would ride along. As we pulled into the parking lot, I thought about the last time we were there, back before Christmas. Ashley didn’t grow up with guns as I did. She’d never owned one before I gave her a shotgun to keep by the bed when I’m away from home. For a year or so, she’d been considering a pistol. She’d held dozens of models but still hadn’t decided on anything. We were at the back of the store looking in the glass case at 1911s. All of a sudden, her eyes got big and she raised her hands then ducked behind me and grabbed onto my arm. I turned and stared down the aisle where a kid who looked about 18 was aiming an AR-15 the salesman had handed him. The muzzle was pointed in our direction. Ashley was terrified. I’ve been at the counter enough to know the predicament — wanting to shoulder a rifle to test the feel but having nowhere sensible to aim. The kid lowered the rifle and went back to talking to the salesman, neither seeming to notice us standing there, Ashley frozen behind me. On the way out, she just kept saying: “He was a kid. He looked like he should’ve been in high school. What does a kid need a rifle like that for? What does anybody need a rifle like that for?” And the truth was, I didn’t have an answer. The truth is, there are guns I feel justified in owning and guns I feel belong on battlefields. I know the reasons my friends give for owning these weapons, and I know that their answers feel inadequate to me. I know that part of what they’re missing or refusing to acknowledge is how fear ushered in this shift in gun culture over the past two decades. Fear is the factor no one wants to address — fear of criminals, fear of terrorists, fear of the government’s turning tyrannical and, perhaps more than anything else, fear of one another. There’s no simple solution like pulling fear off the shelf. It’s an intangible thing. I recognize this, because I recognize my own and I recognize that despite all I know and believe I can’t seem to overcome it. I’m sure that part of why I carry is having a pistol put to my head when I was 14. I’m sure that part of it is having hidden behind walls while shots were fired. Maybe it’s a combination of those two things coupled with headlines and hysteria, the growing presence of mass shootings in American culture. I don’t like being in places where I can’t find the exits. I don’t like crowds and being surrounded by more people than I can keep my eyes on. For the most part nowadays, I stay at the house. When I have to leave, I slide my holster into my waistband before I put on my boots. When a book tour sends me out of North Carolina, 36 states honor the concealed-carry license in my wallet. Unlike a lot of those who carry, I don’t buy into that only-way-to-stop-a-bad-guy-with-a-gun-is-a-good-guy-with-a-gun bravado. I have no visions of being a hero. Instead, I find myself looking for where I’d run, asking myself what I would get behind. The gun is the last resort. It’s the final option when all else is exhausted. When Ashley and I left the store, we headed toward the Levi’s outlet, where she planned to buy a new pair of jeans. The walkway narrowed, and the sidewalks were filled with people and noise. Even though I knew the risk was remote, my mind raced with all those questions of what I’d do if someone suddenly opened fire. As we walked, I could feel the pistol holstered on my side, the weight of my gun tugging at my belt. The fear was lessened by knowing that there was a round chambered, that all it would take is the downward push of a safety and the short pull of a trigger for that bullet to breathe. I felt safer knowing that gun was there.",The New York Times
2018,"Gunmen Shot at U.N. Team Near Site of Reported Chemical Attack, Official Says","BEIRUT, Lebanon — A United Nations security team was fired on in the Syrian town of Douma, raising doubts on Wednesday about when international investigators would be able to visit the site of what was suspected to have been a chemical attack. Eleven days have passed since rescue and medical workers in Douma reported an attack that left victims choking and foaming at the mouth, killing at least 43 people. Blaming the government of President Bashar al-Assad for the attack, the United States, Britain and France launched coordinated strikes on Syrian military facilities on Saturday, describing them as punishment for what they called Mr. Assad’s use of chemical weapons. The Syrian government and its Russian and Iranian allies have denied that any chemical weapons were used and blamed rescue workers and rebels for what they called concocted videos said to show the suffering of victims as a way of demonizing the Syrian government. But the lack of access to the site has left lingering questions about whether chemical weapons were used and if so, what type or types. A team from the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons arrived in the Syrian capital, Damascus, on Saturday, with a mandate to investigate the attack. But the team has not yet been able to reach the site. This has led to accusations by the United States that the Syrian government and Russia are trying to cover up any evidence of chemical weapon use — a charge they deny. The investigators were originally scheduled to visit the site on Monday but did not. On Tuesday, the Syrian government said the team had not been able to go for security reasons, although it had allowed a number of journalists to visit Douma. Some of those journalists visited the site of the attack and interviewed residents who lost members of their families. The residents differed on who was responsible for the attack, with some accusing the government and others accusing the rebel group that had been in control of Douma at the time, the Army of Islam. But the fact that journalists had been able to wander around Douma unmolested raised questions about why it was not deemed safe enough for the investigators to visit. On Wednesday, Ahmed Uzumcu, the director general of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, told a meeting of the group’s executive council that a security team from the United Nations had gone to do reconnaissance in Douma on Tuesday. During a visit to one site, a large crowd gathered and the security team left, Mr. Uzumcu said. At another, the team “came under small-arms fire and an explosive was detonated,” he said. The team left and returned to Damascus unharmed, but it was not clear when the investigators would be able to visit Douma, Mr. Uzumcu said. The longer the investigators must wait to take samples in Douma, the lower the likelihood of obtaining evidence of chemical weapons use, because the toxins in the weapons degrade over time. Determining whether such weapons were used in Douma could help resolve a standoff between the United States and its allies on one side and the Syrian government and its allies on the other. But under its mandate, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons is only responsible for determining whether chemical weapons were used and what kind, not who used them. A review by The New York Times of videos of the aftermath and interviews with residents of Douma, medics and rescue workers suggested that metal canisters containing a chemical were dropped from Syrian government helicopters during a wider offensive to rout the rebels. One of the canisters landed on the upper floor of an apartment building packed with people, many of whom suffocated as the canister’s contents dispersed.",The New York Times

Nassar. “To this day, I still don’t know how he could have been allowed to do this for so long,” Ms. Wieber said. “If these institutions had done their job, neither of us would be sitting here today.” Ms. Wieber and Jamie Dantzscher, a fellow Olympic gymnast, testified in front of a subcommittee tasked with investigating the handling of sexual abuse allegations made by dozens of young female athletes against Dr. Nassar, a former team doctor for U.S.A. Gymnastics and a former member of the M.S.U. faculty. The hearing, held by the subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, Insurance, and Data Security, which holds jurisdiction over the U.S. Olympic Committee and amateur sports, was the next step in the bipartisan inquiry into the systemic problems of abuse in the American gymnastics program. At least 265 women came forward to testify against Dr. Nassar in sentencing hearings this winter after he pleaded guilty to multiple counts of sexual assault and child pornography charges. He is serving the first of what amounts to multiple life sentences in federal prison in Arizona. Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut and the subcommitee’s ranking member, said Wednesday’s hearing was “a critical step forward.” “Across Olympic sports, there are stories of young athletes who have been victimized and have survived physical, emotional and sexual abuse,” Senator Blumenthal said. “We want to fight it, and correct it, and prevent it from happening again.” Ms. Dantzscher, who won a bronze medal at the 2000 Olympic Games, said she had spoken out about Dr. Nassar’s abuse beginning that year and received criticism from members of the U.S.A. Gymnastics staff. She urged the committee to question the organization’s former chairman, Paul Parilla, and its former president, Steve Penny, and to hold U.S.A. Gymnastics accountable. “This is a case of powerful people protecting other powerful people,” Ms. Dantzscher said. “It is up to you, as powerful members of the United States Senate, to hold them accountable, and I believe you will.” In addition to the gymnasts, a retired former speedskater, Bridie Farrell, and a U.S. figure skater and coach, Craig Maurizi, also testified about having experienced trauma dating to as far as 40 years ago. Mr. Maurizi said he informed the U.S. Figure Skating Association about the sexual abuse he suffered at the hands of a coach, Richard Callaghan, more than a decade ago. McKayla Maroney, one of Ms. Wieber’s teammates on the 2012 U.S. gymnastics team, submitted written testimony to the committee and said her abuse from Dr. Nassar started when she was 13. On Tuesday, Ms. Wieber filed a lawsuit against U.S.A. Gymnastics, the U.S. Olympic Committee, and Michigan State, alleging that the organizations could have done more to prevent Dr. Nassar from abusing athletes. Nearly 300 similar lawsuits have already been filed against Michigan State and U.S.A. Gymnastics. “We appreciate the willingness of these athletes — who share in our determination to root out abuse in youth sport governing bodies — to share their stories,” Senator Jerry Moran, Republican of Kansas and the chairman of the subcommittee, said, “and aid in our investigation to protect all U.S.O.C. athletes, at all levels, in all sports.”",The New York Times
2018,HUD Floats a Plan Intended to Reduce Reliance on Housing Assistance,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration has proposed legislation that could triple rents on the poorest tenants in federally subsidized housing as part of a push to redefine housing assistance as a temporary benefit instead of the permanent source of shelter it has become for millions of poor people. The legislation, spurred by Mr. Trump’s conservative budget director, Mick Mulvaney, and drafted by aides to Ben Carson, the secretary of housing and urban development, would also allow local governments to impose work requirements on tenants in public housing deemed fit for work. The plan would also increase rents for elderly and disabled people after six years, agency officials said. But the new rules would hit the poorest residents hardest, with minimum monthly rents in public housing developments and for recipients of Section 8 vouchers rising to $150 a month from $50. The increases would affect about 712,000 families over the next several years, HUD officials said. Rent hikes would gradually be phased in for tenants based on their income and other provisions that could effectively limit the amount of time some tenants would be allowed to remain in government-funded housing. “Every year, it takes more money, millions of dollars more, to serve the same number of households,” Mr. Carson told reporters Wednesday in a conference call. “It’s clear from a budget perspective and a human point of view that the current system is unsustainable.” The proposal, geared at streamlining the agency and cutting the deficit, was intended to start the conversation and should not be regarded as final, Mr. Carson said. Housing advocates and congressional Democrats immediately condemned it. “What pretends to be a hand up is really a foot in the back,” said Shamus Roller, the executive director of the National Housing Law Project. On Wednesday, even as Mr. Carson was promoting the plan, department officials acknowledged that it would probably be superseded by a somewhat scaled-back set of rent increases and work requirement proposals House Republicans plan to unveil next month. And the new plan stands little chance of being passed in the Senate, where moderate Republicans like Senator Susan Collins of Maine are likely to reject it. The proposed cuts would also appear to run counter to Mr. Carson’s behind-the-scenes efforts to prevent the sweeping reductions proposed in Mr. Trump’s first budget. Mr. Carson told friends this year that he would quit if the president did not restore proposed cuts to programs aiding the disabled and the elderly proposed by Mr. Mulvaney, director of the Office of Management and Budget and the most powerful advocate for small government inside Mr. Trump’s governing circle. Mr. Mulvaney has encouraged the new HUD rules as well as similar work rules being enforced in Medicaid and food assistance programs. They are intended to shift the debate over safety net programs sharply to the right by redefining “welfare” to encompass programs beyond direct cash assistance, like housing subsidies, that have long been regarded as quasi-entitlements, several administration officials said. Mr. Trump, aides said, refers to nearly every program that provides benefits to poor people as welfare, a term he regards as derogatory. Historically, welfare has been defined as direct cash assistance to the poor, programs that have been consistently shrinking since bipartisan welfare overhaul in the 1990s. Advocates for poor people say that the rent increases, which seem small to those living above the poverty line, will create great hardships for families struggling to get by in areas where jobs are scarce and barriers to higher income are steep. “It is part of a larger assault on the entire social safety net — proposing to take away limited benefits for health care, food and housing from struggling families just months after giving massive tax cuts to millionaires and billionaires is the height of cruel hypocrisy,” said Diane Yentel, the president and chief executive of the National Low Income Housing Coalition, a Washington-based advocacy group. “This proposal would inflict unimaginable hardships on Americans living life on the brink of financial instability and significantly increase the risk of homelessness and hunger among children and at-risk populations,” said Representative Joseph Crowley, a Democrat of New York who serves as chairman of the House Democratic caucus.",The New York Times
2018,"Hal Greer, Hall of Fame Jump Shooter for 76ers, Is Dead at 81","Hal Greer, the Hall of Fame guard with the dazzling jump shot who helped take the Philadelphia 76ers to the 1967 N.B.A. championship, died on Saturday night in Arizona. He was 81. The 76ers announced his death on the team’s website but did not specify the cause or say where in Arizona he died. A consistently prolific scorer, Greer was one of the most brilliant pro guards of the 1960s, together with Oscar Robertson, Jerry West and Sam Jones. But he was always low key. Greer was a slightly built 6 feet 2 inches. He wasn’t a leaper, he had no special flash, and he seldom showed emotion on the court. “I never said anything that made headlines,” he told Basketball Digest in 1980. “Nothing colorful.” “We called Greer bulldog because he had that kind of expression on his face, and it never changed,” his former teammate Al Bianchi told Terry Pluto in the oral history “Tall Tales” (1992). But in his 15 N.B.A. seasons, with the Syracuse Nationals and their successor franchise, the 76ers, Greer turned in an outstanding game just about every night. Earl Monroe, who faced Greer while playing for the Baltimore Bullets and the Knicks, recalled how Greer would pile up points in an unspectacular but devastating way. “He would have 25 or 30 points on you, and you’d be wondering what he did to get all those points,” Monroe recalled in “Earl the Pearl” (2013, with Quincy Troupe). “Every night, steady. You knew he would be going to pull up and shoot the jumper, but you were never ready for it.” Averaging more than 20 points a game in eight seasons, Greer was an N.B.A. All-Star from 1961 to 1970, and he was named to the all-league second team seven times. He was voted most valuable player of the 1968 All-Star Game, scoring a record 19 points in a single quarter. He was elected to the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1982 and named to the N.B.A.’s 50th anniversary team in 1996. Greer averaged 22.1 points a game on the 76ers’ 1967 championship squad, playing alongside Wilt Chamberlain at center, Chet Walker, Luke Jackson and Billy Cunningham at forward, and Larry Costello and Wally (later Wali) Jones in the backcourt. The 76ers, coached by Alex Hannum, were 68-13 in the regular season, then eliminated the Bill Russell-led Celtics from the playoffs with a 4-games-to-1 victory in the Eastern Division finals, ending Boston’s streak of eight consecutive N.B.A. titles. Philadelphia won the finals over the San Francisco Warriors in six games. Greer averaged nearly 28 points a game in the 76ers’ 15 playoff games. Cunningham long remembered Greer’s one-handed jumper, fired from up to 20 feet out, usually from the top of the foul circle. As he told Hoop magazine in 2006, it was “as good as anybody’s who ever played the game.” Greer was also adept at penetrating to the basket, and he was an outstanding defensive player. He shot free throws effectively while mimicking his jump-shooting form. “I would like to be remembered as a great, consistent player,” he once told The Philadelphia Daily News. Harold Everett Greer was born on June 26, 1936, in Huntington, W. Va., where his father, William, was a railroad worker. After starring at the segregated Frederick Douglass High School there, he became the first high-profile black player at a major college in West Virginia, averaging more than 19 points a game for Marshall College (now Marshall University) in Huntington. Earl Lloyd, the first black player in the N.B.A., with the Washington Capitols in 1950, played at the historically black West Virginia State. The Syracuse Nationals selected Greer in the second round of the 1958 N.B.A. draft. “I didn’t think I had a chance at all,” he once said. “When I first got there, I didn’t even unpack my bag.” But Greer went on to team with the outstanding front-count scorers Dolph Schayes, Johnny Kerr and George Yardley and played five seasons for the Nationals before they became the Philadelphia 76ers, after the Philadelphia Warriors moved to San Francisco. Although Greer enjoyed his greatest success with the 76ers, there were some low points as well. With five seconds left in Game 7 of the 1965 Eastern Division finals and the 76ers trailing the Celtics by 1 point, Greer inbounded the ball. His high, soft toss to Walker was deflected by Boston’s John Havlicek as the Celtic broadcaster Johnny Most memorably screamed: “Havlicek stole the ball! It’s all over!” “I didn’t put enough on the ball,” Greer told The Boston Globe afterward. In his final season, Greer was a substitute on a famously awful team, the 1972-73 Sixers, who went 9-73. Over his career he scored 21,586 points for an average of 19.2 a game and played in 1,122 games, an N.B.A. record at the time of his retirement. He owned a marketing company after leaving basketball. He and his wife, Mayme, had two daughters, Cherie and Kelly, and a son, Hal Jr. The 76ers said all survive him. Greer may have been a steady and quiet sort, but one night in the fall of 1967 he showed a thing or two to a Knicks rookie who would come to epitomize flash. “He was one of my heroes, probably my favorite player,” Walt Frazier wrote in recalling his first preseason appearance in “The Game Within the Game” (2006, with Dan Markowitz). “But that night he just killed me. He beat me off the dribble, he pulled up for 15-foot jumpers. When the locker room cleared out, I sat down and cried. I really didn’t think I had what it took to make it in the N.B.A.”",The New York Times
2018,Halliburton Writes Off Remaining $312 Million Invested in Venezuela,"HOUSTON — Halliburton, the global oil service company, announced on Monday that it had written off its remaining investment of $312 million in Venezuela, as oil production in the politically polarized and virtually bankrupt country continues to plummet. The move had long been expected because the state-owned oil company, Petróleos de Venezuela, known as Pdvsa, had for years been falling behind on paying its bills from companies that maintain and operate its oil and gas wells. “This is one step further into the collapse of the Venezuelan oil industry,” said Francisco J. Monaldi, a Venezuelan energy expert at Rice University, “because it means oil service contractors, which are absolutely essential to operations, are slowly giving up on the country.’’ Daily oil production in Venezuela, the country with the world’s largest reserves, has plummeted by 200,000 barrels since late last year, to its lowest level in 30 years. That drop has helped raise global oil prices in recent weeks to more than $70 a barrel, and has pushed gasoline prices in the United States to their highest level for this time of the year in three years. Pdvsa has been purged of more than 80 executives in recent months, and its operations have been put under the command of a major general in Venezuela’s National Guard with no experience in the oil business. Tensions between the national company and foreign companies that operate in the country have increased as military officers have taken over more oil supervisory positions. Two Venezuelan employees of Chevron, a major partner of Pdvsa’s, were arrested last week after they refused to sign a contract. Christopher Weber, Halliburton’s chief financial officer, attributed the decision to write down company business in Venezuela to a variety of reasons, including the collapse of the Venezuelan currency and the worsening political climate. He also mentioned United States sanctions, which prohibit American investors or companies from buying or selling new Pdvsa debt. The Trump administration is expected to toughen those sanctions after Venezuela’s presidential election on May 20, possibly prohibiting the export of United States light crude that Venezuela blends with its heavy crude to transport it through pipelines. The administration might even block imports of Venezuelan oil to the United States, which is still Venezuela’s biggest market. The re-election of Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro, is virtually certain. The main opposition is boycotting the election because, it says, the process is fixed. The Venezuelan government and Pdvsa are already in default on more than $50 billion in bonds after failing to make interest payments since late last year. Nevertheless, Halliburton said it would continue to operate in the country. “The company is maintaining its presence in Venezuela and is carefully managing its go-forward exposure,” Halliburton said in a statement. The company, based in Houston, wrote off $647 million in Venezuela last year. Schlumberger, Halliburton’s principal global competitor, took a pretax write-down of $938 million in Venezuela late last year. Halliburton made the announcement as it reported a first-quarter profit of $46 million, up from a loss of $32 million for the same period last year.",The New York Times
2018,Hamas Sees Gaza Protests as Peaceful — and as a ‘Deadly Weapon’,"News Analysis GAZA CITY — It was a striking tableau: Ismail Haniya, the political leader of Hamas, the Islamic militant group that has tried suicide bombs, rockets and attack tunnels in its long struggle with Israel, standing before portraits of the giants of nonviolent resistance — Mahatma Gandhi, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Nelson Mandela. Urging on Palestinians who have staged a new campaign of protests along the fence separating Gaza from Israel, Mr. Haniya likened their struggle to those for India’s independence, against racial segregation and discrimination in the United States, and against apartheid in South Africa. “This blessed protest is national, peaceful, popular and civilized,” he said. Minutes later, though, he called the same protests “a deadly weapon” with which to achieve the Palestinians’ goals, saying that guns, rockets and attack tunnels — the more familiar weapons that have kept Hamas listed as a terrorist group by the United States, European Union and Israel — remained at hand if needed. Mixed messages have abounded during the so-called Great Return March, the grass-roots campaign that is now in its third week and seeks to highlight hardship in Gaza and demand the right to return to lands in Israel. While organizers promised peaceful disobedience of Israel’s orders to stay far from the fence, participants have thrown Molotov cocktails and other explosives, even attaching one to a kite. And while Mr. Haniya and other Gaza leaders espoused Palestinian unity, and flew only the national flag, he also, without naming them, accused the Ramallah-based Palestinian Authority and its president, Mahmoud Abbas, leader of archrival Fatah, of presiding over a corrupt era of “humiliation, negotiations and security coordination” with Israel. Few analysts, and certainly few Israelis, have suggested that Hamas may actually be rethinking its strategy merely because it has joined what are meant to be nonviolent mass protests and has name-checked the heroes of peaceful civil disobedience. “It’s quite understandable that when those that proscribe Hamas as a terror organization see Haniya surrounded by icons of peace, it does little to dispel memories of very violent and bloody attacks, including by suicide bombs,” said Beverley Milton-Edwards, an expert on political Islam at the Brookings Doha Center in Qatar who was a co-author of a history of Hamas. But if Mr. Haniya’s unexpected nod to nonviolence struck some as contradictory and self-serving — as evidence of, one might say, a degree of chutzpah — his organization’s embrace of the Gaza protests had a clear logic that can be understood in much simpler terms. Terms like “no-brainer.” Its experiment with popular resistance may or may not be wholehearted, but it is indisputably pragmatic. A month or two ago, Hamas was cornered. Isolated regionally, rived by internal disputes, it had been unable to ameliorate a deepening humanitarian crisis in Gaza and was increasingly humiliated by the failure of reconciliation talks with Ramallah. “They had to make too many concessions in the hope of getting a little bit in exchange, and they wound up getting nothing whatsoever,” said Azzam Tamimi, an analyst for a London-based Arabic television channel with close ties to top Hamas leadership. After a decade running Gaza, and hemmed in by an Israeli-Egyptian blockade, Hamas was growing deeply unpopular. “Though most Gazans would blame Israel fundamentally, and Egypt indirectly, a lot of Palestinians would just do away with all of Hamas to have a better life,” said Tareq Baconi, author of “Hamas Contained: The Rise and Pacification of Palestinian Resistance,” to be published next month by Stanford University Press. The group was in such dire straits that analysts and Israeli security officials warned it might provoke a new war out of sheer desperation to shake things up. Yet, even the prospect of war seemed unavailing. Neither Hamas nor Gaza’s two million residents, still recovering from the past two conflicts, in 2012 and 2014, had any appetite for another round of violence. “They’re absolutely exhausted,” Mr. Baconi said. To its rockets Israel had responded with the Iron Dome antimissile system. To its tunnels Israel was answering with a $2 billion reinforced-concrete wall buried deep underground. And on Sunday, Israel said it had uncovered and destroyed the longest operational tunnel yet from Gaza. It was no surprise, then, that after a grass-roots idea for a peaceful, long-lasting protest along the Gaza fence started gaining widespread support, Hamas brought a halt to what had been a fairly steady tempo of rocket launches into Israel and threw its considerable organizational might behind the demonstrations. By embracing the protests, Hamas cannily aligned itself with a popular movement that became even more popular as it took shape — and that generated an outpouring of international support when Israel responded with gunfire, killing dozens of Palestinians, almost all of them unarmed. Instantly, the woebegone Palestinian cause and the crisis in Gaza were back in the news, and even the demand for a right of return to Israeli land — one that many supporters of a two-state solution seemed ready to throw overboard — was being taken seriously, cheering Palestinians in refugee camps and the diaspora. The time was ripe for a popular movement in Gaza, where younger Palestinians, like those on the West Bank and in East Jerusalem, have grown disillusioned with the moribund Oslo peace process for self-governance, Mr. Baconi said. Many want to turn the national movement into a campaign for civil rights, rather than simply for statehood. “Hamas is just jumping on the bandwagon and recognizing the effectiveness of popular resistance at this moment,” he said. In fact, though it is better known for armed struggle, Hamas has acknowledged the utility of popular resistance since it arose out of the First Intifada in 1987. And last year, it took another subtle step in that direction, adopting a new policy that acknowledged growing support for popular resistance. Yet, not all Gazans see Hamas’s involvement in the new protests as laudable. Some accused the group of cynically hijacking the demonstrations to serve its own purposes, while still also using young men as cannon fodder. “It’s beautiful that we find Hamas adopting this nonviolent struggle,” Mohammad Al Taluli, a 26-year-old activist due in court this week on criminal charges for criticizing Hamas online, said sarcastically. “One week before the peaceful protest there was a military maneuver for the Qassam brigades. Do they think they fool us?” “The gun is no longer a choice,” Mr. Al Taluli added. “It’s a burden on anybody who carries it.” Yohanan Tzoreff, a former adviser for Arab affairs in Israel’s civil administration in Gaza, viewed the protests through the lens of Hamas’s long-running political rivalry with Fatah, in which Hamas hopes eventually to seize control of the Palestine Liberation Organization, over which Mr. Abbas now maintains a tight grip. “Which is the way that the people will adopt?” Mr. Tzoreff said. “The way of Ramallah, which means negotiations, negotiations, negotiations, and our entire fight will be at the international level; or the way in Gaza: popular resistance, with a lot of readiness to sacrifice?” For the moment, the two groups are enjoying an uneasy public truce, with Mr. Abbas expressing solidarity with the Gaza protests. “Fatah publicly support the protests, but behind closed doors, they criticize them as nothing more than a Hamas stunt,” Ms. Milton-Edwards said. For Hamas, the fate of its new embrace of popular protest depends on the ability of its leaders, and the Gaza marchers, to walk a fine line along the fence with Israel. Too much in the way of stone- or firebomb-throwing could stir another heavy-handed Israeli response — and the kind of Palestinian blood bath that could compel Hamas to answer back with rockets. “The more Israel uses disproportionate force, the harder it is for Hamas to continue holding back from retaliating,” Mr. Baconi said. “At some point, Hamas will start to lose legitimacy if it doesn’t.”",The New York Times
2018,"Hanged After a Trial He Couldn’t Understand, and Pardoned 136 Years Later","When Maolra Seoighe entered a Dublin courtroom to be tried for murder, his name was recorded as Myles Joyce. The change was a translation from his native Irish, or Gaelic, into English — a language Mr. Joyce did not speak. So he couldn’t understand the words of the defense lawyer, the judge or the jury members who decided he was guilty in November 1882, and he was hanged the next month. But evidence soon emerged suggesting that Mr. Joyce was innocent, just as he had been saying in Irish all along. Now, 136 years after his death, he has been officially pardoned. “Maolra Seoighe was wrongly convicted of murder and was hanged for a crime that he did not commit,” Ireland’s president, Michael D. Higgins, said on Wednesday. He called the trial a “miscarriage of justice” and pointed to a history of systemic discrimination and linguistic differences, issues that are still relevant in Ireland today. In a country of nearly five million people, only around 70,000 still speak Irish on a daily basis outside of the education system, according to census data. It is taught in schools, but it is in danger of becoming a learned language — like Latin — rather than a living one, said Seán Ó Cuirreáin, who served as the country’s Irish language commissioner until, frustrated that the language was not being prioritized, he announced his resignation in 2013. Mr. Ó Cuirreáin wrote a book about Mr. Joyce that was published in 2016. It’s called “Éagóir,” meaning injustice, and it’s in Irish. “Irish is my first language,” he said. “The language is actually a character in the story, in one sense.” (While many of Mr. Ó Cuirreáin’s compatriots can’t easily read his book, a documentary based on it was released this week. It has subtitles.) Mr. Ó Cuirreáin said interest in Mr. Joyce’s case has been growing in recent years. In 2012, he and President Higgins marked the 130th anniversary of the execution at a wreath-laying ceremony in Galway. Niamh Mary Howlin, a lecturer at University College Dublin’s Sutherland School of Law, was commissioned by the government to do a report on the case. She approved of the president’s decision to pardon Mr. Joyce this week. “This is only the second time a posthumous pardon has ever been granted, so the pardon itself has great historical and legal significance,” she said. “The case of Myles Joyce has been infamous for generations.” Mr. Joyce was from a tight-knit community, and he was related to the five people who were killed in August 1882. In total, 10 men were arrested in connection with the murders, two of whom testified against the others. Five pleaded guilty and were sentenced to prison. The remaining three, including Mr. Joyce, were tried, convicted and hanged. The victims — a married couple, Bridget and John Joyce; two of their children, Margaret and Michael; and John’s mother, Margaret — were found in their home in Maamtrasna, a remote community at the border of Mayo and Galway counties. Reports from the time — some of which included cruel descriptions of the Irish-speaking residents of that rural area — suggested that a firearm and some bludgeoning were involved. Mr. Joyce and two others convicted of participation in the murder were hanged on a cold December morning in Galway. The New York Times reported that Mr. Joyce protested his innocence so persistently that he appeared to have prolonged his own execution: Before the drop fell Myles Joyce spoke in Irish, as follows: “I am going before God. I was not there at all and had not hand or part in it. Lord, forgive them that swore against me.” He continued to reiterate his innocence to the end. The drop fell at 8:25 o’clock simultaneously for all three of the men. Myles Joyce alone struggled slightly, there being some hitch with the rope. His dying speech was delivered with much vehemence. He was still speaking when the drop fell. A doctor who examined the bodies said Mr. Joyce struggled for minutes as the rope strangled him to death. It was shown that after the rope had been adjusted around his neck he turned and addressed the reporters, thus disarranging the rope. The jury severely censured Marwood, the hangman, for his carelessness. Ireland was not yet independent from Britain — that would not happen until 1921 — and the murders took place at a time of simmering conflicts over land rights and independence. That made people wonder whether the murders were connected to the unrest, ultimately raising the profile of the case, Mr. Ó Cuirreáin said. Instead of being tried in nearby Galway, Mr. Joyce was taken all the way across the island, to Dublin, for his trial. English was the language of the court. Professional Irish translators would have been easier to find in Galway, but in Dublin, a police officer was called upon to serve as a translator, Dr. Howlin’s research showed. But he mostly translated Irish into English and not the other way around, effectively leaving Mr. Joyce in the dark. The trial was also compromised by intense media interest, procedural problems, a lack of input from key witnesses and testimonial inconsistencies. “The other two men convicted alongside him swore that he was innocent, and the approvers who had given evidence against him retracted their statements following his death,” Dr. Howlin said in her paper. Two years after the trial, The Times reported that one informer said he had been asked to lie by a crown solicitor. Mr. Ó Cuirreáin also found that a lord lieutenant of Ireland, Earl John Spencer, seemed to have been involved in bribing witnesses. “It sounds like fiction because of the twists and turns,” Mr. Ó Cuirreáin said. “But unfortunately it was true, and innocent people were condemned to death.”",The New York Times
2018,Hank Azaria Offers to Stop Voicing Apu on ‘The Simpsons’ After Criticism,"The actor who portrays Apu Nahasapeemapetilon, the thickly accented convenience store owner on “The Simpsons,” said Tuesday that he would be “perfectly willing and happy to step aside” as the voice of the character. For nearly 30 years, Hank Azaria has been the voice behind the stingy Indian-American owner of the high-priced Kwik-E-Mart in Springfield, the show’s fictional town. Mr. Azaria, who is white, gave Apu a pronounced Indian accent, which, along with the character itself, has come under intense criticism in recent months as a racist stereotype. In December, Mr. Azaria said that he found the situation “upsetting” and that there were “a lot of things to think about.” But on Tuesday, in an interview with Stephen Colbert on “The Late Show,” he offered his fullest response yet to the criticism, which started with the debut last fall of the documentary “The Problem With Apu.” The documentary’s producer, Hari Kondabolu, a comedian of South Asian descent, said in the film that Mr. Azaria’s rendition of Apu was more like “a white guy doing an impression of a white guy making fun of my father.” Mr. Azaria said he had watched the documentary and listened to others. “I’ve given this a lot of thought, really a lot of thought,” Mr. Azaria said in the interview. “I’m perfectly willing and happy to step aside, or help transition it into something new.” For years, Apu was the most prominent character of South Asian descent and representation of Indian-Americans on television. Apu’s significance and influence, the documentary said, contributed to years of negative racial stereotypes that have been used to mock or bully Asian-American children. Mr. Azaria, who has won four Emmys for his portrayal of Apu and other characters on “The Simpsons,” said that he was surprised by the criticism at first but that he now understands it after listening to more people. “The idea that anyone, young or old, past or present, was bullied or teased based on the character of Apu, it just really makes me sad,” he said. “It was certainly not my intention. I wanted to spread laughter and joy.” After his interview aired on Tuesday, Mr. Kondabolu tweeted: “Thank you, @HankAzaria. I appreciate what you said & how you said it.” Mr. Azaria struck a far more conciliatory tone than the show’s writers in their response to the criticism. [Read our analysis of how “The Simpsons” addressed the criticism in a recent episode.] Their response came in an episode on April 8, which featured a scene with Marge Simpson sitting in bed with her daughter Lisa, reading a fictitious children’s book called “The Princess in the Garden.” The book had been edited to remove passages that were considered insensitive. A frustrated Marge says, “Well, what am I supposed to do?” Lisa replies: “It’s hard to say. Something that started decades ago and was applauded and inoffensive is now politically incorrect. What can you do?” The camera then pans to a photo of Apu on Lisa’s nightstand. Her mother says, “Some things will be dealt with at a later date.” “If at all,” Lisa says.",The New York Times

Waverly Richardson, who has worked for Hanky Panky for 15 years, spreads fabric at the company's multi-use warehouse in Queens.CreditCreditCaroline Tompkins for The New York Times Before converting a set of handkerchiefs into a bra and panties that began a 40-year career for her and her best friend, Gale Epstein dabbled in many varieties of D.I.Y. “I had a lot of stuff from her,” said Lida Orzeck, 70, Ms. Epstein’s business partner and longtime friend. It was a cold afternoon in March, and she was seated next to Ms. Epstein, 71, at a long white table at the Park Avenue headquarters of Hanky Panky, the underwear company the two women founded in 1977. “You were getting jeans from vintage shops, then you sewed up the bottoms or something and made them into pocketbooks.” “That was my denim period, yes,” said Ms. Epstein, a Parsons School of Design graduate. “I had a suede period too. That was your first wedding dress. That was pre-Hanky Panky, so that was suede and appliqué. The second was during Hanky Panky, so it was hand-embroidered silk scarves that we were using in our line.” “My wedding dresses are only two out of, what, 10?” Ms. Orzeck said. “Gale also has a lot of sisters and other friends.” “They’re not conventional dresses,” Ms. Epstein said. “But anyway, I don’t design conventionally.” Conventional or not, Ms. Epstein’s designs have certainly proven popular. The thong she created for Hanky Panky in 1986, known simply as 4811 and priced at about $20, is still a top-selling item for the company, which counts Rihanna, Beyoncé, Angelina Jolie, Cameron Diaz, Emma Watson, Eva Longoria, Kim Kardashian West and many others as customers. Thongs, which Hanky Panky produces in a rainbow of hues and several styles, make up more than half of the company’s $50-million business. The other half is made up of different types of stretchy, form-fitting bottoms and lacy, colorful bras. The company’s products have all been made in the United States — primarily in the New York area — since its founding, a considerable feat given that the number of manufacturing jobs in the city has been declining since the 1950s and significantly dropped after 9/11 as one apparel company after another has moved production overseas. In October, Hanky Panky’s employees — a significant portion of whom work at a 90,000-square-foot multiuse warehouse in Queens — discovered that they would soon be part owners of the company. At a party celebrating Hanky Panky’s 40th birthday, Ms. Epstein and Ms. Orzeck announced that the company had established an employee stock ownership plan, which transfers the ownership of the company over to a trust for the benefit of its workers. An ESOP is similar to a 401(k) but does not require employee contributions. The right to shares will be earned after six years of working continuously full-time. When employees leave the company, they retain their vested ownership until attaining full retirement age, and upon retirement they can redeem their shares. “Gale and I are still in charge,” Ms. Orzeck said. “But we no longer wholly own the company.” One need not fear that the next Tanga panty’s design will be crowdsourced. “I’m still the last word on fit,” Ms. Epstein said. “Of course, we make all sizes and we have our in-house focus group, but I’m still involved in the look and feel of everything that comes through the design room. I don’t even trust models to give me exact feedback.” Ms. Orzeck said, “Gale is supersensitive.” At the company’s warehouse last month, Rodney Yetter, Hanky Panky’s quality-control manager, explained how his team contributes to a customer return rate that is one-tenth of 1 percent. “Any type of thing that goes wrong with these is the same type of thing,” Mr. Yetter said. “Human error is easy to find if you know where to look for it. A lace with runoffs, a skipped stitch on a machine. If you’re counting from the crotch area, it’s easy to spot.” He added: “Ninety percent of the returns are because of fit.” Many of the thongs are “one size fits most” and fit sizes 2 to 14. In a world that requires endless size calibration, this is surely a relief to customers (petite and plus sizes are also available). “We offer an assortment of brands, but Hanky Panky continues to be a category leader,” David Law, the chief merchant at Lord & Taylor, wrote in an email. Lord & Taylor was the first store to receive an order from Hanky Panky, in 1977, when Ms. Epstein and Ms. Orzeck personally delivered 144 tops and bottoms that Ms. Epstein had spent an entire weekend sewing. The design that had lured the store’s buyer was a bra-and-bikini set that Ms. Epstein created from Victorian-era handkerchiefs she found in a bridal shop and gave to Ms. Orzeck as a birthday gift. An original version of the set is in the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s permanent collection. Ms. Orzeck took the lead on sales, despite having little experience in the area. She had a doctorate from Columbia University in social psychology and her first job out of graduate school was assessing how the New York Police Department interacted with victims of sex crimes. “Boldly, as if I knew what I was doing, I called up stores, asked for buyers, made appointments,” Ms. Orzeck said. “They all saw me. Because that’s the way business was done then.” The department stores were quick to place orders, but soon bigger companies began copying Ms. Epstein’s designs. “We lost the department-store business because they were looking for low price and high volume,” Ms. Orzeck said. In 1986, Ms. Epstein developed her version of the thong, a slightly more modest version of the “G-string” that had long been worn only by strippers and prostitutes. “One of the reasons the thong became important in the 1970s and ’80s is that more women were wearing pants, so the visible panty line became an issue,” said Colleen Hill, the curator of costume and accessories at the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology. “There was also more acceptance of the body. The fitness crazy in the ’80s encouraged women to feel better about their bodies and show them off more.” Many department stores balked at the idea of selling backless underwear, so Hanky Panky turned to boutiques. Over the next two decades or so, it steadily built a following but remained mostly under the radar. “They started out small and were always very focused on quality, which they still are,” Ms. Hill said. “We never scaled up to a certain volume because we were having too much fun,” Ms. Epstein said. “We didn’t want to create this massive organization that would have gotten out of hand and would have forced us at that time, in order to compete, to go offshore.” But in 2004 The Wall Street Journal published a front-page story about the company (the show “Sex and the City,” among other cultural factors, had popularized Brazilian bikini waxes), and business exploded. “That was the most difficult day of our business life,” Ms. Epstein said. “We had no sales department. We had no P.R. agency.” “You didn’t have a cellphone,” Ms. Orzeck said. “We didn’t even have an e-commerce website. We had 55 employees. This was a time when I would maybe get five emails in a day, and there were hundreds.” The department stores returned, no longer scandalized by the idea of a thong or the company’s name. The company began to slowly and carefully increase production, meting out limited inventory to stores. “It was a balancing act,” Ms. Epstein said. “We had to satisfy everybody in some way.” Ms. Orzeck said, “It was much harder than starting the company. Demand, a reputation to uphold, expectations. It was a gorgeous nightmare.” Eventually, the company expanded to an additional floor of the building, hiring more than 100 new employees. “We have always grown, and we have lived through five recessions,” Ms. Orzeck said. In fact, the economic downturn in 2008 is what allowed them the breathing room to enter e-commerce, late in the game. “By 2009 every brand had a website, except for us,” Ms. Orzeck said. “So the time was right. We had to convince the boutiques that they wouldn’t lose business.” In recent years, Ms. Epstein and Ms. Orzeck have scaled back their involvement in the company. “I’m not in the weeds the way I was the first 25 years,” Ms. Orzeck said. Why shouldn’t they take it a little bit easier after turning the thong into a classic cut, one that remains a staple in many drawers (despite what the millennials may have you believe)? But despite handing over some of their ownership, they have no plans to leave. “Why would I retire?” Ms. Orzeck said. “This is still our baby.”",The New York Times

2018,"Hans Asperger Aided Nazi Child Euthanasia, Study Says","A new study has shed more light on the revelations that Hans Asperger, the Austrian pediatrician for whom a form of autism is named, had collaborated with the Nazis and actively assisted in the killing of disabled children. Published on Wednesday in the journal Molecular Autism by the medical historian Herwig Czech, the report relies on eight years of research that included the examination of previously unseen Nazi-era documents. The study concludes that though Dr. Asperger was not a member of the Nazi Party, he had participated in the Third Reich’s child-euthanasia program, which aimed to establish a “pure” society by eliminating those deemed a “burden.” Dr. Asperger referred disabled children to the notorious Am Spiegelgrund clinic in Vienna, where hundreds were either drugged or gassed to death from 1940 to 1945. “The picture that emerges is that of a man who managed to further his career under the Nazi regime, despite his apparent political and ideological distance from it,” Mr. Czech, of the University of Vienna, wrote in his study. Asperger syndrome is a lifelong developmental disability associated with autism that affects perception and social interaction. About one in 68 children in the United States have been identified with Autism Spectrum Disorder. The study’s findings have prompted debate and consternation among people with autism and their advocates, especially those who identify with the term “Asperger,” Carol Povey, director of the London-based Center for Autism of the National Autistic Society, said in an email. “Obviously, no one with a diagnosis of Asperger syndrome should feel in any way tainted by this very troubling history,” she said. The study has also provoked discussion across social media platforms, with some conflicted about Dr. Asperger’s name being linked to the condition. “My overriding feeling is one of anger, that I thought Hans Asperger was someone who tried to protect and save children who were just like me,” a Twitter user called Ryan Hendry wrote. “Instead, it appears he was part of the Nazi machine that intended to exterminate us.” From social awkwardness to a complete inability to communicate verbally — four men and women speak about life with autism. There are about 700,000 people with autism in Britain, Ms. Povey said, adding, “We will be listening closely to the response to this news so we can continue to make sure the language we use to describe autism reflects the preferences of autistic people and their families.” The editors of Molecular Autism said they believed that Dr. Asperger was guilty of the accusations against him. “We are aware that the article will be controversial,” Simon Baron-Cohen, a co-editor of the journal, said in a statement. “We believe that it deserves to be published in order to expose the truth about how a medical doctor who was seen as only having made valuable contributions to the field of pediatrics and child psychiatry was guilty of actively assisting the Nazis in their abhorrent eugenics and euthanasia policies.” He added, “This historical evidence must now be made available.” Dr. Asperger, who died in 1980, was a pioneer of autism research and is best known for shaping the understanding of the developmental disorder that came to be known as Asperger syndrome. In 1944, he used the term “autistic psychopathy” to describe the disability. The name Asperger syndrome was introduced by the British psychiatrist Lorna Wing in 1981. Mr. Czech traced Dr. Asperger’s involvement in the selection of victims for the Nazis’ child-euthanasia program to his role in 1942 on a commission that screened youngsters with mental disabilities. The commission selected 35 children and categorized them as being “uneducable,” which resulted in their being killed at Am Spiegelgrund. Some experts, however, have suggested that the new evidence should be seen in the context of the time. “Virtually all doctors in Germany at that time were members of the Nazi Party, and there was almost no opposition to the euthanasia programs for the mentally ill and handicapped, except from one or two heads of asylums and a very small number of Catholic bishops,” Anthony Bailey, a professor of child and adolescent psychiatry at the University of British Columbia in Canada, said in an email. But Mr. Czech argued that the euthanasia program was not obligatory because the operation was illegal, even in Nazi Germany. He said that, at the time, Austria’s annexation to Germany in 1938 resulted in the expulsion of Jewish physicians and spurred a great political upheaval. But it also opened opportunities for Dr. Asperger, he added. What emerges after years of searching through personnel files and patient records, he said, is a portrait of a doctor who “sought to accommodate himself to the Nazi regime and was rewarded with career opportunities.” OpinionEdith Sheffer",The New York Times
2018,"Opinion | Happy Birthday, Karl Marx. You Were Right!","The Stone Mr. Barker is an associate professor of philosophy. SEOUL, South Korea — On May 5, 1818, in the southern German town of Trier, in the picturesque wine-growing region of the Moselle Valley, Karl Marx was born. At the time Trier was one-tenth the size it is today, with a population of around 12,000. According to one of Marx’s recent biographers, Jürgen Neffe, Trier is one of those towns where “although everyone doesn’t know everyone, many know a lot about many.” Such provincial constraints were no match for Marx’s boundless intellectual enthusiasm. Rare were the radical thinkers of the major European capitals of his day that he either failed to meet or would fail to break with on theoretical grounds, including his German contemporaries Wilhelm Weitling and Bruno Bauer; the French “bourgeois socialist” Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, as Marx and Friedrich Engels would label him in their “Communist Manifesto”; and the Russian anarchist Mikhail Bakunin. In 1837 Marx reneged on the legal career that his father, himself a lawyer, had mapped out for him and immersed himself instead in the speculative philosophy of G.W.F. Hegel at the University of Berlin. One might say that it was all downhill from there. The deeply conservative Prussian government didn’t take kindly to such revolutionary thinking (Hegel’s philosophy advocated a rational liberal state), and by the start of the next decade Marx’s chosen career path as a university professor had been blocked. If ever there were a convincing case to be made for the dangers of philosophy, then surely it’s Marx’s discovery of Hegel, whose “grotesque craggy melody” repelled him at first but which soon had him dancing deliriously through the streets of Berlin. As Marx confessed to his father in an equally delirious letter in November 1837, “I wanted to embrace every person standing on the street-corner.” [Receive the day’s most urgent debates right in your inbox by subscribing to the Opinion Today newsletter.] As we reach the bicentennial of Marx’s birth, what lessons might we draw from his dangerous and delirious philosophical legacy? What precisely is Marx’s lasting contribution? Today the legacy would appear to be alive and well. Since the turn of the millennium countless books have appeared, from scholarly works to popular biographies, broadly endorsing Marx’s reading of capitalism and its enduring relevance to our neoliberal age. In 2002, the French philosopher Alain Badiou declared at a conference I attended in London that Marx had become the philosopher of the middle class. What did he mean? I believe he meant that educated liberal opinion is today more or less unanimous in its agreement that Marx’s basic thesis — that capitalism is driven by a deeply divisive class struggle in which the ruling-class minority appropriates the surplus labor of the working-class majority as profit — is correct. Even liberal economists such as Nouriel Roubini agree that Marx’s conviction that capitalism has an inbuilt tendency to destroy itself remains as prescient as ever. But this is where the unanimity abruptly ends. While most are in agreement about Marx’s diagnosis of capitalism, opinion on how to treat its “disorder” is thoroughly divided. And this is where Marx’s originality and profound importance as a philosopher lies. First, let’s be clear: Marx arrives at no magic formula for exiting the enormous social and economic contradictions that global capitalism entails (according to Oxfam, 82 percent of the global wealth generated in 2017 went to the world’s richest 1 percent). What Marx did achieve, however, through his self-styled materialist thought, were the critical weapons for undermining capitalism’s ideological claim to be the only game in town. In the “Communist Manifesto,” Marx and Engels wrote: “The bourgeoisie has stripped of its halo every occupation hitherto honored and looked up to with reverent awe. It has converted the physician, the lawyer, the priest, the poet, the man of science, into its paid wage laborers.” Marx was convinced that capitalism would soon make relics of them. The inroads that artificial intelligence is currently making into medical diagnosis and surgery, for instance, bears out the argument in the “Manifesto” that technology would greatly accelerate the “division of labor,” or the deskilling of such professions. To better understand how Marx achieved his lasting global impact — an impact arguably greater and wider than any other philosopher’s before or after him — we can begin with his relationship to Hegel. What was it about Hegel’s work that so captivated Marx? As he informed his father, early encounters with Hegel’s “system,” which builds itself upon layer after layer of negations and contradictions, hadn’t entirely won him over. Marx found that the late-18th-century idealisms of Immanuel Kant and Johann Gottlieb Fichte that so dominated philosophical thinking in the early 19th century prioritized thinking itself — so much so that reality could be inferred through intellectual reasoning. But Marx refused to endorse their reality. In an ironic Hegelian twist, it was the complete opposite: It was the material world that determined all thinking. As Marx puts it in his letter, “If previously the gods had dwelt above the earth, now they became its center.” The idea that God — or “gods”— dwelt among the masses, or was “in” them, was of course nothing philosophically new. But Marx’s innovation was to stand idealistic deference — not just to God but to any divine authority — on its head. Whereas Hegel had stopped at advocating a rational liberal state, Marx would go one stage further: Since the gods were no longer divine, there was no need for a state at all. The idea of the classless and stateless society would come to define both Marx’s and Engels’s idea of communism, and of course the subsequent and troubled history of the Communist “states” (ironically enough!) that materialized during the 20th century. There is still a great deal to be learned from their disasters, but their philosophical relevance remains doubtful, to say the least. The key factor in Marx’s intellectual legacy in our present-day society is not “philosophy” but “critique,” or what he described in 1843 as “the ruthless criticism of all that exists: ruthless both in the sense of not being afraid of the results it arrives at and in the sense of being just as little afraid of conflict with the powers that be.” “The philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways; the point is to change it,” he wrote in 1845. Racial and sexual oppression have been added to the dynamic of class exploitation. Social justice movements like Black Lives Matter and #MeToo, owe something of an unspoken debt to Marx through their unapologetic targeting of the “eternal truths” of our age. Such movements recognize, as did Marx, that the ideas that rule every society are those of its ruling class and that overturning those ideas is fundamental to true revolutionary progress. We have become used to the go-getting mantra that to effect social change we first have to change ourselves. But enlightened or rational thinking is not enough, since the norms of thinking are already skewed by the structures of male privilege and social hierarchy, even down to the language we use. Changing those norms entails changing the very foundations of society. To cite Marx, “No social order is ever destroyed before all the productive forces for which it is sufficient have been developed, and new superior relations of production never replace older ones before the material conditions for their existence have matured within the framework of the old society.” The transition to a new society where relations among people, rather than capital relations, finally determine an individual’s worth is arguably proving to be quite a task. Marx, as I have said, does not offer a one-size-fits-all formula for enacting social change. But he does offer a powerful intellectual acid test for that change. On that basis, we are destined to keep citing him and testing his ideas until the kind of society that he struggled to bring about, and that increasing numbers of us now desire, is finally realized.",The New York Times
2018,"Harassment at WNYC Was Not ‘Systemic,’ Report Says","An investigation into the workplace culture of New York Public Radio and its flagship station WNYC found that incidents of bullying and harassment were not reported to senior managers, in part because of fear of reprisals, a lack of confidence in how reports would be handled, and the perception that the station’s stars were “untouchable.” But the investigation did not find “systemic discrimination” that was known to, and tolerated by, senior management. The investigation also largely absolved Laura R. Walker, the president and chief executive of New York Public Radio, who acknowledged last year that she had “prioritized growth, and content and programming, over investment in some of the processes and people.” Instead, the investigation focuses on the station’s “understaffed” human resources department and recommends steps familiar to many workplaces grappling with the #MeToo movement, such as adding training for managers, creating an anti-bullying policy and clearly explaining its anti-harassment and discrimination policies to employees. “N.Y.P.R. needs to build a level of confidence that it is intent on fostering and preserving a respectful work environment and that all employees — even ‘stars’ — are held to that standard, and that no one will suffer adverse consequences for alerting N.Y.P.R. to inappropriate conduct,” the report says. [Read the report here.] The investigation was conducted by the law firm Proskauer Rose at the behest of the station’s board of trustees and released Tuesday afternoon. The station also held an all-staff meeting at its offices in Lower Manhattan to discuss the findings. Many employees who attended Tuesday’s meeting found the report sorely lacking, according to several people who were at the meeting and spoke anonymously to avoid reprisal. Many seemed stunned, even dismayed, that no one was apparently being held accountable. Accusations of harassment and discrimination at WNYC exploded into the open last year when the writer Suki Kim described her experiences, and those of other women, in an investigation for New York magazine, writing that John Hockenberry, the former host of “The Takeaway,” had harassed her after her appearance as a guest. A subsequent probe conducted by the WNYC newsroom revealed additional cases, as well as management’s awareness of myriad problems with “The Takeaway.” Then, in December, the station fired longtime hosts Leonard Lopate and Jonathan Schwartz after an investigation found they had violated standards of workplace conduct. The spate of bad publicity cast an unflattering spotlight on Ms. Walker, who for more than 20 years has been the public face of the station, and on Dean Cappello, her little-known deputy and WNYC’s chief content officer. Under Ms. Walker’s leadership, the station has grown in reach and funding. In 1995, WNYC, with its city-owned AM and FM stations, had a weekly audience of one million and a budget of $8 million, with $11.8 million in annual fund-raising. Today, New York Public Radio, an independent nonprofit that owns WNYC, WQXR and other entities, boasts a monthly audience of 26 million, including streaming and downloads, and a $100 million budget, with $52 million in annual fund-raising. Ms. Walker’s compensation — she earned $768,000 in the fiscal year ending in June 2016, and another $200,000 as a board member of the Tribune Media Company — has raised eyebrows, prompting some subscribers to cancel their memberships. In recent months, many current and former employees had speculated that either Ms. Walker or Mr. Cappello, or both, would lose their jobs. Then, in January, Ms. Walker announced that Mr. Cappello had been demoted and would no longer have anyone directly reporting to him. But the report from Proskauer, led by two partners, Keisha-Ann Gray and Howard Z. Robbins, does not mention either Ms. Walker or Mr. Cappello. In fact, there are no names at all in the 10-page report, which was based on interviews with 36 current and former employees, among others, and a review of documents and employment records. The report does touch on one topic that had concerned many employees: an exodus of prominent women of color because of what were said to be hostile and discriminatory workplace conditions. But it did not find evidence to corroborate allegations that race and gender played a role in their departures. In a statement, the board of trustees noted that there were many ways “in which we as an organization have fallen short and must do better.” But the board also called Ms. Walker “a committed and talented leader, and she has our full support.” In a statement, Ms. Walker said: “While I am gratified that the investigation found no evidence of systemic discrimination, we at New York Public Radio must hold ourselves to a much higher standard.” She added: “As I have said, this happened on my watch, and I accept responsibility.”",The New York Times
2018,Harper’s Editor Insists He Was Fired Over Katie Roiphe Essay,"James Marcus wants the world to know that he was fired from his job as the editor of Harper’s Magazine. He is not stepping down voluntarily to work on a book, which he said was the face-saving “official narrative” offered to him by John R. MacArthur, the magazine’s longtime president and publisher. He also said that he had refused to accept a severance payment that was contingent on his signing a non-disparagement agreement. “I was fired over a principled stand that I took and I am in no way ashamed of it,” Mr. Marcus said on Wednesday in a phone interview. His disagreement with the boss, he said, had to do with the magazine’s March cover story, “The Other Whisper Network: How Twitter feminism is bad for women,” by Katie Roiphe. The article, which Mr. Marcus described as “exceedingly mediocre” in an email on Wednesday, was assigned over his objections, he said. Within the magazine, there were conflicting versions of what led to Mr. Marcus’s departure. In strong terms, Giulia Melucci, the vice president of public relations at Harper’s, disputed the editor’s version of events. “All we can say is that the notion that he was fired because of the Katie Roiphe story has little in common with reality,” she said in an emailed statement. “That is one small part of a larger and more complicated story. We wish James Marcus all the best.” Told of Ms. Melucci’s remarks, Mr. Marcus said that she “was not present at my firing.” He added that “the bulk of the conversation” he had with Mr. MacArthur, which took place last Friday afternoon, “was about Katie Roiphe’s piece.” Harper’s is a nonprofit publication supported in large part by a foundation established by Mr. MacArthur, who is known as Rick, and his father, J. Roderick MacArthur. That structure provides some financial stability but also allows the younger MacArthur to wield more control over the publication, which was on the verge of folding before he helped rescue it in 1980. The venerable monthly has had unstable leadership since Lewis H. Lapham left Harper’s in 2006, after a 28-year run as its top editor. First there was Roger Hodge, who was fired after a disagreement with Mr. MacArthur in 2010. Next to hold the position was Ellen Rosenbush, who was replaced by Christopher Cox in 2015. Mr. MacArthur ended up firing Mr. Cox after he had been in the job a scant three months, and Ms. Rosenbush returned to duty on an interim basis. She was followed in February 2016 by Mr. Marcus, an early Amazon employee and the author of “Amazonia: Five Years at the Epicenter of the Dot.com Juggernaut.” “He’s looking for a doormat at this point,” Mr. Marcus said of Mr. MacArthur. The news of Mr. Marcus’s firing was first reported by Publisher’s Marketplace. The essay by Ms. Roiphe attracted attention before it was published, while it was going through the fact-checking process. Concerned writers and editors began a Twitter campaign warning that the article would reveal the identity of the main creator of a crowdsourced spreadsheet that named roughly 70 men in the media industry who were said to have acted in a predatory manner toward women. The online complaints intensified, arguing that the safety of the spreadsheet’s creator would be jeopardized by the publication of Ms. Roiphe’s essay. Before the social media campaign had died down, the writer Moira Donegan revealed that she was the main person behind the list in a first-person story for New York magazine’s web vertical The Cut. Ms. Roiphe’s essay had a similarly troubled pre-publication history inside the Manhattan offices of Harper’s. The idea began, Mr. Marcus said, with the publisher, who suggested that the magazine “run a contrarian piece on #MeToo movement.” The editor countered that he was uncomfortable with such an assignment, because of the magazine’s “longtime reputation as a gentleman’s smoking club.” “I expressed my opposition in the beginning, but I was overruled by the publisher,” Mr. Marcus said. “It’s the publisher’s prerogative to essentially assign a piece.” Mr. Marcus said that the magazine approached “one or two” writers, who passed on the idea, before Ms. Melucci, the Harper’s publicist, reached out to Ms. Roiphe. He added, “We can quibble over who technically assigned the piece. She’s a publicist and doesn’t have the power to assign anything. You could say she assigned it with Rick’s permission. She had no role in the editing of the piece.” Ms. Melucci suggested that she got involved in the editorial process only because of unusual circumstances at the magazine. “Maybe think about the fact that the publicist had to assign stories because the editor didn’t have ideas?” she said in a phone interview. “I don’t know — maybe that’s how bad it was.” Mr. Marcus disagreed with that, saying that during the discussion last week that ended with his firing, “there was no complaint about my failure to generate story ideas.” “The editorial process was breaking down,” he continued. “It’s Rick’s magazine, but usually the publisher does not intercede during the editing process. The piece was widely disliked by the entire staff, but I want to stress that they worked with absolute professionalism on it, whatever they thought of it.” Ms. Melucci said that she did not understand Mr. Marcus’s objection to the essay. “I don’t know why,” she said. “Maybe because it was a good story? It was the most successful story we’ve had in a couple years. He may have been against it, but it was good for the magazine.” In addition to discussing the Roiphe article last Friday afternoon, Mr. Marcus said that Mr. MacArthur, the publisher, had expressed his disappointment that Harper’s had not been reaching more readers. The magazine’s circulation, now at 120,000, has been in decline for years. Mr. Marcus said that the publisher’s resistance to bolstering the website and expanding readership engagement by hosting events impeded opportunities for growth. Ms. Melucci said that Mr. MacArthur had no comment for this article. She also declined to comment on whether the magazine had interviewed prospective editors. Ms. Rosenbush, listed as editor at large on the Harper’s masthead, will oversee the publication on an interim basis, Ms. Melucci said. Mr. Marcus described being fired as “painful,” but said he still had respect for Harper’s. “I think it’s still a magnificent publication,” Mr. Marcus said. “I share Rick’s pride in what he has accomplished there, but I think the anxiety and increasing sense that he needs to grab the reins editorially are going to make it hard for anybody who stands in that job. Whoever that poor sod is, I wish him or her good luck.”",The New York Times
2018,"Harry Anderson, 65, ‘Night Court’ Actor Who Bottled Magic Onscreen and Off, Dies","Harry Anderson, who starred as the kindhearted, zany Judge Harry Stone on the long-running NBC comedy “Night Court,” was found dead early Monday at his home in Asheville, N.C. He was 65. The Asheville Police Department, which confirmed the death, did not specify the cause but said foul play was not suspected. Turk Pipkin, a longtime friend, said Mr. Anderson had been hospitalized with the flu a few months ago and had remained sick. Mr. Anderson, who spent nine seasons presiding over a fictional Manhattan courtroom that played host to a steady stream of oddballs, was nominated for three consecutive Emmys, from 1985 to 1987. “Night Court,” which ran from 1984 to 1992, more than held its own against juggernauts like “Cheers,” “The Cosby Show” and “The Golden Girls” during a storied period for sitcoms. It was nominated for 31 Emmys and won seven. John Larroquette, Markie Post, Richard Moll, Charles Robinson and Marsha Warfield starred alongside Mr. Anderson. Judge Harry Stone shared more than a first name with the actor who played him: Both the character and the man wore colorful ties, were magicians at heart and were superfans of the singer Mel Tormé, who made several guest appearances on “Night Court.” Mr. Anderson delivered a eulogy at Mr. Tormé’s funeral in 1999. While he earned critical acclaim and amassed a devoted fan base on “Night Court,” Mr. Anderson never fancied himself an actor. “I’m a magician, or a performer, by nature, and that’s always what I’ve been,” he told WGN-TV in Chicago in 2014. “I was never really an actor,” he said. “I was a magician who fell into a part on ‘Cheers.’ ” His role as the swindler Harry (the Hat) Gittes on “Cheers” — he appeared in six episodes, four in the show’s first two seasons — led to his break on “Night Court” after he impressed Brandon Tartikoff, the president of NBC. Mr. Anderson’s “Cheers” character echoed his real life as well. In 1985, he told People magazine that he used to run a classic street hustle, the shell game, in San Francisco, where, at 21, he had his jaw broken by an opponent who was livid at the game’s outcome. Mr. Anderson, one of three children, was born on Oct. 14, 1952, in Newport, R.I., and spent much of his childhood on the move, often performing on the streets for money, he told People. He had lived in many cities, including Chicago, New York, St. Louis and New Orleans, by the time he landed in California at age 16. From there he found success as a comic magician, which opened the door to his acting career. About his mother, he said to People: “She was a hustler, yeah. She did a lot of things. We moved around a lot, and she had a lot of men friends.” But he said his childhood was not bad, adding that his dubious background should not be viewed any differently from his mother’s. “I respect my mother; she was very concerned with taking care of us,” he said. “She did what needed to be done to try to keep us together. People find my criminal days amusing, but they find her background shocking. I don’t draw any line.” Mr. Anderson told People that his father was a salesman who was mostly absent from his life, and that he had not seen him for 15 years before his death. Mr. Anderson is survived by his wife, the former Elizabeth Morgan, and two children from his first marriage, to Leslie Pollack: Eva Fay Anderson, a writer and producer in Los Angeles; and Dashiell Anderson, a teacher. In his late teens and early 20s, Mr. Anderson traveled the country performing magic. During a stint in Austin, Tex., about 45 years ago, he was performing on the street when he met someone else entertaining passers-by: a juggler named Turk Pipkin. The chance encounter led to a lifelong friendship and business partnership. Mr. Anderson and Mr. Pipkin performed together across the United States, and when Mr. Anderson decided he wanted to try acting in Hollywood, Mr. Pipkin followed him. “We were making it up as we went along,” Mr. Pipkin said in an interview on Tuesday. “When he gathered a crowd, people were just mesmerized. People just couldn’t look away.” Mr. Anderson appeared on “Saturday Night Live” several times in the 1980s. He hosted the show at the height of his fame, in 1985. After “Night Court,” Mr. Anderson felt burned out, so he moved with his first wife and their children to Washington State. But CBS lured him back into television a few years later with an offer to play the newspaper columnist Dave Barry on the comedy “Dave’s World,” which ran from 1993 to 1997. In 2008, he appeared in an episode of “30 Rock” titled “The One With the Cast of ‘Night Court.’ ” In 2000 Mr. Anderson moved to New Orleans, eager to return to his roots. It was there that Mr. Pipkin introduced him to Ms. Morgan. Once married, the Andersons opened the nightclub Oswald’s Speakeasy, where he performed, as well as a magic and curiosity shop, Sideshow. Mr. Anderson at first refused to leave New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina in 2005, opting to stay in Oswald’s in the French Quarter while the storm battered the city, Mr. Pipkin said. He evacuated only when the firefighters stationed nearby said they were leaving. After Katrina, tourism flagged. Mr. Anderson disagreed with the city’s plans for rebuilding, Mr. Pipkin said. He and his wife had also become captive to the depression that affected many in New Orleans at the time, Mr. Anderson told The New York Times in 2006. Despite efforts to support their community — Mr. Anderson opened his club for what he called French Quarter Town Hall meetings — and maintain their businesses, they chose to call it quits. The Andersons took a weeklong vacation in Asheville, where they fell in love with an old house and decided to buy it. “I’m glad we tried to stay” in New Orleans, Mr. Anderson said, “but I don’t want to be the person I will be if I stay here.”",The New York Times
2018,"Hart Family, Before Driving Off Cliff, Hid Dark Home Life From View","After Jennifer Hart drunkenly drove a sport utility vehicle straight off a 100-foot cliff on the Northern California coast late last month, taking her life and those of her wife and their adopted children, at least two searches began. One was for the missing bodies; another was for answers. How, those who knew the Harts wondered, could a family that looked so happy and normal in photos have hidden such a dark life from public view? Dozens of pages of reports released this week by child welfare officials offer some clues. Taken together they paint a portrait of a pair of mothers — one dictatorial and eccentric, the other constantly working and seldom home — who doled out cruel punishments and perennially withheld food from their six children. In the Hart household, any act of insubordination could be severely punished. The children knew this all too well. “They are like trained robots,” one worried caller told the authorities, according to the newly released documents, which describe the family’s dynamics. “We called them like little soldiers,” one former neighbor said of the children. In the weeks since the crash, searchers have fanned out along the Pacific coastline looking for the bodies. They have found those of the parents — Jennifer and Sarah Hart, both 38 — and four of their six children: Markis, 19; Jeremiah, 14; Abigail, 14; and Ciera, 12. As of last week, Devonte Hart, 15, and Hannah Hart, 16, were still missing, but feared dead. [Jennifer Hart's blood alcohol level was above the legal limit at the time of the crash.] Captain Greg Van Patten, a spokesman for the Mendocino County Sheriff’s Office, said Friday that the office had no additional updates and was operating “under the theory and the belief that the whole family was together” at the time of the crash. The documents released this week show that child welfare officials in Minnesota, Oregon and Washington State — three states where the Harts lived during the past seven years — knew of reported abuse, but, in one case, apparently stepped aside after completing their assessment; could not gather enough evidence to corroborate the claims of neglect in another; and, in a third case, learned of the allegations too late. “We believe the release of these records may help avoid future tragedies,” Caroline Burnell of the Oregon Department of Human Services said in a letter accompanying the documents. The department, she wrote, “continues to strive to improve.” Officials with the Oregon Department of Human Services became aware of the Hart family’s history in 2013. An anonymous person had reported that the children appeared malnourished, and so officials contacted child welfare officials in Minnesota, where the family had lived for years, to get more information on their background. Minnesota Child Welfare said it had received six troubling reports of abuse or neglect — two of which it deemed to be founded. In a 2010 case, one of the parents was found to have physically harmed Abigail, causing bruising all over her body. The dispute had been over a penny: The parents discovered one in Abigail’s pocket and accused her of lying about how she got it. A spanking ensued, which Sarah Hart said “got out of control,” according to the documents. The couple agreed to in-home therapy, counseling and other “skill building activities” as a remedy, the documents said. [“It was pure acceleration from the last brake application until it hit the bottom of the cliff.”] The New York Times previously reported that Sarah Hart was convicted of misdemeanor domestic assault in Minnesota around the same time. A criminal complaint says that Ms. Hart admitted to spanking one of her children, identified as A.H. In a 2011 episode, Hannah told a school nurse that she had not eaten. Jennifer Hart then became angry and shoved a banana and nuts into the child’s mouth. When confronted about this, Sarah Hart argued that Hannah was “playing the food card” and should just be given water. Eventually, a child welfare worker reported that the children’s school stopped calling the Harts because officials feared that the children would be punished. The Harts eventually pulled the children out of school, began to home-school them and later moved. The problem, one Minnesota welfare worker noted, according to documents, was that Jennifer and Sarah Hart “look normal.” In a telephone interview on Wednesday, a woman who lived across the street from the Harts in Alexandria, Minn., described the parents as “real friendly girls.” Still, the neighbor, Lorraine Fealy, 71, said she did not know their children well because the parents “didn’t let them out of the house very often.” When they did, the children were “very highly disciplined,” Ms. Fealy said. “They’d all come down the steps single file and walk out in the yard single file,” she said. The children’s behavior bothered her, she added, because “it wasn’t like normal kids.” Having been made aware of allegations against the Harts, child welfare officials and the police in Oregon began their own investigation in 2013. After interviewing each family member, they found that Jennifer — the more domineering of the couple — would travel with the children to music festivals several weeks a year, that Sarah was a retail manager at a Kohl’s and that the family received about $2,000 a month in adoption assistance. Investigators also interviewed at least two women who knew the family, and they painted a disturbing portrait of the Harts’ home life. They told investigators that the children had to raise their hands before speaking, got in trouble for laughing at the dinner table and in one instance were prohibited from telling one of the children, Markis, “Happy Birthday” on his birthday. In another episode, one of the women told investigators, Jennifer stayed with the children at her home. They ordered pizza, but Jennifer would allow her children to have only a small piece. The next morning, though, the pizza was gone — and Jennifer was irate, according to the documents. She told the woman that none of the children would be eating breakfast because none of them had admitted to having eaten the pizza. The woman said Jennifer then forced all the children to lie on their bed for about five hours as punishment. Still, officials with child protective services ultimately said that they were “unable to determine” if the women were guilty of neglect, according to the documents. They also said they could not identify a “safety threat.” Public records indicate that the Harts had moved to Washington State by 2017. But it was not until March 23 of this year that someone called the Department of Social and Health Services. The woman who called said that six months earlier, Hannah had jumped out of a second-story window at 1:30 a.m. and bolted inside the woman’s home, asking to be hidden. Hannah told the woman’s husband that she had been whipped with belts and that her mothers were racists, and begged the woman not to force her to return home. More recently, the woman said Devonte — who was famously photographed hugging a police sergeant during a 2014 demonstration — had been coming to their house two or three times each day, asking for food, and begging the woman not to tell his mother about the requests. Devonte told the caller that his parents punished him by taking meals away. He also claimed that he and his siblings were being hidden from view and that they were “sometimes” abused, according to the department’s intake report. [The photo of Devonte ricocheted around social media and was featured by major news media outlets.] Case notes also document each time that investigators tried to reach the Harts face to face in the hours and days after filing the report. On March 23, the day the intake report was created, an investigator saw a large brown S.U.V. turn into the Harts’ driveway, but no one answered the door when the investigator knocked. A deputy returned on March 26 — but no one appeared to be home. And when an investigator went back the next morning, there was still no answer. Later on March 27, the department got some news. It would not need to make any more visits. The family had been in a car crash in California, the case notes say, and all eight of its members were dead.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Has Latin America’s Crusade Against Corruption Gone Too Far?,"Jorge G. Castañeda Mr. Castañeda was foreign minister of Mexico from 2000 to 2003. Mexico City — After two years of trials and investigations, the Lava Jato, or Car Wash, scandal continues to wreak havoc on Brazil’s politics. On April 4, Brazil’s Supreme Court ruled against former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva’s appeal to avoid being imprisoned and barred from running for office again. Despite his lead in the polls for the October presidential election, he will not be on the ballot, and may watch the returns from jail. Similarly, just last month President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski of Peru was forced to resign after his supporters were caught on tape buying votes against his imminent impeachment. Mr. Kuczynski was accused of receiving money from Odebrecht, the Brazilian construction conglomerate, more than a decade ago. He was the latest Latin American leader to fall into disgrace in unending corruption scandals, but probably not the last. As the Mexican election campaign heats up, polls and pundits agree that the dominant issue for many voters is corruption. Each candidate accuses the others of engaging in corruption, being complicit in it or condoning it. The winner will probably be the candidate most likely to convince voters of his effectiveness in combating Mexico’s traditional scourge. Have recent events against corruption begun to threaten democracy and the rule of law, instead of strengthening them? There is a case to be made for these doubts, but it is a weak and, ultimately, flawed one. Whatever the drawbacks and dangers of the current anti-corruption drive in the region, they are preferable to the alternative: an intolerable status quo. On Friday and Saturday, Lima, the capital of Peru, will host the triannual Summit of the Americas, the only regional meeting where the leaders of every nation in the Western Hemisphere, including Cuba and the United States, sit at the same table. For each summit meeting, the group chooses a theme in advance. This time, the theme is corruption in the region. In Argentina, myriad scandals involving the Kirchner and Fernández administrations have come to light and are being prosecuted. And in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, former presidents are either in prison, under investigation or suspected of widespread corruption. It is useful to recall that the region has been known for widespread corruption for many decades. In 1992, President Fernando Collor de Mello of Brazil resigned before being impeached for corruption; millions of dollars were discovered at the Washington-based Riggs Bank in the name of the Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet; and Mexican presidents, dating back to the late ’40s, are suspected of having stashed away enormous fortunes. All of this went unnoticed, or in any case untouched. No longer. The issue today is not whether the drive against corruption in Latin America will continue, nor if it represents a sea change in the region’s standard operating procedure. Both statements are undeniable. But is the rise of anti-corruption demagogues or the discredit for democratic rule that these scandals bring with them not more damaging than the original sin itself? Are provisional institutions like the United Nations-inspired International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala or the O.A.S.-inspired Mission to Support the Fight Against Corruption and Impunity in Honduras not undermining efforts to build permanent institutions against corruption? In Brazil, where independent judges have exercised a direct impact on the electoral process, have they not opened the way to extremist rabble-rousers like the conservative candidate Jair Bolsonaro, while simultaneously making the country ungovernable? And are the calls for an internationally supported truth commission on corruption and human rights violations in Mexico a symptom of civil society being fed up with interminable scandals, or a menace to the country’s eternally weak justice system? There are no simple answers to these questions. Any flat-out judgment, in either direction, is bound to be schematic and skewed. The facts on the ground are that with two or three exceptions — Uruguay, Chile and perhaps Costa Rica — no country in Latin America has ever been spared massive doses of corruption. Standing institutions alone have never functioned effectively either in wiping it out, diminishing it noticeably or taking action against impunity for corruption or human rights violations. Regarding the latter plague, for which the region has a dismal reputation even today, international cooperation of one sort or another has proved indispensable for bringing criminals to justice or at least naming and shaming them for generations to come. The best example lies probably in Guatemala, but also in Argentina, where former presidents of the Junta were indicted and jailed for human rights violations. There appears to be no choice but to place any attempt to deal legally, democratically and effectively with the lack of punishment above other considerations: institution-building, national sovereignty, political stability, short-term economic performance. Developments over the past few years in all the region’s countries are positive, hopeful ones. In the end, they will strengthen civil society, representative democracy, the rule of law and economic progress. They do not weaken institutions; they help to transform them and make them function. Similarly, taking corruption to a supranational level that must be addressed through international cooperation is not an abdication of sovereignty; it is a desirable change. In fact, this is perhaps the most imaginative and productive route for the fight against corruption. It is, by definition, a transnational phenomenon: People who steal money hide it far from where they stole it. The Odebrecht scandal, the Panama Papers, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in the United States and the European Union’s equivalent legislation are all indicators of the need and the tradition of taking on corruption beyond strictly national borders. The inclusion of an anti-corruption chapter in the new Nafta currently being negotiated by Mexico, the United States and Canada is a step in the right direction. But much more has to be done with regard to this supranational approach. Governments have to exchange information on bank accounts, assets and travel — promptly and fully. Visas, property and monetary holdings must be subject to a clean bill of health for the individuals or companies — including offshore or shell companies — for new applicants and standing proprietors. Tax codes need to be strictly enforced, with no one looking the other way. Requests for arrests and extraditions should be responded to quickly and fairly. Acquisitions, sales and exchanges have to be monitored and questioned. Much of this already occurs among rich nations: members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the European Union. It is barely beginning between most Latin American nations and the United States. When the hemisphere begins to combat corruption with the same vigor with which it unwisely wages war on drugs and immigration, much will change in Latin America. Things are moving in the right direction; they need to move further and faster.",The New York Times

2018,Hawaiian Food Is Flourishing … in Utah?,"The restaurant chain Mo’ Bettahs has found success appealing to Utah’s dominant religious group: Mormons, who have long had ties to Polynesia. The brothers Kimo and Kalani Mack, who hail from Oahu, moved to Salt Lake City and opened their restaurant, Mo’ Bettahs, with no experience, no business plan and only the money they had saved driving buses in Honolulu.CreditCreditRyan Shorosky for The New York Times SALT LAKE CITY — The restaurant Mo’ Bettahs is a ballad to beach life. Surfing movies play on TV screens in a continuous loop. Paddles and surfboards that have all touched Hawaiian waters adorn the walls. Reggae music by the Hawaiian band Natural Vibrations pulses through the speakers. It’s nearly enough to make you forget you’re in a dry, landlocked city where the sights include snow-capped mountains and the occasional blizzard. That this restaurant exists at all is improbable. The brothers Kalani and Kimo Mack, who hail from Kaneohe on the coast of Oahu, opened the Hawaiian-style fast-casual place in 2008, in the depths of the Great Recession, with no experience, no business plan and only the money they had saved from driving buses in Honolulu. A decade later, Mo’ Bettahs has six perennially packed locations in Utah, an aggressive plan to expand to other states and a loyal customer base that dotes on the restaurant’s specialties: crisp, golden-brown chicken katsu dipped in ketchup-laced Mo’ Bettahs sauce, and steak glossed with a sweet, almost maltlike homemade teriyaki. A large measure of that success, though, derives not from any particular dish, but from the very specific appeal the restaurant holds for Utah’s dominant religious group: Mormons. As the headquarters of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Utah is home to two million Mormons, the largest number in any state. And the Mormon Church has long had strong ties to Polynesian island groups like Hawaii, Tonga and Samoa. That Pacific region was one of the church’s first overseas destinations, in the 1840s, for its missions — an essential Mormon tradition in which young members spend one and a half to two years in a single place to try converting locals to the faith. As a result, Mormons number in the hundreds of thousands in Polynesia, which has six Mormon temples and several church-sponsored schools. The Mack brothers, Kimo, 48, and Kalani, 49 — relaxed, slow-talking and clad in Hawaiian shirts and flip-flops regardless of the weather — never considered any of this when they moved to Salt Lake City and set out to open Mo’ Bettahs, even though both are lifelong members of the Mormon Church. Growing up in Hawaii — their mother was Hawaiian-Korean, and their father was Caucasian — they were beach bums who barely graduated from high school, and eventually became city bus drivers. Kalani moved to Salt Lake City in 1998 because his wife’s family was from there, as was his father; Kimo followed in 2008 to escape the high cost of living in Honolulu. “The Mormon thing wasn’t really a draw,” Kalani said. “I thought that everyone in Utah kind of takes for granted the fact that everyone’s Mormon. It doesn’t feel as special as it does in Hawaii.” With no other job prospects, the brothers brainstormed and wrote down 10 ideas for businesses they could start together — including a tent company, and creating kiosks for loading songs onto an iPod. They settled on option No. 3: opening a restaurant. They had no clue about the logistics of running a restaurant, but no doubt that it would center on their favorite food, the Hawaiian plate lunch — a multicultural meal of meat, rice and macaroni salad, a staple of 19th-century sugar-plantation workers who came to Hawaii from countries like Japan and China. The name, Mo’ Bettahs, is Hawaiian Pidgin, a Creole language from the plantations. The Macks’ main source of culinary education was Zippy’s — the popular Hawaii-based fast-casual chain where they worked making plate lunches for two years — as well as their mother, an avid home cook who “fried everything,” Kimo recalled. The brothers worked tirelessly to ensure that their new restaurant looked and felt like their island home. They bought 200 gallons of their favorite soy sauce, Aloha Shoyu, from Hawaii for their teriyaki; they installed a tin roof in one corner and decorated it with surfboards and Hawaii license plates to mimic the look of their grandparents’ house in Kauai. Kalani cooked pound after pound of elbow pasta to perfect the restaurant’s creamy macaroni salad (or “crack salad,” as customers have taken to calling it). But when Mo’ Bettahs opened in the summer of 2008, with the economic downturn in full swing, the brothers were making only $500 a day in sales. “I remember so vividly telling Kimo, ‘How long do you think we can go until we have to pull the plug and cut our losses?’” Kalani said. Around the same time, Facebook was gaining traction, and Kalani’s 15-year-old daughter, Malia, had just created a profile for herself. “I quickly realized, holy smokes, you can reach a lot of people through this,” he said. So Kalani made a profile for Mo’ Bettahs, and soon noticed that there were many Facebook groups for Mormons who had served missions in Polynesia. He started promoting the restaurant through those channels. Mo’ Bettahs was suddenly mobbed with former missionaries eager to give their families and friends a taste of the place where they had spent their most formative years. Mormons, the Macks quickly realized, were their greatest marketing tool. “Mormons are all about supporting their neighbors, and seeing their community succeed,” Kimo said. “I would go as far as to say: You want to be a successful business person here? You need to join the church.” One of those fans is Vince Vernon, who sells commercial insurance and served his mission in Hawaii from 2000 to 2002. Mo’ Bettahs, he said, “took the environment in Hawaii — where everyone is happy to see you, where people are constantly feeding you, where there’s so much food that you cannot see the bottom of the table — and they brought that here.” At one point, Mr. Vernon said, he visited the restaurant every day for six weeks because it reminded him so strongly of his mission experience. “And it’s the best food I have ever had in my life,” he said. “I can’t even begin to describe the endorphin release from that chicken katsu.” Todd Bangerter, a plumber, served his mission in Kaneohe from 2002 to 2004. “I am a redneck hunting guy from Utah, and by the time I left Hawaii, I felt so much like part of the culture,” Mr. Bangerter said. “I really grew up there.” To have a place as true to his memories as Mo’ Bettahs, he said, “all the way in Utah, where the biggest body of water close to the ocean is the Great Salt Lake — it’s amazing.” From his first taste of the macaroni salad, he said, it was like he was back in Hawaii. The Macks quickly became celebrities in local Mormon circles. “It got to the point that when I changed congregations, I walked in and everyone knew who I was,” Kimo said. “They were like, ‘You’re the Mo’ Bettahs guy!’” There is one subset of the local Mormon population that the brothers acknowledge they have not been as successful in wooing: people of Polynesian descent. On a recent afternoon at the original restaurant, a table of teenage Samoan-American girls agreed that the food didn’t have the depth of seasoning they were used to. “It’s good for Utah, but I’ve had Hawaiian barbecue with a lot more flavor,” said one, Charlotte McFarland. “A lot of the cooks here are white, so they don’t know how to season because they didn’t grow up cooking this food. This chicken katsu just tastes fried.” A local Lyft driver from the Philippines who has spent much of his life in Hawaii said the food at Mo’ Bettahs was “not sweet enough” for his tastes. This response doesn’t surprise the Macks. Polynesia has people of so many backgrounds that “everyone makes their food a little differently,” Kalani said. “That’s why we don’t want to rely on that Polynesian audience, because I think so few of them actually eat with us, and those that do are our harshest critics.” Still, business continues to look up. Mo’ Bettahs has opened five more locations in Utah, and the brothers say they are one opening away from making $1 million in sales each month. “I’m an island boy who didn’t go to school, so that’s like, whoa!” Kimo said. In 2017, the Macks entered into a partnership with the Utah restaurant development company Four Foods Group to standardize their business operations and grow the brand nationally. (Four Foods says it holds a 50.1 percent stake in the chain.) Andrew and Shauna Smith, the group’s founders, said they were impressed by the economics of the restaurant. “You get so much food for your money, but the food cost is lower than average in the industry,” Mr. Smith said. There are also not many Hawaiian restaurants in Utah to compete with Mo’ Bettahs. The plan is to open six more Utah locations starting this summer, with a branch in Idaho — which also has a large Mormon population — to follow next year. After that, Mo’ Bettahs plans to expand to states like Nevada and Missouri, in cities where housing costs are low and incomes are high. Four Foods has gotten Mo’ Bettahs onto Instagram and Twitter, and expanded its presence on Facebook, which the Mack brothers had all but stopped using once they realized their fellow Mormons provided a much more powerful social platform. “We’ve got this network of people from all over the world just because of the connectivity of the church,” Kimo said. “They have become our customers, our business partners, our insurance guys, our graphic design team.” It helps that the teriyaki steak inspires devotion, too. “This food is the next big thing,” said Mr. Vernon. “It’s going to be better than Chipotle and Panda Express.” Follow NYT Food on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Pinterest.

2018,"He Ate the World’s Hottest Pepper, Then Landed in the Hospital With ‘Thunderclap’ Headaches","Trilobites If you eat a really hot pepper, you expect pain. A lot of pain. In addition to the feeling that you have just put a live coal in your mouth, you may weep, vomit and wonder where in your life you took a wrong turn. You don’t expect a headache so intense and immediate that it sends you to the emergency room. But that’s what happened to a 34-year-old man who turned up at Bassett Medical Center in Cooperstown, N.Y., with what clinicians call a thunderclap headache. His problems began when he ate a whole Carolina Reaper — the hottest pepper in the world, according to Guinness World Records — while participating in a hot-pepper-eating competition. He immediately started experiencing dry heaves — not unknown in the hot-pepper-eating world. But then a pain in his neck and head came on like … a thunderclap. It passed, but over the next few days he experienced more thunderclap headaches — that’s the clinical term — so he sought medical attention. Scans of his head and neck showed the kind of constriction in some arteries that can cause intense headaches, doctors reported on Monday in BMJ Case Reports. The scientific term for this temporary narrowing of arteries is reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome. Dr. Kulothungan Gunasekaran, one of the report’s authors, now at the Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, said that for some reason the man must have been particularly sensitive to capsaicin. The Carolina Reaper is a popular pepper, and many people eat them and experience nothing worse than the desire to cut out their own tongues. “I was discussing the case with a nurse who had eaten three Carolina Reapers,” Dr. Gunasekaran recalled. The Reaper has been measured at more than two million Scoville heat units, the accepted scale for how hot peppers are. Measurements vary, but a really hot habanero might come in at 500,000 Scoville units. The patient was fine, with no lingering damage, but thunderclap headaches are not to be dismissed. For one thing, there’s the pain, which seems to surpass even the normal effect of the peppers. Dr. Lawrence C. Newman, a neurologist and director of the headache division at NYU Langone Health, said, “On a one to ten scale, it’s off the charts.” And it can indicate the kind of stroke that results from bleeding in the brain. It happens instantaneously. If that kind of headache hits you, it makes sense to seek medical attention “whether you’ve bitten into a pepper or not,” Dr. Newman said. The new study does suggest that capsaicin, being investigated for its role in alleviating pain and lowering blood pressure, can have unexpected effects on certain people. Cayenne pepper pills and a capsaicin patch, sold in China and Turkey, have been blamed in medical reports for two nonfatal heart attacks in young men, the result of spasms in arteries. But “we are not advising anything against the Carolina Reaper,” Dr. Gunasekaran said. The Reaper was bred to reach record levels of heat. Reached by phone at the PuckerButt Pepper Company in Fort Mill, S.C., the Reaper’s creator, Ed Currie, offered mixed advice on pepper consumption. On the one hand, he said, “People who eat whole Reapers are just being stupid.” But Smokin’ Ed, as he calls himself, also gave the impression that wasn’t such a bad thing. “We eat them all the time,” he said, with no ill consequences beyond pain. Mr. Currie indulges in other competitions of suffering. For instance, he said, he had recently taken the Death Nut Challenge, which involves eating insanely hot peanuts. He has a partnership with a company that produces them. “I knew beforehand I shouldn’t do it,” Mr. Currie said. “I was in pain for two hours.” For the average person interested in spice, not suffering, he advised using small amounts of any really hot pepper in food preparation, as they were intended. So if you happen to go beyond your limits — having, say, entered a hot-pepper-eating competition? “Citric acid seems to work the best to alleviate the pain,” he said. “Don’t chug milk because you’ll just throw it up.” An earlier version of this article misstated the journal in which the case was published. It was in BMJ Case Reports, not the British Medical Journal.",The New York Times

Buckel, at 5:30 a.m. Saturday, calling out sick. Twenty-five minutes, later, Mr. Buckel sent him an email: “I apologize for leaving this world early and leaving you with some big challenges to tackle. But I have to at least try to make this planet a better place for having lived on it.” Mr. Buckel, a nationally known civil rights lawyer and, in his final decade, a master composter directing the sprawling site at the Red Hook Community Farm in Brooklyn, set himself on fire around dawn Saturday in Prospect Park. It was, according to his suicide letter, to make a statement about people protecting the environment. Mr. Morales, 26, did not see the email until he finished work on Saturday, where, for five days a week for the last three years, Mr. Buckel was his patient teacher. “I was like, ‘What does this mean? Is he dead?’” Mr. Morales said. Growing up in the Woodrow Wilson Houses in East Harlem, Mr. Morales met Mr. Buckel through a volunteer environmental program and later became a staff member of the site, operated by the Brooklyn Botanic Garden. “He touched a lot of people,” Mr. Morales said. “We didn’t come from privilege, we came from the projects. He was a light in a lot of our lives.” The act of self-immolation was so shocking, the loss so sudden, that friends and family of Mr. Buckel struggled on Sunday to make sense of his legacy, if not his death. “He was very much someone who felt like he always wanted to make sure that while he was alive that he was doing more to make the world a better place,” his partner of nearly 34 years, Terry Kaelber, said. “And he wanted to give more than he was taking from it.” Suicide is, ultimately, ineffable, and experts caution that there is a rarely a single reason people take their own lives; they say there are often underlying issues, such as mental illness. His family and friends acknowledged that Mr. Buckel had become distraught recently over the national politics of climate change — “all that’s going on with the Trump administration and the rollback by Pruitt at the Environmental Protection Agency,” Mr. Kaelber said, referring to agency’s embattled administrator, Scott Pruitt. In retrospect, Mr. Morales said he knew Mr. Buckel had been upset as recently as February when he began discussing articles about the environment, for instance one about how 96 percent of human beings breathe polluted air and another about the Arctic Circle experiencing record breaking temperatures. Mr. Morales said two weeks ago Mr. Buckel sent him an email with all his contacts for the compost site, showing him how to complete paperwork, annual reports and other documents that would need to be turned over to city agencies. With a back injury that limited his work, Mr. Buckel was struggling over what he could do next. Mr. Kaelber said he interpreted this “dramatic act” as “what can a person at age 60 do that people would pay attention to.” Mr. Buckel started his career as a Legal Aid lawyer, and gained national prominence by arguing cases with Lambda Legal, an organization that fights for the civil rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. Mr. Buckel was the lead lawyer in the case in which a Nebraska sheriff was found liable for failing to protect a transgender man who was murdered in Falls City, and was the strategist behind same-sex marriage cases in New Jersey and Iowa. He retired from Lambda Legal in November 2008, and was a grant writer before starting at the composting site at the farm, across from an Ikea store. He felt composting was something that community members could do together to bring about a more sustainable world. Mr. Buckel lived his message. He took showers with a minimum use of water, and walked one hour to work and back from his home at the edge of Prospect Park, rather than use fossil fuels. He refused even to use machines at the composting site, evidence of a passion that friends say was his true fuel. “I think he had a purity of spirit that was not a possibility in this world and that pained him very much,” said Marisa DeDominicis, the executive director of Earth Matter, which composts on Governors Island. Erik Martig went to YouTube to remember his mentor, who had made a series of instructional videos for the tight-knit community of urban composters. In his typical calm and methodical manner, Mr. Buckel explained how to make neat, rat-proof compost piles with pitchforks, shovels and teamwork. “This is the David Buckel that I knew,” said Mr. Martig, 34, who worked with Mr. Buckel at the farm. “I struggle to believe that this is a protest suicide. I think that, underneath, he’s got to be in a very dark place, it’s not characteristic of David,” he added. On a grim Sunday, neighbors gathered at Mr. Buckel’s home. George Bachman, a retired firefighter, would greet him tending his garden on a quiet stretch south of Prospect Park. His 16-year-old daughter knew Mr. Buckel’s college-age daughter, Hannah. He knew the history of Mr. Buckel’s kind of suicide, but was perplexed. “I’m a Vietnam veteran so I’m well aware,” Mr. Bachman said. “Buddhist monks used to light themselves up in protest of the war.” Mr. Buckel alluded in his letter to the self-immolation of Tibetans as protest against China’s government. Tom and Isa Cucinotta of Lefferts Gardens spent a few minutes in silence at the site in Prospect Park where Mr. Buckel died. They did not know him, but they felt a kinship with him and his despair with the current state of the world. “It feels important because he was one of the people able to do something about these injustices. He was successful, whereas we can only do little things,” Ms. Cucinotta said. “It feels like he has given up. What does that mean for the rest of us?”",The New York Times
2018,He Died 21 Years After Being Abused. Prosecutors Are Calling it Murder.,"When a 1-year-old boy was severely assaulted in 1997 in Brunswick County, N.C., his mother and her partner were charged with felony abuse. Both were convicted and sentenced to prison, and were eventually released. The child, then named David Cody Rhinehart, was unable to walk or talk for the rest of his life. Last month, he died at age 22. And this week, the people convicted of abusing him — his biological mother Robyn Noffsinger, 41, and her former partner David Tripp Jr., 45 — were arrested and charged again, this time with first-degree murder. The case is unusual for its time lapse: 21 years between an assault and the death of the victim. The murder charges rest on the argument that the child, whose name was changed to David Elei Stuart after he was adopted, died as a direct result of the abuse he suffered in 1997. Doctors who examined him at the time reported severe injuries, including a head fracture, a split lower lip, spiral fractures in the legs, burns in the diaper area that indicated immersion in a very hot liquid and bruising to the head that “would have required substantial force by squeezing,” court documents show. “Life stopped for David to the extent that he was forever placed in a state of prolonged infancy from which he never emerged,” Jon David, the Brunswick County district attorney, said Tuesday at a news conference announcing the murder charges. Beth Schmitt, who adopted Mr. Stuart in 1999 with her then-partner Lori Elei Stuart, said in an interview this week that he had led a fruitful life despite his limitations. For two decades, she watched him grow. Mr. Stuart, she said, seemed to love music and would smile when he heard it. He grew a thin mustache that Ms. Schmitt did not like. He went to sporting events and played baseball in a league for children with disabilities; a friend would push his wheelchair around the bases. The years after Mr. Stuart’s abuse were often difficult, she said, because of recurring medical emergencies like breathing problems and bouts of pneumonia. But Ms. Schmitt said those years were also a gift, because doctors had told her he might not survive his sixth year. “He was happy despite his challenges, despite the fact that he couldn’t walk, he couldn’t talk,” she said. “He would communicate to us by facial expressions and the noises he would make. He made people aware that life is very precious.” Mr. David praised Ms. Schmitt, 44, and Ms. Stuart, 52, both psychologists in the Raleigh-Durham area of North Carolina. “They provided the best quality of life he could’ve hoped for under the circumstances,” he said. Acknowledging the 21-year gap between the abuse and Mr. Stuart’s death, Mr. David said it was still legally possible to bring homicide charges because North Carolina has no statute of limitations on felonies. He added that it was not uncommon for a murder prosecution to follow an assault prosecution when victims die. The North Carolina Office of the Chief Medical Examiner did not immediately respond to a request for information about the cause of Mr. Stuart’s death. In North Carolina, a first-degree murder conviction can result in a death sentence or life in prison without parole. Mr. Tripp’s lawyer, W. James Payne, said his client “intends to maintain his innocence and defend himself before the court.” A lawyers for Ms. Noffsinger did not respond to requests for comment. The district attorney’s office said Ms. Noffsinger and Mr. Tripp were being held at the Brunswick County Jail on $1 million bail and are scheduled to appear in Brunswick County Superior Court on June 6. Ms. Schmitt said that as she adjusted to life without Mr. Stuart, she wanted to focus on “the good memories, not just the abuse.” “It was a lot of work,” she said of raising him. “But I would do it all over again.”",The New York Times
2018,He Drove a Tesla on Autopilot From the Passenger Seat. The Court Was Not Amused.,"The era of driverless cars is coming down the road. But not quickly enough for one British man, who ran afoul of the law when he was caught in the front passenger seat of a Tesla set to Autopilot, cruising at about 40 miles per hour with his hands behind his head. No one was in the driver’s seat. Witnesses told the police that “traffic was heavy” last May when they saw the nondriver, Bhavesh Patel, 39, of Nottingham, England, in his white Tesla S60 on the M1 motorway near Hemel Hempstead. The police said in a statement that Mr. Patel, who had owned the car for about five months before the stunt, admitted that what he had done was “silly” but said that the car was capable of something “amazing” and that he was just the “unlucky one who got caught.” On April 20, Mr. Patel pleaded guilty to dangerous driving, and a court barred him from driving for 18 months. According to the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire road policing unit, a passenger in another car used a cellphone to record video Mr. Patel cruising by. The police said that Mr. Patel had switched on the car’s semiautonomous driving function while it was in motion, and then hopped into the passenger seat — “leaving the steering wheel and foot controls completely unmanned.” It was not clear how far he traveled that way. The cellphone footage was first posted on social media before it was reported to the police, who sent a “Notice of Intended Prosecution” to Mr. Patel. He was later interviewed at the Stevenage Police Station. The authorities consulted a Tesla engineer who said Autopilot features were “intended to provide assistance to a ‘fully attentive driver.’ ” The investigating constable, Kirk Caldicutt, said: “What Patel did was grossly irresponsible and could have easily ended in tragedy. He not only endangered his own life but the lives of other innocent people using the motorway on that day.” Two drivers have died in the United States in Tesla cars with Autopilot engaged: one in a Model S sedan in Florida in 2016 and the other in a Model X sport utility vehicle in California in March this year. In its investigation into the death in Florida, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration concluded that the crash had not resulted from a flaw in Tesla’s systems, but found that Autopilot lacked safeguards to prevent its misuse. March also saw what was believed to be the first pedestrian death associated with self-driving technology, when a Volvo refitted for autonomous operation by Uber — which had an emergency backup driver behind the wheel — struck and killed a woman on a street in Tempe, Ariz. As for Mr. Patel, who could not be reached for comment on Sunday, St. Albans Crown Court ordered him to complete 100 hours of community service and 10 days of rehabilitation, in addition to the driving ban, and to pay 1,800 pounds — about $2,480 — toward the cost of his prosecution. “This case should serve as an example to all drivers who have access to autopilot controls and have thought about attempting something similar,” Constable Caldicutt added in a statement. “I hope Patel uses his disqualification period to reflect on why he chose to make such a reckless decision.”",The New York Times
2018,He Forced the Vatican to Investigate Sex Abuse. Now He’s Meeting With Pope Francis.,"When I first interviewed Juan Carlos Cruz eight years ago, he was so ashamed about what had happened to him that he was not sure he wanted his name to be public. In his youth in Chile, he had been sexually abused by the Rev. Fernando Karadima, one of Chile’s most prominent priests. The Vatican eventually found the priest guilty and removed him from his post. This week, Mr. Cruz and two other victims of Father Karadima’s will stay at the Vatican in an extended visit with Pope Francis, who issued an extraordinary apology this month for “grave errors” in the handling of sexual abuse cases in Chile. Pope Francis had long defended a Chilean bishop who Father Karadima’s victims said had witnessed and covered up the abuse. After Francis accused the victims of “calumny,” his comments caused an international uproar, and he ordered an investigation. On seeing the results, he apologized to the three Karadima victims, Mr. Cruz, Dr. James Hamilton and Jose Andres Murillo. I spoke with Mr. Cruz, who now lives in Philadelphia, ahead of his trip. This interview has been edited and condensed. Do you accept Pope Francis’ apology? I don’t think that this is a P.R. exercise. I’m looking forward to speaking to him with an open heart, and hearing what he has to say. I am being told he wants me to be completely honest with him. What do you want to get across to him? Mostly, the pain and suffering of so many people, and some people have suffered a lot more than I have. I’ve suffered a lot. But I’ve had friends that have committed suicide. I have to make sure that our case is not treated as an isolated case. It feels like the heaviest backpack you’ve ever carried. For years now you’ve been seen as an opponent of the Church, especially in Chile, where you and your friends accused the bishops of a cover-up. But didn’t you join Father Karadima’s Catholic community in Santiago because you wanted to be a priest? When I joined I was 15, 16. My dad had just died. I was so vulnerable. And I was such a good kid. I wanted to change the world. Since I was a kid I wanted to be a priest. I wanted to die a martyr in Africa if that meant I was going to bring people to God. I had all these dreams. Why did you give that up? There was massive abuse. This man, Father Karadima, was abusing kids and young people from 1958 through 2010 or 11. I was there eight years, in this setting, under his spell. His spell! I know he was pretty powerful in the Chilean church and some of his disciples were made bishops. But you make it sound like he was more than just a regular priest. They called him “Santito,” the saint. Probably he would have been made a saint if people didn’t speak up about the abuse. People saved things that he would give them, because we all expected he was going to be made a saint. If he gave you a book and he signed it, you kept it as a relic. You have insisted that Bishop Juan Barros Madrid and other bishops in Chile who were mentored by Father Karadima were aware of the sexual abuse. But how do you know that they knew? They would witness when Karadima was kissing someone on the lips, or sticking his tongue in someone’s mouth. Or when we were in Karadima’s room, and he would say, now everybody out. Everybody knew what happened after that. But nobody ever spoke about it. How hard was it for you and Jimmy and Jose Andres to decide to sue and take the case public? I remember the first time we met the lawyer, Juan Pablo Hermosilla — I only knew he was a famous attorney who had fought Pinochet, the dictator. He said to me, “I want you to be very sure of what you’re doing, because you’re gay and they’re going to descend on you like you cannot imagine.” And that’s exactly what happened. It got to the point where [Chilean Cardinal] Errázuriz once said I might have liked being molested, so he wasn’t sure I was a victim. It turned out that being gay was the least of my sufferings, because the way they treated all of us was just horrific. And Cardinal Errázuriz — he’s one of the nine cardinals that Pope Francis chose to be on his council of nine advisers? Right. That’s what I want to ask the pope: How could you have George Pell [the Australian cardinal charged with sexual assault] and Francisco Errázuriz on your council? I’m sure there are other cardinals out there who are good people. You have 120 or something to choose from. It sounds like you’re angry at the pope. Are you? There’s been moments that I was. I don’t want to be angry at him and I understand that people make mistakes. But this is the most informed man in the world. That is a question mark for me. Why he didn’t act on it faster or understand the situation faster, and had to put everybody through such pain? Is it true that Pope Francis invited the three of you to stay with him in Casa Santa Marta? I’m going to be there a week. Probably sleeping three doors down from him. He wants to meet individually with each one of us, and he cleared his agenda Sunday to meet with me. But this encounter, as much as I am so honored, it won’t end up in anything if it doesn’t result in concrete actions. And firing a few bishops won’t do the trick. It sounds like you are expecting Pope Francis to fire Bishop Barros for failing to report Father Karadima’s abuse. Well, I’m assuming. What if he doesn’t? It will be a really bad thing. It will be really disappointing, and I mean the biggest disappointment I’ve ever had. Do you think you’re also looking to the pope to be a pastor to you? The pastor that Father Karadima failed to be? Probably. Because I have an image of the pope that no matter how shattered my image of him is, he’s the pope. I hope we all get some kind of healing out of this, for ourselves.",The New York Times
2018,"He Inhaled Mustard Agent in Iraq, but the Navy Denied Him a Purple Heart","At War The improvised explosive device that Petty Officer Third Class Jeremiah Foxwell approached in September 2006 resembled hundreds of others he had destroyed in and around Baghdad. On the ground was a damaged artillery shell that had been ejected by a roadside blast. Brown crystals around its nose looked like a homemade explosive that local insurgents often used. Foxwell’s orders were to remove old shells from the battlefield. He prepared to lift the munition and carry it to his truck. “I stood it upright and basically got a face full of fumes,” he said. In that moment, Foxwell unwittingly became the Navy’s first known chemical-warfare casualty in Iraq after the 2003 invasion. The weapon in his hands was an aging mustard shell. Within hours of exposure, Foxwell sought treatment for dry eyes, dried blood in his nose and chest tightness. He was admitted to the base’s clinic for 24-hour observation. Symptoms of mustard-agent exposure can take a day or more to fully appear. Two days after the incident, Foxwell went back to the clinic with chest pain, difficulty breathing and “raw openings of skin” inside his nose. Despite his symptoms, he was returned to duty within days. So began a long journey into a medical and administrative bureaucracy within the Defense Department that made repeated errors in handling his case. Foxwell’s wounds were first reported by The New York Times in 2014 in an investigation that found that American service members and Iraqi police officers had been wounded by aging chemical weapons, manufactured in the 1980s and abandoned during or after the Iran-Iraq war. The investigation noted that the military failed to follow its own medical protocols and did not track the health of almost all the exposed troops. In Foxwell’s case, he did not receive the required blood or urine test to confirm chemical exposure, despite a note in his record from a physician who treated him acknowledging “chemical vapors — mustard gas” from a “terrorist chemical weapon.” Following The Times’ report, Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel ordered the services to look into the cases of exposed veterans and open a search for others. A Pentagon review eventually uncovered several hundred troops who had come forward since 2003 to report that they may have been exposed to chemical agents. In a letter to the chairman of the House Committee on Veterans Affairs, Hagel vowed to make sure that potentially exposed troops were cared for and that any injuries related to combat service were recognized. But in late 2016, two years after submitting evidence of his exposure, Foxwell, who left the service in 2008, was turned down by the Navy for a Purple Heart, the medal awarded to troops wounded by enemy action. In an email, a Navy official offered Foxwell insight into the service’s thinking: After thorough review of your record and assessment of the medical and legal departments, the awarding authority finds that the wound you sustained was not so severe that it required treatment by a medical officer at the time of the injury. There are [sic] also no evidence that the enemy triggered the projectile to begin leaking, or otherwise caused the leaking fluid to come into contact with you. You were not forced into contact with the leaking projectile due to enemy action but rather travelled as part of a team to a weapons cache secured and held by U.S. forces, where you proceeded to voluntarily inspect the projectiles. This statement appears to be wrong on several important points. First, Foxwell’s medical records show that he was evaluated and treated by a medical officer — an Army lieutenant colonel at the 704th Support Battalion medical clinic at Forward Operating Base Falcon, south of Baghdad. (The records further show that the clinic did not follow medical-care protocols put in place by the Army in 2004 for chemical casualties, which mandated care immediately upon exposure, and then specific and substantial follow-up evaluations regardless of whether symptoms worsened.) Second, Foxwell was not responding to a weapons cache. He was responding to the blast site of a pair of I.E.D.s, which insurgents had detonated against another patrol shortly before. He did not volunteer to inspect a projectile. Foxwell was there to render the devices safe, remove or dispose of any remaining threats and collect evidence — standard tasks for explosive ordnance disposal techs during the war. Third, Foxwell was wounded by fumes released from the munition when he first picked it up; he did not come in contact with the “leaking fluid.” Foxwell did not immediately recognize that it was a chemical warhead because, on the exterior, it looked identical to the high-explosive shells commonly used in I.E.D.s in Iraq at the time. The disposal team only discovered the leaking fluid after Foxwell inhaled the vapors, which prompted them to test it for chemical agents. Last, the mustard agent was released by the insurgents, which had triggered the devices against the patrol that called for assistance. Navy officials declined to discuss the specifics of Foxwell’s case with The Times but did say that “approval of the award would have been inconsistent with past practices and standards.” They also said that not a single sailor who was evaluated for potential exposure has received a Purple Heart. As of June 2015, nearly 400 sailors had been processed for screening, according to a Defense Department report that The Times acquired from a Navy official not authorized to speak on the record. In Foxwell’s case, the denial seems arbitrary when the circumstances are compared with the regulations. Under Defense Department criteria, service members “wounded in action” to include “all effects of gases and like chemical and biological warfare agents” and “requiring treatment by a medical officer” can be awarded a Purple Heart. Additional procedures — developed by the Office of the Secretary of Defense and the military branches to ensure “thorough and fair consideration” — are in place for service members wounded by chemical agents in Iraq, Navy officials told The Times. But these Purple Heart eligibility assessments are handled at the service level and are subject to interpretation by administrative review boards. In practice, this means the branches may still make different and potentially inconsistent decisions on nearly identical incidents. For instance, in 2015, months after Hagel called for a review, the Army awarded a Purple Heart to a soldier exposed to mustard agent in 2007 while clearing a mustard-filled artillery shell from an I.E.D. site near Taji, Iraq. Foxwell said he still suffers from medical problems resulting from inhaling mustard agent. A lesion in his sinus behind one eye has been irritating the optical nerve and causing double vision. “I wasn’t given a fair shake,” he said, adding that the Navy’s awards board, as evidenced by the errors in its official reply to him, “was ignorant as to the context of the situation.”",The New York Times
2018,He Killed a Red Cross Worker: ‘I Will Go to Hell for What I Did’,"Why did an Afghan polio patient shoot a Spanish physiotherapist in the heart last year? The motive is still a mystery. Mohammad Nasim, who since the age of 2 had been treated for polio at the Red Cross orthopedic center in Mazar-i-Sharif, Afghanistan, killed a therapist there in September. “I don’t know what made me do this,” he said from prison.CreditCreditThe New York Times MAZAR-I-SHARIF, Afghanistan — Mohammad Nasim knew he would not be searched at the gates of the International Committee of the Red Cross orthopedic center because he was a polio patient who had been going there for 19 years. “They did not imagine I could do something like this,” he said. So he made no special effort to hide the Russian-made Tokarev semiautomatic pistol — just tucked it under the shirt of his shalwar kameez and rolled himself down the main corridor in his wheelchair. Lorena Enebral Perez, a physiotherapist from Spain who had started working there a few days before, stepped into the corridor, headed for the 10 a.m. tea break. She had just finished a session with children; pediatric physiotherapy was her passion. Mr. Nasim went right up to her in his chair. He says he did not know who she was, but guessed — incorrectly — that she was the center’s director. He pulled the pistol out and, without a word, shot her in the heart at nearly point blank range. “I lost my control. I wasn’t able to think properly,” he said in a recent interview conducted by telephone from the prison in Mazar-i-Sharif, the northern city where the orthopedic center is located. It was Mr. Nasim’s first interview since he shot Ms. Enebral on Sept. 11 and a lawyer who was present verified his identity. “I came to my senses and I thought, ‘What did I do?’ because I am a full polio victim and need this center more than anybody,” Mr. Nasim said. “No one suffered from this more than I did.” Ms. Enebral, 38, had been working for Red Cross orthopedic centers around Afghanistan for a year and before that had held similar jobs in Malawi, Ethiopia and Tanzania. “The relationship Lorena had with children was magic,” her colleagues wrote in a tribute later. “Whenever Lorena was around, the environment was radiant.” Mr. Nasim’s attack put at risk a treasured institution run by the Red Cross for nearly three decades, serving thousands of the war wounded in northern Afghanistan. Not only was the orthopedic center closed for two months after the killing, but the agency is now looking to transfer it to another group if it can find one willing to take it over. Mr. Nasim struggled to explain what he had done and why. First, he described it as an impulsive act. But he had brought the gun to Mazar-i-Sharif from his home in Baghlan Province two days before the shooting, which would have required smuggling it past numerous checkpoints along the way. Then he claimed the Taliban had forced him to do it, threatening to kill his family if he did not. The Taliban vehemently denied that, praising the work the Red Cross does. In a separate interview, Mr. Nasim’s own father, Amin Jan, scoffed at his son’s claim and disowned him. “I don’t know what made me do this,” Mr. Nasim said. He is far from the only Afghan to have killed a foreigner with no apparent provocation. In 2014, a police officer killed an Associated Press photographer. Another killed three Americans at a hospital. Both told investigators they did not know why they had done it. Neither had any known Taliban or insurgent connections; nor did Mr. Nasim. While his motivations are murky, Mr. Nasim makes no effort to deny his guilt. “I will go to hell for what I did,” he said. “I should just be killed.” Mr. Nasim has yet to be tried on the murder and terrorism charges he faces. Afghanistan has the death penalty and often uses it. He has already paid a price. Mr. Nasim shares a cell in the Mazar-i-Sharif prison with 40 others. One of his orthotic braces fell off during his arrest and was left behind, as was his wheelchair. In prison, his other brace broke. “Now I am not able to walk any more,” he said. “I just go around on my hands.” He said he would not ask the Red Cross to fix his braces or return his wheelchair. “I am too ashamed,” he said. Another prisoner had to carry him on his back a short distance from his cell to the prison’s telephone office for the interview. Mr. Nasim said he was less worried about his own condition than about the Red Cross center’s future. “I would be ready to die to keep that center open now,” he said. “No one knows more than me how much we are helpless without them.” Last year, 19,000 people were treated in the Mazar-i-Sharif facility, one of seven Red Cross orthopedic centers around the country. Many of the patients are victims of four decades of war and a landscape riddled with bombs and land mines. Others simply need treatment in a country with poor health care. Mr. Nasim insisted he had no complaints about his treatment at the center. “The people in this center were like my second mother and father,” he said. They made and fitted him with orthotic braces on both legs, taught him to walk short distances and coached him through physiotherapy. They built and customized a wheelchair for him to use for longer distances. The day before he shot Ms. Enebral, he arrived at the center to have his orthotic braces repaired and adjusted and to get his wheelchair checked, as he had been doing since age 2. He is 21 now. Atiqullah Attiq, a technician who, like most of the center’s staff, is himself disabled, did the orthotics adjustments for Mr. Nasim that day and noticed nothing out of the ordinary about his behavior. “I personally treated him for two years,” said Ahmad Khalid Wahidi, a physiotherapist at the center. “How he could do this, I don’t know.” On Sept. 11, the door between Mr. Attiq’s workshop and the corridor was open. He heard the gunshot and turned to see Ms. Enebral staggering toward him. “She came in and was holding her hands on her chest and there was blood everywhere and she was crying, ‘Ahh! Ahh!’ and fell down dead,” he said. Afterward, he said, he heard Mr. Nasim shout “God is great.” Mr. Wahidi, who arrived at that moment, said he heard the same thing. Mr. Nasim denied saying that, and he said he surrendered immediately. “After firing, I was very agitated,” he said. “I don’t remember anything. I just dropped the gun.” Mr. Wahidi, however, said Mr. Nasim’s gun jammed when he pointed it and tried to fire at someone else and he then fled in his wheelchair while trying to unjam it. Finally, a relative of a patient jumped on him and overpowered him, knocking the gun away. Mr. Nasim described himself as a devoutly religious man. He had studied in Islamic madrasas, where he managed to memorize the entire Quran, in its original Arabic. Like most Afghans, Mr. Nasim does not speak or understand Arabic. Afghans who achieve that feat of memorization spend years doing it and are rewarded with a special place in society, the title “qari,” and are often exempted from work and supported by donations from admirers. Mr. Nasim was asked whether his study of the Quran had shaped his views on killing an unarmed civilian in cold blood. “I don’t know the meaning of the Quran. I can just recite it,” he said, then laughed. “I don’t know what the Quran says about such an act, but I know the act was something bad.” Many of the patients at the orthopedic center were angry at him and fearful about their future. “If this place weren’t here, we would just be like a dead body,” said Dur Mohammed, 45, a big man who lost a leg to a mortar shell and now works for an advocacy group for the disabled. “If I were here when it happened, he wouldn’t have left this place alive,” he added. “He just did that because she wasn’t a Muslim.” Zakirullah Rahim, 35, a regular patient who comes for physiotherapy for a spinal injury and who overlapped with Mr. Nasim over the years, said: “Only an idiot would do what he did. She was a foreigner, but she was helping us. So she was not a Muslim, but she was helping Muslims.” Mr. Nasim agreed. “How can I be proud of killing someone who is serving us?” he said.",The New York Times
2018,He Played at Death in a Gaza Cemetery. Then He Was Buried There.,"JABALIYA, Gaza Strip — He lay down among the tombstones in a cemetery beside his grandfather’s house, his cousin said, in what passes for child’s play in the grim reality of Gaza. Telling his cousin he hoped to be buried there, he scooped up piles of sand as if digging his own grave. The boy, Muhammad Ayoub, then sneaked off on Friday, disobeying his mother, to join the weekly protest along the fence dividing Gaza from Israel. Shot through the head by an Israeli sniper, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, he was buried in the same small graveyard that night. The Israeli military said it was examining his death. Muhammad’s relatives and the Gaza health authorities initially said he was 15; his identity card showed that he turned 14 two months ago. His mother said he had wanted to be a “shahid,” Arabic for martyr, since kindergarten, even before he understood what that meant. Muhammad’s world was circumscribed on one side by the Mediterranean Sea, where he liked to swim at dawn, and by the borders with Israel and Egypt, largely sealed for most of the two million residents of the Palestinian coastal territory, which is run by Hamas, the militant Islamic group. But his death has intensified international attention and censure over Israel’s handling of the protests that began on March 30, both because of his age and because it was caught on graphic video. It has also been widely covered in Israel and has created some unease among the public, which has widely supported the military’s actions on the border. Criticizing the military for not expressing regret about the killing, the military affairs correspondent of the Maariv newspaper, Tal Lev Ram, wrote in a commentary on Sunday: “The death of a Palestinian teenager, hostile as he may be, must not find us indifferent and unresponsive. Indifference in this case is first and foremost our own loss.” Isolated and impoverished, plagued by chronic electricity shortages and hardships exacerbated by Palestinian infighting, Gaza has bred a young generation that lives without hope. Critics have long accused Hamas of cultivating a death cult, and say it is now trying to deflect the Gaza residents’ growing anger away from itself and toward Israel. “But Hamas cannot drag young people out of bed at gunpoint and shuttle them to the borders to dance to its tune,” Muhammad Shehada, a writer and civil society activist from the Gaza Strip, wrote of the protests in the Haaretz newspaper this month. “Was it not for the misery inflicted by Gaza’s status quo, no one would show up for that date with death.” Muhammad’s father, Ibrahim Ayoub, 40, said on Saturday that his son was innocent. He spoke from the mourning tent outside the family’s single-story home with a corrugated metal roof in the hardscrabble Jabaliya refugee camp in northern Gaza. “Even if he touched the fence, he was peaceful,” he said, adding that his son had not been throwing stones or holding a weapon. Basel Ayoub, 18, the cousin who was with Muhammad at the cemetery and recounted the scene there, saw him again at the protest site around the time he was killed. Both Basel and another cousin who was there, Muhammad Hamouda Ayoub, 29, said Muhammad had been sitting on the ground with other boys, then got up and ran to escape clouds of tear gas, when he was shot. Over the past four Fridays, at least three dozen Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire along the Gaza frontier while protesting, sometimes violently, the 11-year blockade of the territory. The protesters are also pressing for Palestinians’ return to lands in what is now Israel. The Gaza Health Ministry has recorded three other minors among the dead. One was 17, another 15 and a third a few days short of his 14th birthday. Hundreds of other people have been injured. Israel says it is acting to secure its border against any mass breach of the fence and to prevent terrorist attacks under the cover of the protests against its soldiers and nearby Israeli communities. The military has warned protesters to stay away from the fence, saying it will not allow them to endanger its soldiers or damage security infrastructure by hurling rocks, burning tires, throwing firebombs or cutting the wire. The military said on Saturday that it was examining all of the reported deaths. It accused Hamas, which has thrown its weight behind the protests, of placing women and children on the front line and “using them as a ‘human shield’ for the realization of its goals.” Over the weekend, the military revised its initial estimate of the number of participants in Friday’s protest, raising it from 3,000 to about 10,000 by the day’s end. That is still a significantly lower turnout than the 30,000 to 40,000 who came to the five protest sites on March 30, when the campaign began. Coming as Israel celebrates its 70th anniversary, the protest campaign has touched one of the country’s most sensitive nerves. Dubbed the “Great Return March,” the campaign is expected to peak on May 15 when Palestinians mark what they call the Nakba, or the catastrophe, of Israel’s foundation and the 1948 war over its creation, during which hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were expelled from their homes. One of six siblings ranging in age from 3 to 17, Muhammad grew up in the alleyways of the Jabaliya refugee camp with refugees and their descendants from al-Faluja, a former Palestinian village less than 20 miles northeast of Gaza. He had already lived through three wars. Muhammad’s father worked for the Western-backed Palestinian Authority security forces before Hamas routed them during factional fighting more than a decade ago. Hamas officials came to pay condolences after Muhammad’s death, but left after a few minutes amid an altercation with supporters of Fatah, the rival Palestinian group, whose flags adorned the family’s mourning tent. His mother, Raida Ayoub, 39, said her husband had taken Muhammad and his two brothers to the protest on the first two Fridays. They skipped the third, scared off by the Israeli warnings. This Friday, too, she told him not to go, fearing for his safety, and took him to his grandfather’s house instead. But after playing outside there, he met an aunt and told her to tell his mother he was going to the protest “just for one hour.” In the video of his killing, panicked voices can be heard shouting that he has been shot in the head. Others immediately proclaim him a “shahid.” A few hours later, he was in the ground.",The New York Times
2018,"He Saw a Future Right Away. She Did, Too (Post Lasik Surgery).","Mini-Vows Kate Ann Wood and Steven Kent Gryskiewicz are to be married April 29 at Castlemartyr, a hotel in County Cork, Ireland. Teresa Graham, a humanist celebrant, is to officiate. The couple met at the University of Pennsylvania, from which each received an M.B.A. The bride, 33, is a managing director of Goldman Sachs in New York. She graduated from Boston University. She is a daughter of Nancy E. Wood and James F. Wood of Hudson, Ohio. The bride’s father is the director of the United States-China Clean Energy Research Center, Advanced Coal Technology Consortium at West Virginia University. He is the former deputy assistant secretary at the Department of Energy. Her mother is a licensed instrument-rated private pilot in Hudson. The groom, who is 35 and known as Kent, is a digital expert associate partner at McKinsey & Company in New York. He graduated from George Washington University with two bachelor’s degrees, one in political science and the other in sociology. He is a son of Nur D. Gryskiewicz and Stanley S. Gryskiewicz of Alexandria, Va. The groom’s parents are industrial organizational psychologists. His mother, who has a private practice in Alexandria, is an executive coach serving both public and private sector clients. His father is a founding member of the Center for Creative Leadership in Greensboro, N.C. He is also the board chair and founder of the Association for Managers of Innovation. While pursuing master’s degrees at Wharton in January 2014, Ms. Wood and Mr. Gryskiewicz went about the business of trying to get each other’s attention. At the time, they were both working full-time jobs, she in New York and he in Washington, and would meet at school every other week when attending classes. “She was amazing and beautiful,” he said, “and as soon as I heard her speak I knew that she was much smarter than me, and that was the number one thing that attracted me to her.” Mr. Gryskiewicz had rotated into Ms. Woods’s section of the core curriculum shortly after their first year at Wharton. “I remember thinking ‘where did this handsome guy come from?’” Ms. Woods said. As it turned out, they had a number of mutual friends, which made it easier to begin talking to each other, first during online group chats, and then one on one. “He left a lot of voice mail messages,” Ms. Wood said. “Some funny, some sweet — all romantic.” In March 2014, Ms. Wood awoke in her home on the morning after having Lasik eye surgery and discovered a text message from Mr. Gryskiewicz. She opened it to find a photo of Mr. Gryskiewicz holding up two fingers. Below the photo he wrote: “How many fingers am I holding up?” Mr. Gryskiewicz’s text became a seminal moment in their budding relationship, as she began to see quite clearly that he was an “extremely thoughtful and selfless man.” “It was very sweet,” she said of the text. “A couple of my girlfriends had sent flowers, but I wasn’t expecting anything like that from Kent, it was really cute.” They grew closer in the ensuing weeks, and in May, they went on a first date in Manhattan, where they had dinner and went to see the Broadway show “Of Mice and Men.” “One of the first things I noticed at dinner was how much of a gentlemen he was,” Ms. Wood said. Mr. Gryskiewicz did his fair share of noticing as well. “Not only was she gorgeous, but she just had this comfortable way of talking to me that made it seem as if we were old friends.” They began dating long distance, and in January 2015, Mr. Gryskiewicz got his current job in New York so that he could be closer to Ms. Wood. “Kate made me realize that life is meant to go through with someone,” Mr. Gryskiewicz said, “and I knew in my heart that she was that someone.”",The New York Times
2018,He Says He’s an Innocent Victim. Robert Mueller Says He’s a Spy.,"The Saturday Profile KIEV, Ukraine — The man sat at a restaurant table, grasping a glass of white wine. His sandy hair was close cropped, he wore a cardigan sweater and in the afternoon bustle he looked like just another office worker at lunch. While seated, the most notable element of his appearance was hardly noticeable; only when he stood to introduce himself did it become clear that he is short, almost childlike, in stature, a characteristic that earned him the nickname “the midget” from Russian political operatives. He spoke flawless English, with only a touch of an accent, was gregarious, and casually brushed aside the main question in this rare interview in Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, a year or so ago, saying that of course he was not a Russian spy. Yet in Washington these days, the man, Konstantin V. Kilimnik, has turned up in multiple court filings by the special prosecutor, Robert S. Mueller III, who identifies him as Person A. Just this week, for example, a Dutch lawyer was sentenced to a month in prison for lying to the F.B.I. about, among other things, his communications with Person A. And last week, Mr. Mueller turned over a card in the investigation into the Trump campaign’s possible collusion with Russia by asserting in a court document that this person “has ties to a Russian intelligence service” and was in contact with a senior member of the campaign, Rick Gates, during the 2016 election. “The Federal Bureau of Investigation special agents assisting the Special Counsel’s Office assess that Person A has ties to a Russian intelligence service and had such ties in 2016,” the filing said. As Person A, Mr. Kilimnik, a 47-year-old former Russian military interpreter, has appeared now in multiple court filings by the special prosecutor, which suggests that he could become a pivotal figure in the investigation. For about a decade, he worked as an office manager in Kiev for the political consulting business of Paul Manafort, acting as a go-between and fixer for the American and the Russian-leaning politicians who were its clients. The Russian government has denied meddling in the 2016 election and President Trump has denied collusion by members of his campaign staff. But during the years that Mr. Manafort worked in Ukraine, the country was deeply penetrated by Russian intelligence agents. While Mr. Kilimnik continues to deny that he was a Russian agent, it would have been perfectly normal for Moscow to plant someone in the Manafort operation. Konstantin Viktorovich Kilimnik was born in eastern Ukraine in the Soviet period. He studied at the Military Institute of the Ministry of Defense in Moscow, and after the Soviet breakup took Russian citizenship, he said in the interview. The institute trains interpreters for the Russian military intelligence agency, formerly known as the G.R.U. and now called the Main Directorate. He worked for a time in Sweden as an interpreter for a Russian company that exported arms, and later in the Moscow office of the International Republican Institute, a Washington-based nonprofit, where former employees said they suspected he was informing on them to the Russian authorities. He parted ways with the organization, a former employee of the Moscow office said, after the chief of the F.S.B., the successor agency to the K.G.B., talked in a speech about the private meetings of the institute’s officials. They didn’t have evidence, but suspected Mr. Kilimnik had been the source, said the former official, who could not be cited publicly discussing personnel issues. In the interview, Mr. Kilimnik said he had been dismissed for having taken work on the side as an interpreter for Mr. Manafort in Ukraine in the early 2000s. It is not known whether Mr. Manafort, a longtime consultant to Republican politicians, was aware of the suspicions of the institute’s managers when he hired Mr. Kilimnik in 2005. Mr. Manafort’s business in Ukraine was registered in Mr. Kilimnik’s name. Mr. Manafort’s former client President Viktor F. Yanukovych was deposed in 2014, and Mr. Kilimnik said he stopped working for Mr. Manafort that year. In August of 2016, Mr. Kilimnik was formally investigated in Ukraine on suspicion of ties to Russian spy agencies, according to documents from Parliament and the Prosecutor General’s Office, but no charges were filed. A Ukrainian lawmaker, Volodymyr I. Ariev, who requested the investigation, said Mr. Kilimnik’s background in military intelligence deserved scrutiny. “He was a student of a military school in Russia,” Mr. Ariev said. “Everybody in the former Soviet Union knows what that means. They produce professional spies.” In person, though, Mr. Kilimnik has been surprisingly nonchalant about the suspicions swirling around his past and role in the 2016 campaign. He said he was never contacted by investigators in Ukraine and called the probe politically motivated. “If there were any truth to me talking to any security service in the world, they would arrest me,” he said, speaking of Ukrainian law enforcement. Before the United States election, Mr. Kilimnik said, he and Mr. Manafort had spoken “every couple of months,” at a time when Mr. Manafort served as chairman of the Trump campaign, but he said there was nothing to hide in the calls and meetings. The two mostly discussed Ukrainian politics, not the election, he said: “I was briefing him on Ukraine.” The filing last week by the special counsel’s office asserted that Mr. Kilimnik had communicated with Mr. Gates late during the 2016 campaign, and that Mr. Gates was aware of Mr. Kilimnik’s background in Russian intelligence. The filing was notable for touching on Mr. Gates’s activities during the campaign. He has pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. and conspiring to defraud the United States for activities related to his work in Ukraine mostly before joining the Trump campaign, and agreed to cooperate with the investigation. Mr. Gates’s communications with Mr. Kilimnik were revealed in the sentencing documents of a former lawyer for the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, Alex van der Zwaan, who pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. about his interactions with Mr. Kilimnik and with Mr. Gates. Mr. Kilimnik also played a role in a reported effort by Mr. Manafort to contact a Russian oligarch, Oleg V. Deripaska, during the campaign. Mr. Manafort and Mr. Kilimnik had cooperated on an ultimately unsuccessful business venture financed by Mr. Deripaska, known as the Pericles investment fund. In July, 2016, while Mr. Manafort was chairman of the Trump campaign, Mr. Manafort emailed Mr. Kilimnik asking him to offer Mr. Deripaska “private briefings” about the campaign in exchange for resolving a multimillion dollar financial dispute related to the business, according to The Washington Post. Mr. Deripaska has said he never received the offer. Mr. Kilimnik, reached by email, declined to comment on this matter and the special counsel’s court filings. Mr. Kilimnik has surfaced as a fringe figure in other aspects of the Russian investigation. Rinat Akhmetshin, a Russian-American lobbyist who attended a Trump Tower meeting with Donald Trump Jr. in June of 2016 where a Russian lawyer had promised to provide negative information on Hillary Clinton, had also worked in Ukraine with Mr. Kilimnik closely enough to know his nickname among Russian-leaning political operatives in Kiev. At the time, about eight years ago, Mr. Akhmetshin was trying to persuade political advisers of Mr. Yanukovych to buy the rights to a book that cast a domestic political opponent in a negative light, and attended meetings with Mr. Kilimnik. In the interview last year, Mr. Kilimnik said he divided his time between Kiev, where he worked, and Moscow, where his wife and two daughters lived in the suburb of Khimki. In a court filing last year, Mr. Mueller asserted that Mr. Kilimnik was now based in Russia. In email exchanges over the past year, Mr. Kilimnik has declined to say where he is. “I do not want to be part of the U.S. political games and I am not,” Mr. Kilimnik wrote in an email last year. “I am simply a random casualty because of my proximity to Paul,” he said, referring to Mr. Manafort. Asked in the interview about the allegation of ties to Russian intelligence agencies, Mr. Kilimnik said, “I vehemently deny it.”",The New York Times
2018,"He Wanted to Escape His Childhood. Now, It Fuels His Art.","The Saturday Profile MONTREAL — If Xavier Dolan could direct a film about his life, he says, the opening scene would show the first encounter between his headstrong and emotional Quebecer mother and his Egyptian-born womanizing father, at a bohemian bar in Montreal where his mother had gone to hear his father sing. This being a Dolan production, there is a good chance the mother would be overbearing, vulnerable and exquisitely made up. The camera would zoom in unforgivingly. The emotions would be volcanic, and ecstasy would soon give way to agony, accompanied by the frenetic beats of a music video. His parents’ marriage ended when Mr. Dolan was 2 and a half years old. By the time he was 8, his mother, unable to cope with her hyperactive son, sent him to boarding school in rural Quebec, where the young gay boy was mercilessly bullied and where, in turn, he tormented others. He found refuge in Hollywood films like “Titanic” and “Mrs. Doubtfire,” along with the psychodrama of kitsch American sitcoms. Today, Mr. Dolan — celebrated actor and director, Louis Vuitton model, voice-over artist (he provided the voice of Ron Weasley in the French Canadian versions of the “Harry Potter” movies), darling of the Cannes Film Festival, former child star and art-house cinema wunderkind — says the fuel for his art is his lost childhood. He has directed seven films. He is 29. “I wanted to get out of childhood as soon as possible and escape it, and now that I’m making movies, I’m chasing it,” he said during an eight-hour interview that had all the intensity of a Dolan film, accented by allusions to Proust and a heavy snowfall outside. It began at Montreal’s opulent St. James Hotel before migrating to his handsome Edwardian house, which, he notes, channels the red chinoiserie of Diana Vreeland’s lush New York apartment. “What I have been feasting on all these years is nostalgia — a nostalgia for the childhood that I didn’t end up having,” he added. Waiflike and compact, wearing a hoodie and with a tattoo of Dumbledore (of “Harry Potter” fame) on his left arm, Mr. Dolan peppers his sentences in English with words like “prolix” and “epistolary,” and only occasionally switches into French to emphasize a point. He used part of his earnings as a child star to take Berlitz classes in English. Even early on, he said, he realized that if he was going to conquer Hollywood, he would need to speak fluent English. In person, Mr. Dolan is at once intense and cerebral, funny and self-deprecating. He has sometimes been pilloried as impish and arrogant, and he bristles at being labeled an “enfant terrible,” as he often is. It is perhaps an occupational hazard for a director who has been variously compared to Alfred Hitchcock, Woody Allen and the poet Arthur Rimbaud. He made his first film, “I Killed My Mother,” a Freudian-tinged, semi-autobiographical film about a gay teenager who clashes with his mother, after he dropped out of college at 17. As one producer after the other rejected it, he scraped together money from his child-acting gigs to make the film himself, at age 20, eventually winning international acclaim. When he later noted wryly that Orson Welles, who made “Citizen Kane” at 25, was a “late bloomer,” the critics pounced, and he turned to Twitter to explain that he had been joking. “I’m a big mouth. People can dislike me and think I’m a narcissistic brat,” he said. “But one thing no one can ever take away from me is that I’ve always spoken my mind, and I have always been true to myself.” As we meet, he is the subject of a social media storm over his decision to cut the American star Jessica Chastain from his soon-to-be released film, “The Death and Life of John F. Donovan,” his first English-language film. The movie focuses on an 11-year-old boy and his unlikely correspondence with a closeted actor that is contorted into scandal. (When he was 9 years old, Mr. Dolan wrote a letter to Leonardo DiCaprio, requesting a meeting. He got the address wrong, and it is now framed in Mr. Dolan’s house.) In the deeply moving film, shot in London, Montreal, New York and Prague, the boy, now a grown man, tells a hard-bitten journalist about how Donovan, torn between fame and personal fulfillment, had changed his life. The original cut of the movie, which stars Kathy Bates, Natalie Portman and Susan Sarandon, and has added cultural resonance in the #MeToo era, was more than four hours long. Eliminating Ms. Chastain, he says, was predicated solely on her character no longer fitting the story line. “People are saying: How can you cut someone so famous?” he said. “To me, that’s an insult to her talent.” Born in Montreal, Mr. Dolan was raised by his single mother, Geneviève, a college administrator with Irish roots. He began appearing in commercials for a drugstore chain at the age of 4, and by the time he was 6 he was a child star, appearing in movies, television shows and commercials. Mr. Dolan’s films, a cri de coeur for tolerance, are invariably populated by outcasts and underdogs, a reflection, he says, of his own feelings of not belonging. When he was 8, he recalled, a bully on a bike plowed over him in the schoolyard. “At that moment, I decided that my world was in the movies and in the shows,” he said. “Anywhere but real life.” He remembered a kindly headmaster letting him escape bullies by allowing him to watch his beloved American sitcoms in an empty dormitory. Later, he added, the headmaster, who was accused of pedophilia, killed himself. After Mr. Dolan was catapulted to cinematic fame with “I Killed My Mother,” he made a raft of French-language films, including “Laurence Anyways,” an ill-fated love story featuring a transgender schoolteacher. In his most critically acclaimed movie, “Mommy,” which shared the Jury Prize at Cannes in 2014, a mother played by his muse, the Quebecer actress Anne Dorval, tries to tame her violent son. Unifying nearly all of his films are strong-willed but vulnerable female characters who provide succor to emotionally wounded sons. “I was brought up by women. I never had a father figure,” Mr. Dolan said. “Of course, there is a part of my mother in these strong women, and of course, there is a part of me.” While his films can divide critics, they seldom leave the viewer indifferent. His last film, “It’s Only the End of the World,” about a gay man who comes home to his family in rural France to tell them that he is dying, was booed at Cannes in 2016, but won the Grand Prix. More than a year later, Mr. Dolan is still smarting from the eviscerating criticism (the film, with A-list French actors such as Marion Cotillard, is hard to watch, and it deals an emotional body blow, with characters who brutally turn on one another). “I still feel scared to disappoint people and to be criticized or mocked,” he reflects. “I wasn’t like that before.” Mr. Dolan admits that his romantic life has been largely devoid of longer-term relationships because he tends to be attracted to unattainable heterosexual men. His latest crush is Canada’s prime minister, Justin Trudeau. In the same way, he said, he really made friends only in his late 20s, after an adolescence consumed by work. “The love stories that I have found that are reciprocal are in movies,” he said, with more than a hint of wistfulness. His next film, “Matt and Max,” recounts the story of two heterosexual male 20-somethings who share a kiss, and the impact it has on their lives. After a slew of thoughtful films with gay themes, such as “Call Me by Your Name” and “God’s Own Country,” Mr. Dolan said he wanted to reflect on unrequited love — his unrequited love. As I am leaving, he suddenly stops me and looks me in the eye. “I don’t want you to think my parents were monsters,” he said. “My childhood really wasn’t that bad.” video",The New York Times
2018,He Won $1 Million to Make a Movie. Then the Problems Set in.,"One evening this month, Faraday Okoro was sitting in a sound studio in Chelsea, putting the final touches on his first feature film. Onscreen, one of the main characters had just picked up a beaded necklace, and Mr. Okoro, leaning back into his chair with a can of seltzer in his hand, was questioning whether the rattle of the beads could be heard clearly enough. In front of him, a sound engineer pressed pause, punched a series of commands into a keyboard, and played the scene again. The beads were louder. Mr. Okoro nodded. “I think it’s good,” he said softly, and sipped from the can. Mr. Okoro, 31, was impressively calm. He had just days before the film needed to be finished, a milestone that would mark the end of a year of life-changing turbulence, one that began last spring, at a luncheon where he learned that he’d won $1 million. At the time, Mr. Okoro had directed only short films. A graduate student at New York University, he was among five finalists for an award being given by AT&T, the Tribeca Film Festival and the Tribeca Film Institute to a promising young filmmaker, with a focus on underrepresented perspectives. After a game-show-like pitch-off that Mr. Okoro prepared for, in part, by recording himself delivering a 10-minute presentation and repeatedly playing it back through headphones, he won the transformative grant. His thesis project would have a million-dollar budget. But the money came with pressure. “It’s much different than winning the lottery,” he said this month, “because I still had to make the movie for it to mean anything. And I could really feel that.” Besides, there were strings attached. One requirement was that the film, which at that point had been written but not yet fully cast, had to be finished within a year, in time to have its premiere at this year’s festival. And the nature of Mr. Okoro’s project posed an additional challenge: He would be shooting in Lagos, Nigeria, far from their New York support systems. It would not be easy. The film, “Nigerian Prince,” follows a Nigerian-American high schooler, Eze (Antonio J. Bell), whose mother sends him to live with his aunt (played by the Nigerian actress Tina Mba) in Lagos. There, Eze befriends his cousin, Pius (Chinaza Uche), a professional scammer who sends phishing emails, among other deceitful business pursuits. Mr. Okoro wrote the story with Andrew Long, a fellow Howard University alumnus. As they developed the script, they were guided by the director Spike Lee, who mentored Mr. Okoro at N.Y.U. (Mr. Lee is also an executive producer of the film.) The project was long-gestating. “This is classic Faraday,” Sheldon Chau, the film’s cinematographer, said in a phone interview. “He comes up to me and he asks me, ‘Sheldon, what are you doing summer 2017?’ This is in 2014. And I was like, ‘I think I’m free.’ And he was like, ‘Well, that’s when I want to do my feature.’” The plot is based in part on Mr. Okoro’s own life. A Nigerian-American raised in Maryland, Mr. Okoro was sent to live with his extended family in Lagos for his first two years of high school, in the early 2000s. Like his character, Eze, he reluctantly left his friends and home. “I definitely resented it,” he said. He eventually learned to appreciate the new culture; one of his hopes is that the film will resonate with other young Nigerian-Americans who have felt disconnected from their roots. But shooting a movie in the West African city brought a host of unforeseen challenges. “We shot during the end of the rainy season,” said Mr. Okoro, who was familiar with the region’s climate but hadn’t bargained for all the difficulty it would present in filming. “There were some days where we’d go to set at 6 a.m., and it’d rain at 6:30 and flood.” The week before filming began, the crew arrived to a space meant to double as a police station onscreen, but it, too, was flooded. They didn’t end up using that location, though not because of the flooding; as at several other sites, the owner decided at the last minute that despite a signed contract, filming would no longer be allowed there. With little leverage and less time, Mr. Okoro and his team went searching for an alternative. In addition to the frequent rains and notoriously unreliable power, they ran up against in the city’s heavy traffic, which the director described as “like L.A. times five or 10.” Mr. Okoro and his team did have assistance. Several of his collaborators were peers from N.Y.U. To help them navigate, they hired artists from the prosperous Nigerian film industry, known as Nollywood. Most of the crew members were Nigerian, and the American heads of creative departments were paired with Nigerian artists. “It just became apparent that all the departments needed a partner to show us the proper way to do things,” Ari Fulton, the costume designer who met Mr. Okoro at N.Y.U., said in a phone interview. For Ms. Fulton, the assistance came from Olaogun Opeyemi, a Nigerian costume designer and the film’s costume supervisor, who helped make nuanced choices. One example is a red hat worn by Pius, the cousin, that’s an adaptation of an Igbo cap. Ms. Opeyemi helped fill out the history of the cap, which younger Nigerians have adapted for more casual use. Another learning experience was realizing that despite the size of the budget, financial decisions still had to be carefully considered. “The million dollars just flies,” said Mr. Chau, the cinematographer. He described the days after winning the grant, when he and Mr. Okoro would fantasize about using elaborate film gear. But they quickly realized that they were being unrealistic; after all, their budget, while several times higher than the $150,000 or $200,000 they’d initially hoped to shoot the movie for, was still modest for a feature film. “We went back to pretty much our initial approach,” Mr. Chau said. “It was a humbling experience.” Still, Mr. Chau also noted that while Mr. Okoro was the ostensible winner, the money had a trickle-down effect, bolstering the professional portfolios of his young collaborators. “The profiles of all of us came up,” Mr. Chau said. The pressure trickled down, too. “If someone hands you a million dollars, they expect you to turn out an amazing product,” Ms. Fulton observed. “It’s a huge thing to carry on your shoulders.” Mr. Okoro has carried it for a year. The morning after the film was finished — the sound mixed, the color corrected — less than two weeks before the film’s April 24 premiere, the director was standing in a Tribeca restaurant where this year’s award finalists were scheduled to pitch their films. After exchanging greetings with two of the new judges, the actor Griffin Dunne and the comedian Ilana Glazer, Mr. Okoro took a seat, waiting for the new finalists to appear. On the floor at his feet sat a hard plastic carrying case he’d brought with him. Inside it was a computer drive with the copy of “Nigerian Prince” that will be used for the Tribeca screenings. The film was finally ready, and Mr. Okoro would not let it out of his sight.",The New York Times
2018,Hearing the Cohen Case: A Soft-Spoken Judge Who ‘Carries a Big Stick’,"Judge Kimba M. Wood had barely finished a hearing this week that involved both Michael D. Cohen, President Trump’s lawyer, and — in a stunning revelation — the Fox News host Sean Hannity, when the right-wing media machine started going after her. Info Wars, the conspiracy theory website run by Alex Jones, posted an article that distilled Judge Wood’s 30-year career to a single Saturday five years ago when she performed the wedding of the left-wing billionaire George Soros. Keeping with the theme of a liberal cabal, the Washington Times mentioned that another progressive bigwig — Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader — was also at the festivities. Joining the attacks, Fox News and NRA TV also soon chimed in. Given its explosive mix of money, sex and presidential politics, the case engulfing Mr. Cohen — an investigation into whether he broke the law by suppressing scandals about women who claimed they had affairs with Mr. Trump — was almost certain to provoke a pushback and present a challenge to any judge called upon to manage it. But the Cohen affair is not Judge Wood’s first turn in the political spotlight. In 1993, after five years on the bench, she was considered for United States attorney general by President Bill Clinton after an earlier nominee, Zoë Baird, was found to have hired undocumented immigrants as nannies and failed to pay their taxes. But Judge Wood was asked to withdraw her name after telling White House screeners that she was sponsoring her own nanny for a green card — which was legal then — and that she had paid all the necessary taxes. “I have fulfilled every legal requirement with respect to the employment of our babysitter,” she said in a statement at the time. “Nevertheless, and after further consultations, I have concluded that in the current political environment, proceeding further with the possibility of my nomination would be inappropriate.” Although she had done nothing illegal, Judge Wood, 74, was a casualty of politics and continued on the bench at Federal District Court in Manhattan, one of the country’s highest-profile judicial stages. Over the years, she has handled several prominent cases, earning a reputation for being sensitive, demanding and — as could be relevant in Mr. Cohen’s matter — unequivocal in her expectations of public officials. “She’s sort of the judicial equivalent of Teddy Roosevelt — she speaks softly but carries a big stick,” said Judd Burstein, a lawyer who has known Judge Wood for more than 30 years. “She has a wonderful judicial temperament. She’s very soft-spoken, very courteous to people, but completely no-nonsense.” In 2010, Judge Wood presided over the guilty pleas of 10 Russian spies who had worked as long-term sleeper agents — a case that inspired the TV show “The Americans.” Six years later, when she sentenced Dean G. Skelos, the former Republican leader of New York’s State Senate, to five years in prison on corruption charges, she admonished him for ignoring his “moral compass.” “Through your crimes,” she said, “you have caused immeasurable damage to New Yorkers’ confidence in the integrity of their government.” (Mr. Skelos’s conviction was later overturned on appeal after the Supreme Court narrowed the legal definition of corruption. He is scheduled to be retried in June, again before Judge Wood.) The case of Mr. Cohen more or less landed in her lap. In a bit of legal happenstance, Judge Wood was the emergency duty judge last week when Mr. Cohen’s lawyers filed a motion challenging the search warrants that federal agents used to seize his cellphones, papers and computers in a series of extraordinary raids this month. It remains unclear if Judge Wood will continue to preside as the matter moves forward. If criminal charges are ultimately brought, the case would be randomly reassigned. But at least so far, Judge Wood has shown herself to be a firm jurist in the proceeding. On Monday, she compelled Mr. Cohen’s lawyers to reveal that Mr. Hannity had once been one of Mr. Cohen’s clients. Engaging her in a game of cat-and-mouse, the lawyers had at first described Mr. Hannity merely as a “prominent individual” who was embarrassed to be connected to the Cohen investigation. But after another lawyer — representing news media outlets — stepped in to argue that embarrassment was not sufficient grounds to keep the name a secret, Judge Wood decided she agreed. When Mr. Cohen’s lawyers pushed back, Judge Wood was blunt. “I’m directing you to disclose the name now,” she said. And so the lawyer did. Although the moment passed with a burst of audible gasps, Judge Wood’s measured approach — not raising her voice, but not backing down — showed a side of her that lawyers in her court know well. “What’s relevant to this case is that she’s so calm and levelheaded,” said Robert B. Fiske, Jr., a former United States attorney in Manhattan who has known Judge Wood since the 1980s. “Both sides, I think, would be very happy to have her as the judge. She has the ability to come into a high-pressure situation and deal with it intelligently and fairly.” Born in Port Townsend, Wash., in 1944 to a military family, Judge Wood spent her early years following her father, a career Army officer, through different posts in Europe. She studied for a time at the Sorbonne in Paris before attending Connecticut College and then Harvard Law School, graduating in 1969. Between college and law school, Judge Wood got a master’s degree from the London School of Economics while also briefly training, as something of a lark, to become a Playboy bunny. By 1971, she had embarked on what became a high-powered legal career, working briefly at the federal Office of Economic Opportunity and then taking a post at the New York law firm, LeBoeuf, Lamb, Leiby & MacRae, where she was among the first women to work on antitrust matters. In 1988, President Ronald Reagan, a Republican, appointed Judge Wood, a Democrat, to the federal bench in New York with the support of another Republican power broker, former State Senator Alfonse M. D’Amato. At that point, Judge Wood had little experience with criminal law and had never tried a case in front of a jury, but at her confirmation hearings Mr. D’Amato praised her for her “extraordinary background as a legal scholar.” In 1990, in one of her first important cases, Judge Wood sentenced the onetime junk-bond king Michael Milken to 10 years in prison for, among other crimes, violating federal securities laws. At the time, she said that she was issuing the severe prison term to send a message to the financial community, and also because Mr. Milken had chosen to break the law despite his good fortune and intelligence. In her sentencing decision, Judge Wood said that she received several letters from the public asking her to punish Mr. Milken for the “alleged abuses of the 1980s” — the savings-and-loan crisis, the takeover craze and the rampant use of junk bonds. She said that while she sympathized “with the anxiety expressed in these letters,” Mr. Milken should only be held accountable for his own offenses. “Our system of justice,” she went on, “protects everyone from being sentenced on supposition.” Two years later, though, after Mr. Milken had cooperated with federal prosecutors against his Wall Street colleagues, Judge Wood followed the urgings of both sides in the case and reduced his sentence so that he only served about two years. “If society did not reward cooperation by the worst criminals (who often know most about high-level criminal schemes),” she said this time, “many serious crimes would go undetected and/or unpunished.” At that point, Judge Wood was working 12-to-14-hour days, such long stints that she gave up one of her hobbies, painting abstract canvases in oil. To relax, her family said, she played tennis and grew roses at a vacation home in Massachusetts. Her marriage at the time, to the journalist Michael Kramer, ended in divorce. She is now married to Frank E. Richardson, a wealthy financier who once served as an unpaid member of an investment advisory committee for Mr. Soros’s Quantum Industrial Holdings. Though Judge Wood declined to comment on the case, a spokesman for the court, Edward Friedland, said in a statement issued Wednesday: “From time to time, but rarely, Judge Wood and her husband came across George Soros at large social gatherings that had nothing to do with politics. When he asked Judge Wood to perform his wedding, she did so.” Mr. Friedland added that Judge Wood has performed over 40 marriage ceremonies during her time as a judge. But even if Judge Wood moves in rarefied circles, she still maintains an exacting demeanor in the courtroom, lawyers said. “She is very kind and sensitive, but she doesn’t suffer fools lightly,” said Gerald L. Shargel, a veteran defense lawyer who has appeared before Judge Wood on numerous occasions. “She’s always been very gracious in my experience, but anyone who thinks she’s going to be a walk in the park, they’re going to be sadly mistaken.” In 2010, for instance, Bennett Epstein, a lawyer who had a trial before Judge Wood, sent her a letter requesting permission to delay the proceeding so that he could attend the circumcision of his daughter’s child in Philadelphia — if, indeed, it was a boy. “Should the child be a girl,” Mr. Epstein wrote, “not much will happen in the way of public celebration. Some may even be disappointed.” In a flourish of pointed generosity, Judge Wood permitted the delay, but added a handwritten note to the bottom of Mr. Epstein’s missive. “If a daughter is born,” she wrote, “there will be a public celebration in court, with readings from poetry celebrating girls and women.” An earlier version of this article misstated a detail of Judge Kimba M. Wood’s marital history. Michael Kramer was her second husband, not her first. The earlier version also misstated the connection between her current husband, Frank E. Richardson, and George Soros’s Quantum Industrial Holdings. Mr. Richardson once served on an investment advisory committee for the group; he did not sit on its board.",The New York Times

2018,"Helen Mayer Harrison, Leader in Eco-Art Movement, Dies at 90","Helen Mayer Harrison, half of the husband-and-wife team known as the Harrisons, pioneers in the eco-art movement whose works blended elements of art, biology, environmentalism and more, died on March 24 in Santa Cruz, Calif. She was 90. Her family said the cause was Alzheimer’s disease. Ms. Harrison and her husband, Newton Harrison, were both well into careers as educators when, in the late 1960s, they began shifting their focus to making art, vowing that anything they created would involve ecosystems and environmental awareness. Their artworks were unconventional, to say the least, pushing the very boundaries of what constitutes art. They made topsoil and grew crops in it. They consulted on urban planning projects in Baltimore, Europe and elsewhere. Well before global warming was in the public consciousness, they considered its likely effects through maps and other means. And then there was “Hog Pasture,” one of their earliest works, created for a 1971 exhibition at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts called “Earth, Air, Fire, Water: Elements of Art.” They made an actual pasture indoors, with hopes of having a real hog root around in it. The museum, they recalled years later, was fine with the pasture but not with the pig. In 2012 they re-created the work at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, and this time a pig named Wilma was allowed. In front of curious spectators, Wilma took eagerly to the pasture, searching for whatever it is that pigs search for in dirt. “The significance of the piece is what you see,” Ms. Harrison said in a video of the exhibition. “All of the sudden people are looking at the environment in one way or another, and they’re looking differently. In other words, it’s bringing their attention in a way that is meaningful.” Helen Mayer was born on July 1, 1927, in Queens. Her father, Henry, and her mother, Natalia Perla Wiseman, were both teachers. She received a bachelor’s degree in English at Queens College in 1946 and a master’s degree in educational philosophy at New York University in 1949, then began teaching in the New York City school system. She met Mr. Harrison, an artist whose early focus was sculpture, in the early 1950s. They married in 1953. After living for a time in Florence, Italy, they returned to New York, where, living on the Lower East Side, Ms. Harrison plunged into the causes and cultural movements of the early 1960s, especially the growing peace movement. After Mr. Harrison completed work on his master’s degree in 1965, both he and Ms. Harrison were offered teaching positions at the University of New Mexico. Two years later they moved to the University of California, San Diego, where Ms. Harrison directed the extension division’s education programs. But by the beginning of the 1970s she and her husband were devoting themselves to making art of an earth-conscious nature. One of their first efforts interpreted that commitment quite literally: For “Making Earth” (1969-70), Mr. Harrison made topsoil in the parking lot of their studio, and Ms. Harrison used it to grow plants. They came to call these early works their Survival Pieces. “Hog Pasture” was one. Another was a portable orchard, inspired by what they saw going on in Orange County, Calif. “It was made with trees, and we brought them indoors,” Ms. Harrison said in a 2013 video interview. “We made it because we thought: ‘All the orange trees in Orange County are disappearing. The orchards are being cut down.’ So we made an orchard for the museum that would be the last orange orchard in Orange County. And it was, in all probability.” The work was first exhibited at California State University, Fullerton. To the inevitable question, Why the Survival Pieces constituted art rather than farming, Mr. Harrison had a ready answer. “What we did in a series of museums was make work that, as an ensemble, added up to the food chain,” he said in the same interview. “So we were thinking quite differently than farmers do.” The Harrisons moved into urban ecology in the 1980s, working on conceptual designs for a promenade in Baltimore, the reclamation of a debris pit in Pasadena, Calif., and more. Not all of their works were so large in scale, however. Their contribution to the 1989 group show “The Drowned World: Waterworks” at the P.S. 1 Museum in Queens (now MoMA PS1) was a distillation device that purified water from the East River, showing the gunk it had contained. In the 1990s and beyond, their projects took on a regional aspect, examining ecosystems and environmental degradation. These works might include an installation, videos, maps, urban designs and other elements and involve input from planners, biologists and others not generally associated with the art world. For instance, the multipart “Greenhouse Britain” (2006-2009) considered the possible effects on England of rising oceans resulting from global warming, suggesting high-rise living spaces, hanging gardens and a dam to protect Bristol. Climate change was on the Harrisons’ radar well before it began making regular headlines, something Mr. Harrison credited to his wife. “Helen Mayer Harrison brought to our collective work deep expertise in literature, educational philosophy and transdisciplinary research,” he said by email. “One startling example of this was in 1973 when she introduced global warming research, which then became the lifelong theme in our work.” In addition to being an artist, Ms. Harrison was a professor at the University of California, San Diego, from 1980 to 1994. At her death she was professor emerita of digital arts and new media at the University of California, Santa Cruz. “Ahead of her time, and yet somehow very much of her time, Helen aimed to strengthen the connection between mind and everyday life through her work,” Susan Solt, the dean of that university’s arts division, said by email. “Helen blended the worlds of art and science so skillfully that ecologists, landscape architects, engineers and politicians were convinced to rethink their own contributions to our ecosystems.” In addition to her husband, Ms. Harrison is survived by three sons, Steven, Joshua and Gabriel; a daughter, Joy Harrison; nine grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren. In a 2010 interview, the Harrisons talked about their long partnership. “People want to know who does what,” Mr. Harrison said. “What happens is, I do the first draft, Helen does the second, I go back in for the third, and then Helen has the final one.” To which Ms. Harrison added: “So he has the first word, and I mostly have the last word. It works out.”",The New York Times
2018,"Helping Kids With A.D.H.D., and Their Families, Thrive","The Checkup When a child has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, it affects everybody in the family, said Dr. Mark Bertin, a developmental pediatrician in Pleasantville, N.Y. Parents need to understand the nature of A.D.H.D., he said, and appreciate that it affects “a host of self-management skills,” which play out in school but also in daily home routines. Dr. Bertin, who is the author of “The Family A.D.H.D. Solution” (disclosure: I wrote a blurb for the book), and “Mindful Parenting for A.D.H.D.,” said research shows that parents of children with A.D.H.D. are more anxious, more stressed and less confident, and that their marriages may be strained. It’s painful to watch your child struggle, and A.D.H.D. can present struggles all day long, from getting out of the house in the morning to getting homework done at night. “When a child has A.D.H.D., the level of independence is delayed compared to peers, and often just day-to-day life becomes more stressful at home,” Dr. Bertin said. “All the little things may be harder.” Dr. Gabrielle Carlson said that she grew up with a brother who had attention problems, “and I was the perfect older sister.” She is a professor of psychiatry and pediatrics at Stony Brook University School of Medicine who became a child psychiatrist, in part, she said, because of an interest in these symptoms and in what could help. “My brother drove my parents crazy,” she said. Their parents had both children tested, and “my goodness, it turned out my brother had the same I.Q. as I did!” So everyone was completely mystified about why one child was so successful in school and the other, well, “my mother said when his teachers saw her coming, they would cross the street.” Dr. Carlson’s own son was a smart kid with A.D.H.D. “My son used to say, it’s not fair everybody else can get their homework done and I can’t,” she said. “You get demoralized after a while when you try hard to do something and you just can’t do it. “The smarter the person is, in some respects, the more frustrating it is for the person,” Dr. Carlson said. She referenced the Charles M. Schulz cartoon in which Linus laments that there’s no heavier burden than a great potential. Part of the problem is that other people, including family members, don’t realize how difficult A.D.H.D. can make a child’s life. This is not about laziness or a lack of resolve. “People don’t truly understand what A.D.H.D. is and why a kid who’s bright can’t just grit his teeth and get it done,” Dr. Carlson said. Sometimes “it’s surprising for parents to realize that A.D.H.D. is a proven medical condition and that part of the diagnosis is defining where it is disruptive in life,” Dr. Bertin said. Since kids may be better able to focus on things they find of absorbing interest — say, the Yankees’ starting lineup rather than the deadline for that science project — “it can look like it’s a motivational issue when it’s not,” he said. Sometimes just understanding different aspects of A.D.H.D. — that the child has executive function issues and needs help planning, or that the child cannot control his emotions and needs help with anger management — helps the parent cope. And often, the kids are really trying, Dr. Carlson said. “The kids get up in the morning and they say, I’m going to do it today, I’m going to really work on this today, and then they can’t do it, their brains won’t let them do it.” So the kids need help, and successfully treating A.D.H.D. has multiple components. There is that essential education — for the child and the family — about what A.D.H.D. means. There’s educational testing, supports and accommodations in school, behavior techniques and routines at home, especially around schoolwork as kids get older. “You have lists, and you have incentives, and the star charts,” Dr. Carlson said. For parents, this means trying to provide structure, to give positive feedback and set consistent limits, all worthy goals for any child. But frustratingly, Dr. Bertin said, A.D.H.D. itself makes all those interventions much more stressful for everyone, and “when parents are feeling swamped and overwhelmed it’s really hard to do a lot of things that are recommended in taking care of A.D.H.D.” And of course, there’s medication. The medication helps many struggling children, but “it doesn’t organize you,” Dr. Carlson said. On the other hand, “it focuses you, it decreases your impulsivity, it helps your mood regulation so you’re less volatile,” and all of that may help with the struggles and frustrations of academic work and family life. “At the end of the day, you’re talking to a child psychiatrist who believes in treatment,” Dr. Carlson said. She tells parents that she likens refusing medication to refusing to wear glasses. “I can say, I refuse to wear glasses, I am pathologically opposed to glasses, so I’m going to have to get an aide, I’m going to have to have someone read to me and I can make people make the print large and I’m going to need a chauffeur,” she said. “If all you have to do is put the glasses on and that takes care of a lot of the problem, then for God’s sake put on the glasses!” Families should not expect simple answers, or short-term solutions. Parents have to take care of themselves, and pay attention to the family dynamic, looking for ways to help everyone thrive. Look for areas of life where the child is successful and for ways to spend positive time together, Dr. Bertin suggested. Make sure the child is getting all the appropriate interventions at school, and look for resources to help with the home side of academics. And watch for sibling issues. It may not be healthy for a child who does not have A.D.H.D. to be cast in the role of the “good child,” he said. Parents should make sure all children get their share of positive parental attention. Dr. Bertin suggested thinking of A.D.H.D. “as a delay in self-management skills.” With help and support and time to develop, “they will do well over time,” he said. So kids with A.D.H.D. need a short-term strategy that helps them function, he said, tied to a long-term plan to eventually give them the skills they need, because whatever they pursue in life, they will need those executive function skills. Looking at A.D.H.D. as a developmental delay, he said, “is a practical problem-solving way to look at challenging situations, though it doesn’t mean everyone is going to outgrow it; they’re going to work past their delays through the interventions.” And everyone should understand that though self-management skills are delayed, “that doesn’t mean kids have a free pass for life,” Dr. Bertin said. “The long-term plan is get them fully independent and caught up, but short term, if their skills are such that they can’t manage their backpack, they have to work as hard as they can while we help them manage their backpack.”",The New York Times
2018,Her Start in the Air Force Led to a Surprising Place,"Vocations Caroline MacDonald, 54, is Rosewood Hotel Group’s vice president of sales and marketing for the Americas and Europe. Did you have your current job in mind from the start? Not at all. I wanted to be a vet, because I had a soft spot for animals. My first job at the age of 15 was working for my mother, who owned a small answering service in Los Angeles back when people called in for messages delivered by actual people in real time. Graduating from high school, I did not have a specific path or interest. So I enlisted in the Air Force in 1984. Why the Air Force? For one thing, they would subsidize my further education and train me in a field. Also, I wanted to travel. I describe my interview at the recruitment center as my “Private Benjamin moment.” I said I want to travel to exotic places, to experience different cultures and to go to college while working abroad. How did that work out for you? They found I had a high administrative and leadership aptitude. So I was sent to Germany, where I held an administrative role during peacetime and later was trained to plot nuclear, biological and chemical fallout as my wartime function. I attained the position of staff sergeant. I re-enlisted and was assigned to Spain, where I earned a degree in systems management from the University of Maryland, which sent professors to Europe-based military bases as part of its overseas extension programs. I continued to train in programming and systems. The military refined my critical assessment and leadership skills, and taught me discipline and teamwork. It’s quite a stretch from plotting nuclear fallout to plotting sales and marketing strategies for luxury hotels. How did that happen? After my military experience, by then the single mother of a daughter who has autism, I returned to Carmel, California, where my family lived. With very few programming jobs there, I landed a job at a small independent hotel in nearby Monterey as a sales administrative assistant. Within six months I was sales manager. Eventually I joined Auberge Resorts in 2001, where I rose to chief marketing officer in 2013 while simultaneously earning my M.B.A. from Pepperdine University. In 2016 the Rosewood Hotel Group hired me to run sales and marketing for the Americas and Europe. They have 23 hotels and Laos opened in March, with 16 in the pipeline. Luxury hotel marketing is full of clichés like “hidden gem,” “bespoke,” “artisanal,” “authentic” and “charming.” How do you deal with it? I admit these tired phrases are hard to avoid. Rosewood had used “a sense of place” as part of its philosophy as early as 1980 with its first hotel, the Mansion on Turtle Creek in Dallas. The company made “A Sense of Place” a registered trademark in 2000. That said, I think hotels distinguish themselves in the small details that attend to the guest. That’s the personalized X factor that transcends clichés. How do you balance working in the luxury business with your own life and values? My personal life of family and service puts everything in perspective. My daughter Casey, who is now 31 and is high-functioning autistic with a full and active life, keeps me quite grounded and centered in reality, as does my husband, Bob. On Friday nights we three go to downtown Los Angeles to hand out fresh burritos to the homeless community with an L.A. group called Share a Meal. I also serve on the board of Chrysalis, a nonprofit organization that helps the homeless community develop job skills and obtain employment. To get away from it all, Bob and I take long rides on our motorcycles up and down the California coast.",The New York Times
2018,"Herbert Kaiser, 94, Health Care Champion in South Africa, Dies","In 1971, an American diplomat named Herbert Kaiser was doing a tour of duty in South Africa when he developed melanoma. It did not escape Mr. Kaiser’s notice that, being white, he received excellent medical attention from a white doctor, while the country’s nonwhite population was chronically underserved by the health system, in part because few medical professionals were people of color. A decade later, after he had retired from the State Department, Mr. Kaiser and his wife, Joy, thought back on that experience and looked into the disparities. “We learned that out of a black population of over 20 million in 1984, there were only 350 black doctors, fewer than 20 dentists and less than 120 pharmacists,” Mr. Kaiser recalled in a 2004 commencement address at his alma mater, Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania. “The figures for black infant and child mortality and for maternal mortality were appalling. We saw for ourselves overflowing waiting rooms for sick blacks and hospitals with 300 percent occupancy rates. Figure that one out: It meant two to a bed or on the floor.” The Kaisers did something about the problem. In 1985 they founded Medical Education for South African Blacks, a nonprofit organization that provided financial and other support to students of color seeking health careers. Mr. Kaiser died on March 30 at his home in Palo Alto, Calif. He was 94. His son Timothy said the cause was heart failure. By the time the Kaisers’ organization disbanded in 2007 it had helped some 10,000 South Africans of color receive training as doctors, nurses, midwives and more. The timing of the Kaisers’ initiative proved auspicious in two ways. One was that, when the organization (known by the acronym Mesab) was founded, South Africa was still under apartheid; a more equal health care system and stronger black professional class helped secure the country’s survival when majority rule came in the 1990s. The other was that Mesab began producing health care professionals just as the AIDS crisis was devastating the country. Herbert Kaiser was born on June 8, 1923, in Brooklyn. His father, Max, was a house painter, and his mother, the former Nettie Slavititski, was a caretaker. The Depression years were difficult for the family, and Timothy Kaiser said that being on the receiving end of public charity left his father with a sense of obligation that he carried his entire life. After graduating from high school, Herbert worked briefly at the Brooklyn Navy Yard and then, in 1942, joined the Navy, serving on the submarine Dragonet, which was stationed off Japan in August 1945 when the atomic bombs were dropped on that country. He attended Swarthmore on the G.I. Bill, graduating in 1949, the same year he married Joy Dana Sundgaard, a fellow student. He took a job with the State Department and was posted to Glasgow in 1950. Later in that decade he developed an expertise in Eastern European affairs, and his career included postings to Yugoslavia, Austria, Poland and Romania. He retired in 1983. Mr. Kaiser was fluent in a number of languages, which enabled him to understand the nuances at play in the politically and socially divided areas where he worked. He needed those skills when he and Joy set up their nonprofit. Besides the tensions and factions within South Africa, the Kaisers had to deal with the international pressure that was causing many prominent people and companies to withdraw investments from that country. Raising money for their fledgling organization was difficult. But eventually a number of companies, including Johnson & Johnson, Kellogg’s and Pfizer International, signed on, and community leaders in South Africa got behind the effort. Scholarship money alone, though, wasn’t the answer. The organization found that it also needed to provide other kinds of support for students, both during apartheid and after. “South African blacks have had to cope with decades of poor primary and secondary education, as well as social neglect,” Saul Levin, Mesab’s chief executive, said in 2005. “Students who come into universities from rural areas are shellshocked. I have had students who tell me they’ve never had a bank account or ridden in an elevator.” Thus, accommodations were made for the program’s students, like allowing them to repeat failed courses or to cut back on their course load if they were having academic trouble. A mentoring program was established. And Mesab responded to the AIDS crisis with a palliative care program that financed the training of professionals and community caregivers in treating those with the disease. In addition to his wife and his son Timothy, Mr. Kaiser is survived by another son, Paul; a daughter, Gail; and six grandchildren. The Kaisers’ efforts, which wound down in 2007, drew praise from some of the leading figures in modern South African history, including President Nelson Mandela and Archbishop Desmond Tutu. When, in 2013, the Kaisers published a book, “Against the Odds: Health & Hope in South Africa — The Story of Medical Education for South African Blacks,” the archbishop wrote the foreword. “If someone had told me in the 1980s that 10,000 blacks would have been trained as health professionals — doctors, dentists, nurses, etc. — in the space of 22 years, I would have recommended that they go and consult their psychiatrist,” Archbishop Tutu wrote. “And then to add to such an unlikely scenario the prediction that over 27 million U.S. dollars would be raised for this enterprise,” he continued, “would have confirmed for me that someone was in desperate need of psychiatric treatment.”",The New York Times
2018,Here Are the Biggest Stories in American Politics This Week ,"Whether it was President Trump’s first state dinner, the visits of two prominent European leaders, the withdrawal of the president’s nominee to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs or a summit meeting between the leaders of North and South Korea, it was a big week in American politics and diplomacy. Here’s a look back at what you might have missed. Dr. Ronny L. Jackson, the White House physician, withdrew his nomination to be secretary of veterans affairs on Thursday after lawmakers publicized a litany of allegations about him. The accusations included accounts of his liberally giving out prescription medication, being intoxicated at work and presiding over a hostile work environment. President Trump and other top administration officials strongly defended Dr. Jackson, citing favorable performance reviews from previous administrations. But interviews with current and former colleagues showed that the isolation of the White House medical unit hid the perception of Dr. Jackson as a bully who loosely dispensed strong drugs, kept sloppy records and drank too much. Additional Reading A History of Ronny Jackson in Fewer Than 70 Words Trump’s Doctor Accused of Handing Out Ambien. D.E.A. Calls the Practice Illegal. News Analysis: For Many, Life in Trump’s Orbit Ends in a Crash Landing President Emmanuel Macron of France came to the United States with the intention of persuading Mr. Trump to not scrap the Iran nuclear deal next month, but it remained unclear whether he made progress toward that goal. And while Mr. Macron criticized Mr. Trump’s policies in a rare joint address before Congress, the bromance between the two flourished during the visit. Mr. Macron and his wife, Brigitte, were treated to the administration’s first state dinner, a 21-gun salute and a private evening at George Washington’s home. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany received a less extravagant greeting when she arrived on Friday. She reiterated Mr. Macron’s push for the United States to remain part of the nuclear deal and pressed for a stronger commitment that the European Union would be exempt from the coming steel and aluminum tariffs. It’s likely that when Mr. Trump visits Britain in July — an on-again, off-again trip announced Thursday — he will receive a similarly subdued reception.

Here’s What He Can Expect. For the first time, the Supreme Court heard arguments over Mr. Trump’s efforts to impose a ban on travel to the United States from several predominately Muslim countries. Although a decision was not made, the court’s five-member conservative majority seemed ready to approve a revised version of the president’s plan. Justices also heard arguments in their third voting-rights case of the term, weighing a long-running dispute over congressional and state legislative districts in Texas. Challengers say the districts discriminate against minority voters. The court upheld the constitutionality of a procedure that eases challenges to questionable patents. In a separate case, it ruled that foreign corporations — in this case, a bank based in Jordan with a branch in New York — may not be sued for complicity in human rights abuses abroad.

Mueller III, who is leading the Russia investigation. And while Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, has said he will not allow the bill to reach the floor for a vote, the bipartisan support in the committee sends a warning message to Mr. Trump about the consequences of firing Mr. Mueller. It was also revealed Friday that the Russian lawyer who met with Trump campaign officials in Trump Tower in June 2016 has recanted her earlier denials of Russian government ties and admitted that she was a source of information for a top Kremlin official. The revelation came hours before Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee announced they had found no evidence that the Trump campaign aided Russia’s meddling in the 2016 election. Rudolph W. Giuliani, the latest high-profile addition to the president’s legal team, is said to be working to reopen negotiations on a possible interview between the president and the special counsel. Mr. Trump continued to distance himself from Michael D. Cohen, his personal lawyer who is under investigation from the Justice Department. Attorney General Jeff Sessions also declined to say whether he had recused himself from the inquiry into Mr. Cohen, given his recusal from the special counsel’s investigation. He also declined to answer when asked if he would quit if Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, was fired.

The confirmation followed a late approval from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which almost failed to give him a favorable vote. On his first full day as secretary of state, Mr. Pompeo traveled to Europe and warned that Mr. Trump may withdraw from the Iran deal early next month. He also called for European countries to increase their military spending. Mr. Trump announced Tuesday that he would dispatch Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, and other economic advisers to China next week. With the two countries locked in a tit-for-tat tariff battle, Mr. Mnuchin and the rest of the American delegation will be charged with forestalling an all-out trade war. In an unusual Twitter exchange that bypassed the usual topics of media and politics, Mr. Trump reached out to Kanye West, the bombastic rapper and longtime supporter.

The most contentious hearing was with Mr. Pruitt, who faced an entire day of questions about his spending, housing arrangements and raises for staff members. But he dodged the blame, pointing a finger instead on decisions made by his employees. The news that Speaker Paul D.

The leaders agreed to work to remove all nuclear weapons from the Korean Peninsula and pursue talks with the United States to formally end the Korean War. It was the first time a North Korean leader had ever stepped foot in the South, something Mr. Trump applauded on Friday. It paves the way for a summit meeting between the American and North Korean leaders. But Mr. Trump vowed that he would not be fooled by the North the way he said his predecessors had. The Trump administration also abruptly redirected Washington’s pick to be ambassador to Australia, and instead named him the American envoy to Seoul. It fills a diplomatic void right before Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim are scheduled to meet.

2018,Here’s What You Need to Know About Online Testing for the ACT and SAT,"Q: What kind of computers are required for an online test? A: Students can use school-owned laptops, desktops or Chromebooks. What are the safeguards against crashes, slow-loading tests or lost answers? ACT’s test administrator, Pearson Assessment, uses proctor caching: Each testing location has its own local server, which downloads the test, delivers it to individual students and collects the answers before returning them to Pearson’s home server. Once the tests are returned, they disappear from local computers. The SAT’s administrator, AIR Assessment, uses a proprietary browser with built-in redundancies, including a diagnostic tool that helps schools assess the health of their network and how many testers it can support at one time. Responses are saved on multiple servers, so if the connection is disrupted students can log on elsewhere and pick up where they left off. There’s talk that the online test might one day become adaptive. What does that mean? Adaptive tests adjust the level of questioning according to how the test taker performs on prior questions, so that low scorers are asked fewer of the hardest questions and high scorers don’t need to waste as much time on easy ones. That kind of test can provide a more detailed picture of what students have mastered. It also means test takers get different questions in a different order from one another and from previous exams that may have been leaked or stolen. Does anyone use these adaptive tests? The GRE and G.M.A.T. graduate exams are adaptive tests, as is the Smarter Balanced test some states use to measure Common Core skills in grades 3 to 11. Language placement exams are often adaptive, as are licensing exams for pharmacists, accountants, paramedics and other professions. [READ MORE: For the ACT and the SAT, Pencils No Longer Required, but Sometimes Necessary] What’s the holdup on going adaptive? Just to go online has required exhaustive studies and statistical analysis to ensure comparability of a paper exam score with one from a computer, time the test loading and scrolling speeds of various laptops, and assure that computerized testing doesn’t work to the advantage of some groups of students over others. Beyond that, adaptive testing also demands a much larger store of potential questions. If my school gives the SAT or ACT online, can I request a paper version instead? If the school opts for online testing, only students granted special accommodations for a disability can take it on paper. But schools may opt for a mixed mode of ACT testing, which would allow students to choose. Digital ACT and SAT tests are given on more than one day. Are they different tests, and if not, what’s to prevent students sharing questions and answers online? Both companies declined to answer, citing test security, but said they take many steps to protect against cheating and ensure a fair testing environment. Is scratch paper allowed? Does the online test have any useful features that paper tests don’t? Both tests allow pencils and scratch paper. Both tests allow you to bookmark items to return to later and have a countdown clock to keep track of time left in the section. The ACT lets you cross off answers you want to eliminate, and it marks unanswered questions with an orange dot, while the SAT provides electronic scratch paper and the ability to highlight passages. Where can I test drive an online test? For the ACT, visit the TestNav website, home.testnav.com. Students also may access timed and untimed ACTs to become comfortable with the testing, using Preparing for the ACT Test Taken Online. For the SAT, the College Board recommends Official SAT Practice on Khan Academy, www.satpractice.org. Students also are given practice questions on the actual AIR test platform ahead of test day.",The New York Times
2018,Hermès Plays a Hipster Tune,"On Thursday evening, the ground floor of the Madison Avenue Hermès men’s store underwent something of a redesign. Ordinarily, silk ties hang from the oak-colored walls. Instead, there were only records, which had been placed in sleeves matched to the patterns of the brand’s scarves. By the doors were Pioneer turntables and JVC headphones. Fashion editors swayed to electronic tracks that seemed more suited to the chill-out tent at Coachella than the retail outlet of a 181-year-old French fashion house whose disinclination toward chasing trends is virtually unparalleled in the industry, but whose dedication to the classic can occasionally seem a bit like fustiness. Particularly when big shifts are taking place in fashion land. Gucci is selling faux vintage AC/DC concert shirts for $750. Limited-edition drops from Supreme are greeted with almost as much attention as the Super Bowl. A few weeks ago, Louis Vuitton hired as its new designer of men’s wear Virgil Abloh, a stylist to Kanye West and founder of the haute street wear brand Off-White. Who wants to get left behind? Why not try to put forth the idea that Hermès can also be hip? Guests with crocodile Kelly bags smiled and posed in a photo booth where the backdrop was patterned like a checkerboard-patterned scarf. Waiters served mini burgers, deviled eggs and a chicken and waffles hors d’oeuvre that didn’t really taste like chicken and waffles. Upstairs, the D.J. Patrick Vidal was playing a set for scenesterish 20-and 30-somethings who perused the racks of patterned T-shirts and hooded zip-up parkas. Here was Emory Stewart, who is 30 and described what he does for a living as being at the intersection of fashion, creative strategy, real estate, interior design and branding. This means he goes to a lot of parties, is active on Instagram and is well poised to talk about how the kids are consuming these days and how the grown-ups are trying to reach them. “This is a take on Generation Z,” he said, standing there in his Margiela shirt, Gucci pants, Balenciaga shoes and Givenchy jacket (“from Riccardo Tisci’s last collection, he noted). “Hermès is going for millennials,” he said. “Look at Supreme. There are lines out the door every weekend. It’s not always luxury, but it’s a trend and Supreme is making a lot of money. Virgil Abloh is now the creative director of Louis Vuitton. Kids look like they’re homeless, but they’ve got $10,000 worth of garments on.” Perhaps unsurprisingly, Christophe Goineau, the creative director of Hermès men’s silks, put the goal of the event differently. According to him, the idea was merely to parallel different experiences of pleasure and appeal to the senses. He wanted, he said, to get at the “feeling and emotion you get” upon encountering a “beautiful cashmere” scarf. If the crowd seemed mostly impressed by the execution of the concept, it may have been because the store still looked like a beacon of luxury. The clothes on the racks were mostly informal, but unmistakably Hermès. “It’s still quite elevated,” said Dorian Grinspan, the recent Yale graduate who edits Out of Order, an international fashion and culture magazine bible that’s popular with Brooklyn types. Even the choice of Mr. Vidal as the evening’s D.J. was an indication that Hermès was doing this the Hermès way. “He’s over 50,” Mr. Goineau said.",The New York Times

THE ONLY STORY By Julian Barnes 254 pp. Alfred A. Knopf. $25.95. If English life, as Lawrence Durrell was fond of saying, is by and large a “long, slow toothache,” then Julian Barnes is now perhaps its principal dentist. Over a period of more than 30 years, he has returned again and again to certain lugubrious and exacting English themes: suburban conventions, coming-of-age anxieties and the enigmas of bourgeois love. From his first novel, “Metroland,” to “The Sense of an Ending,” which won the Booker Prize in 2011, Barnes has applied a melancholy drill to a patient still confined to the chair. One could argue that in “The Only Story,” Barnes’s new book, he is taking his cue from Flaubert, as he did in his best-known work, “Flaubert’s Parrot.” The older woman in this novel, 48-year-old Susan Macleod, stands in for Madame Arnoux of “A Sentimental Education,” and 19-year-old Paul Casey could be seen as a version of Frédéric Moreau. They are, after all, eternal archetypes. The revolutions of 1848 in Flaubert’s novel become in Barnes’s work the multiple revolutions of the 1960s, not least the sexual revolution. A passing reference to a Private Eye cartoon of Prime Minister Alec Douglas-Home situates the crucial action of the novel in the years 1963-64, a fateful era in Britain’s own cultural upheavals. Flaubert stated that he wanted to write the moral history of his generation, to excavate passions that he declared were, despite the romantic pretenses of French society, “inactive.” Barnes has set out to do much the same. “The Only Story” is just as pessimistic, with about the same satirical temperature and measuring the same ironic distance from what at first seems to be a love story that might generate some erotic heat. But “In the Mood for Love” this is not. In a small town in suburban Surrey, Paul meets Susan at the local tennis club, where they are assigned to be partners in a doubles tournament. Susan is married, with two daughters, and as Mrs. Robinsons go she is shy but ironic, seemingly insouciant but grimly trapped in a sterile marriage to Gordon Macleod, a nondescript British Empire type who is given all the most charmless attributes of both his generation and his race. The generation being that of World War II, described here as “played out” and traumatized, exhausted and sad, with no hint of the Greatest Generation mythology that has benefited its American counterpart. If one thinks back to the semi-forgotten satire of the British ’60s, shows like “That Was the Week That Was” and the “Beyond the Fringe” skits helmed by Peter Cook, Dudley Moore, Jonathan Miller and Alan Bennett, the first thing that is striking is the delicious comic tension between the wartime generation and the generation that followed. The comedy is driven by the onetime solidity of archaic British types: Colonel Blimps and academics with plummy accents, cap-tipping proles and Middle Englanders with lips so stiff they can hardly talk. But that seemingly solid tapestry of social orders melted away into nothingness almost overnight. Barnes sets his tale in its twilight, among what he calls “furrow-dwellers,” the torpid English middle classes, but he refrains from deriving much comedy from it. His Gordon Macleod is a drunken brute who slams his wife’s face into the doorjamb. Narrating the first section of the novel, Paul is filled with rage for this hateful caricature of a man, though this is entirely unsurprising since nothing complex or sympathetic is offered on behalf of the luckless and cuckolded Gordon. It might have occurred to Paul at some point that a 19-year-old doing the deed with your wife under your own roof might inspire a little chagrin, but Paul is himself — and purposefully, I think — a self-righteous adolescent who never quite sees it this way, for all his grandstanding about his own shame. When asking himself, in retrospect, how much he understood about love at 19, he intones, “A court of law might find —” No, sympathy and vitality are reserved for the women in Paul’s telling, and indeed the author’s. There are shades here of Sarah, Graham Greene’s heroine in “The End of the Affair.” Susan is, without question, the character linchpin of the novel, and she is rendered touchingly. Miraculously, she shines through her lover’s philosophizing about love and memory, about which he has little original to say. She has spirit. The young man and older woman begin a hesitant and fumbling sexual liaison whose sacrilegious tenderness is, however, never quite incarnated by Paul’s recollection of it. Take her ears, at which he marvels. In an early moment of their lovemaking, he remembers: “It wasn’t until we were in bed and I was rummaging and rootling around her body, into every nook and cranny, every overexamined and underexamined part of her, that, crouched above, I swept back her hair and discovered her ears.” One wonders at his language here. Rummaged and rootled? Was she really enjoying such a feverish examination? This makes him sound like a stamp collector going over his latest finds rather than an awe-struck adolescent losing his virginity. But this is Barnes’s point, I assume. “Strange as it may seem,” Paul implausibly reflects just before the episode of the ears, “I never reflected on our age difference.” Teenage boys do lose their cherries to much older women (and they do so in the garden suburbs south of London), but it’s rare that they never reflect on doing so with a woman nearing 50 with a husband and two daughters in tow. Nor do they tend to set up house with them. Still one could argue, after all, that this is the Emmanuel Macron story, with the cruel difference that Paul goes on to become not the leader of a major European nation but an obscure loser after eloping with his mistress and utterly failing to live happily ever after. For the darkness of the story only invades you in its last hundred pages. Years later, Paul settles down alone in the countryside to run something called the Frogworth Valley Artisanal Cheese Company and acquires a taste for reading lachrymose agony columns in the local newspaper. He also bakes. He not only loathes the memory of Susan’s husband but most men to boot, finding them boastful, oafish and predatory, both beastly and comical. As for himself, he is by his own account an “absolutist for love.” In other words, he is somehow less human than the man he still hates. As “The Only Story” proceeds, Barnes slips in and out of the first-, second- and third-person voices. Sometimes, but not always, with subtle effect. Near the beginning of the second section, which explores Paul and Susan’s uneasy cohabitation, the slip into the second person heralds a nice gearshift into Paul’s self-questioning; Barnes has a skillful command of tone and its moral implications, when he chooses to exert it. In the more hardened third person at the end of the book, the narrator has Paul recall a public service ad about AIDS in which it is suggested that when two people have sex they have sex with all their previous partners, and at once the ruminations become interesting. In that voice, the novel seems to find the right distance from its subject. I like the way Paul gradually forgets the very body he had overly fetishized, even the ears. “Things, once gone,” we are told, “can’t be put back; he knew that now. A punch, once delivered, can’t be withdrawn. Words, once spoken, can’t be unsaid. We may go on as if nothing has been lost, nothing done, nothing said; we claim to forget it all; but our innermost core doesn’t forget, because we have been changed forever.” Of which we can say that this is both true and beautifully put. As Paul opines, “In love, everything is both true and false; it’s the one subject on which it’s impossible to say anything absurd.” Which isn’t true, but I like it anyway. There is much food for self-contemplation on the part of the generation that came to maturity in the 1960s, and it’s a popular theme among British novelists born in the 1940s. But it has proved difficult to pull off. Love isn’t the only story, as it turns out, even if, as Paul insists, “first love fixes a life forever.” Barnes is aware of this, but to relate in some way the dark sides of the cultural revolution of the ’60s and that of his coming-of-age story he would have had to let his characters emerge a little more from Paul’s perspective and the look-at-me-in-the-dock exegesis of his poor treatment of a woman he never really understands. Here and there, all the same, Barnes’s rapier wit flashes and glitters. At one point in his decline, Paul gets “punitively drunk to the point of sudden rationality.” What a delicious phrase that is, and how much more Paul might have delivered on it.",The New York Times
2018,"He’s No Longer My Ex-Husband, He’s My Co-Grandparent","Ties When my sister was born, she went nameless for months because my parents could not agree on anything. Thirty years after this conflicted couple contentiously uncoupled, my mother started cooking dinner for my father once a week. What reconnected them? The grandchildren. My mother, Jo, is a fiercely independent surgeon who voted for Hillary Clinton. My father, Emanuel, a real estate developer, has a tendency to take charge, and he cast his vote for Donald Trump. Emanuel grew up in a religious Jewish home, the son of Holocaust survivors in Washington Heights. Jo grew up in Los Feliz, Calif. My father’s relatives were the first observant Jews she had ever met. By the time I was in first grade they were divorced. I toted an L.L. Bean bag to school on Fridays to spend the night at my father’s apartment. For years, my parents’ contact was limited to kid-related events, like parent-teacher conferences. Yet their tension remained, my mother occasionally whispering damning words about my father within earshot, inevitably beginning with “He never ….” For his part, my father would more directly and angrily announce, “Your mother always ….” Maybe that’s part of the reason I lived in New York City for a decade, despite my affinity for Los Angeles, my hometown. But it was hard to stay away; imperfect as my family may have been, my dream of eventually living a meaningful and more mellow life in L.A. still pulled me. When I became pregnant with my first child, I was determined to have the baby at the California hospital where my mother had once worked as an obstetrician. When baby Sylvie, named after my mother’s mother, entered the world, she became the first person to truly bring my parents into a respectfully shared territory in decades. A few years later, when my husband Adam, Sylvie and I moved from New York City to Los Angeles permanently, my parents, who use the Yiddish grandparent names “Bubbie” and “Zeide,” crossed paths more regularly. We lived at my mother’s during our prolonged house renovation. It wasn’t ideal, but I was pregnant again and grateful for all the help I could get, even if it meant witnessing my parents’ occasional glares when my father came to visit, charging in the door despite the barking of my mother’s Chihuahua. “Why don’t you give your dog back to the shelter before he bites someone and you get sued?” he’d snap. As he strapped Sylvie into her stroller to take her to the park, he’d warn, “Tell your mother that letting raccoons live in the crawl space under her house will spread disease and is disgusting.” Yet eventually he began picking up treats for my mother’s barking dog. To my amazement, the tension between my parents began to abate, particularly when they both zoomed in on Sylvie, a magnet with her bright red hair and contagious giggle. Maybe I should have seen the shift coming. As a psychologist, I know about the profound therapeutic impact of exposure therapy — when a person chooses to repeatedly face an uncomfortable stimulus rather than avoid it. For example, if someone hates public speaking, rather than dodging opportunities to grab a microphone, she would actively pursue chances to perform. Experts used to think that the objective of exposure therapy was to reduce discomfort. Now, anxiety researchers understand that the mechanism of change is creating new learning; in other words, instead of the body relaxing in the face of something difficult, the mind expands to develop healthier appraisals. Of course, it’s not always easy to persuade a person to approach something that distresses them. I find that it helps to remind my patients of what they most want in life, and then have them link facing their fears to achieving those higher aims. As for my parents, I know that they both deeply savor the opportunity to offer love and wisdom to their grandchildren. Our period of living in limbo forced them to learn to linger in the service of that intention. As social scientists predict, repeated exposure led to improved understanding and a better quality of life. When the holidays rolled around, my mother suggested that we invite my father. By that time, Sylvie was 2 and we had a newborn son, Eli, named after my grandfather. The night of our family dinner, my mother was focused on perfecting short ribs; I was trying to get Eli to sleep and we were all absorbed in Sylvie’s singing. There was no space for whispered words of resentment. My father brought a bottle of his favorite sparkling grape juice and loudly blessed the children. Dinner was uneventful, besides the fact that for the first time in decades, my parents were sitting together at the aged wooden dining table they had shared years before. When Adam and the kids and I finally moved to our own place a few months later, I invited my father to our first Shabbat dinner. “Do you want to come over?” I asked my mom. “Will it be weird for you if Dad’s there?” “He’s not my ex-husband,” my mother replied. “He’s my co-grandparent.” And so I asked them both again. And again. I don’t cook, so my mother tends to bring a cooler filled with multiple courses. If dinner is set for 6, she’ll breeze in around 6:30, but the food is always delicious. My father recites the blessings and sits across from my mother, occasionally observing, “It’s nice of your mom to bring you food.” Sometimes, they chime in together with comments like “Sylvie, sit down,” or “That toy is dangerous for Eli.” Recently, Adam mentioned that my father had purchased my mother a ticket for a benefit for my daughter’s school. He found out because a school administrator had called to ask what to do about the seating arrangements. We chuckled about our modern family but I was touched. My mother and father have taught me that it’s possible to pivot; that it’s never too late to learn to be flexible, with intention and practice. “It’s very nice of your mom to provide a home for those raccoons,” my father said with a smile, as we all sat at a table together for another holiday dinner. “Most people would get rid of them. She feeds them.” “They’ve been here for years; they don’t bother me,” she told him. “They’re part of the family.”",The New York Times
2018,He’s the Producer. She’s the Talent. Who Owns the Hit Record?,"LONDON — When Joe Penhall wrote “Mood Music,” he had no idea it would be so topical. The Olivier Award-winning playwright wanted to consider the emotional wrangle over intellectual property in art. But in the wake of the #MeToo movement, a long-overdue examination of systemic sexism and male power in the entertainment industries has come to the fore, and it’s made the drama — about an acrimonious case of artistic differences in the music business — timelier than anyone expected. The play, which begins performances at the Old Vic here on Saturday, charts the toxic working relationship between a middle-aged male music producer and a young female singer-songwriter. Their fight over who owns a hit record spills from the studio into legal offices and psychiatrists’ couches. There are striking similarities to Kesha’s lengthy legal battle with her former producer Dr. Luke, but “Mood Music” grew out of an abstract idea rather than a specific case. Mr. Penhall, who wrote the screen adaptations of the novels “Enduring Love” and “The Road,” most recently created Netflix’s hit psychological crime drama “Mindhunter.” He described himself as fascinated by the complexities of artistic collaboration. “You’re exploiting your own vulnerability to make the work,” he said recently. And since artists mine their own lives for material, working relationships are necessarily personal. “If that’s betrayed, it’s a shockingly intimate form of betrayal,” he said. “It’s like a marriage breaking down.” Matthew Warchus, the Old Vic’s artistic director, programmed “Mood Music” on that basis alone. “It’s a really volatile subject: the paradox of two people fighting violently and emotionally over something that should be beautiful and life-enhancing,” he explained. Mr. Penhall has a few close collaborations of his own — though none that have soured as starkly as those of his protagonists. This is, for instance, the fourth time he has worked with Roger Michell, who directed his breakthrough play, the psychiatric-hospital-set “Blue/Orange” in 2000. “There’s one collaborator who really gets you and you get them, and there’s something about that chemistry,” he said of Mr. Michell. “You have to trust them implicitly.” “Mood Music” is not a #MeToo play — not directly. Written and programmed before allegations were made against Harvey Weinstein, there’s nothing sexually untoward between Mr. Penhall’s protagonists, played by Ben Chaplin and Seána Kerslake. Their relationship is as platonic as it is vitriolic, but in picking at the power dynamics of a creative industry, it feels entirely on point. Stories of sexism in the music industry are rife — like the male critical response to Joni Mitchell or Björk’s recent complaints about ceding credit to her male collaborators. In February, an academic study by Stacey L. Smith of the University of Southern California found that, of the 600 most popular songs in the past five years, just 12.3 percent were written by women. Female producers were even more rare: sometimes as little as 2 percent. Despite that, Mr. Penhall, who started his career as a cub music reporter (“I know what it’s like to be in a room with a rock star,” he said), doesn’t believe the music industry is “inherently patriarchal.” Rather, he blames commercialism: “You’re selling to a mass audience, and a mass audience isn’t necessarily forward thinking. The market is domineering and brutal and coercive.” The effect is to turn people into products — particularly female artists, whose personal lives become part of the package. “It’s not just monetizing talent, it’s monetizing trauma,” Mr. Penhall said. “That’s true of every artist, whether you’re Picasso or Miley Cyrus, but I think it’s more acute with songs because it’s more naked. The whole industry has exploited heartbreak and sex.” The Old Vic is on something of a roll — its musical “Girl from the North Country,” with songs by Bob Dylan, won two Oliviers this month, and Mr. Warchus said it would “certainly” come to New York — but it’s also dealing with the fallout of its own #MeToo moment. Until 2015, it was run by Kevin Spacey, one of the first people to face accusations of sexual harassment and assault. Though Mr. Warchus stressed that the issue in this instance was about “a person rather than an institution,” he believes “Mood Music” cuts to the issue’s core. “The sexual side of things is the sensational side, the headline, but it’s not really the interesting side of any of this,” he said. “We really do need to have a hard think about how we deal with power, because people are always going to have power over others.” Plenty of creative industries feed on hierarchical distinctions. “It happens in our world all the time,” Ms. Kerslake said. Actors end up kowtowing to producers and directors. “The funny part of our job is that you actually have to give over control sometimes.” Playing such a toxic relationship onstage is a challenge of its own. Mr. Chaplin, who took on the producer part when Rhys Ifans dropped out for “family reasons,” recognizes the responsibility that comes with representing an abuse of power. “I don’t want it to appear easy,” Mr. Chaplin insisted. At the same time, acting such a part can take its toll: “Doing it night after night, you inevitably start feeling battered.” Widely regarded as one of the sharpest script-polishers in Hollywood, Mr. Penhall has had his share of unsatisfying artistic encounters in an industry he likened to “a sausage factory.” He said he’s walked away from several sizable projects uncredited, including the Oscar-winning film “The Last King of Scotland.” “I didn’t want a credit because I didn’t think it was worth a credit,” he said. It’s his way of retaining creative control. “If it stinks, it stinks,” he said bluntly. “Life’s too short, and I don’t need the dough. Nobody needs money that much to traduce themselves.” With “Mindhunter,” Mr. Penhall knew exactly what he was getting into: a big-budget setup with a collaborative writing process — “but I wanted to do that.” He submitted to its rigmarole, partly to work with the director David Fincher, but mostly for the chance to write something expansive. (And, as in many of his plays, the series, about the early days of the FBI’s criminal psychology unit, allows him to explore a favorite subject of his: abnormality.) At it turned out, “Mindhunter” afforded Mr. Penhall more creative control than expected. “I was free,” he said. “I could write what I wanted to write. The budget was enormous. The subject was as dark as you could possibly get.” “This is what’s glorious about how the industry’s evolved in the last couple of years,” he said of the advent of streaming services. “It’s now incumbent upon you to be as distinctive and original and challenging as possible. That’s the status quo.” It might still be a production line, but, Mr. Penhall said, “you can still make your own sausages.”",The New York Times
2018,Hidden Stash of Valuable Drawings Found in Walls of Artist’s Home,"Perhaps you know the jubilant feeling that comes from finding loose change under a couch cushion. City officials in Boise, Idaho, recently made an unexpected discovery that was much more significant, unearthing thousands of dollars’ worth of drawings by a well-known artist hidden in the walls of his own home. They stumbled across 11 never-before-seen works by James Castle, a prolific figure best known for his creative use of soot, spit and other everyday materials to create a wide range of sophisticated landscapes and portraits. This isn’t the first time Castle’s work has been found stashed on his property. To add to the mystery, no one seems to know why the drawings were concealed. “I think we were kind of more in shock than anything,” said Rachel Reichert, the cultural sites manager for the Boise City Department of Arts and History. The discovery happened because of a demolition. The city of Boise had acquired Castle’s house in 2015, intending to preserve the property, which also included a small shed where Castle worked. The goal was to convert it into a cultural center while paying tribute to the artist. Castle (1899-1977) was born deaf and never really learned how to read, write, speak or use sign language properly. But from a very young age, he had developed a love of drawing with sticks or other materials he found while rummaging through trash. Eventually, he became a renowned outsider artist — a term used for those who were self-taught and working outside mainstream institutions — who rose to prominence in the 1950s. In late December, a team of four from the city arts and history department was working in Castle’s house in the midst of the restoration. They had begun a process called investigative demolition, taking off outer Sheetrock layers to assess the underlying structure and configuration of the 2,000-square-foot home. It wasn’t long before the team found wall cavities that hadn’t been seen for 75 years or more. Nestled in a small crevice at the bottom of a living room wall were tobacco bags, socks, drawing utensils, a lone marble and 10 drawings. Another work was found in a bedroom. All of the sketches were made with soot and spit. “I think everyone’s reaction in the room was pretty hushed,” Byron Folwell, an architect on the team, said. He added: “We were kind of in awe. There wasn’t a lot of exuberant yelling.” The drawings included a strikingly detailed portrait of the exterior of the very house in which the hoard was discovered. There was also a series of smaller sketches on what appeared to be an envelope. At the top left, emblazoned in capital letters, was a return address for the Los Angeles-based Western Auto Supply Company. “The work itself was really on point for the time period and the location,” Mr. Folwell said. The Castle family moved into the house at the end of 1931, and Castle lived there until he died. It was originally a one-room farm structure, before several additions were made in the ensuing decades. Ms. Reichert said that the 11 sketches were difficult to date because Castle would often hold onto materials for long periods, but that they were most likely made between 1930 and 1950. The collection was sent to Castle’s estate, which authenticated it and immediately gave it back to the city as a gift, along with 50 other works. The estate valued the recently discovered drawings at a total of $75,000, and said that all 61 drawings included in the gift were worth $1.1 million. All of the works will be on display when the restored Castle house opens to the public on April 28. Although the discovery may have been unexpected for the city, it didn’t surprise Castle’s estate. His pieces have been found all over the property for years, according to Jacqueline Crist, the managing partner of the James Castle Collection and Archive, who added that news of the most recent find was met with a shrug by Castle’s family members. “Castle hid his work in unusual spaces,” Ms. Crist said. “He would bundle his drawings up on rafters. He’d hide them under foundations of a barn.” The only question is why. No one is completely sure. “I guess we’ll never know,” Ms. Crist said. “We can only assume that these were things that were precious to him.”",The New York Times
2018,High Blood Pressure Tied to Pregnancy Loss,"Women whose blood pressure is high before they are pregnant may be at increased risk for miscarriage, a new study has found. Researchers used data from a study of 1,228 women attempting pregnancy after having previously lost a baby. Of the 797 who achieved pregnancy, 188, or almost a quarter, lost the baby again. The study, in Hypertension, found no association of blood pressure with the ability to get pregnant. But after adjusting for smoking, body mass index, marital status, education, race and other factors, they found that for each 10-point increase in pre-pregnancy diastolic blood pressure — the bottom number in a blood pressure reading — there was a 17 percent increase in the risk of pregnancy loss. There are many reasons for miscarriage, and often the cause is unknown. But inflammation and blood vessel impairment, which are characteristic of hypertension, are also known to be involved in pregnancy loss. “Our study is observational and cannot be used to show cause and effect,” said the lead author, Carrie J. Nobles, an epidemiologist with the National Institutes of Health. Still, she pointed out that in addition to its potential effects on pregnancy, high blood pressure can raise the risk for cardiovascular disease. “Maintaining good blood pressure is important even beyond reproductive health,” she said.",The New York Times
2018,High Points,"Wordplay FRIDAY PUZZLE — Hi everybody! Deb is fine — bright-eyed and bushy-tailed and grazing in the desert with her beautiful family. Today’s grid by Joe Krozel is subtly amazing in a number of ways that might not knock the solver in us over the head, but will delicately slip into the constructor part of our collective brain. First of all, it’s a pangram — all 26 letters appear in the grid. It has 90 degree symmetry — go ahead, spin it and see if you don’t remember a past incarnation or want to chirp like a chicken. This puzzle also has a “Freshness Factor” in the 100th percentile. The “FF” is based on an algorithm that rates every puzzle’s clues in terms of their historical frequency in the Times puzzle.* This could have something (O.K., a lot) to do with the next interesting statistic: word length. This grid includes words that range in length from five to eight letters only, meaning that there are no lil’ gimmes to cling to as you ascend its rocky face. Of course Mr. Krozel had to make the mountain; it’s no mean feat to rely on such limited options when constructing. On a less objective note (although I’m sure I missed a few other stats, feel free to berate me in the comments), I was really gobsmacked that this puzzle managed to include all of those interesting aspects without being contorted in its cluing. I found a paltry two clues that seemed awkward to me, UNNAILED and IV TUBE, and one can often find more crosswordese to quibble about on most days. Several of the 11 debuts were surprising in their mundanity, including ZIPPERED, JAILABLE, UNMIXED and OVERDOSE; ROUSEY seems like a name that would have cropped up by now and will surely appear again. 1A: It’s Friday, so there’s going to be some extra rope on a few clues with which you may hang yourself. “One talking a blue streak?” makes one think of a “Chatty Patty” type, but the blue in this case means ribald, and the talker is not a “curser” nor a “cursor” but a CUSSER. 15A: When I think of those human evolution timelines, they usually consist of a fish becoming a monkey becoming a tall guy becoming some fat, hunched-over desk jockey, so I didn’t anticipate CRANIA as an answer. But it makes perfect sense, since our skulls have changed so much as our brains grew ever larger and our posture straightened, for a while at least. Did we come all this way just to get “text neck?” 23A: Another instance of extra rope; I tossed in “mess hall” at first instead of MESS TENT. The two are equally common in the crossword puzzle and seem to be used interchangeably, but a hall seems much more permanent than a tent. I could use a “mess tent” myself, actually, just me, my sleeping bag and my mess. 35A: I suspect that this is the lid on the most challenging quarter of the puzzle, although we all have different bailiwicks. MPEG FILE doesn’t quite fill itself in on crosses, does it? Since it’s my job today, I indulged the frisson of curiosity I felt about MPEG and found out that the acronym is for the Moving Pictures Experts Group, who are actual people, a subset of the International Organization for Standardization, also actual people, who seek to herd the many cat videos in this world into a homogeneous format so that everyone in said world can enjoy them. 42A: One more that could be a gotcha: “Not abundant” means “scarce” but it also means SPARSE. 14D: Why is it that big, burly cars so often get named after marginalized people (Cherokee, Touareg) or places of majestic beauty like Tahoes, Denalis, the Yukons or Dodge DURANGOS? Big cars aren’t good for wilderness; they need roads and they tend to pollute. A good name for an S.U.V. would be 47A. When I hear the names of actual S.U.V.s I think of horses running across some unspoiled plain. Or “The Simpsons,” of course: 29D: “Acted evasively” should probably be read as a neutral description; great when you’re a ship maneuvering past enemy submarines, as an example, but more commonly dishonorable when you’re avoiding questions, responsibility or consequences of your actions. When you’ve WEASELED out of something you’ve most likely done the latter. Weasels are reputed villains in human history going way back, and there are astoundingly weird traits ascribed to them that have informed people’s opinion of them for millenniums. Most of these traits are total fantasy; thank goodness we have science now, to conquer superstition and misinformation. 34D: The classification of stars has evolved so much that there’s no logic to the order without a back story. Suffice to say, Rigel and Spica are B STARS, and I believe they’re far hotter than our own sun, a dwarf G star. 37D: I got this term for a shin plate, GREAVE, on the crosses, but looked up the anatomy of a suit of armor just to see what terms we might have in use today. There’s a plackart and a helm, and a “fauld” where a knight would articulate his or her waist, but there’s a wide array of interesting vocabulary there that could be a theme for someone, someday, if you were looking. Most solvers probably noticed the wide open spaces of today’s puzzle. It’s a 56-worder … or, technically, a 55-worder if you consider that 7-Down and 12-Down are connected. I almost missed this last feature when constructing: In fact, the puzzle was just about in the envelope when I looked it over one last time for any pair of entries which might be concatenated to form something familiar. (Will once did this when recluing an early puzzle of mine, and it really left an impression on me.) So I looked and I was rewarded with this astronomically unlikely linkage … within the same quadrant of all places. It’s even more outrageous that 31-Across was initially ISLED, which would mask the link I sought. So, anyone betting that 7-Down and 12-Down were the first two words in the puzzle just lost a sum of money. In actuality, the starters in that quadrant weren’t words at all: They were the letters J and Q … successively placed at every credible pair of starting squares until some fill emerged. The inspiration for this was Patrick Berry’s July 15, 2006, puzzle which used the same grid that also contained those same two letters in a common quadrant. I was truly impressed with his effort to make a Scrabbly low-word puzzle, and for over a decade I decided I would take it one step further and produce a pangram. That decade involved not only fortifying my word list with new lively short entries, but also removing weak entries at every step: I produced many many failed attempts — containing unacceptable entries — until I finally achieved the quality of today’s puzzle. So, enjoy. Dizzy, huh? Stare at one spot on the wall and take a peek at the answer key. While the answers are free to everyone, the Crossword puzzles require a subscription.

2018,Higher Property Taxes? You May Be Able to Appeal,"Your Money Adviser If your property tax bills are increasing, you’re not alone. The average tax bill in 2017 was about $3,400, or 3 percent higher than the prior year, according to a report published on Thursday by Attom Data Solutions, which analyzed tax information on 86 million single-family homes across the country. Of course, tax bills were much higher in some markets. The report identified nine counties with average property taxes greater than $10,000 — most of them in the New York area, led by Westchester County ($17,179). Property taxes are typically the second largest cost for homeowners after their mortgage, said Daren Blomquist, senior vice president at Attom Data. Real estate taxes fund local governments, allowing them to operate schools and parks, pick up trash and provide emergency services and other functions. The higher tax bills reflect, in part, rising home values in many markets, as residential property continues its recovery from the real estate downturn. In some areas, the report said, local budget needs are pushing tax rates higher. The effective tax rate — the average annual property tax, as a percentage of the average estimated market value of homes in each area — was about 1.2 percent, around the same as the year before, Attom Data reported. States with the highest effective property tax rates included New Jersey, Illinois, Vermont, Texas and New Hampshire, all of which were above 2 percent. If you’ve received your formal tax bill, it may be too late to file an appeal — sometimes called an abatement request. Typically, cities and towns first send out a notice of assessment, showing how your home is valued for tax purposes. Property owners then have a certain amount of time to challenge the assessment, though the period varies from state to state and even city to city. Some areas give a two-week window, while others may allow several months. Assessors are generally strict about filing dates, so if you file paperwork late, your appeal may not be heard. “You really need to know those deadlines,” said Aaron Vansant, a partner with DonovanFingar, a Birmingham, Ala., law firm specializing in real estate matters. Property tax experts suggest taking some basic steps to check the accuracy of your property’s valuation. If you added on to your house, your tax bill will probably be higher. But if the assessment shows that your home has four bathrooms, and you know it has two and a half, that’s an error that should be corrected. You may be able to have the mistake fixed with a simple phone call to the assessor’s office, depending on the department’s workload. “It never hurts to pick up a phone and call,” said Risë E. Rosen, a property tax lawyer in Mineola, N.Y. If you do file an appeal, you’ll need some data to back up your claim. That could be sales data for homes comparable to yours, provided by a real estate agent. Or, it could be a formal appraisal. The National Taxpayers Union offers tips on its website, including attending an appeals board hearing to get a feel for the process. Mr. Vansant said he expected more homeowners to appeal property assessments next year because of recent changes in federal income tax law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, signed into law last year, capped the deduction for state and local taxes at $10,000, so more homeowners may push back on higher property tax bills, he said. Here are some questions and answers about property taxes: How is my home valued for property tax purposes? Tax bills are based on the market value of your home, or a percentage of its full market value, multiplied by a local tax rate — often known as a millage rate. (One “mill” equals $1 per $1,000 of assessed value.) Often, assessor departments provide examples online, to show how your town’s bills are calculated. Do I get a discount for property taxes that are paid on my main home? Many areas allow for a “homestead” exemption, which provides a discount or credit on your tax bill if the property is your main home. If you don’t see the exemption noted on your tax bill, check with your assessor to make sure you are getting the credit to which you are entitled. Also, some areas may offer a discount if you pay your taxes early, Mr. Vansant said. How much will I pay for a property appraisal? Fees vary, but an appraisal for a real estate tax appeal will probably cost $300 to $500, said Jim Murrett, president of the Appraisal Institute, a professional association of real estate appraisers.",The New York Times
2018,Highlights From Zuckerberg’s Day 2 Testimony: DealBook Briefing,"Good Wednesday. Here’s what we’re watching: • Mark Zuckerberg is back on Capitol Hill. • Why would a trade war with China be good for the United States economy? • Has Facebook opened itself up to regulation? • Bank of America’s move on gun sales. • Why did the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of N.Y. recuse himself from the Michael Cohen raid? Want this in your inbox each morning? Sign up here. Mark Zuckerberg’s second day of Congressional grilling lifted its shares again. The stock rose 0.8 percent, even as the broader market dropped 0.6 percent. While it remains to be seen whether Mr. Zuckerberg’s performance will keep regulations at bay, his testimony was certainly a tonic for investors. Facebook’s two-day rise of more than 5 percent added over $24 billion to its market capitalization, according to Bloomberg data. Ali Mogharabi, a Morningstar analyst, offered this takeaway from the two-days of testimony: “Zuckerberg appears willing to work with lawmakers on possible regulations, which may create a barrier to entry in the social network space and help Facebook maintain its market leadership.” — Matt Phillips Mark Zuckerberg is back on Capitol Hill for a second day of congressional testimony. Here are some highlights : • Representative Greg Walden, Republican of Oregon and chair of the Energy and Commerce Committee, kicked off the hearing by declaring that “while Facebook has certainly grown, I worry it has not matured.” Mr. Walden floated the prospect of regulation, saying that “I think it is time to ask whether Facebook may have moved too fast and broken too many things.” • Mr. Walden also asked: “What exactly is Facebook?” The definitions matter. If Facebook is viewed as a telecommunications service that is more like a utility, it may be regulated by the Federal Communications Commission. If lawmakers define Facebook as a publisher, it could also fall under regulations at that agency. “I consider us to be a technology company,” Mr. Zuckerberg answered. “The primary thing we do is have engineers that write code and build services for other people.” • Representative Frank Pallone, a New Jersey Democrat, pressed Mr. Zuckerberg on whether Facebook would agree or refuse to change Facebook’s default settings to minimize collection and use of users’ data. “This is a complex issue that deserves more than a one-word answer,” Mr. Zuckerberg answered. “That’s disappointing to me,” Mr. Pallone responded. • California Democrat Anna Eshoo put it more bluntly, asking Mr. Zuckerberg: “Are you willing to change your business model to protect users’ privacy?” Mr. Zuckerberg was noncommittal, saying: “Congresswoman, I’m not sure what that means.” • Representative Joe Barton, Republican of Texas, pressed Mr. Zuckerberg on why Facebook has been allegedly censoring content from conservative organizations and Trump supporters such as Diamond and Silk. Mr. Barton also asked Mr. Zuckerberg if he would agree that Facebook would work to ensure it is “a neutral public platform.” “I do agree that we should give people a voice,” Mr. Zuckerberg said. • Rep. Gene Green, a Texas Democrat, and Jan Schakowsky, an Illinois Democrat, pressed Mr. Zuckerberg’s promise to give users worldwide the same privacy controls required by a tough new data protection law which will go into effect in the European Union next month. Mr. Green also asked Mr. Zuckerberg if Facebook planned to comply with the provision in the European law that allows individuals to obtain a copy of the data companies hold about them. • A number of lawmakers have tried to draw a comparison between the Obama campaign’s use of a Facebook app to scrape data from users and their friends in 2012 and Cambridge Analytica. Those lawmakers have failed to mention one very important distinction between the Obama campaign’s app and Cambridge Analytica’s app: The Obama app was actually on Facebook itself, and it was very clear about who and what the data would be used for. The app used to scrape data for Cambridge Analytica was accessed through a personality questionnaire hosted on a site outside of Facebook, and it appeared to users to be for academic research, not for a political data company owned by a wealthy Republican donor and dedicated to reshaping the American electorate. Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, made an appearance on “CBS This Morning” and weighed in on the Facebook controversy. Mr. Musk told co-host Gayle King: “I think whenever something is – whenever there’s something that affects the public good then there does need to be some form of public oversight. … I do think there should be some regulations on AI. I think there should be regulations on social media to the degree that it negatively affects the public good. We can’t have like willy-nilly proliferation of fake news, that’s crazy. You can’t have more types of fake news than real news. That’s allowing public deception to go unchecked. That’s crazy.” Andrew writes: These were the most important words from Mark Zuckerberg’s five-hour testimony: “I agree we are responsible for the content.” They may come back to haunt him, given his previous rejection of calling Facebook a publisher. He later backtracked and called his business a tech company, but his acknowledgment may fundamentally shift the conversation — and how the company operates. (All in all, Mr. Zuckerberg did better than anyone had expected.) More from Peter Eavis: Lawmakers now seem much more aware of how much power large technology companies have. This was encapsulated in questions posed by Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina. He framed Facebook as a monopoly and brought up the possibility of regulating Facebook, asking Mr. Zuckerberg: “But you as a company welcome regulation?” And Facebook may now only be one big scandal away from a more stringent government response. Critics’ corner • Paul Pendergrass writes, “If Mr. Zuckerberg can convince lawmakers and users that he is the most capable and determined person to fix his company’s problems, then the company can start turning the corner on this crisis.” • Kara Swisher of Recode tweeted that Mr. Zuckerberg won yesterday’s hearing “not because he was so good (he was fine if a little flat), but because the senators really dropped every single ball possible.” • Sara Fischer and Dan Primack of Axios write, “Mark Zuckerberg on Tuesday morphed from a shy tech nerd into a confident business executive who ran circles around lawmakers.” • Shira Ovide of Gadfly writes: “Zuckerberg believes he’s giving users control, but he’s giving them the illusion of control. And that means the consent of Facebook users is not informed.” Elsewhere in Facebook: Robert and Rebekah Mercer have tried to mend fences with the tech giant on behalf of Cambridge Analytica. Some user data obtained by the quiz app behind the scandal included private messages. Facebook collects more info about you than you realized. And could Instagram help bail out its parent company? That’s the question Jack Ma, the founder of Alibaba, said he is struggling currently to understand. “Under a symbiotic U.S.-China relationship, America became a preeminent technology leader, and its brands are today the envy of the world. China improved the standard of living of its citizens with a tenfold increase in per capita gross domestic product over the past 20 years.” But that relationship will change over the next two decades, Mr. Ma said: “China is shifting its economy from the world’s largest exporter to the world’s largest consumer. Chinese citizens now have the wealth and income to pursue discretionary spending. They want to buy high-quality imported food, cosmetics, fashions and health and wellness products for themselves and their children.” Mr. Ma goes on to write: “It is therefore ironic that the U.S. administration is waging a trade war at a time when the largest potential consumer market in the world is open for business. Is America going to forfeit this opportunity? Instigating a trade war is the wrong solution because it will only provoke retaliation. The Chinese government responded to U.S. tariff threats with its own tariffs on American agricultural products, such as soybeans. China is the largest export market for American soybeans, worth $14 billion annually and accounting for 65 percent of all U.S. soybean exports. The U.S. has been a consistent defender of free and open markets, but this time it is resorting to protectionism that will not improve American competitiveness. Any country seeking to increase exports would do better to focus on developing good products and channels to access foreign markets rather than putting up trade barriers.” Shares of CBS are down 1.9 percent and Viacom’s stock is off nearly 1 percent after CNBC reported that Shari Redstone is likely to replace Les Moonves, the chief executive of CBS, if a deal isn’t reached with Viacom. Shari Redstone, whose National Amusements controls CBS and Viacom, is seeking to combine the two media companies. From Reuters: “Her longtime friend and business ally, powerful CBS Chief Executive Les Moonves, has emerged as one of the biggest obstacles to a potential CBS-Viacom tie-up, according to people familiar with the matter. Concerns are that his objections could either doom the transaction or that he might not lead the new entity, the people said. “Moonves is chafing at Redstone’s insistence on installing Viacom’s CEO as his second-in-command and likely successor of a merged company, the people say.” Add the U.S.’s second-biggest bank to the list of financial firms wading into the gun control debate. Bank of America said it would stop lending money to companies that make military-inspired firearms for civilians, such as AR-15-style rifles. Bank of America works with “just a handful” of such manufacturers, according to its vice chairwoman Anne Finucane. Their reactions? “Mixed,” she said. (Still unclear: how this affects Remington Outdoor, which owns Bushmaster and is getting through Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeds with the aid of an asset-backed loan from Bank of America and several other institutions.) The DealBook tally of financial firms that have taken steps to limit gun sales: Citigroup, Amalgamated, BlackRock, Bank of America. (Know of another? Do tell us.) Why did Geoffrey Berman, the Trump-appointed interim U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, which oversaw the F.B.I. searches, recuse himself from the case? DealBook readers might recall that Mr. Berman was a longtime lawyer for Deutsche Bank, one of the few major banks that lent money to Trump in recent years. On the legal issues behind the raid: Though President Trump has complained on Twitter that “attorney-client privilege is dead” after the F.B.I.’s searches at his personal lawyer’s office and hotel room, DealBook’s Peter Henning explains why that’s not the case. (So does George Conway, the husband of Kellyanne Conway.) More on Mr. Cohen: The F.B.I. sought records related to payments to Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal, who claim to have had affairs with Mr. Trump. And how the lawyer attracted federal attention. • Robert Mueller corner: President Trump is still seething about the special counsel, and advisers worry he will try to fire him or the deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein. He sought to shut down Mr. Mueller’s investigation in December, the NYT has reported, though it’s disputed whether he could fire him directly. Republican leaders in Congress still oppose legislation to protect the special counsel. • What the tariffs on imported metal have cost a Pennsylvania manufacturer.

(Axios) Mr. Deripaska in particular is suffering from the U.S. sanctions against associates of President Vladimir Putin and their companies. According to analysts, traders and bankers , he may soon need Russian government support to stay afloat: Shares in Rusal, the aluminum producer he controls, have fallen 55 percent since Friday, when the sanctions were unveiled. It’s a humbling blow to Mr. Deripaska, who has sought Western acceptance. A former State Department official told Bloomberg he “had it coming.” The pain isn’t likely to end. A top U.S. Treasury Department official has warned of “consequences” if British firms continued to do business with sanctioned companies. After the two companies failed to reach a deal last year (and in 2014, and 2011), they’re back in talks, Michael hears. Shares in both companies jumped — Sprint 17 percent, T-Mobile 5.7 percent — after the WSJ reported on the restart. It’s not exactly a surprise. SoftBank’s Masa Son bought control of Sprint planning to merge it with T-Mobile, the better to fight Verizon and AT&T. And most analysts agree that both companies need to become bigger to survive. • The F.C.C. is reportedly pushing back on part of Sinclair’s plan to win approval of the $3.9 billion acquisition of Tribune — selling Tribune TV stations in New York City and Chicago to companies affiliated with the broadcaster’s founding family.

2018,Hillary Clinton Avoids Direct Reference to Comey Memos in Speech,"In her first public appearance since James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, began his book tour, Hillary Clinton made only a glancing reference to him in a speech on Sunday night and instead focused most of her attacks on President Trump, once again likening him to authoritarians. Mrs. Clinton gave the Arthur Miller Freedom to Write Lecture at PEN America’s World Voices Festival in New York City. She spoke at length about threats to journalists around the world before turning her attention to domestic matters. She criticized Mr. Trump, not so subtly comparing him to authoritarian leaders who had suppressed journalism in their countries. “Today, we have a president who seems to reject the role of a free press in our democracy,” she said. “Although obsessed with his own press coverage, he evaluates it based not on whether it provides knowledge or understanding, but solely on whether the daily coverage helps him and hurts his opponents.” After listing more examples of Mr. Trump’s attacks on the news media, Mrs. Clinton said, “Now given his track record, is it any surprise that, according to the latest round of revelations, he joked about throwing reporters in jail to make them ‘talk’?” She was referring to the newly declassified memos that Mr. Comey kept, recounting his private conversations with Mr. Trump. According to those notes, Mr. Comey and Mr. Trump agreed that those who leaked classified information should be aggressively prosecuted. Mr. Comey said he was in favor of “putting a head on a pike as a message.” Mr. Trump, according to Mr. Comey’s telling, suggested that reporters who publish the leaks should be jailed, adding: “They spend a couple days in jail, make a new friend, and they are ready to talk.” Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump have exchanged barbs since he entered the White House. She has repeatedly questioned his fitness for office, and Mr. Trump has frequently called her “Crooked Hillary” in posts on Twitter. After her remarks, which were at the Cooper Union, Mrs. Clinton participated in an onstage interview with the author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. During the conversation, Mrs. Clinton revisited her election loss at great length. When Ms. Adichie asked if Mrs. Clinton had fought back enough during the campaign, the former Democratic nominee conceded that she had not. “I was really struggling with it, and I concluded — as I was, I think, expecting myself to — ‘O.K., you just have to be calm and in control because ultimately, what the country wants is somebody who is not going to be blowing up in the Oval Office,’” Mrs. Clinton said. She went on: “They want somebody who is going to be able to deal with the problems. Well, you know that did not work out so well.” The White House did not respond to a request for comment.",The New York Times
2018,Hints of Human Evolution in Chimpanzees That Endure a Savanna’s Heat,"Matter The apes of Senegal’s Fongoli savanna may offer hints to how our own ancestors moved out of the woodlands, shed their fur and started walking upright. A male chimpanzee drinking at a waterhole in Fongoli, a Senegalese savanna. Temperatures at Fongoli can reach 110 degrees Fahrenheit or more.CreditCreditFrans Lanting/lanting.com Nine years later, Erin Wessling can still remember the first time she visited Fongoli, a savanna in southeast Senegal. “You feel like you walk into an oven,” she said. Temperatures at Fongoli can reach 110 degrees Fahrenheit or more. During every dry season, brush fires sweep across the parched landscape, leaving behind leafless trees and baked, orange soil. “It’s really nuts,” said Ms. Wessling, now a graduate student at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology. Yet Ms. Wessling and her colleagues keep coming back to Fongoli, despite the harsh conditions. That’s because it’s home to some remarkable residents: chimpanzees. To study them, scientists have mostly traveled to African rain forests and woodlands, where the apes live in dense groups. The sparse populations of chimpanzees that live on savannas in western and central Africa are far less understood. Ms. Wessling and her colleagues think there are important lessons to be learned from chimps like the ones at Fongoli. Because they are our closest living relatives, they may even tell us something about our own deep history. Millions of years ago, our apelike ancestors gradually moved from woodlands to savannas and began walking upright at some point. The Fongoli chimpanzees demonstrate just how difficult that transition would have been — and how that challenge may have driven some major changes in our evolution, from evolving sweat glands to losing fur and walking upright. The savanna became the subject of long-term research in 2000, when Ms. Wessling’s undergraduate adviser at Iowa State University, Jill D. Pruetz, first paid a visit. Surveying Fongoli, Dr. Pruetz decided it would be a good place to observe the differences between chimpanzee life on a savanna compared to forests. In forests, for example, chimpanzees typically thrive on a diet of ripe fruit. That’s a rare treat on a savanna. But Dr. Pruetz could not simply settle down right away and watch the chimpanzees. At first, the sight of her frightened them off. So Dr. Pruetz and her colleagues let the apes grow accustomed to their company. That alone took four years. At last, in 2004, Dr. Pruetz and her colleagues could follow the chimpanzees from dawn to dusk. “You just have to drink water all day,” said Dr. Pruetz, now a professor at Texas State University. The team gradually built up a catalog of strange behaviors — ones rarely if ever seen in others. Forest chimpanzees get enough water from the fruit in their diet so they need less drinking water and can wander in search of food. The Fongoli chimps, by contrast, required daily drinking water and anchored themselves to reliable water sources in the arid landscape. And while forest chimpanzees are active throughout the day, Dr. Pruetz found that the savanna chimpanzees rest for five to seven hours. Dr. Pruetz could often find them lurking in small caves in the dry season, and when the rainy season arrived, the chimpanzees would slip into newly formed ponds and bob there for hours. Forest chimpanzees typically spend all night in nests they build in trees. But at Fongoli, the research team noticed that the chimpanzees often made a late-night racket. Staying up all night to watch them, Dr. Pruetz discovered that they spent hours after sundown searching for food. “It might as well have been a daytime scene,” she said. All these odd behaviors suggested that the chimps were struggling to cope with Fongoli’s harsh conditions. But all Dr. Pruetz’s observations couldn’t reveal what was happening inside their bodies. “I didn’t know how stressed they were,” she said. In 2014, Ms. Wessling set out to get an answer — by collecting chimpanzee urine. Like humans, chimpanzees have molecules in their urine that reflect their physical condition. When they feel stress, for example, they make the hormone cortisol. The pancreas produces a substance called c-peptide in response to food. Its levels can reflect whether chimpanzees are getting enough energy. If a chimpanzee gets dehydrated, the protein creatinine builds up in its urine. Scientists regularly gather urine from forest chimpanzees, but there, they need only go under a tall tree and hold out a leaf. On the savanna, Ms. Wessling would have to wait until a chimpanzee ambled away from where it had urinated. By the time she reached the spot, the urine might have already seeped into the ground or evaporated. “You basically watch your sample disappear,” Ms. Wessling said. From 20 chimps, Ms. Wessling gathered 368 urine samples that were taken back to Germany for analysis. The chimps’ c-peptide levels showed they ate a decent amount of food, and possibly termites to get additional calories. While that was an indicator of a healthy diet, analyses of the two other compounds told another story. Many of the chimps had produced high levels of cortisol, indicating that life on the savanna could be very stressful. And their creatinine levels were also high, evidence that the heat of the savanna caused them to become dehydrated. For all the ways that the Fongoli chimps tried to protect themselves from the heat, it still punished them. “These chimps are sort of right at the edge of what they can do,” Dr. Pruetz said. “This really gives you the biological basis of it.” The research was published earlier this month in the Journal of Human Evolution. To scientists who study human evolution, the Fongoli chimpanzees offer some intriguing parallels to our ancestors millions of years ago. Studies of DNA indicate that our two evolutionary branches split roughly seven million years ago. The earliest members of our branch (known as hominins) may have been chimp-like in some respects, growing fur and walking through forests on their knuckles. Over millions of years, Africa’s rain forests retreated into patchworks, as savannas expanded. In eastern and southern Arica, hominins moved into open habitats, eventually reaching arid grasslands — places as daunting for survival as Fongoli. “How and when hominins got better at coping with heat is a fascinating, unsolved problem,” said Daniel E. Lieberman, a paleoanthropologist at Harvard. The results from Fongoli suggest that a chimpanzee-like ancestor might have eked out an existence on an east African savanna. Food might not pose the biggest challenge. Instead, they would be hard-pressed by the heat. Early hominins might have used some of the strategies documented in Fongoli, like staying near water and shifting a lot of activity from day to night. But even so, early hominins would have still suffered stress. That stress might have only been overcome when hominins evolved new physical adaptations. Humans have skin glands that let us sweat much more than chimpanzees, for example. The origin of our upright posture might also be intertwined with our struggle with heat. Some researchers have proposed that early hominins began standing to aid in reaching fruit hanging from trees. Peter Wheeler, of Liverpool John Moores University, has suggested that an upright posture would have helped hominins stay cool in an arid environment. On the savanna, walking tall might mean walking cool. Dr. Pruetz suspects Dr. Wheeler may be right, and she hopes to study the Fongoli chimpanzees more to test his idea. The chimpanzees may shift their posture — as far as they can with an ape anatomy — in order to cope with the high temperatures. It’s now possible to get close enough to measure the heat flowing from the chimpanzees with a thermal imaging camera. “We really haven’t had that opportunity before,” she said. “There’s a lot of fun stuff we can do.”",The New York Times
2018,His Father Aided a Dictator. Paraguay Elected Him President.,"ASUNCIÓN, Paraguay — Paraguay’s governing Colorado Party won Sunday’s presidential election as Mario Abdo Benítez, a conservative former senator, defeated his rival, Efraín Alegre, a former lawmaker from a center-left coalition. Mr. Abdo Benítez’s presidential bid evoked memories of Paraguay’s dictatorship from 1954 to 1989 because his father was the personal secretary of Alfredo Stroessner, the despotic military leader who ruled the small South American nation during those years. The election extended the Colorado Party’s dominance in Paraguayan politics and solidified the rightward political shift in South America. Mr. Abdo Benítez belongs to a more conservative wing of the party than the departing president, Horacio Cartes. His election follows transitions of power in Argentina, Brazil and Chile, where conservative or center-right leaders have defeated socialist parties in recent years. The party has held on to the presidency since 1945 with the exception of an electoral defeat in 2008 by Fernando Lugo, who was impeached and removed from office in 2012. Election officials declared Mr. Abdo Benítez’s victory shortly after 9 p.m., after more than 96 percent of votes had been tallied. He won by about four percentage points, an outcome far closer than polls had suggested. Mr. Abdo Benítez struck a conciliatory tone as he thanked supporters on Sunday night. “We have built a project that touched the heart of the people and that seeks unity for Paraguay,” he said. There was significant overlap in the initiatives that both candidates campaigned on. Mr. Abdo Benítez and Mr. Alegre vowed to strengthen the country’s judiciary with the aim of making Paraguay more attractive to foreign investors. And they promised to overhaul the tax system to improve the economy. The candidates also backed a gender parity bill aiming to pave the way for women to play a more prominent role in politics. They also oppose legalizing abortion and same-sex marriage. The lack of radical policy differences made for an election in which the biographies and personal style of the presidential hopefuls loomed large. During the campaign, Mr. Abdo Benítez, a former president of the Senate, did not overtly pay homage to the era when the country was ruled by a dictatorship. But he refrained from disavowing the abuses carried out by the junta during the region’s longest military dictatorship, which included rape, forced disappearances and arbitrary detentions. Mr. Abdo Benítez, 46, appeared keen to elicit the memory of his father, Mario Abdo, on Sunday morning after he cast his ballot. Trailed by reporters, the candidate visited the family mausoleum where his father is buried in Asunción’s Recoleta cemetery. The dictatorship is an abstract idea for many voters in this country of nearly seven million people, where the median age is 25. But the candidacy of Mr. Abdo Benítez clearly rattled young liberals. On Friday night, at a concert featuring psychedelic cumbia and feminist reggaeton at a colonial house in Asunción, Pedro Lezcano, a percussionist, grabbed the microphone and said, “If your folks are Colorados, hide their cédulas,” a reference to the national identity cards required for voting. Attendants clapped and started yelling, “Dictatorship never again!” But some young voters said they favored Mr. Abdo Benítez because of the stories they have heard about life under military rule. “I didn’t live through the dictatorship, but I know that life was good, and I think we could use another period like that,” José Rodríguez, a 19-year-old medical student, said on Sunday night. “There are too many thieves and assaults, and it wasn’t like that before.” Paraguay’s economy has been among the top performers in the region in recent years, even as neighboring Brazil weathered a brutal recession. But the landlocked country remains one of the continent’s poorest and least equitable in terms of wealth. Despite those factors, Mr. Alegre, a former congressman and minister in the Lugo government, said leftist parties had struggled to mount a strong challenge to the governing party because its allies across government give it a built-in advantage. “There are three or four generations of public servants who are Colorados, 95 percent of government officials are Colorados,” he said. “It’s a result of the dictatorship years and successive clientelist governments.”",The New York Times
2018,History May Be a Guide for the Maple Leafs. Just Don’t Tell Their Coach,"TORONTO — For this Toronto Maple Leafs team, despite the franchise’s rich and storied past, it is not the time for history lessons. The Leafs, of course, do not like talking about the Game 7 collapse against the Boston Bruins five years ago. Coach Mike Babcock does not even want to reference the 1992-93 team, which was drubbed in its first two playoff games before going on a magical run to the conference finals. “I don’t go back, even when I’m coaching the team for a series here or a series there,” Babcock said after practice on Wednesday. “To me, they’re all different. As far as what happened to the Leafs in 1993, I don’t know much about it.” Fans who have remained loyal through the tough times will remember. It was the closest the Leafs have come to reaching the Stanley Cup finals since winning the championship in 1967. The 1993 team was beaten, 6-3 and 6-2, in the first two games in Detroit as the Red Wings neutralized Toronto’s leader, Doug Gilmour, with strong, physical play, while the normally combative Wendel Clark received bad press for looking passive and disinterested. This year, Toronto lost Games 1 and 2 in Boston, 5-1 and 7-3, and criticism was directed at Toronto’s best player, Auston Matthews. Many were writing the Leafs’ epitaph for a season in which they established a franchise record for wins (49) and points (105). But in Game 3 at home on Monday, Toronto held off Boston, 4-2, to trim the Bruins’ series lead to 2-1. Game 4 is Thursday. Like the 2018 Leafs, the 1993 team cranked up the emotion and will to win in Game 3, charging back to beat the Red Wings, 4-2. Toronto then evened the series in Game 4, and eventually took Game 7 in Detroit on an overtime goal by Nikolai Borschevsky. Toronto advanced to the conference finals by beating the St. Louis Blues in seven games, but fell short of the Cup finals with a seven-game loss to the Los Angeles Kings. Back in 1993, the Leafs relied on grit and experience. They were powered by Gilmour and Dave Andreychuk, who were approaching their 30th birthdays, and Clark, who was 26 and in his eighth N.H.L. season. Even the last time Toronto won a playoff series, in 2004 against the Ottawa Senators, the Leafs were loaded with veterans and future Hall of Famers like Mats Sundin, then 32; Joe Nieuwendyk, 37; Ron Francis, 40; and goaltender Ed Belfour, 38. Youth and raw talent form the nucleus of this year’s Leafs, which could be a vulnerability. Experience becomes a premium in the playoffs, when handling adversity is as important as handling a puck. Toronto’s top two scorers in the regular season, Mitch Marner and Matthews, are only 20, and the third-leading scorer, William Nylander, is 21. “What you’ve got to remember is these guys are young guys,” Babcock said. “You’ve got to go through some of these slappings in your life and respond and learn how to play.” Boston’s top line is well seasoned, with Brad Marchand, 29, and Patrice Bergeron, 32, who have 179 playoff games between them and have won a Stanley Cup. They are complemented by 21-year-old David Pastrnak, who entered Wednesday’s games as the leading point scorer in the postseason with nine in three games. Among the fresh-faced Leafs, 10 players made their postseason debuts last spring when Toronto lost to the Washington Capitals in six games in the first round. Trying to capitalize on the franchise’s momentum, management sprinkled this year’s lineup with veteran talent like 38-year-old Patrick Marleau, the 36-year-old defenseman Ron Hainsey and 35-year-old Tomas Plekanec. “There was a little more of that wide-eyedness out of guys last year,” forward James van Riemsdyk said. “Now, this year, there is more of that confidence.” Yet optimism started to fade quickly in the playoffs when Nazem Kadri, the team’s shutdown center and 32-goal scorer, was suspended for three games for an illegal hit on Tommy Wingels in Game 1. After the first two games, Toronto’s critics zeroed in on Matthews, who had been held off the score sheet, defenseman Nikita Zaitsev and even Babcock for his matchup and lineup decisions. The coach took heat before Game 3 for promoting Plekanec from the fourth line to the second line between Marleau and Marner. Plekanec had been a disappointment since coming from the Montreal Canadiens in a trade in late February. Yet on Monday, in the familiar checking role he specialized in with Montreal, Plekanec kept the Bruins’ top line scoreless. “He played his best game since he’s been here,” Babcock said. “Maybe just the fact that he maybe didn’t feel as important as he should have when he got here affected his play.” That second line scored a pair of goals, off the stick of Marleau, while Matthews got his first goal of these playoffs. “I thought Auston got the weight of the world off his back,” Babcock said on Wednesday. Despite 13 Stanley Cup championships, trailing only the Canadiens with 24, the Maple Leafs have been mostly a laughable band of losers. They have reached the playoffs only three times since the 2004-5 lockout and share the longest championship drought in the N.H.L. The evidence of a glorious past is everywhere at the Air Canada Centre. The walls outside the dressing room are lined with photos depicting scenes of players from the 1960s like George Armstrong clutching the Stanley Cup and Coach Punch Imlach sipping Champagne in front of a blackboard on which is humorously scrawled, “No practice tomorrow.” Five years ago, Tim Leiweke, the team president at the time, created an uproar by threatening to remove the portraits of the old boys. “We want to put pressure on these guys,” he said then. “I want it to be about them.” But the current team president, Brendan Shanahan, a Hall of Famer player who grew up in the Toronto area, preserved the photos and was a major influence in the creation of Legends Row, the bronze statues placed outside the arena that immortalize the Leafs’ heroes of the past. Babcock said, “I think we just have to keep building the product on the ice so it matches our history.”",The New York Times
2018,Hit After Hit,"Wordplay FRIDAY PUZZLE — Would it be fair to say that most solvers merely read their puzzle clues and fill in their best guess at an answer without giving much thought as to how those clues get there? Constructors and editors spend a lot of time writing and tweaking these snippets so that they will be as fair — and sometimes as devious — as possible to a majority of solvers. It’s not as easy as it looks. To prove that point in a manner that is conclusive, if not a bit underhanded, we’ve secretly planted a recording device in Will Shortz’s office as a way of listening in on his and the digital puzzles editor Joel Fagliano’s conversations. After editing out the lunch orders and petty arguments, we were left with a very interesting conversation, transcribed below, about how to make a clue in David Steinberg’s crossword both tricky and fair. Before you even get there, however, you might have noticed that Mr. Steinberg does something you don’t see every day in a crossword: He deliberately puts in two entries — 1A’s SEETHING and 1D’s SEE THINGS — that could be seen as duplicates because they look so similar in the grid, but they’re really not. Not only that, but he connects them. Pretty daring as crossword entries go, but since the two entries are not etymologically related, it’s a perfectly cromulent idea. Nice work on Mr. Steinberg’s part for debuting I CAN TAKE A HINT, LOSE SLEEP OVER, ETHICAL DILEMMAS and BEER MONEY. 16A: No one would blame you at all if you were thinking of finance with the clue “Do high-level banking?” Today, however, the answer is AVIATE because to bank is to roll the plane and its spoilers so it turns. You’re “high-level” because you are up in the sky. 31A: I had to look this one up because I don’t follow hockey, but there is an N.H.L. team called the Minnesota Wild. Hence “Wild grp.” 65A: Wordplay would like to welcome the entry HALFTONE back to The New York Times Crossword after 44 years. It is a reproduction of a photograph or other image in which the various tones of gray or color are produced by variously sized dots of ink. 66A: Surprise! For those of us who didn’t know, of course. Antarctica, despite its ice cover, is a DESERT. It is extremely dry, and there is very little rain there. 12D: As you’ll discover below in Mr. Shortz’s and Mr. Fagliano’s discussion, fewer people are likely subscribing to CABLE TELEVISION because they are cutting the cord. 47D: A “hit” in this case would be a puff of some substance that gets you stoned, hence the answer STONER for “One getting hit after hit?” As you probably guessed, this puzzle started with SEETHING and SEE THINGS. Really looking forward to seeing how everyone reacts to such a long “dupe” — at 1-Across/1-Down, no less! Working with stacked 8s crossing stacked 9s was brutal, though, especially since two of the long entries were already locked in. Not thrilled with the resulting crosswordese, though I do really like BEER MONEY, EYE CANDY, LOSE SLEEP OVER, ETHICAL DILEMMAS and especially I CAN TAKE A HINT. All in all, I appreciate that Will let me bring some variety to the Friday themeless slot, and I’m pleased with how this puzzle turned out, given the constraints. Hope you enjoy! JOEL FAGLIANO: All right, 12-Down, CABLE TELEVISION … His clue is “Netflix ancestor,” which we have crossed out. I mean, that’s not even really true. WILL SHORTZ: That makes it sound like it’s not around anymore. Also, it’s a little odd to spell out “cable television” in this sense. Normally, you’d just say “cable TV” or “cable.” SHORTZ: “1970s media innovation”? That kind of gives it an old-timey feel. Think ’70s is right? FAGLIANO: I don’t know. I was trying to think of some cable channel names that are misleading. SHORTZ: [laughing] Of course. FAGLIANO: “Bravo,” or whatever. I couldn’t think of any good ones. O.K., let me look yours up. When did you first get cable? SHORTZ: Late ’80s. I got it for one year, and … then I shut it off. Because I found I would go to bed at midnight and think, O.K., let me watch 15, 20 minutes of something before I go to sleep. Then at 3 in the morning when I was turning the TV off … [Both laugh] FAGLIANO: Well, it’s sort of unclear. Because it says it first became available in 1948, but I don’t think most people had it until much later. SHORTZ: So “innovation” wouldn’t be the right word. I thought CNN started in ’79 or ’81, so that’s why I said 1970s. FAGLIANO: CNN started in 1980. SHORTZ: And that wasn’t the first in cable TV. [Silence as both think for a while] SHORTZ: “Subject of the Springsteen lyric ‘500 channels and nothing on’.” Do you know what I’m talking about? FAGLIANO: Yeah, somehow I do. What’s that song? SHORTZ: Hmm, I can’t remember. “Broadcaster’s competition”? FAGLIANO: Right. “History is part of it” [laughs]. That’s just mean. SHORTZ: Honestly, they call it the History Channel. FAGLIANO: True. “Expensive package”? SHORTZ: “Monthly bill”? FAGLIANO: I wonder if that’s just CABLE as opposed to CABLE TELEVISION. I don’t know. SHORTZ: I think it’s both, although that does sound quaint. FAGLIANO: “Dish alternative”? SHORTZ: Aha. But you’re getting the same channels with dish, so is that not really cable, or is it just a different way of getting it? FAGLIANO: It just comes through waves instead of through a wire. Maybe it isn’t an alternative. SHORTZ: “Contents of a dish”? “What a dish supplies”? FAGLIANO: “Higher-up channels?” SHORTZ: [laughs] O.K., we’ve got all sorts of ideas here. FAGLIANO: Yeah, they’re all bad, but we have a lot of them! SHORTZ: “Alternative to an antenna”? But that would be simply for CABLE. FAGLIANO: We had the rabbit ears for a while. That was the forerunner to us getting cable, but my parents waited until I was going to college. Unbelievable! [laughs] But it was probably for the best. SHORTZ: Yeah, I don’t think you were harmed by that. When I started watching too much TV as a kid, my mom limited me to an hour a day. Of course, that felt like a basic loss of freedom. FAGLIANO: [laughs] SHORTZ: In retrospect, I think her rule was all right. The one exception — one show I liked was “The Virginian,” which went 90 minutes. She made an exception for that. FAGLIANO: Maybe this is too vague, but we could find the stat “What 60 percent of U.S. households have.” Sort of makes you think. SHORTZ: Huh! That’s not bad. I would bet 75 percent, 80 percent. I wouldn’t even be shocked by 90 percent. [Both look for the exact number: Will reaching for the 2018 World Almanac, Joel checking for an internet source.] SHORTZ: O.K., I’ve got the figure, the exact figure, and interestingly, it’s going down! It got as high as 90 percent. It peaked at 90.6 percent. Now it’s down to 81 percent, and still falling. Wow, I’d hate to say 80 percent, because next year it might be under 80 percent, and the clue would be out of date. In 2013, the figure was 90 percent, ’14 it was 89 percent, ’15 it was 86 percent, ’16 it was 84 percent and ’17 it was 81 percent. What’s happening? FAGLIANO: People are cutting the cord. They’re just doing without cable. I mean, I don’t have cable. I just watch stuff over my computer, and then I project that onto my TV. But I also don’t watch that much TV. Anyway, can we save this? Can we put a year? Like, “What 80 percent of American households had in 2017.” SHORTZ: That’d still date the puzzle eventually. How about: “What 90% of American households had in 2010 — but fewer have today.” That’s likely to stay true. FAGLIANO: Nice! That’s an intriguing clue. SHORTZ: That’s great for a 15-letter answer. Makes you go “Hmm …” Almost finished solving but just need a bit more help? We’ve got you covered. Warning: There be spoilers ahead, but now you can take a peek at the answer key.

2018,"Hold On, the Mets Are 8-1?","WASHINGTON — The day before this new season began, Yoenis Cespedes, the Mets’ slugging outfielder, surveyed his team, its health and the new manager, Mickey Callaway. He declared this team better than the one in 2015 that reached the World Series. And after the Mets toppled their divisional rival, the Washington Nationals, 6-5, late Sunday night to cap a three-game sweep, Cespedes repeated his claim. This time he had a little more proof. “In my six years in the major leagues, this is the best team I’ve ever been on,” said Cespedes, who drove in the winning run in the 12th inning. “We’ve been showing it, and we will keep proving it.” The Mets, whose implosion in 2017 is still bitterly remembered, are now one of the winningest teams in the major leagues. Entering Monday, the Mets, the Houston Astros, and the Boston Red Sox were the only teams that had won at least 80 percent of their games this year. And with a 4-2 win Monday night against the Miami Marlins, the Mets improved to 8-1 for the first time since 2006 and matched the franchise record for best start to a season. The victory over the Nationals (5-5), winners of four of the past six National League East crowns, epitomized the Mets’ formula so far this year: timely hitting, a stout bullpen, imperfect but inspired play, and the Midas touch of Callaway. The Mets’ hot start has been accomplished with limited contributions from some of its best players, such as the pitcher Noah Syndergaard; the outfielder Michael Conforto, who returned Thursday from shoulder surgery; and Cespedes. “This team has got all the right pieces,” said Adrian Gonzalez, a first baseman new to the team who has reached the playoffs five times in his career, most of them with the Los Angeles Dodgers. The right pieces, in his mind, include capable pitching and hitting, experience and youth, and leadership from the front office to coaching staff. “I’ve played on talented teams, but talent doesn’t create a good team,” he said. “We have a good team. You can tell we’re structured well.” Callaway’s style and tactics have been welcomed by several Mets players. “He’s a young manager who understands modern baseball well,” Cespedes said recently of Callaway, who replaced Terry Collins, the oldest manager in baseball. “He communicates well and gives us a lot of confidence.” Many young managers endure growing pains in their new jobs (see: Gabe Kapler of the Philadelphia Phillies), and Callaway hasn’t been perfect. But he has pulled the right strings often with lineup decisions and pitching changes, and the team’s talent has helped. “It’s the players,” Callaway said. “They’re doing the job. It’s almost like you can throw anybody in that situation and they get the job done.” Callaway, the former pitching coach of the Cleveland Indians, has deftly run the Mets’ bullpen, usually the trickiest bit of strategy for a manager during the game, and he has gotten relief pitchers to buy into the fluid roles of modern baseball. In commending Callaway over the weekend, Mets relief pitcher Jeurys Familia, perhaps inadvertently, made comments viewed by some fans as a subtle criticism of Collins. “You can see the difference,” Familia said of Callaway. “He knows what he’s doing over there and it’s working. So far everybody is doing good in the bullpen.” Following one of the worst-pitched seasons in Mets history, the rotation has been solid (3.09 earned run average). The bullpen, on the other hand, has a 1.21 E.R.A.. Two off days and a snowed-out game have allowed Callaway to rely heavily on Familia and relief pitchers, a luxury he will not be afforded during the meat of the season. Seth Lugo, who was supposed to be the fifth starter to open the season, has been a godsend as a versatile reliever, as has Robert Gsellman, another past starter. They have combined to allow just one run over 12 innings. “We’re very proud of roles, the work we put in, and it’s been good to see it translate on the field,” Lugo said. Health will likely be the biggest determinant in the success of the Mets this season. The medical staff was overhauled in the winter, and General Manager Sandy Alderson spent nearly $89 million to improve the team by signing players such as the pitcher Jason Vargas and Gonzalez. “For me, it’s the length of our lineup that has really impressed me,” said the outfielder Jay Bruce, who re-signed with the Mets this winter. What Bruce meant is the improved depth and quality of a lineup in which, for example, Brandon Nimmo is not a regular outfielder since Conforto’s return but has the talent to start. This week will bring the Mets a long awaited but somewhat ceremonial moment. The Mets need a fifth starter on Wednesday against the Marlins while Vargas recovers from a hand injury, so they will call up Zack Wheeler, who struggled in spring training, from Class AAA Las Vegas for, at least, one start. Time and injuries have changed some of them, but Wheeler’s return to the major leagues will mean that the Mets’ big five starters — Jacob deGrom, Matt Harvey, Steven Matz, Syndergaard and Wheeler — will finally all pitch in the same rotation. After the win Sunday, Harvey said a message had been sent across all of baseball about the Mets. He applauded the attitude of Callaway, the coaches and his teammates. “It’s nice to come in here and have fun with everybody once again,” he said. “It’s been a long time since that’s happened. We’re pushing, and we’re pushing each other.” Before the season began, the Nationals were the prohibitive favorites to repeat as division winners and contend for the World Series because of talented All-Stars such as the outfielder Bryce Harper, who is perhaps the hottest hitter in baseball now; the starters Max Scherzer and Stephen Strasburg; the first baseman Ryan Zimmerman; and the second baseman Daniel Murphy, a former Met who has yet to play this season because of knee surgery. Across the division, the Phillies improved over the winter, and the Atlanta Braves have hit well to start the season. Following the weekend sweep, Callaway was more realistic about the division landscape and the Nationals than some of his enthusiastic players. “There’s a ton of season left and they have a really good team,” he said.",The New York Times
2018,"Hollywood’s Ambassador, Schooled in Diplomacy and the Muppets","LOS ANGELES — Charles H. Rivkin began his Hollywood career in 1988, when Jim Henson hired him to plot a business future for Kermit the Frog. Mr. Henson’s unexpected death two years later threw the Muppets into crisis. But Mr. Rivkin pushed the little puppet studio toward the booming cable and DVD businesses, ultimately engineering its sale for $680 million in 2000 — $1 billion in today’s dollars. A hairpin turn into politics awaited. Mr. Rivkin — polished, almost preternaturally so — became a mega-fund-raiser for the soon-to-be-president, Barack Obama, who named him ambassador to France in 2009. After a celebrated run in Paris, where he was the youngest American envoy since the Eisenhower administration, Mr. Rivkin became an assistant secretary of state. And now Mr. Rivkin, 55, finds himself trying to meld both of those lives — Hollywood insider and Washington influencer — as chairman of the musty Motion Picture Association of America, which runs the byzantine movie rating system and lobbies around the world for the six old-line Hollywood studios (20th Century Fox, Universal, Warner Bros., Disney, Sony and Paramount). He officially took over the organization on Jan. 1, replacing Christopher J. Dodd, the former longtime Democratic senator of Connecticut. Depending on your perspective — and whether or not you see opportunity in upheaval — Mr. Rivkin’s timing either is perfect or couldn’t be worse. There is little doubt about his point of view. Over dinner with a reporter at Bouchon Beverly Hills, he was in such a good mood about returning to moviedom that he broke into song as Gonzo, rasping out a couple of lines from “I’m Going to Go Back There Someday,” a song from “The Muppet Movie.” Mr. Rivkin then merrily downed an oyster, pinkie in the air, and called his new position “possibly the best job in the world.” But Hollywood has changed immensely in the time he has been away. Attendance at theaters in the United States and Canada dropped 6 percent in 2017, to a 22-year low. Yet studios are more reliant than ever on the box office. Squeezed by the rise of subscription streaming services like Netflix, the six major studios reported an 18 percent drop in home-video rental and sales revenue, including video-on-demand purchases, in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with the 2016 period. Digital TV Research, a British media consultancy, estimated in October that piracy would cost the global movie and television business $37.4 billion in lost revenue this year, an 18 percent increase from 2017. Losses in 2022 were projected to reach $51.6 billion. To cope with these challenges and others, Hollywood is consolidating. Disney will soon absorb Fox. AT&T is fighting the Justice Department in court for the right to acquire Time Warner, which owns Warner Bros. As Amazon, Netflix and even Apple pour resources into original content, more consolidation is expected. Mergers could lead to budget cuts for the nonprofit Motion Picture Association. Under the current setup, the six member studios chip in more than $16 million apiece annually to fund the association’s global operations, according to tax filings. The organization, which endured a 20 percent budget cut in 2009 as the studios dealt with the Great Recession, also faces challenges in Washington. Its influence has diminished over the past decade: Silicon Valley stars reign supreme now. “I do not think we have punched our weight in terms of influence — the power that we should have, given the jobs we support,” said Jeff Shell, chairman of the Universal Filmed Entertainment Group, which includes Universal Pictures, DreamWorks Animation and Focus Features. Mr. Shell added that the M.P.A.A. is “a big, complicated organization and needs an executive to go in and rethink every part as a business — what should be invested in and grown, what should be scaled back.” And Mr. Rivkin, who hails from a storied Democratic family (his godfather, Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey, wrote a note on a napkin to excuse him from school so that he could attend the party’s 1968 national convention), inherits the M.P.A.A. during a culture war. Hollywood personalities — Meryl Streep, Jimmy Kimmel, Kathy Griffin, among others — have attacked President Trump, who has been happy to return fire. Many studio executives, while publicly silent, privately worry that Mr. Trump’s position on trade, in particular his aggressive stance toward China, will hurt their profitability. China is fast eclipsing North America as the world’s No. 1 movie market, and studios have been trying to persuade the Chinese government to relax restrictions on film imports. The Office of the United States Trade Representative is leading those negotiations, but Mr. Rivkin also plays a role. As the association’s chief, he is effectively Hollywood’s global ambassador and its chief Washington crusader. (He does not, however, plan to register as a lobbyist; for that role, Mr. Rivkin hired Gail MacKinnon, a former Time Warner executive who started her career working for Republican lawmakers.) Mr. Rivkin acknowledged that the organization faces challenges big and small, including questions about its identity and its structure. Netflix plans to release 80 original movies this year but is not a member. Should it be? But he spoke about solutions with a confidence that felt genuine, calling the association “a dust-covered diamond that can easily shine again.” He then began an impassioned recitation of industry data. Did you know, for instance, that more Americans go to the movies than attend professional football, basketball, baseball and hockey games combined? Mr. Rivkin also spoke excitedly about plans, some already in motion, to increase the trade organization’s profile, including improved branding, more star-studded events in Washington and livelier social media feeds. “Reinvigorated at every level,” he said of the association. At the same time, Mr. Rivkin aggressively disputed the notion that Mr. Trump and Hollywood are on opposite sides. “President Trump probably knows this industry better than any president since Reagan,” he said. “I think he understands that entertainment is important both as an economic force — jobs in every single state — and as a projection of American values. It’s our soft power. It’s showing the world what America is capable of.” The film and television industries support 2.1 million jobs in the United States, contribute $134 billion to the economy and account for $16.5 billion in exports, according to Motion Picture Association data. Hollywood has struggled to cast the right person as its cheerleader in chief since 2004, when Jack Valenti retired after 38 years. Mr. Valenti, who worked in the White House for Lyndon B. Johnson, was larger than life. He picked fights, lionized the studio chiefs and fended off lawmakers’ efforts to limit sex and violence on screen by devising the self-regulating film ratings system. Mr. Valenti was followed by an entertainment outsider, Dan Glickman, secretary of agriculture during the Clinton administration. Mr. Glickman, affable but low key, scored victories, including securing $400 million in government production incentives. But Hollywood never accepted him as one of its own. He left in 2010. Mr. Dodd took over the next year. While making inroads on piracy, he also struggled at times to persuade the six studios to speak with one clear voice on crucial industry matters, including the 2014 cyberattack on Sony Pictures. Michael Lynton, then Sony’s chief, was so furious over the organization’s lack of public support during the early days of that crisis that he almost canceled Sony’s membership. Herding studio chiefs is harder than it used to be. In Mr. Valenti’s era, the film factories were stand-alone entities whose interests were in lock step. Today, the studios are owned by sprawling conglomerates, which employ their own lobbyists and often have competing interests. Mr. Rivkin, who has been married to the businesswoman Susan Tolson for 28 years (they have two children), has deep political relationships, some of which involve family. His father, William R. Rivkin, who was close to the Kennedys, served as ambassador to Luxembourg, Senegal and Gambia. His brother, Robert, is Chicago’s deputy mayor. Mr. Rivkin worked at the State Department under John Kerry, a close friend. At the same time, unlike his two most recent predecessors, Mr. Rivkin knows Hollywood. At the Henson Company, he forged agreements with partners like Sony and Disney. After the Henson Company was sold, he led another boutique studio, WildBrain, where he oversaw production of the hit Nickelodeon series “Yo Gabba Gabba!” One of Mr. Rivkin’s cousins, the Democratic fund-raiser and education advocate Jamie Alter Lynton, is married to Mr. Lynton, the former Sony chief. Despite moving in rather grand circles, Mr. Rivkin does not wear his ego on his sleeve, say people who know him well. “Charlie was always the Dudley Do-Right of the kids business,” said Brown Johnson, Nickelodeon’s former president of animation, referring to the heroic “Rocky and Bullwinkle Show” character. “So honest. So respectful. A listener.” Brian Henson, chairman of the Henson Company and Jim Henson’s son, agreed — with a twist. “I think that putting his ego aside actually is part of his ego,” he said. “Charlie wants to be the guy who makes things happen for others.”",The New York Times
2018,"Holocaust Is Fading From Memory, Survey Finds","For seven decades, “never forget” has been a rallying cry of the Holocaust remembrance movement. But a survey released Thursday, on Holocaust Remembrance Day, found that many adults lack basic knowledge of what happened — and this lack of knowledge is more pronounced among millennials, whom the survey defined as people ages 18 to 34. Thirty-one percent of Americans, and 41 percent of millennials, believe that two million or fewer Jews were killed in the Holocaust; the actual number is around six million. Forty-one percent of Americans, and 66 percent of millennials, cannot say what Auschwitz was. And 52 percent of Americans wrongly think Hitler came to power through force. “As we get farther away from the actual events, 70-plus years now, it becomes less forefront of what people are talking about or thinking about or discussing or learning,” said Matthew Bronfman, a board member of the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany, which commissioned the study. “If we wait another generation before you start trying to take remedial action, I think we’re really going to be behind the eight ball.” Despite the gaps in the respondents’ knowledge, the study found an overwhelming consensus — 93 percent — that all students should learn about the Holocaust at school. And Holocaust denial remains very rare in the United States, with 96 percent of respondents saying they believe the genocide happened. “The issue is not that people deny the Holocaust; the issue is just that it’s receding from memory,” said Greg Schneider, the executive vice president of the Claims Conference, which negotiates restitution for Holocaust victims and their heirs. “People may not know the details themselves, but they still think it’s important. That is very heartening.” The survey, conducted by Schoen Consulting from Feb. 23-27, involved 1,350 American adults interviewed by phone or online, and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points. Millennials were 31 percent of the sample, and the results for that group have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus five percentage points. The questions were developed by a committee that included officials from the Claims Conference, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and Yad Vashem, as well as a Holocaust survivor and a polling expert from George Washington University. (In a strange footnote, the head of Schoen Consulting, Doug Schoen, is in the news this week for arranging for President Trump to give a speech during a 2015 event in Ukraine.) Worldwide, the estimated number of living Holocaust survivors has fallen to 400,000, according to the Claims Conference, many of them in their 80s and 90s. And Holocaust remembrance advocates and educators, who agree that no book, film or traditional exhibition can compare to the voice of a survivor, dread the day when none are left to tell their stories. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington collects comment cards from many visitors before they leave, and they underscore that “no educational experience that anyone has coming through here has as much of an impact as hearing from a survivor directly,” said Kristine Donly, interim director of the Levine Institute for Holocaust Education at the museum, who sat on the board that developed the survey. And so, across the country and around the world, museums and memorials are looking for ways to tell the witnesses’ stories once the witnesses are gone. At the site of the Monument to Six Million Jewish Martyrs, the Philadelphia Holocaust Remembrance Foundation has been developing an interactive memorial plaza, scheduled to open in October. Visitors will use a new app that will, among other things, feature survivors’ recorded testimonies. In one part of the plaza, train tracks that carried prisoners to the Treblinka death camp will be embedded in the pavement. When visitors step onto the tracks, the app, using geocaching technology, will pull up videos of Philadelphia residents “who were on those very trains that led to Treblinka,” said Eszter Kutas, the remembrance foundation’s acting director. And at the Illinois Holocaust Museum and Education Center, near Chicago, visitors can speak with one of seven holograms of survivors — a project also tested at the Museum of Jewish Heritage in New York. Drawing on recorded testimony, the holograms can answer questions in real time. Visitors to the Illinois museum’s Take a Stand Center first watch a five-minute film in which a survivor introduces him- or herself. In one, Fritzie Fritzshall describes being taken to a ghetto at gunpoint during Passover, and from there to Auschwitz. “I have so much more to tell you,” she says. “So please ask me questions.” Then the hologram appears, “so real that our audience typically gasps when they see it,” said Susan L. Abrams, the museum’s chief executive. “It really was as effective as hearing from a live survivor, and that surprised us,” Ms. Abrams said. “When you sit in this theater and the lights dim, everything else melts away. Our visitors truly believe that they are having this conversation with a survivor. I don’t think even we realized just how powerful it would be.”",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Holocaust Survivors ‘Have Voices That Matter’,"Letter To the Editor: Re “Getting Facts Wrong on the Holocaust” (news article, April 13): More than four decades passed before I could break the silence about my traumatic experiences during the Holocaust. It is a formidable challenge for survivors to speak and for others to listen. The number of survivors is dwindling; they are getting quite old and their memories are fading. Yet it is ever more important that the signs of authoritarian regimes and how they evolved are brought into the consciousness of youths and adults, as warning signals of what must be prevented from happening again. Survivors, when able, have the responsibility to bear witness and provide evidence so that the six million Jews who were murdered are not forgotten, so that perpetrators are not pardoned for their crimes, and so that deniers don’t have a leg to stand on. While the voices of the victims have been silenced forever, we the survivors have voices that matter. After four decades of not speaking, I realized that silence was no longer an option. I told my stories to my children and grandchildren as well as to many students in many schools over a 30-year period. Schools and other organizations should take advantage of every opportunity to engage survivors to tell their stories. IRENE BUTTER, ANN ARBOR, MICH. The writer survived two concentration camps, Westerbork and Bergen-Belsen. She recently published her memoir, “Shores Beyond Shores: From Holocaust to Hope.”",The New York Times
2018,"Holstering the K-Pop, South Korea Silences Propaganda at the DMZ","SEOUL, South Korea — South Korea turned off loudspeakers blaring bouncy music and other propaganda into North Korea on Monday, silencing weapons of psychological warfare so annoying to the North that its military once fired shots across the border. The South’s Defense Ministry said it switched off all batteries of the propaganda loudspeakers along the inter-Korean border, known as the Demilitarized Zone, days before its president, Moon Jae-in, is to join the North’s leader, Kim Jong-un, there on Friday for a summit meeting. It said the decision was made to help “ease military tensions and create a peaceful mood for the meeting.” The venue — Panmunjom, a “truce village” inside the DMZ — is within the earshot of propaganda broadcasts from both sides. “We hope that our move today will result in South and North Korea ending mutual slandering and propaganda against each other and creating a peaceful new beginning,” the ministry said in a statement. The silencing of the loudspeakers was another sign of easing tensions on the divided Korean Peninsula, as Mr. Kim prepared for his meeting with Mr. Moon and for a separate one later with President Trump, which would be the first summit meeting between North Korea and the United States. Over the weekend, Mr. Kim announced an end to all nuclear and long-range missile tests and the shutting down of his country’s only known nuclear test site. South Korean officials said the North was expected to reciprocate the South’s initiative by turning off its own propaganda loudspeakers. Because of electricity shortages in the North, its loudspeakers have not been as powerful as the South’s, South Korean military officials said. For decades, loudspeakers have been a fixture along the border, beckoning soldiers to defect to the other side. In November, a North Korean soldier defected to the South in Panmunjom, fleeing through a hail of gunfire by fellow North Korean soldiers. Day and night, songs eulogizing the North’s “fatherly” leader and communist propaganda lamenting “depraved capitalist” lifestyles have drifted across the border to the South. For their part, South Korean loudspeakers denounced hunger and human rights violations in the North, highlighting the number of cars and other signs of affluence in the South. Lately, it added K-pop music to the mix. South Korea hoped that its propaganda barrage would undermine the personality cult surrounding the ruling Kim family in the North. In 2015, Mr. Kim ordered his front-line military units to go on a “semi-war state” after the two Koreas exchanged rocket and artillery fire. He ordered his front-line units to prepare to attack South Korean loudspeakers along the border unless they stopped blaring propaganda. The two Koreas decommissioned their loudspeakers after their ties improved following their first summit meeting in 2000. But they switched them on again as their relations soured. The propaganda war across their heavily armed border escalated after the North conducted its fourth nuclear test in early 2016. But anti-North Korean activists in the South vowed to continue to send propaganda balloons, which carry dollar bills, transistor radios, CDs containing Western movies and leaflets that call Mr. Kim a pig. Some of the activists complained that the police tried to stop their balloon campaign as South Korea cultivated its rapprochement with the North. In the past, the South Korean authorities have tried to discourage the balloon campaign when relations with Pyongyang have improved or the North has threatened to fire across the border to shoot down the balloons.",The New York Times
2018,Home Depot Shooting: Dallas Officer Dies From Injuries,"A Dallas police officer died on Wednesday, one day after he, another officer and a store security guard were shot at a Home Depot. The officer, Rogelio Santander, and a fellow officer, Crystal Almeida, were at the store responding to a request for assistance with an arrest. Officer Santander died from his injuries at 8:11 a.m., according to the Dallas Police Department. “Our hearts are aching because of this Dallas police officer who lost his life in the line of duty,” Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas said on Twitter. “We thank him for paying the ultimate sacrifice protecting his community and we keep his family in our prayers.” Officer Almeida and Scott Painter, the Home Depot security guard, both remain critically injured, Chief U. Renee Hall of the Dallas Police Department said at a news conference on Wednesday. “We are optimistic about what we are seeing with them right now,” she said. Mr. Santander and Ms. Almeida had both spent three years with the department. The police had arrested a man in connection with the shooting, Armando Juarez, 29, late on Tuesday night after an extensive search and a chase that led them from southeast to northwest Dallas. He will be charged with at least two counts of aggravated assault on a public servant and two previous felony theft warrants, the department said early Wednesday. More charges may come, it said. “I want to thank our Dallas police tonight,’’ Mayor Mike Rawlings said after the arrest on Tuesday. “They have taken a punch and they have come out fighting.” At about 4:12 p.m. on Tuesday, the Police Department received a call to go to the Home Depot on Forest Central Drive in northeastern Dallas to help an off-duty officer who was there make an arrest, Chief Hall said on Tuesday. The shooting occurred shortly after they arrived. In 2016, five Dallas police officers were shot and killed at a rally against police violence by Micah Johnson, a 25-year-old Army reservist who later died in a standoff with the police. Mr. Johnson, an African-American, was hoping to single out white officers in the ambush. Last week, in Trenton, Fla., two sheriff’s deputies were shot dead by a gunman who ambushed them as they ate at a Chinese restaurant.",The New York Times
2018,Homeless Children Are 3 Times as Likely to Be Suspended at Some Schools,"Homeless students miss an average of 20 school days a year, making them less likely than other children to be on grade level and more likely to drop out of school. They are also more likely to be suspended, according to a new report from the Institute for Children, Poverty and Homelessness, causing them to miss an average nine additional days of instruction. In all, that’s almost six weeks of class time lost. More than 111,500 New York City students were homeless at some point last year, whether they were staying in a shelter, in a hotel or with family or friends. The report focuses on 102 middle schools that had high rates of suspensions during the 2015-6 school year, which it calls suspension hubs. It found that homeless students at those schools were even more likely than their classmates to be suspended, and when they were, the punishments were more severe, including for similar infractions. At suspension hubs, 14 percent of homeless students were suspended that year, compared with 9 percent of their classmates who lived in more stable circumstances. At Frederick Douglass Academy II in Manhattan, which includes a middle school and a high school, 36 percent of homeless students were suspended during the 2015-6 school year, compared with 22 percent of students with stable housing. The study found that students staying in shelters and black children were more likely to be suspended. At the 102 schools, 22 percent of homeless black boys were suspended. During the 2015-6 school year, the citywide suspension rate for middle schools was 4 percent. For homeless middle school students citywide, it was 7 percent. “This report is another indicator of what’s happening with homeless children,” said Ralph da Costa Nunez, chief executive of the Institute for Children. “These kids are dropping out at much higher rates than regular students. They’re being suspended. They’re repeating grades. It’s almost becoming a death sentence for their future.” The upheaval of homelessness means those children are often anxious and traumatized, and that their parents are as well. Many of them travel long distances from where they sleep to school in the morning, leaving them exhausted before the day begins. Drained and frightened, they bring all of that with them to school. The de Blasio administration has made it a priority in recent years to reduce suspensions in city schools, pushing schools to use what are called restorative techniques that encourage people in conflict to talk through their differences. During the 2014-5 school year, Mayor Bill de Blasio’s first full school year in office, suspension rates fell 17 percent. That trend abruptly reversed itself recently, though. The education department notified the City Council in March that suspensions jumped 21 percent during the last six months of 2017. The department said that in response to that bump, it gave additional training to certain schools, in areas like de-escalation, and the rise slowed considerably. “We are committed to meeting the unique needs of students in temporary housing, which is why we have invested in more social workers in schools and trainings for staff in de-escalation and therapeutic crisis intervention,” Miranda Barbot, an education department spokeswoman, said in a statement. “We remain laser-focused on addressing the root causes of conflict and behavioral concerns for students in temporary housing.” According to the education department, Frederick Douglass II has had an additional full-time social worker since last year, and the parent coordinator has attended training on how to better support homeless families. The school has had a mental health clinic on site since the 2015-6 school year. The department said that during the 2016-7 school year, homeless students accounted for 13 percent of all suspensions, relatively flat when compared to the previous school year. “If the new chancellor really wants to make a difference, to make a real mark, this is one place to start,” Dr. Nunez said of the city’s new schools leader, Richard A. Carranza, who started the job last week. “One hundred and ten thousand kids is no joke.”",The New York Times
2018,Homeless People Outside New York City Are Pushing for More Help,"Virginia Katchmar sleeps in a storage unit in Rochester near Lake Ontario. Four hundred miles away, Sheila Cummings has been living in a homeless shelter in Hempstead, Long Island, since she was evicted early last year from her apartment. Both women say they would be better off in New York City, where there are more legal protections and services to help people return to permanent housing than in their hometowns. Though they do not know each other, Ms. Katchmar and Ms. Cummings have joined a growing coalition of homeless people, tenants and their advocates that is pushing the state legislature to expand to all of New York State the tenant laws and other protections available only in the city and a few other counties. With rent regulations set to expire in June 2019, the coalition, the Upstate/Downstate Alliance, is hoping to bring attention to their cause. “This is a moment right now when the state legislature and the governor have to be thinking about tenant protections and tenant protections as a tool,” said Celia Weaver, research and policy director of New York Communities for Change, which is part of the coalition. “It’s a tool to combat homelessness.” The majority of homeless people in the state live in New York City, and they have more rights to challenge landlords and more access to assistance than people living elsewhere in the state, advocates say. New York City has poured millions of dollars into rental assistance and legal assistance in housing court to help tenants who are facing eviction. In addition, a state law specific to New York City prevents people from being cut off public assistance for failing to make required appointments to work, attend drug treatment or visit social workers, a punishment known as “sanctions.” Yet low-income residents in other towns are also coping with gentrification, escalating rents and stagnant wages similar to New York City, and many of those areas have seen a steep rise in homelessness in the last decade. Ms. Cummings’s story is typical. After her husband died in October 2015, her income could not keep up with her rent of $1,525 on their longtime apartment in Freeport, Long Island. At 58, she earns $21,000 as a school bus monitor. “No one is being accountable — they raise your rent more than your salary,” she said. “Everything just spiraled out of control, and I ended up getting evicted.” Between 2007 and 2017, homelessness in New York State rose by 43 percent, the largest increase among states in the country, according to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Last year, about 89,500 people were living in shelters or on the street in the state. In a report released on Wednesday, the Upstate/Downstate Alliance predicted that the number of people living in shelters around the state could reach 100,000 by 2020 unless more regulations to safeguard tenants from high rents and evictions are put in place. Formed in October, the alliance wants lawmakers to expand rent regulations to all counties, and also wants more rental assistance programs and affordable housing. So far, the group’s proposals have gotten little traction in Albany, where the real-estate lobby is formidable and Republicans who control the State Senate have been resistant. “There are multitudes of real estate organizations and real estate lobbyists that have an overwhelming, vast amount of money that want to make sure tenant protections never make it to the floor,” Assemblyman Luis R. Sepúlveda, a Democrat from the Bronx, said. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat running for re-election, has signaled he is open “to discussing ways to further strengthen rent laws,” but he has stopped short of endorsing the coalition’s specific objectives, said Richard Azzopardi, a spokesman for the governor. Many Republican lawmakers oppose rent regulation on principle, arguing it reduces affordable housing. “When you look at a place like the City of New York where you have rent stabilization, you do not have the incentive to build low-income and moderate-income housing because of the stabilization,” said Assemblyman Michael Fitzpatrick, a Republican from Smithtown. The state’s rent regulations have their roots in the 1940s when lawmakers sought to prevent price gouging during a housing shortage. Still, only 51 out of 994 cities and towns in New York have rent control, which restricts the rights of landlords to raise rents and to evict tenants. Rent stabilization, which is the most-used regulation, provides tenants with the right to renew leases and local rent guidelines boards set maximum rates of rent increases. Only three counties outside New York City have rent stabilization programs: Nassau, Rockland and Westchester. Another important driver of homelessness outside New York City is a state law requiring agencies to cut off welfare benefits to people who fail to show up to work, drug treatment programs and appointments with social workers, advocates say. These sanctions can cut a person off from government-funded help for as long as six months. In 2015, the same year rent regulations were extended another four years, the social services law was amended to protect welfare recipients from being denied benefits for missing appointments. But the final bill was written so it only applied to New York City. “This is a clear injustice that person after person is going through,” said Ryan Acuff, a founder of Take Back the Land Rochester, a tenant advocacy group. “People are not being accused of a crime; they are being accused of missing an appointment.” Mr. Acuff said many of the homeless people he works with at St. Joseph’s Catholic House of Hospitality in Rochester have lost welfare benefits temporarily. Patrick Braswell, 51, a migrant worker who stays at St. Joseph’s, said he became homeless last year after he was fired from a job because he was accused of moving personal property with a work vehicle. He had other financial problems and ended up to losing his $930-a-month apartment. Mr. Braswell, who had been gathering signatures to support reforming the “sanctions” process, said he missed a meeting with a worker at the Department of Social Services and was denied his public-assistance check. “For 30 days, you’re not going to get any help from the Department of Social Services,” he said. “You have to start the period all over again. I asked the guy the other day. ‘Have you ever been late to work? Have you ever been late to an appointment?’” Ms. Katchmar, 34, who said she had been in and out of homelessness for a decade, grew so tired of being denied benefits under the sanctions law that she gave up on traditional housing last year. First, she lived in her car and now lives in her storage unit. She uses a shower at St. Joseph’s, a friend’s house or sometimes, a local laundromat. “I make it through,” said Ms. Katchmar, who is disabled. “It’s really cold, but I have enough blankets to keep me warm.” Assemblywoman Pamela Hunter, a Democrat from Syracuse, introduced an unsuccessful bill last year that would have eased sanctions for all public assistance recipients throughout the state. “Last year, the opposing side thought there were enough mechanisms available,” Ms. Hunter said. “I say to them, do another homeless head count.”",The New York Times
2018,"Homeless in Seattle, and Marrying Under the Overpass","Vows Three days before their wedding ceremony, Michelle Vestal’s dress and Bob J Kitcheon’s suit were stolen. Most couples would have panicked, but they took it in stride. “Things get taken all the time out here,” Mr. Kitcheon said with a shrug. He and Ms. Vestal live in a tent by the side of a parking lot in the south of Seattle, a few minutes’ drive from downtown. Mark Lloyd, a local resident and volunteer, and now friend to the couple, stepped in. He gave Mr. Kitcheon a shirt and drove them both to a Goodwill store. As is the way in their relationship, the couple helped each other choose new clothes. Ms. Vestal, 50, and Mr. Kitcheon, 61, met six years ago under the King Street station clock in Seattle. This past February, back under the same clock tower, Mr. Kitcheon proposed. When they first met, he was up from Phoenix, where he then lived, for Seattle’s annual Hempfest. Ms. Vestal told Mr. Kitcheon she had some marijuana to sell him and he gave her $10. She said that at the time she was addicted to crack cocaine; she stole his money. But that didn’t put off Mr. Kitcheon. A month later, after asking her to hang out, they spent a few hours together at a laundromat. “The thing I remember most was his smell,” Ms. Vestal said. “It still makes me feel wooshy now.” Ms. Vestal, who was born in Barrow, Alaska, was adopted at birth. Her biological father “was not cool with me” and her mother “was a dope fiend.” Her adoptive parents, who she refers to as Mom and Dad, lived in a remote part of Alaska with no roads. Her mother was the president of a newspaper, her father president of an oil company. “I was raised by a good family,” she said. “I had a nanny, but I wasn’t spoiled. My mom and dad never yelled at me, they never spanked me, but I had a rough life.” She said she was sexually abused by her grandfather, who is now deceased. She has two younger sisters and speaks to her family regularly. Her older and only brother died from a drug overdose 17 years ago. Ms. Vestal, who had dreams of being a veterinarian, was introduced to “life outside” her sheltered upbringing when she was 18. “I went buck wild and told my parents, ‘You can’t tell me what to do no more.’” It was at this point that she met a man who introduced her to crack cocaine. A 30-year addiction to the drug began. In 1985, Ms. Vestal moved to Seattle, where she has lived, and been mainly homeless, since. She has been married five times previously and has eight grown children: one in Seattle; the others, including two sets of twins, are in Anchorage. “They are all being taken care of,” she said. Aware of the judgments that might be made about some of her life choices, she added, “This doesn’t make me a bad person, because I’m not.” Mr. Kitcheon (who said he has never used hard drugs; “I just smoke weed and drink beer”) was married once before. His first wife died 25 years ago. After her death, he couldn’t bear to stay in the home where they had raised their 10 children. He put up a tent in the backyard, and much to the confusion of his children, slept outdoors. Mr. Kitcheon said he still owns the five-bedroom Phoenix property where his daughters now live. “I’m really not homeless,” said Mr. Kitcheon, a Los Angeles native. “I could leave this city any time. I just don’t worry about anything.” He misses his “babies” but has led a transient life for years. “I tell my kids all the time, ‘Pops got to go,’” he said. “But I raised them well.” He said he has four sons: two in the Army, one in the Marines, one in the Navy; and six daughters, all nurses. The morning of their wedding marked 84 days clean from crack cocaine for Ms. Vestal. It’s the first time that she has tried to stop using the drug. “I would never have done it if it wasn’t for him,” she said, referring to Mr. Kitcheon. “It was really hard, and it’s really hard right now, but knowing that I’m loved and that I’ve got somebody with me, has made it possible.” Mr. Kitcheon said, “I asked her, ‘Do you want that dope or do you want me?’” He promised that if she was willing to try to quit, he’d help her through it. “I believed in her and she believed in me.” Ms. Vestal now has an apprenticeship at the nonprofit Native Works, where she is paid $14 an hour to make jewelry. The company is affiliated with the Chief Seattle Club, where Ms. Vestal also helps other homeless Native Americans. Ms. Vestal says she was raised by her father to always help others. “This woman would take the jacket that she’s wearing and give it to anyone,” Mr. Kitcheon said. “My mother was the same way. She used to feed the street people before she fed us.” The practical challenges of living on the street bring the couple closer. “He does everything for me,” she said. “He makes sure I eat, that I’ve got clothes on my back. He paints my toenails.” They’re often giggling and whispering. ”Whatever she wants, I’ll do it,” Mr. Kitcheon said. But with the difficulties of drug abuse, the relationship has had challenges. Mr. Kitcheon has a construction job, working eight hours a day. “I used to lie to him and every time he got a paycheck, I’d steal from him,” Ms. Vestal said. Mr. Kitcheon, however, said he knew he could always make more money and in spite of addiction, their love persevered. Last Thanksgiving, Ms. Vestal and Mr. Kitcheon visited her family in Alaska. He said the family house “is huge, with helicopter pads in the backyard,” and added that he impressed her parents when he made a jerk goose for dinner. When asked what had spurred his proposal this past February, he said, “Because I can trust her.” A five-minute walk from where the couple live, a group of around 20 local residents, including Mr. Lloyd, hold a Sunday lunch for homeless people called the Rainier Pop-Up Kitchen. “When they told us they wanted to get married, the whole group got giddy about them doing it here,” Mr. Lloyd said. “We’ve been having email and Facebook threads to plan the day.” Every week for the last year, volunteers bring dishes to serve on a sidewalk beside a busy road under an Interstate 90 bridge, where around 100 diners eat at folding tables and chairs. Ms. Vestal and Mr. Kitcheon are regulars. “Michelle’s a lot of fun because she’ll always tell you what she thinks,” Mr. Lloyd said. “And Bob’s a cool guy. We’re the same age and we like to talk about the ’60s.” On Sunday, March 18, after everyone had eaten, the couple were married by Vicki Butler, another local volunteer and an associate dean at the City University of Seattle, who was ordained by the Universal Life Church. (It was while meeting at her house to plan the wedding that the couple’s clothes were stolen.) Because of health concerns for Ms. Vestal’s mother, her family was not able to travel to the wedding, but the bride, using Ms. Butler’s phone, called one of her sisters to tell her about her wedding day. Volunteers and diners had erected and decorated a gazebo frame with blue and white paper garlands and strings of battery-powered lights. Mr. Lloyd bought new white tablecloths. Other volunteers provided tea lights, boutonnieres and flowers, and sparkling cider to toast the couple. Ms. Vestal’s flower girl, Adelaide, 2, is a regular at the weekly lunches. She and her parents, Leslie and Austin Dekle, and their infant daughter, live in a tent. The family, originally from Georgia, has been on the road since July 2015. Just before the ceremony, the groom asked the bride if she had cold feet — quickly followed with, “I’ve got some hand warmers you could put in your boots if you do.” Ms. Butler’s husband, Larry Butler, who works as a Santa Claus for a Seattle mall, gave away the bride. Everyone knew him from his appearance at the Christmas meal. Adelaide, held by her mother, followed them to a small podium in the gazebo. Sue Alexander, a volunteer, made the wedding cake and also stood in for the maid of honor, who was injured by a camping fire the night before. (Because fires are a frequent hazard in homeless camps, Mr. Lloyd buys and hands out fire extinguishers to those in the community.) The vows were a simple declaration made through teary eyes of, “I will always love you forever.” Passing cars honked as a unity candle was lit, and Ms. Butler announced the couple as husband and wife. Guests blew bubbles as “Always and Forever” by Heatwave played over portable speakers and Mr. and Mrs. Kitcheon held each other tight and danced. Greg Jacobs, the best man and a Los Angeles native who is also homeless, shared wisdom from his own experience: “When you’re homeless and you’re in a relationship, it gets real, real serious. It’s unbearable sometimes. She might be hungry and you’re not. She needs coffee but it’s dark outside. You don’t know where the next meal is coming from. But if you can go through that with an individual, that’s love.” After the ceremony, the couple walked along the busy road back to their tent, carrying leftover food and flowers and a gift of a boombox from the Butlers. “It’s hard for me to be happy,” Ms. Vestal said, “but with this man, I am.”",The New York Times
